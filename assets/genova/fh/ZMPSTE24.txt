# ZMPSTE24

## Overview
ZMPSTE24 is a gene that encodes the zinc metallopeptidase STE24, a crucial enzyme involved in the post-translational processing of prelamin A into mature lamin A, a key structural component of the nuclear envelope. This enzyme is categorized as a zinc metalloprotease and is characterized by its unique tripartite architecture, which includes a ZMP core, ZMP accessory, and α-barrel modules. The α-barrel module, composed of seven transmembrane α-helices, forms a large intramembranous cavity that houses the active site necessary for its enzymatic function (Goblirsch2020Ste24:; Goblirsch2019The). ZMPSTE24 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and inner nuclear membranes, where it facilitates the cleavage of prelamin A, preventing the accumulation of its farnesylated form, which is associated with various progeroid disorders (Nie2020A; Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24). Mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene can lead to severe genetic disorders, such as Restrictive Dermopathy and Mandibuloacral Dysplasia type B, underscoring its essential role in maintaining nuclear integrity and cellular function (Navarro2013New; Moulson2005Homozygous).

## Structure
ZMPSTE24 is a zinc metalloprotease characterized by a unique tripartite architecture, consisting of a ZMP core, ZMP accessory, and α-barrel modules. The α-barrel module is composed of seven transmembrane α-helices that form a large intramembranous cavity, approximately 12,000 to 14,000 Å³ in volume, which houses the active site and substrate-binding region (Goblirsch2020Ste24:; Goblirsch2019The). The catalytic site is defined by the HExxH motif, where two conserved histidines and a glutamate coordinate the zinc ion essential for enzymatic activity (Goblirsch2020Ste24:; Goblirsch2019The).

The protein's structure includes splayed transmembrane helices that create entrance and exit portals for substrates, with the active site located at the membrane interface (Goblirsch2020Ste24:). The ZMP core module is primarily cytoplasmic and contains the conserved gluzincin HExxH…E motif, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Goblirsch2020Ste24:). The ZMP accessory module plays structural roles and interacts with the ZMP core, while the α-barrel module provides a heptahelical, membrane-spanning structure (Goblirsch2020Ste24:).

ZMPSTE24 also features a large T-shaped opening formed by lateral pivoting of transmembrane segments, facilitating substrate entry and egress (Clark2016Human). The protein's electrostatic potential is strongly negative, which may influence its function (Goblirsch2020Ste24:).

## Function
ZMPSTE24 is a zinc metalloprotease that plays a critical role in the post-translational processing of prelamin A into mature lamin A, a structural component of the nuclear envelope. In healthy human cells, ZMPSTE24 is responsible for cleaving prelamin A, specifically removing the last 15 amino acids of the C-terminal tail after CAAX processing, which includes farnesylation, proteolysis, and carboxylmethylation (Barrowman2012Requirements; Coffinier2007HIV). This cleavage is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear lamina, which is involved in heterochromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle control (Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24).

ZMPSTE24 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and the inner nuclear membrane, allowing it to process prelamin A within the nucleus (Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24). The enzyme's activity prevents the accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A, which is associated with progeroid disorders such as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (Nie2020A; Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24). Proper function of ZMPSTE24 is crucial for cellular health, as its dysfunction can lead to nuclear morphology defects and various cellular dysfunctions, including disrupted transcription factor activity and altered epigenetic regulation (Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene are linked to several severe genetic disorders, primarily characterized by defects in the processing of prelamin A, leading to the accumulation of its toxic, unprocessed form. Restrictive Dermopathy (RD) is a lethal autosomal recessive condition caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ZMPSTE24, resulting in tight skin, joint contractures, and often death in the perinatal period (Navarro2013New; Moulson2005Homozygous). These mutations lead to a complete loss of ZMPSTE24 function, causing severe nuclear abnormalities (Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24).

Mandibuloacral Dysplasia type B (MAD-B) is another disorder associated with ZMPSTE24 mutations, characterized by skeletal abnormalities and lipodystrophy. It is typically caused by compound heterozygous mutations that result in partial loss of enzyme function (Navarro2013New; Yaou2011Type). The severity of these conditions correlates with the residual activity of ZMPSTE24 and the level of unprocessed prelamin A (Barrowman2009ZMPSTE24).

ZMPSTE24 mutations are also implicated in progeroid syndromes, such as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), where they exacerbate the effects of LMNA mutations, leading to premature aging symptoms (Denecke2006A). These findings highlight the critical role of ZMPSTE24 in maintaining nuclear integrity and cellular function.

## Interactions
ZMPSTE24, a zinc metalloprotease, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with prelamin A, facilitating its cleavage to mature lamin A, which is essential for nuclear envelope stability (Goblirsch2019The; Coffinier2007HIV). ZMPSTE24 also interacts with the inducible transmembrane protein family IFITM, particularly IFITM3, which may assist in chaperoning ZMPSTE24 to its viral fusion targets, highlighting its role in antiviral responses (Tipper2023Spf1).

The protein is part of a quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it shares approximately 40% of its interactants with Atp13A1, suggesting a significant overlap in substrate recognition (Tipper2023Spf1). ZMPSTE24's interactions are not limited to its proteolytic activity; it also plays a nonenzymatic role as a viral restriction factor, acting as a downstream effector in the presence of IFITMs, which reduce the infectivity of various viruses (Goblirsch2019The).

HIV protease inhibitors have been shown to inhibit ZMPSTE24, leading to the accumulation of prelamin A, which suggests a competitive interaction with these drugs (Clark2016Human; Coffinier2007HIV). This interaction is significant as it links the inhibition of ZMPSTE24 to side effects observed in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (Clark2016Human).
