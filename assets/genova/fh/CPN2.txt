# CPN2

## Overview
The CPN2 gene encodes the regulatory subunit of the carboxypeptidase N (CPN) enzyme complex, a plasma zinc metalloprotease involved in the modulation of inflammatory responses and maintenance of homeostasis. The protein product, carboxypeptidase N subunit 2, is crucial for stabilizing the enzymatically active subunits of the CPN complex, thereby preventing their rapid clearance from the bloodstream and protecting them from degradation. This regulatory subunit is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, which plays a significant role in protein-protein interactions within the enzyme complex. CPN2 is heavily glycosylated, a modification essential for its stability and function. The CPN complex, including CPN2, is involved in the inactivation of various peptides, such as complement anaphylatoxins and kinins, by cleaving carboxy-terminal arginines and lysines, thus altering peptide activity and receptor binding (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase; Talens2012Binding).

## Structure
The CPN2 gene encodes a polypeptide that is 545 amino acids long, with a molecular mass of approximately 58,762 Da for the protein alone, and 83 kDa when glycosylated (swanson2010revisiting). The primary structure of CPN2 includes a 52-residue cysteine-rich amino terminal region, a 312-residue leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, and a 145-residue cysteine-rich carboxy-terminal region (swanson2010revisiting). The LRR region is significant, as it contains 12 leucine-rich repeats, each 24 amino acids in length, and constitutes 54% of the protein (swanson2010revisiting).

The secondary structure of CPN2 is characterized by the LRRs, which typically form a horseshoe-like structure with a curved β-sheet on the inner surface and α-helices and β-turns on the outer surface (swanson2010revisiting). The tertiary structure involves hydrophobic interactions in the amino three-quarters of the protein, with the carboxy-terminal region being more hydrophilic and flexible (swanson2010revisiting).

In terms of quaternary structure, CPN2 forms part of the carboxypeptidase N enzyme complex, traditionally viewed as a heterotetramer, but recent studies suggest a trimeric structure with two regulatory subunits and one catalytic subunit (swanson2010revisiting). CPN2 is heavily glycosylated, with seven potential asparaginyl-linked glycosylation sites, five of which are within the LRR region (swanson2010revisiting). This glycosylation, particularly involving sialic acid residues, is crucial for protecting the enzyme from clearance by liver lectins (swanson2010revisiting).

## Function
The CPN2 gene encodes the regulatory subunit of the carboxypeptidase N (CPN) enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining homeostasis in the human body. CPN is a plasma zinc metalloprotease that cleaves carboxy-terminal arginines and lysines from peptides in the bloodstream, thereby regulating the activity of peptide hormones and growth factors (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase; Talens2012Binding). 

CPN2 specifically functions to stabilize the small, enzymatically active subunits of the CPN complex, preventing their rapid removal from the bloodstream through glomerular filtration and protecting them from degradation or enzymatic inactivation at body temperature (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase). The CPN complex, including CPN2, is involved in inactivating various peptides such as complement anaphylatoxins and kinins by removing a single amino acid, which can alter peptide activity and receptor binding (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase). 

CPN2 is also implicated in the regulation of fibrinolysis, as it binds to fibrinogen and fibrin, potentially acting as a long-term antifibrinolytic enzyme when thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) loses its activity (Talens2012Binding).

## Clinical Significance
The CPN2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CPN2 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with poor overall survival, particularly in early stages of the disease, suggesting that CPN2 could serve as a prognostic marker for LUAD. High CPN2 expression correlates with tumor stage, node status, and malignancy, indicating its role in tumor progression (Xu2022Carboxypeptidase).

In myasthenia gravis (MG), increased levels of CPN2 are associated with a decreased risk of the disease. This suggests a protective role for CPN2 in MG, potentially due to its involvement in complement activation pathways, which are known to be dysregulated in MG (Li2024Integrative).

In Sézary syndrome, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, CPN2 is involved in genetic rearrangements leading to novel fusion transcripts. These rearrangements result in ectopic expression of CPN2, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease (Iżykowska2017Genetic).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase N subunit 2 (CPN2) is a component of the carboxypeptidase N (CPN) enzyme complex, which is a tetramer composed of two catalytic subunits (CPN1) and two regulatory subunits (CPN2). The CPN2 subunits play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalytic subunits, ensuring the structural integrity of the enzyme complex (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase). The interaction between CPN1 and CPN2 subunits is characterized by a strong association, with the leucine-rich repeat region of CPN2 speculated to bind to the hydrophobic CPN1 subunit. Charged residues from the leucine-rich repeat regions of CPN2 may also participate in these interactions (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase).

The tetrameric structure of CPN is maintained through interactions between the heterodimers, which are mediated by the leucine zipper region in CPN2. The amino and carboxy-terminal ends of CPN2 are likely involved in tetramer formation, with the amino-terminus of one CPN2 binding to the basic residues on the carboxy-terminus of another CPN2 (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase). These interactions contribute to the stability of the CPN tetramer in the bloodstream, allowing it to perform its function in cleaving carboxy-terminal arginine and lysine residues from peptides (Matthews2004Carboxypeptidase).
