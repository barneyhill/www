# SPATA16

## Overview
The SPATA16 gene encodes the spermatogenesis-associated protein 16, which is integral to the process of spermatogenesis, particularly in the formation of the acrosome, a critical structure for fertilization. This protein is characterized by a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for its function in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. SPATA16 is predominantly expressed in the human testis and localizes to the Golgi apparatus and proacrosomal vesicles, playing a pivotal role in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis (Kyrgiafini2023Genetic; Dam2007Homozygous). Mutations in SPATA16, particularly those affecting the TPR domain, have been linked to male infertility conditions such as globozoospermia, characterized by round-headed spermatozoa lacking an acrosome (Fujihara2017Human; Dam2007Homozygous). The evolutionary conservation of the TPR domain underscores its critical role in normal sperm development and male fertility (Dam2007Homozygous).

## Structure
The SPATA16 gene encodes a protein that is highly conserved across mammals, consisting of 569 amino acids and featuring a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Chang2023Molecular; Dam2007Homozygous). The TPR domain is a common structural motif involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes, and in SPATA16, it is essential for its function in spermatogenesis (Dam2007Homozygous). The TPR domain is highly conserved, with a 92% identity in mice and 98% in chimpanzees, indicating its evolutionary importance (Dam2007Homozygous).

The SPATA16 protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus and proacrosomal vesicles, playing a significant role in acrosome formation during spermiogenesis (Fujihara2017Human; Kyrgiafini2023Genetic). Mutations in SPATA16, particularly in the TPR domain, can disrupt its function, leading to conditions such as globozoospermia, characterized by round-headed sperm lacking an acrosome (Chang2023Molecular; Dam2007Homozygous). The protein's structure and function are critical for normal sperm development, and disruptions can result in male infertility (Fujihara2017Human). The SPATA16 gene is composed of 11 exons, and mutations affecting exon 4 can lead to aberrant splicing and protein dysfunction (Dam2007Homozygous).

## Function
The SPATA16 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the formation of the acrosome, an essential structure for fertilization. The protein is specifically expressed in the human testis and is localized in the Golgi apparatus and proacrosomal vesicles, which merge during spermiogenesis to form the acrosome (Kyrgiafini2023Genetic; Dam2007Homozygous). The SPATA16 protein contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a protein-protein interaction module that acts as an organizing center for complexes regulating various biological processes (ElInati2016A). This domain is highly conserved across mammals, indicating its essential role in sperm development (Roozbahani2017Association).

Mutations in SPATA16, such as the homozygous mutation c.848G→A, can disrupt the splicing site of exon 4, leading to aberrant splicing and the production of non-functional proteins. This disruption is associated with globozoospermia, a condition characterized by round-headed spermatozoa lacking an acrosome, resulting in male infertility (ElInati2016A; Dam2007Homozygous). The gene's role in acrosome formation underscores its importance in normal sperm morphology and male fertility (Fujihara2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPATA16 gene are associated with globozoospermia, a rare form of male infertility characterized by round-headed spermatozoa lacking an acrosome. This condition results in impaired fertilization capabilities due to the sperm's inability to penetrate the oocyte. A specific homozygous mutation, c.848G>A, leading to an amino acid substitution (p.R283Q) in the TPR domain of SPATA16, has been identified in affected individuals. This mutation disrupts normal splicing, causing aberrant splicing forms and exon skipping, which are linked to globozoospermia in a consanguineous family (Dam2007Homozygous).

In addition to globozoospermia, SPATA16 variants have been implicated in teratozoospermia, a condition involving abnormal sperm morphology. Studies have identified untranslated region (UTR) variants in SPATA16 that may affect miRNA binding sites, potentially impacting gene expression and contributing to the pathogenesis of teratozoospermia (Kyrgiafini2023Genetic).

Research using mouse models has shown that deletions in the Spata16 gene can lead to spermiogenic arrest and infertility, highlighting the gene's essential role in sperm formation and its potential link to infertility conditions (Fujihara2017Human).

## Interactions
SPATA16 is known to participate in protein-protein interactions facilitated by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is a common feature in proteins involved in multiprotein complexes. This domain is crucial for mediating interactions with other proteins, which are essential for its role in spermatogenesis (Fujihara2017Human; Dam2007Homozygous). 

The protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus and proacrosomal vesicles, indicating its involvement in acrosome formation during spermiogenesis (Dam2007Homozygous). In mouse models, SPATA16 and PICK1 are both localized to the Golgi apparatus in round spermatids, suggesting a potential interaction or co-localization that may be important for acrosome biogenesis (Fujihara2017Human). 

A GST pull-down assay identified 35 potential partners of SPATA16, highlighting its extensive interaction network, although specific partners were not detailed in the context provided (ElInati2016A). The study of these interactions is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SPATA16's role in male fertility and its involvement in conditions such as globozoospermia (ElInati2016A).
