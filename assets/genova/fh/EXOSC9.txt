# EXOSC9

## Overview
EXOSC9 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 9, a crucial part of the RNA exosome complex involved in RNA processing and degradation. The protein is categorized as a structural component of the exosome, contributing to the formation of a barrel-like hexameric structure that facilitates RNA substrate processing. Although EXOSC9 contains an RNase PH-like domain, it is catalytically inactive, serving primarily as a scaffold within the exosome complex (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). The protein's role extends to various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Müller2020RNA; Quttina2023Exosc9). Mutations in EXOSC9 are linked to neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Bizzari2020Expanded).

## Structure
EXOSC9 is a component of the RNA exosome complex, which is crucial for RNA processing and degradation. The protein is part of the core structure of the exosome, forming a ring-like assembly with other subunits. This core is composed of six subunits, including EXOSC9, which together create a barrel-like hexameric structure that serves as a scaffold for RNA substrates (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). The EXOSC9 protein contains an RNase PH-like domain, which is structurally similar to those found in other exosome components, although it is catalytically inactive due to specific amino acid substitutions (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

The human exosome complex, including EXOSC9, has been structurally characterized using X-ray crystallography, revealing a complex architecture with a central channel through which RNA substrates are threaded (Liu2006Reconstitution). EXOSC9 interacts with other subunits such as hRrp41 and hRrp46, forming heterodimers that contribute to the stability of the exosome complex (Liu2006Reconstitution). The protein also features an S1 RNA-binding domain, which is essential for its function in RNA binding and processing (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of EXOSC9, although specific modifications have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
EXOSC9 is a core component of the RNA exosome complex, which is essential for RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, EXOSC9 is involved in the degradation of various RNA species, including precursor RNAs and un-spliced pre-messenger RNAs in the nucleus, as well as mRNAs with AU-rich elements in the cytoplasm (Müller2020RNA). It plays a critical role in maintaining cellular functions by preventing aberrant RNA processing and accumulation of non-physiological transcript levels (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

EXOSC9 is also crucial for ribosome biogenesis, a process essential for protein synthesis, and its down-regulation can lead to p53 protein stabilization and G2/M cell cycle arrest (Müller2020RNA). In the context of telomere maintenance, EXOSC9 is recruited to telomeres to facilitate the degradation of TERRA, a long noncoding RNA, which is vital for maintaining telomeric integrity and genomic stability (Quttina2023Exosc9). This activity is cell cycle-dependent and involves interactions with chromatin-binding proteins, such as HP1α, modulated by SUMO post-translational modifications (Quttina2023Exosc9). Through these processes, EXOSC9 contributes to the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOSC9 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1D (PCH1D). This condition is characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, axonal motor neuropathy, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory insufficiency. The homozygous missense mutation p.(Leu14Pro) in EXOSC9 has been linked to both severe and milder phenotypes of PCH1D, with symptoms such as cerebellar atrophy, psychomotor delay, and lactic acidosis (Slavotinek2020Biallelic; Bizzari2020Expanded). 

EXOSC9 mutations also impact ribosome biogenesis and p53 levels, contributing to neuromuscular defects and increased apoptosis in brain cells, as observed in zebrafish models and human patients (Müller2020RNA). These mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including early-onset weakness, respiratory impairment, and motor neuronopathy similar to spinal muscular atrophy (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

In cancer biology, EXOSC9 plays a role in stress resistance and tumorigenicity. Depletion of EXOSC9 in cancer cells reduces stress resistance and P-body formation, which are crucial for cellular stress responses. High EXOSC9 activity is associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yoshino2020EXOSC9).

## Interactions
EXOSC9 is a core component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. It interacts with other exosome components such as EXOSC8, EXOSC2, and EXOSC3, forming a stable multiprotein complex essential for maintaining the integrity and function of the exosome. The interactions between these subunits are crucial for the complex's role in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation, particularly during erythropoiesis. Downregulation of EXOSC9 disrupts these protein-protein interactions, leading to changes in erythroid maturation (McIver2016Exosome).

In cancer cells, EXOSC9 plays a significant role in stress resistance and P-body formation. It interacts with RNA substrates, including APOBEC3G mRNA, promoting its decay and thereby influencing stress response mechanisms. The RNA-binding motif of EXOSC9 is essential for these interactions, as mutations in this motif impair its ability to mediate stress resistance and P-body formation (Yoshino2020EXOSC9).

EXOSC9 also interacts with R-loops, RNA/DNA hybrid structures, in the context of DNA damage repair. This interaction is significant for maintaining genome stability and involves colocalization with senataxin, a helicase involved in R-loop resolution (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).
