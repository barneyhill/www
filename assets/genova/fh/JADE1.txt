# JADE1

## Overview
JADE1 is a gene that encodes the protein jade family PHD finger 1, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its two Plant Homeodomain (PHD) zinc fingers, which are essential for its function in histone acetylation and chromatin binding. JADE1 is a component of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) HBO1 complex, where it facilitates the acetylation of histone H4, thereby promoting gene expression by enhancing chromatin accessibility. The protein exists in two isoforms, JADE1L and JADE1S, which differ in their subcellular localization and stability. JADE1 is also involved in cell cycle regulation and the Wnt signaling pathway, acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for β-catenin, thus playing a role in tumor suppression. Its interactions with proteins such as the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) further underscore its significance in cellular processes and disease contexts, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Foy2008Role; Panchenko2016Structure; Chitalia2008Jade1).

## Structure
The JADE1 protein, encoded by the PHF17 gene, is characterized by its two Plant Homeodomain (PHD) zinc fingers, which are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. These PHD fingers include a canonical PHD1 and a non-canonical extended PHD2, both of which are zinc-binding motifs involved in protein-protein interactions and chromatin binding (Siriwardana2015The; Panchenko2016Structure). The PHD fingers are essential for the protein's function in promoting histone H4 acetylation, particularly through interactions with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) like TIP60 and HBO1 (Foy2008Role; Panchenko2016Structure).

JADE1 exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing: the full-length JADE1L and the truncated JADE1S. JADE1L contains 842 amino acids, while JADE1S lacks a large C-terminal fragment, resulting in a protein of 509 amino acids (Siriwardana2015The; Tzouanacou2003Identification). These isoforms differ in their subcellular localization and stability, influenced by the presence of PEST sequences and nuclear localization signals (Foy2008Role; Tzouanacou2003Identification).

Post-translational modifications of JADE1 include phosphorylation, which regulates its function and localization during the cell cycle, particularly in cytokinesis (Siriwardana2015The). The interaction of JADE1 with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) suggests a role in ubiquitination and tumor suppression (Panchenko2016Structure).

## Function
The JADE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. JADE1 is part of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) HBO1 complex, where it synergizes with HBO1 to acetylate histone H4. This acetylation is essential for chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, as it facilitates the accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA (Foy2008Role). The PHD zinc fingers of JADE1 are critical for its function, as they provide specificity for nucleosomal histone substrates and are necessary for the acetylation activity (Foy2008Role).

JADE1 is also involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly in DNA synthesis and cytokinesis. It is required for the acetylation of bulk histone H4, which is linked to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Depletion of JADE1 results in slower DNA synthesis rates and decreased levels of chromatin-bound HBO1, indicating its role in the HBO1-mediated pathway (Panchenko2016Structure). Additionally, JADE1 has a role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by ubiquitinating β-catenin, thereby inhibiting its accumulation and activity, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis (Chitalia2008Jade1).

## Clinical Significance
JADE1 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating cellular processes. In tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary age-related tauopathy (PART), JADE1 is upregulated in neurons with neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting its involvement in tau protein aggregation and clearance. JADE1 interacts with the 0N4R tau isoform, which is associated with neurofibrillary tangles, and may play a neuroprotective role by modulating tau-induced neurotoxicity (Farrell2021Genomewide).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), JADE1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is regulated by microRNA-155-5p, which targets JADE1, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Lower JADE1 expression is linked to poorer survival outcomes in ccRCC patients. JADE1's tumor suppressor function is partly due to its interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which stabilizes JADE1. In the absence of VHL, JADE1 degradation increases, contributing to ccRCC progression (Kalantzakos2023MicroRNA1555p).

JADE1 is also involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for β-catenin, inhibiting its pro-proliferative effects. This function is significant in renal cancer and cystic diseases, where dysregulation of β-catenin can lead to tumor formation (Chitalia2008Jade1).

## Interactions
JADE1 is involved in several significant protein interactions, particularly in the context of histone acetylation and ubiquitination. It interacts with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, notably HBO1 and TIP60, to enhance histone H4 acetylation. This interaction is crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, with JADE1 acting as a co-factor that synergizes with HBO1 to promote acetylation (Foy2008Role). The PHD zinc fingers and the N-and C-terminal domains of JADE1 are essential for its interaction with HBO1, although the PHD fingers are not necessary for the physical binding itself (Foy2008Role).

JADE1 also interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), which stabilizes JADE1 and influences its role in apoptosis and tumor suppression. This interaction is linked to the regulation of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. JADE1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling (Chitalia2008Jade1; Panchenko2016Structure). These interactions highlight JADE1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including transcription regulation and tumor suppression.
