# H2AC11

## Overview
H2AC11 is a gene that encodes the protein H2A clustered histone 11, a variant of the histone H2A family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, playing a critical role in the organization and regulation of DNA within the nucleus. The H2A clustered histone 11 protein is involved in the structural configuration of chromatin, influencing gene expression and DNA repair processes. As a core histone, it is integral to the formation of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin. Variations in the expression of H2AC11 have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and viral infections, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zheng2023Identification; Zhang2020Gene; HerreraCampos2022Implications).

## Clinical Significance
H2AC11, a variant of the histone H2A, has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its role in chromatin structure and gene expression. In the context of kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and COVID-19, the expression of H2AC11 has been associated with decreased probability of ICU admittance, suggesting a protective role in these conditions. The molecular docking analysis indicated a docking affinity score of -7.9 kcal/mol for H2AC11, highlighting its potential involvement in therapeutic strategies using berberine (Zheng2023Identification).

In pancreatic cancer, H2AC11, also known as H2AC22, is part of the core histones involved in the progression from acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM) to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although its specific clinical significance in pancreatic cancer is not directly addressed, histone-related genes like H2AC11 may have implications in cancer development and progression, potentially serving as biomarkers or therapeutic targets (Zhang2020Gene).

In the context of hyperoxia, H2AC11 was upregulated in metastatic uveal melanoma cells, indicating its role in transcription regulation under these conditions. However, the clinical significance of H2AC11 in this context requires further research (HerreraCampos2022Implications).
