# MAN2B2

## Overview
The MAN2B2 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 2B member 2, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of N-glycans. This enzyme is categorized as a core-specific α1,6-mannosidase, which specifically targets α1,6-linked mannose residues in glycoproteins. The activity of the MAN2B2-encoded enzyme is essential for the final steps of lysosomal glycoprotein degradation, facilitating the conversion of glycoproteins into amino acids and monosaccharides, which are then recycled for glycan synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Verheijen2020Defining; Suzuki2016Catabolism). Mutations in the MAN2B2 gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, which can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including neurological and immune system abnormalities (Verheijen2020Defining; Tian2022Compound). The enzyme's function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of glycans, underscoring its importance in protein quality control and cellular metabolism (Verheijen2020Defining).

## Function
The MAN2B2 gene encodes a core-specific α1,6-mannosidase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the lysosomal degradation of N-glycans. This enzyme specifically targets the core α1,6-linked mannose residues, complementing the activity of MAN2B1, which hydrolyzes α1,2-, α1,3-, and α1,6-linked mannose residues. The activity of MAN2B2 is dependent on the prior action of other enzymes, such as AGA and CTBS, which prepare the substrate for MAN2B2 by yielding Manα1-3(Manα1-6)Manβ1-4GlcNAc (Suzuki2016Catabolism).

In healthy human cells, MAN2B2 is involved in the final steps of lysosomal glycoprotein degradation, converting glycoproteins into amino acids and monosaccharides. These products are then recycled or salvaged for glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Verheijen2020Defining). The enzyme's function is essential for preventing the accumulation of glycans and ensuring the proper functioning of the N-glycosylation pathway (Tian2022Compound). MAN2B2's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control, contributing to the recycling of monosaccharides for glycan synthesis (Verheijen2020Defining).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAN2B2 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a group of inherited metabolic diseases characterized by multi-organ dysfunction. These disorders can present with a variety of clinical features, including neurologic deficits, dysmorphism, immune disorders, and hematologic abnormalities (Tian2022Compound). MAN2B2-CDG is a rare form of CDG, with only a few cases reported. One case involved a Chinese child with compound heterozygous variants in the MAN2B2 gene, presenting with severe developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features, cleft palate, and hypospadias, but notably without immune deficiency (Tian2022Compound).

Another study identified a novel immune deficiency syndrome associated with a homozygous variant (p.Asp38Asn) in the MAN2B2 gene. This variant leads to impaired enzymatic activity, resulting in abnormal glycosylation and lysosomal involvement. The clinical presentation includes immune deficiency, immune dysregulation, failure to thrive, strabismus, and neurodevelopmental disability (Verheijen2020Defining). The patient's condition improved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating potential therapeutic approaches for MAN2B2-related disorders (Verheijen2020Defining). These findings highlight the role of MAN2B2 in glycoprotein catabolism and its potential impact on immune function (Verheijen2020Defining).
