# AGMAT

## Overview
The AGMAT gene encodes the enzyme agmatinase, which is a member of the arginase or ureohydrolase superfamily. Agmatinase is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of agmatine to produce putrescine and urea, playing a significant role in polyamine biosynthesis, which is crucial for cellular growth and differentiation (Mistry2002Cloning; Molderings2012Agmatine). Although traditionally associated with agmatine hydrolysis, recent research suggests that agmatinase may also act on other guanidino acids, indicating a broader substrate specificity (Sinn2022Guanidino). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain, and its activity is modulated by Mn2+ ions, which are essential for its catalytic function (Sinn2022Guanidino). AGMAT's expression and activity have been linked to several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and mood disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2019Agmatinase; Bernstein2012Agmatinase).

## Structure
The human enzyme AGMAT, also known as agmatinase, is part of the arginase or ureohydrolase superfamily. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of guanidino acids rather than agmatine, as previously thought. AGMAT shares a significant sequence similarity with guanidinobutyrase (GbuA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with 60.2% identical amino acids, and forms hexamers with a shared active site between subunits (Sinn2022Guanidino). The active site residues coordinating Mn2+ ions and essential catalytic residues are conserved between AGMAT and GbuA (Sinn2022Guanidino).

The enzyme's structure includes two naturally occurring variants, R105 and G105, which differ in substrate specificity. The R105 variant shows higher activity for taurocyamine due to its ability to interact with the substrate's sulfonic group (Sinn2022Guanidino). Structural modeling using the Robetta server and the GbuA crystal structure as a template has provided insights into the enzyme's configuration (Sinn2022Guanidino).

AGMAT's activity is dependent on Mn2+ ions, which are coordinated by conserved Asp and His residues, positioning a hydroxide ion for nucleophilic attack at the guanidine moiety (Sinn2022Guanidino). The enzyme's expression is noted in the kidney, liver, and brain, and its levels have been linked to various health conditions (Sinn2022Guanidino).

## Function
AGMAT, also known as agmatinase, is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of agmatine to putrescine and urea, playing a crucial role in polyamine biosynthesis. Polyamines, such as putrescine, are essential for cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. AGMAT is part of the arginase superfamily and is active in the mitochondria, where it influences various cellular processes, including gene expression, ion channel regulation, and stress response (Mistry2002Cloning; Molderings2012Agmatine).

In healthy human cells, AGMAT is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney, with lower levels in the brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues. Its activity is tissue-specific, suggesting distinct physiological roles in different organs. In the liver, AGMAT may regulate circulating agmatine levels, while in the kidney, it could modulate agmatine's effects on glomerular filtration rates. In the brain, AGMAT is involved in modulating agmatine's role as a signaling molecule, potentially affecting neurotransmission and neuroprotection (Mistry2002Cloning; Molderings2012Agmatine).

Recent studies suggest that AGMAT may not primarily hydrolyze agmatine in humans but rather other guanidino acids, indicating a broader substrate specificity than previously thought (Sinn2022Guanidino).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AGMAT gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), AGMAT is significantly overexpressed, correlating with advanced clinicopathological features and poorer prognosis. This overexpression promotes malignant phenotypes by activating the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, specifically through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to the up-regulation of cyclin D1 via the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Zhu2019Agmatinase).

In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), miR-151a-5p targets AGMAT, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction suggests that the miR-151a-5p/AGMAT axis plays a crucial role in CRC progression, highlighting AGMAT as a potential therapeutic target (Xie2023miR‑151a‑5p).

In liver cancer, AGMAT is downregulated, which is associated with elevated arginine levels that promote tumor growth. This downregulation is an early event in liver tumorigenesis and correlates with poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (Mossmann2022Elevated).

AGMAT expression is also linked to mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, where it is upregulated in hippocampal interneurons, potentially affecting mood regulation (Bernstein2012Agmatinase).
