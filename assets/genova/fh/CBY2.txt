# CBY2

## Overview
The CBY2 gene encodes the protein chibby family member 2, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly ciliogenesis and intracellular protein trafficking. As a component of the cilia-associated protein network, CBY2 interacts with Nek1, a kinase crucial for the formation of primary cilia, structures essential for cellular signaling and environmental sensing. The protein is notably expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries, suggesting a role in vascular health and pathophysiology. Variants of the CBY2 gene, such as p.Pro83Thr, have been associated with altered protein aggregation and are linked to conditions like intracranial aneurysms, indicating a potential genetic predisposition to such vascular diseases (Maegawa2022Wholeexome).

## Function
The CBY2 gene, also known as Chibby family member 2, is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the context of ciliogenesis and intracellular protein trafficking. CBY2 has been identified as an interacting partner of Nek1, a kinase involved in the formation of primary cilia, which are essential for chemo- and mechanosensing in various cell types, including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (Maegawa2022Wholeexome). The dysfunction of primary cilia is linked to vascular diseases, highlighting the importance of CBY2 in maintaining vascular health (Maegawa2022Wholeexome).

CBY2 is expressed in the medial smooth muscle layer of cerebral arteries, specifically in human brain vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role in vascular pathophysiology (Maegawa2022Wholeexome). A variant of CBY2, p.Pro83Thr, has been shown to alter protein aggregation, which may impact its function in cellular processes (Maegawa2022Wholeexome). While the precise molecular activities of CBY2 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its involvement in ciliogenesis and potential impact on vascular health are significant areas of interest (Maegawa2022Wholeexome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CBY2 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms (IA). A study identified a missense variant, c.247C>A (p.Pro83Thr), in the CBY2 gene that is associated with increased aggregation propensity of the gene product in the cytoplasm. This variant was significantly associated with IA in case-control samples, suggesting a potential role for CBY2 in genetic predisposition to IA (Maegawa2022Wholeexome). The CBY2 gene is involved in ciliogenesis, interacting with Nek1, a kinase important for primary cilia formation. Dysfunction in these cilia is linked to vascular diseases like IA, indicating that CBY2 may contribute to IA pathogenesis through its role in the cilia-associated protein network (Maegawa2022Wholeexome).

The study also identified three rare CBY2 variants (p.R46H, p.P83T, and p.L183R) in additional IA probands, showing significant enrichment compared to controls. This further supports the potential involvement of CBY2 in IA (Maegawa2022Wholeexome). Although the exact clinical significance of CBY2 in vascular pathophysiology requires further investigation, these findings highlight its potential role in cerebrovascular conditions (Maegawa2022Wholeexome).
