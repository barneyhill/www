# PECAM1

## Overview
PECAM1, or platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as CD31. This protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, particularly within the vascular system. CD31 is predominantly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and platelets, where it facilitates critical processes such as leukocyte transmigration, angiogenesis, and the maintenance of vascular integrity. The protein's structure includes an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail that undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional properties. CD31 is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell survival, migration, and immune responses, making it integral to both physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation, wound healing, and cancer progression (Newman2003Signal; Privratsky2011Relative; Kirschbaum1994Organization).

## Structure
PECAM-1, also known as CD31, is a cell adhesion molecule with a complex molecular structure. The protein is composed of 738 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal peptide, a 574-amino acid extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a 118-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (Kirschbaum1994Organization). The extracellular domain contains six immunoglobulin (Ig) homology units, which are encoded by separate exons, suggesting an evolutionary origin through gene duplication and exon shuffling (Kirschbaum1994Organization). 

The cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 is encoded by seven short exons and is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may regulate phosphorylation, cytoskeletal association, and affinity modulation (Kirschbaum1994Organization). These isoforms can alter the protein's adhesive properties, as constructs lacking parts of the cytoplasmic tail exhibit changes in binding specificity (Kirschbaum1994Organization). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation on serine-threonine and tyrosine residues, play a role in regulating PECAM-1's cell surface distribution and its association with the cytoskeleton (Sheibani1999Tissue). The presence or absence of specific exons, such as exon 14, influences PECAM-1's adhesive interactions, with exon 14 being crucial for heterophilic, calcium-dependent, heparin-sensitive aggregation (Yan1995Alternative).

## Function
PECAM1, also known as CD31, is a critical adhesion molecule involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining vascular integrity by facilitating homophilic interactions at endothelial cell junctions, which are essential for barrier function and leukocyte transmigration (Privratsky2011Relative). PECAM1 is also involved in signal transduction, acting as both an agonist and adhesion receptor. It modulates integrin function, influencing cell adhesion and migration, particularly in vascular cells (Newman1997The).

PECAM1's cytoplasmic domain is crucial for its signaling functions, interacting with molecules like SHP-2 to regulate pathways that affect cell survival and integrin activation (Newman2003Signal). It also plays a role in angiogenesis by modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, impacting endothelial cell migration and capillary morphogenesis (Park2010PECAM1). PECAM1's expression is vital for endothelial cell homeostasis, influencing the expression of proteins like VE-cadherin, which are important for maintaining endothelial junctions and vascular integrity (Park2010PECAM1). Overall, PECAM1 is integral to processes such as inflammation, wound healing, and cardiovascular development (DeLisser1994Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PECAM1 expression or function are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of vascular integrity, PECAM1 is crucial for maintaining endothelial cell junctions. Deficiency in PECAM1 leads to increased vascular permeability and susceptibility to conditions like septic shock, as observed in PECAM1-deficient mice, which exhibit prolonged bleeding times and delayed recovery of vascular barriers under stress (Privratsky2011Relative). 

In cancer, PECAM1 plays a role in tumor progression and metastasis. It modulates the tumor microenvironment by regulating TIMP-1 expression, which is crucial for tumor cell proliferation. PECAM1-null mice show decreased TIMP-1 expression in metastatic tumors, highlighting its significance in tumor progression (Abraham2018Involvement). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high PECAM1 expression is associated with improved survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic factor (Cao2021Prognostic).

In leukemia, PECAM1 is involved in BCR/ABL signaling and may contribute to imatinib resistance in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia cells. Its phosphorylation is enhanced by imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL mutants, potentially inhibiting apoptosis and contributing to drug resistance (WU2012PECAM1). These findings underscore PECAM1's role in various pathological conditions, particularly those involving vascular and immune system disruptions.

## Interactions
PECAM1, also known as CD31, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which binds to PECAM1 when its cytoplasmic domain is tyrosine-phosphorylated. This interaction is essential for signal transduction and involves the SH2 domains of SHP-2 binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on PECAM1 (Newman2003Signal). PECAM1 also associates with integrins, modulating their function and influencing processes such as cell migration and leukocyte extravasation (Newman1997The; Newman2003Signal).

PECAM1 forms complexes with the TGF-b receptor complex in T cells, where it enhances the inhibitory effects of TGF-b signaling. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of PECAM1 and the recruitment of SHP-2, which antagonizes TCR signaling (Newman2016The). In endothelial cells, PECAM1 interacts with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), influencing its localization and activity. This interaction is crucial for the mechanotransductive response to fluid shear stress and nitric oxide production (Dusserre2004PECAM1).

PECAM1 also interacts with β- and γ-catenin, and its phosphorylation is affected by GSK-3β, which plays a role in antiapoptotic signaling and vascular development (Hyun2017As). These interactions highlight PECAM1's role in regulating cell adhesion, signaling, and vascular integrity.
