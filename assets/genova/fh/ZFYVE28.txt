# ZFYVE28

## Overview
ZFYVE28 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger FYVE-type containing 28, which is characterized by the presence of a FYVE domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in endosomal trafficking and signal transduction, as it facilitates binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and localizes the protein to endosomes. The protein is involved in the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes, a process essential for the degradation of phosphorylated insulin receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors, thereby playing a significant role in regulating insulin signaling and cellular growth processes (Yu2023ZFYVE28). ZFYVE28's function is particularly relevant in the context of insulin resistance and metabolic disorders, where its expression levels are altered, impacting insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism (Yu2023ZFYVE28). The protein's interactions and regulatory roles in various tissues, including the nervous system, underscore its importance in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction (Wang2023Multiphase).

## Structure
ZFYVE28 encodes a protein that contains a FYVE domain, which is a cysteine-enriched small Zn(2+) binding domain consisting of approximately 60-70 amino acids. The FYVE domain is characterized by its ability to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and is crucial for the protein's localization to endosomes. Structurally, the FYVE domain includes two β-hairpins and a small carboxyl terminal α-helix, forming a positively charged pocket that interacts with PI3P. This interaction is highly dependent on Zn(2+) ions, which facilitate the domain's insertion into the lipid bilayer, thereby aiding in endosomal localization and protein sorting (Yu2023ZFYVE28).

The FYVE domain's role is essential for the function of ZFYVE28, as deletion of this domain disrupts the protein's colocalization with early endosomes and its ability to promote the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes. This conversion is critical for the degradation of phosphorylated insulin receptors, linking the protein to insulin resistance mechanisms (Yu2023ZFYVE28). The protein is also involved in regulating endosomal localization of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR (Yu2023ZFYVE28). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variants, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ZFYVE28 gene encodes a protein that contains a FYVE domain, which is crucial for its role in endosomal trafficking and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, ZFYVE28 is involved in the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes, a process essential for the degradation of phosphorylated insulin receptors (INSR) and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) (Yu2023ZFYVE28). The FYVE domain allows ZFYVE28 to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), facilitating its localization to endosomes and promoting receptor degradation (Yu2023ZFYVE28).

ZFYVE28 plays a significant role in regulating insulin signaling by promoting the degradation of phosphorylated INSR, which is linked to insulin resistance. This function is mediated through increased production of late endosomes, directing receptors towards lysosomal degradation (Yu2023ZFYVE28). In the context of EGFR signaling, ZFYVE28 modulates receptor localization and degradation, impacting cellular processes such as growth and differentiation (Zambrano2018FYVE; Yu2023ZFYVE28).

In podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney, ZFYVE28 is enriched and associated with EGFR signaling, although it is not critical for the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier (Zambrano2018FYVE).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFYVE28 gene have been implicated in insulin resistance, a condition often associated with obesity and metabolic disorders. In individuals with insulin resistance, ZFYVE28 expression is elevated, which promotes the degradation of phosphorylated insulin receptors by facilitating the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes, leading to lysosomal degradation. This process impairs insulin sensitivity and contributes to increased lipid accumulation in the liver and serum (Yu2023ZFYVE28).

In mouse models, liver-specific overexpression of ZFYVE28 results in impaired insulin sensitivity and worsened metabolic indicators, such as increased liver weight and elevated serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Conversely, knockout of ZFYVE28 in mice improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for managing insulin resistance and related conditions (Yu2023ZFYVE28).

The regulation of ZFYVE28 by insulin and the NOTCH signaling pathway is crucial, as impaired insulin signaling in insulin-resistant conditions leads to increased ZFYVE28 expression. This dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of ZFYVE28 in these conditions (Yu2023ZFYVE28).

## Interactions
ZFYVE28 interacts with various proteins and plays a role in cellular processes through its FYVE domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). This interaction localizes ZFYVE28 to endosomes, where it facilitates the degradation of phosphorylated insulin receptors (INSR) by promoting the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes, ultimately leading to lysosomal degradation (Yu2023ZFYVE28). ZFYVE28 also acts as a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, similar to its role in INSR degradation, by promoting receptor degradation in endosomes (Zambrano2018FYVE; Yu2023ZFYVE28).

In the nervous system, ZFYVE28 shows tissue-specific expression and interacts with several other genes, including CHD9, PRNP, PSMB7, SUPT7L, USP46, ACOT11, and TTC17, particularly in the caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, and basal ganglion (Wang2023Multiphase). These interactions suggest a significant role for ZFYVE28 in these regions, although the specific functional outcomes of these interactions are not fully elucidated. The interactions of ZFYVE28 with these proteins may involve both stable complexes and more transient regulatory interactions, contributing to its role in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction.
