# ANKRD23

## Overview
ANKRD23 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 23, which is a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and are integral to the protein's function as a transcriptional regulator. Ankyrin repeat domain 23 is predominantly expressed in the myocardium, skeletal muscles, and brown adipose tissue, where it plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and muscle function. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of myoblast differentiation and glucose homeostasis, and is implicated in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Its expression is modulated in response to muscle stress and energy demands, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders (Shimoda2015DiabetesRelated; Chagula2020Ankyrins; Wang2017The).

## Structure
ANKRD23, also known as diabetes-associated ankyrin repeat protein (DARP), is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common protein-protein interaction domains. These motifs typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Chagula2020Ankyrins; Bang2014The). The protein contains four tandem ankyrin repeats in its central region, which are crucial for its role as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus (Chagula2020Ankyrins). 

ANKRD23 is part of the muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP) family, which includes other proteins like CARP (Ankrd1) and Ankrd2. These proteins share about 50% sequence identity and are involved in stress response and energy metabolism (Bang2014The; Wang2017The). The protein is expressed in myocardium, skeletal muscles, and brown adipose tissue, and is upregulated in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance (Chagula2020Ankyrins; Bang2014The). 

While specific details on the primary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ANKRD23 are not provided, the protein's involvement in cellular signaling and structural integrity is facilitated by its ankyrin repeat domains (Chagula2020Ankyrins).

## Function
ANKRD23, also known as ankyrin repeat domain 23, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. This protein is a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARP) family, which plays a significant role in the integration of cytoskeletal architecture, stress response, and transcriptional regulation in skeletal and cardiac muscles (Wang2017The). ANKRD23 is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue, indicating its involvement in energy metabolism and muscle function (Wang2017The).

In skeletal muscle, ANKRD23 negatively regulates myoblast differentiation, a crucial process in muscle development. During myoblast differentiation, ANKRD23 mRNA levels increase significantly in the later stages, while protein levels decrease, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation (Wang2017The). The protein is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is up-regulated after muscle eccentric contractions, enhancing the expression of MyoD and muscle LIM protein (MLP) genes, which are important for muscle integrity (Wang2017The).

ANKRD23 also plays a role in glucose homeostasis by modulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in skeletal muscle. It negatively regulates glucose uptake, and its absence leads to increased AMPK phosphorylation, enhancing glucose uptake and oxidation in muscle cells (Shimoda2015DiabetesRelated). This suggests that ANKRD23 is involved in energy metabolism and could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes treatment (Shimoda2015DiabetesRelated).

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD23 gene, which encodes the diabetes-associated ankyrin repeat protein (DARP), has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression levels. In the context of type 2 diabetes, ANKRD23 is notably over-expressed. This over-expression is associated with the condition's characteristic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, suggesting that ANKRD23 could serve as a potential biomarker for diabetes (Chagula2020Ankyrins). The protein encoded by ANKRD23 is involved in stress stretch signals, linking myofibrillar stretch-induced signaling pathways to muscle gene expression, which may play a role in muscle stress pathways and energy metabolism during recovery from prolonged hunger (Chagula2020Ankyrins).

While the specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in ANKRD23 are not detailed in the available literature, its involvement in these pathways indicates a significant role in muscle and metabolic disorders. The broader family of muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), which includes ANKRD23, is known to be up-regulated in response to muscle contraction and injury, suggesting a role in muscle strengthening and injury response (Chagula2020Ankyrins). However, the exact cellular mechanisms and potential pathologies associated with ANKRD23 mutations remain to be fully elucidated.
