# ITPRIPL1

## Overview
The ITPRIPL1 gene encodes the protein ITPRIP-like 1, which plays a crucial role in immune regulation by acting as a novel immune checkpoint. This protein is involved in modulating T cell activation through its interaction with the CD3ε component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, delivering inhibitory signals that are essential for maintaining immune tolerance and homeostasis (Deng2022The). ITPRIP-like 1 is also implicated in calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for various cellular processes, including T cell activation (Deng2022The). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy, particularly in tumors resistant to conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (Deng2022The). Additionally, aberrant methylation patterns of ITPRIPL1 have been identified as potential biomarkers for early-stage breast cancer detection (Wang2021Automatic).

## Function
The ITPRIPL1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a novel immune checkpoint, playing a significant role in the regulation of T cell activation. It interacts with the CD3ε component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, delivering an 'off' signal that counterbalances the 'on' signal from peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligation to the TCR. This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance, particularly to self-antigens with high immunogenicity (Deng2022The).

In healthy human cells, ITPRIPL1 is involved in modulating T cell activity and maintaining immune homeostasis. It impairs T cell cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by experiments showing that overexpression of ITPRIPL1 in target cells reduces T cell-induced apoptosis, while knockout of ITPRIPL1 increases it. This suggests a negative correlation between ITPRIPL1 expression and T cell cytotoxicity (Deng2022The).

The protein is also associated with calcium signaling pathways, which are critical for various cellular processes. ITPRIPL1's interaction with CD3ε may influence calcium signaling pathways essential for T cell activation (Deng2022The). This regulatory role in immune responses highlights its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Deng2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The ITPRIPL1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer and immune regulation. In the realm of oncology, ITPRIPL1 is associated with immune evasion mechanisms in cancer. It functions as a novel immune checkpoint by interacting with CD3ε, impairing T cell activation. This interaction is particularly significant in tumors that are resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy, suggesting that ITPRIPL1 may serve as an alternative immune checkpoint in such cases (Deng2022The). Targeting the ITPRIPL1-CD3ε axis has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy, especially for patients who do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (Deng2022The).

In breast cancer, ITPRIPL1 is noted for its aberrant methylation patterns. Hypermethylation of ITPRIPL1 is observed in a significant proportion of early-stage breast cancer patients, making it a potential biomarker for early detection. This methylation is associated with HER2 positivity and is specific to breast cancer, as it is not commonly found in other cancer types (Wang2021Automatic). The methylation status of ITPRIPL1, along with other genes, is used to improve the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection, offering a noninvasive diagnostic tool (Wang2021Automatic).

## Interactions
ITPRIPL1 interacts with the CD3ε protein, a component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, forming a novel immune checkpoint axis known as the ITPRIPL1-CD3ε axis. This interaction is characterized by a concentration-dependent binding, with a sigmoid binding curve and an EC50 of approximately 0.2553 μg/ml. The binding kinetics indicate a relatively weak interaction with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.17e-07 M (Deng2022The). ITPRIPL1 acts as a ligand for CD3ε, delivering an inhibitory signal to T cells and repressing their activation, which is significant for immune regulation (Deng2022The).

The interaction between ITPRIPL1 and CD3ε has been validated using various assays, including ELISA and binding kinetics assays, as well as a Jurkat-dual assay, which demonstrated that the effect of ITPRIPL1 can be counteracted by CD3ε protein, confirming direct contact between the two proteins (Deng2022The). A monoclonal antibody, 13B7, has been developed to target ITPRIPL1, blocking its interaction with CD3ε and restoring T cell activation, highlighting its potential for anti-tumor immunity (Deng2022The).
