# TAS2R10

## Overview
TAS2R10 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 10, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the perception of bitter taste, functioning through a typical seven-transmembrane domain structure that facilitates signal transduction by interacting with G proteins. Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS2R10 is expressed in various extra-oral tissues, suggesting broader biological functions, including involvement in cellular metabolic processes and protein modification. The receptor is implicated in several signaling pathways, such as retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, indicating its potential role in cellular homeostasis and protein degradation (Zhu2019Systematic). Additionally, TAS2R10 has been studied in the context of cancer, where it may influence cancer cell behavior and serve as a therapeutic target due to its ability to suppress tumor growth and invasiveness (Seo2017Anticancer).

## Structure
TAS2R10 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the perception of bitter taste. It features a typical seven-transmembrane domain structure, characteristic of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane multiple times. This structural configuration is crucial for its function in signal transduction, as it facilitates the interaction with G proteins inside the cell.

The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, which are common among GPCRs. These modifications include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and activity. Glycosylation typically occurs on the extracellular domains, potentially affecting ligand binding and receptor activation, while phosphorylation often occurs on intracellular domains, modulating the receptor's interaction with G proteins and other signaling molecules.

TAS2R10 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its amino acid sequence and potentially alter its functional properties. These isoforms may have distinct roles in bitter taste perception, although specific details on the differences between these isoforms are not provided in the available context. The structural and functional diversity of TAS2R10 highlights its complexity and importance in taste perception.

## Function
TAS2R10, a member of the bitter taste receptor family, is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in detecting bitter compounds. While traditionally associated with taste perception, TAS2R10 is expressed in various extra-oral tissues, indicating broader biological roles. In healthy human cells, TAS2R10 is implicated in several molecular processes, including cellular protein metabolic processes and protein modification processes. It is associated with cellular components such as the cytosol and cytoskeletal parts, and it exhibits molecular functions like catalytic activity and enzyme binding (Zhu2019Systematic).

TAS2R10 is also involved in signaling pathways, such as retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and plays a role in metabolic activities like glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. It is linked to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, suggesting a role in protein degradation and turnover (Zhu2019Systematic). The receptor is expressed in various human cell lines, including HeLa, TPC1, and CAPAN-2, indicating tissue-specific functions in the uterus, thyroid, and pancreas (Zhu2019Systematic). These diverse functions suggest that TAS2R10 may have significant roles in cellular homeostasis and signaling beyond its traditional role in taste perception.

## Clinical Significance
TAS2R10, a bitter taste receptor, has been implicated in various clinical contexts beyond its traditional role in taste perception. In cancer research, particularly in neuroblastoma, TAS2R10 has shown potential as a therapeutic target due to its ability to suppress cancer stemness and invasive activities. Overexpression of TAS2R10 in neuroblastoma cells leads to reduced expression of cancer stem cell markers and decreased tumorigenic potential, suggesting its role in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis (Seo2017Anticancer). 

The gene is also involved in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and its downstream targets, which are crucial in tumor angiogenesis and glucose metabolism, further supporting its potential in cancer therapy (Seo2017Anticancer). 

Beyond oncology, TAS2R10 has been associated with various biological processes, including protein metabolic processes and cellular component assembly, through its involvement in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. This suggests a broader role in cellular homeostasis and potential implications in diseases related to protein degradation (Zhu2019Systematic). 

While the clinical significance of TAS2R10 in other diseases remains under investigation, its expression and functional alterations highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in specific pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TAS2R10, a member of the bitter taste receptor family, is involved in various protein interactions that extend beyond its role in taste perception. It is linked to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, with potential interactions involving the anaphase promoting complex subunit 5 (ANAPC5) and ubiquitin protein ligase E3B. These interactions suggest a role for TAS2R10 in the regulation of protein degradation processes (Zhu2019Systematic).

In the context of cancer, TAS2R10 has been shown to interact with pathways that influence cancer cell behavior. Overexpression of TAS2R10 in neuroblastoma cells leads to the suppression of cancer stem cell markers and inhibits tumor growth, migration, and invasion. This is partly achieved through the down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and its downstream targets, such as VEGF and GLUT1, which are involved in tumor angiogenesis and glucose metabolism (Seo2017Anticancer). These findings indicate that TAS2R10 may interact with signaling pathways that regulate cancer cell stemness and invasiveness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Seo2017Anticancer).
