# RAD17

## Overview
The RAD17 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms in human cells. The RAD17 protein functions as a checkpoint clamp loader, specifically facilitating the loading of the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex onto DNA at sites of damage. This process is crucial for the activation of the ATR kinase, which is a key player in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly in regions with extensive single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Bermudez2003Loading; Day2022Structure). Structurally, RAD17 is related to the AAA+ class of ATPases and forms a complex with replication factor C (RFC) subunits, replacing the Rfc1 subunit to form the RAD17-RFC complex. This complex is involved in recognizing DNA damage and signaling to cell cycle controls, especially during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Zou2003Replication; Ellison2003Biochemical). RAD17's activity is ATP-dependent and is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is essential for its role in maintaining genomic stability (Li1999hRAD17).

## Structure
The RAD17 protein is a component of the checkpoint clamp loader complex, playing a crucial role in the DNA damage response. Structurally, RAD17 is related to the AAA+ class of ATPases, characterized by conserved sequence motifs such as the Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B (DEXX) motifs, which are involved in nucleotide binding (Venclovas2000Structurebased). The protein shows structural similarity to the δ′ subunit of E. coli polymerase III and the D2 fragment of the NSF protein, both members of the AAA+ class (Venclovas2000Structurebased).

The human RAD17-RFC complex forms a specialized clamp loader, where RAD17 replaces the large RFC1 subunit, altering the loading specificity from PCNA to the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp (Day2022Structure). The RAD17-RFC complex is described as having two effective layers: a lower open 'C' shaped ring and an upper closed pseudo-pentagonal ring, with RAD17 contributing to the structure through its N-terminal Rossmann fold and central helical bundle domains (Day2022Structure). RAD17 interacts specifically with the RAD9 subunit of the 9-1-1 complex through a linear segment, ensuring specificity for the respective clamp (Day2022Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate RAD17's activity, which is crucial for its function in maintaining genomic stability (Li1999hRAD17).

## Function
The RAD17 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control in human cells. RAD17 functions as a checkpoint clamp loader, facilitating the loading of the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex onto DNA at sites of damage. This process is essential for the activation of the ATR kinase, which plays a significant role in responding to DNA damage, particularly at sites with substantial regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Bermudez2003Loading; Day2022Structure).

The RAD17 protein is part of a complex with replication factor C (RFC) subunits, where it replaces the Rfc1 subunit, forming the RAD17-RFC complex. This complex is involved in recognizing DNA damage and signaling to cell cycle controls, particularly during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Zou2003Replication; Ellison2003Biochemical). RAD17's activity is ATP-dependent, and it shows specificity for DNA substrates with 5' recessed ends, which is crucial for its role in loading the 9-1-1 clamp onto DNA (Shiomi2002Clamp; Ellison2003Biochemical).

In healthy human cells, RAD17 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it helps maintain genomic stability by halting cell cycle progression to allow DNA repair in response to genotoxic stress (Bermudez2003Loading).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAD17 gene have been implicated in various cancers due to its critical role in DNA damage repair and maintaining genomic stability. In families with histories of pancreatic and breast cancers, RAD17 has been identified as a candidate cancer predisposition gene. A specific splice site mutation, c.1605 + 2T > A, in RAD17 may lead to exon skipping and loss of function, potentially increasing cancer risk by causing genomic instability (Joris2024Identification). This mutation is absent in control populations, suggesting its significance in cancer predisposition (Joris2024Identification).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), RAD17 expression is significantly downregulated, often due to genomic deletions and loss of heterozygosity at its locus. This downregulation contributes to genomic instability, a hallmark of HNSCC, and may play a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhao2007Downregulation). Additionally, the miR-205-5p/BRCA1/RAD17 axis has been shown to promote genomic instability in HNSCC by downregulating RAD17, which is crucial for DNA repair. This axis is associated with poor prognosis and high recurrence rates in patients (Valenti2019The).

## Interactions
The RAD17 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the DNA damage response pathway. It forms a complex with the Rad1-Rad9-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex, which is essential for the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1, a key step in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (Zou2002Regulation). RAD17 associates with chromatin and recruits the Rad9 complex independently of ATR, suggesting it helps stabilize ATR's association with chromatin (Zou2002Regulation). The Rad17-RFC complex, which includes RAD17 and RFC2-RFC5 subunits, is loaded onto sites of DNA damage, facilitating the loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto DNA (Medhurst2008ATR).

RAD17 is phosphorylated by ATR, a process mediated by the Rad1-Rad9-Hus1 complex, which is crucial for maintaining the 9-1-1 complex at DNA damage sites (Medhurst2008ATR). This phosphorylation is necessary for the formation of Rad9 foci in response to DNA damage and replication stress (Medhurst2008ATR). RAD17 also interacts with Replication Protein A (RPA), which enhances its binding to single-stranded DNA and facilitates its recruitment to sites of DNA damage (Zou2003Replication). These interactions highlight RAD17's role in coordinating the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stability.
