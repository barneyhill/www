# GPR135

## Overview
GPR135 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 135, a member of the GPCR family, which is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is notable for its ß-arrestin-biased signaling, exhibiting constitutive activity by recruiting ß-arrestin2 without the need for an external ligand (Oishi2017Orphan). GPR135 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and pancreatic beta cells, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological processes such as cellular signaling and potentially influencing insulin secretion (Oishi2017Orphan). Additionally, GPR135 forms heteromeric complexes with the melatonin MT2 receptor, modulating its signaling pathways, which may have implications for circadian rhythm regulation and other melatonin-related functions (Oishi2017Orphan). Despite these insights, the full spectrum of GPR135's physiological roles remains to be elucidated, warranting further research into its functions and interactions (Oishi2017Orphan).

## Function
GPR135, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is involved in various molecular processes, primarily through its role as a ß-arrestin-biased receptor. It exhibits spontaneous activity, recruiting ß-arrestin2 without the need for an external ligand, which suggests a constitutive activity profile (Oishi2017Orphan). This receptor is expressed in human pancreatic beta cells, where it may influence cellular signaling pathways in an agonist-independent manner, potentially affecting insulin secretion or other metabolic processes (Oishi2017Orphan). 

GPR135 is also expressed in the brain and other tissues, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Oishi2017Orphan). The receptor's activity is characterized by its ability to form heteromeric complexes with the melatonin MT2 receptor, modulating MT2 receptor signaling by affecting ß-arrestin2 recruitment but not cAMP production (Oishi2017Orphan). This interaction suggests a role in the regulation of melatonin receptor functions, possibly impacting circadian rhythms or other melatonin-related processes. Despite these insights, the specific functions of GPR135 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to clarify its physiological roles (Oishi2017Orphan).

## Interactions
GPR135, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of signaling pathways. It is known to spontaneously recruit ß-arrestin2, a protein involved in receptor desensitization and internalization, in an agonist-independent manner. This recruitment is specific and has been confirmed through competition assays (Oishi2017Orphan). GPR135 also forms heteromeric complexes with the melatonin MT2 receptor, which affects the recruitment of ß-arrestin2 to MT2 but does not influence cAMP production (Oishi2017Orphan). These interactions suggest a reciprocal regulatory signaling network between GPR135 and the MT2 receptor, potentially modulating melatonin-induced signaling (Oishi2017Orphan).

The receptor's interaction with ß-arrestin2 is further supported by its co-localization in the endosome, as observed through confocal microscopy. This interaction changes the ß-arrestin2 staining pattern, indicating constitutive recruitment (Oishi2017Orphan). Despite these interactions, GPR135 does not bind melatonin or its analogs, as demonstrated by radioligand binding assays (Oishi2017Orphan). These findings highlight GPR135's role as a ß-arrestin-biased receptor, with potential implications for its function in various tissues, including human pancreatic beta cells (Oishi2017Orphan).
