# BTNL2

## Overview
BTNL2 (butyrophilin-like 2) is a gene that encodes a type-1 transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the butyrophilin-like family, structurally related to the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules. The BTNL2 protein plays a crucial role in immune regulation by modulating T cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis. It is predominantly expressed in lymphoid tissues and the intestine, where it functions as a negative regulator of T cell activation, influencing signaling pathways such as NFAT, NF-κB, and AP-1. This regulatory function is essential for the differentiation of regulatory T cells and the maintenance of immune tolerance, particularly in the intestinal environment. BTNL2's involvement in immune modulation extends to interactions with γδ T cells, impacting tumor immune escape mechanisms. Genetic variations in BTNL2 have been associated with autoimmune diseases, such as sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting its clinical significance in both immune regulation and disease susceptibility (Arnett2014Immune; Du2022Cancer; Nguyen2006BTNL2).

## Structure
The BTNL2 protein is a type-1 membrane glycoprotein and a member of the butyrophilin-like family, related to the B7 family of costimulatory receptors and ligands. Its structure includes four extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, organized into two IgV-IgC pairs (IgVa-IgCa and IgVb-IgCb) (Nguyen2006BTNL2). The N-terminal IgV domain of BTNL2 adopts a beta sandwich topology typical of immunoglobulin folds, consisting of nine beta strands and two short helical turns (Basak2020Structural). The structure is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys24 and Cys98 (Basak2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of BTNL2 is monomeric and globular, with a Stokes radius of 1.98 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 1.57 S, indicating a compact form (Basak2020Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a tetrameric complex for functional assays, achieved by binding biotinylated BTNL2 to streptavidin in a 4:1 stoichiometric ratio (Basak2020Structural).

BTNL2 is expressed in various tissues, including lymphoid organs and the intestine, and is involved in immune regulation. It can inhibit T cell activation by reducing IL-2 secretion (Basak2020Structural; Nguyen2006BTNL2).

## Function
BTNL2 (butyrophilin-like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune regulation, primarily by modulating T cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis. The BTNL2 protein is structurally related to the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules and is expressed in various tissues, including the intestine and lymphoid tissues (Arnett2014Immune; Nguyen2006BTNL2). It functions as a negative regulator of T cell activation by inhibiting T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways, such as NFAT, NF-κB, and AP-1, which are crucial for T cell proliferation and cytokine production (AbelerDörner2012Butyrophilins:; Nguyen2006BTNL2).

BTNL2 also plays a role in the differentiation of regulatory T cells (T Reg cells) from naive CD4+ T cells, contributing to immune tolerance and homeostasis. This process involves the induction of FOXP3 expression, a marker of T Reg cells, and is crucial for maintaining intestinal immune balance (Arnett2014Immune; Rhodes2016Regulation). The protein's activity in the intestine suggests its involvement in promoting tolerance and reducing inflammation, which is essential for preventing excessive immune responses (Arnett2014Immune).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BTNL2 gene have been linked to several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The BTNL2 G16071A polymorphism is associated with an increased susceptibility to granulomatous diseases, particularly sarcoidosis. This association is notably strong among Caucasians, while it is not significant among Asians, and considered a false-positive in Africans (Tong2016The). The polymorphism may lead to a truncated protein product, potentially affecting T-cell responses and contributing to disease susceptibility (Tong2016The).

BTNL2 has also been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Exome sequencing identified several non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BTNL2 that confer RA risk independently of other known RA-susceptible genes (Mitsunaga2013Exome). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has been associated with rare variants in BTNL2, such as the p.G454C variant, which shows a significant association with increased IBD risk (Prescott2015Pooled).

In cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, BTNL2 expression is linked to tumor immune escape by engaging IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and target for cancer immunotherapy (Du2022Cancer).

## Interactions
BTNL2 (butyrophilin-like 2) is involved in several interactions that modulate immune responses. It is known to bind to putative receptors on activated B and T cells, inhibiting T cell proliferation and affecting TCR activation of NFAT, NF-κB, and AP-1 signaling pathways (Nguyen2006BTNL2). BTNL2 does not bind to known B7 family receptors such as CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, and PD-1, indicating a distinct receptor interaction (Nguyen2006BTNL2).

The protein also interacts with γδ T cells, specifically binding to Vγ1 γδ T cells, which are major IL-17A producers in tumors. This interaction is significant in the context of tumor immune escape, as it promotes IL-17A production, enhancing tumor resistance by recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (Du2022Cancer). BTNL2's role in modulating the tumor microenvironment is further highlighted by its ability to bind CD4+ T cells, and its blockade leads to increased accumulation of CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells (Du2022Cancer).

The structural characteristics of BTNL2, particularly its non-canonical CC′ loop, suggest it may interact with binding partners that have narrower interacting domains than typical IgV domains (Basak2020Structural). However, the specific binding partners and the exact biological significance of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
