# NUDT5

## Overview
The NUDT5 gene encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 5, a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, which is characterized by its ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, such as ADP-ribose. This protein plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by regulating the levels of free ADP-ribose and oxidized nucleotides, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing oxidative damage (Yang2000Cloning; Ito2011Cleavage). NUDT5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular responses to oxidative stress and hormonal signaling, and is particularly abundant in liver and pituitary tissues (Yang2000Cloning). The protein's enzymatic activity is essential for normal cell cycle progression and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, where its expression levels can impact prognosis and therapeutic outcomes (Zhang2021The; Qian2024The).

## Structure
The human NUDT5 protein is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, characterized by a conserved Nudix motif crucial for its enzymatic activity (Zha2006Crystal). The primary structure of NUDT5 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including an N-terminal domain, a catalytic Nudix domain, and an extended α-helix at the C-terminus (Zha2006Crystal). The secondary structure includes α-helices and loop-helix-loop motifs, particularly in the Nudix domain, which is involved in substrate binding and catalysis (Zha2006Crystal).

The tertiary structure of NUDT5 forms a stable three-dimensional conformation, facilitating its function as an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homodimer, with significant domain swapping between monomers, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, salt-bridges, and hydrogen bonds (Zha2006Crystal). This dimerization is essential for its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (Zha2006Crystal).

NUDT5 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. The protein may also exist in splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its function or localization (Arimori2011Diverse). These structural features contribute to NUDT5's ability to hydrolyze a variety of nucleoside diphosphates, including ADP-ribose and oxidized nucleotides (Arimori2011Diverse).

## Function
NUDT5 is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ADP-sugars, such as ADP-ribose and ADP-mannose, to AMP and sugar phosphates. This activity is crucial for regulating the levels of free ADP-ribose in cells, which can otherwise lead to non-enzymatic protein modifications and intracellular damage (Yang2000Cloning). NUDT5 also plays a role in nucleotide metabolism by cleaving oxidized nucleotides like 8-oxo-dGDP, thus preventing their incorporation into DNA and maintaining genomic stability (Ito2011Cleavage; Arimori2011Diverse).

The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular responses to oxidative stress and hormonal signaling. It is particularly abundant in the liver and pituitary tissues, suggesting significant physiological roles in these areas (Yang2000Cloning). NUDT5's activity is essential for normal cell cycle progression, as its reduced expression can lead to cell cycle delays, particularly affecting the transition from the G1 to the S phase (Zhang2011Lowered). By maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools and preventing oxidative damage, NUDT5 contributes to cellular metabolism and regulation, impacting overall organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUDT5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in breast cancer. NUDT5 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer that is notably aggressive and lacks targeted hormonal therapies. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival in breast cancer patients (Zhang2021The). In TNBC, NUDT5 plays a crucial role in regulating oxidative DNA damage and cell proliferation. Its inhibition, either through siRNA targeting or small molecule inhibitors like TH5427, results in suppressed tumor growth by interfering with DNA replication and inducing oxidative DNA lesions (Qian2024The).

In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, high NUDT5 expression is linked to poorer prognosis and is considered a potential prognostic biomarker. This association is particularly evident in patients receiving hormone treatment, where high NUDT5 levels correlate with reduced survival rates (Tong2021NUDT5). NUDT5 is also involved in hormone-dependent gene regulation and nuclear ATP synthesis, processes essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in breast cancer cells (Wright2016ADPribose–derived). These findings suggest that targeting NUDT5 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing breast cancer.

## Interactions
NUDT5 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It is known to form homodimers, with the active site located at the interface between the two chains, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Dubey2024Identification). NUDT5 shares substrate activity with NUDT14, indicating a high degree of structural similarity and potential redundancy in their functions (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). 

In terms of genetic interactions, NUDT5 is part of a cluster with other NUDIX enzymes such as NUDT4, NUDT6, NUDT7, NUDT8, and NUDT9. Knockdown studies have shown that reducing NUDT5 expression affects the expression of these enzymes, suggesting strong interactions within this cluster (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Specifically, in A549 cells, the double knockdown of NUDT5 with NUDT8 or DCP2 results in increased cell death, indicating a synergistic effect on cell viability (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

NUDT5 also interacts with nucleic acids, particularly in the context of hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties like ADP-ribose, which is important for maintaining NAD+ homeostasis and influencing cancer cell metabolism (Dubey2024Identification). These interactions highlight NUDT5's role in cellular metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target.
