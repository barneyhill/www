# CLCC1

## Overview
The CLCC1 gene encodes the chloride channel CLIC-like 1 protein, which is a transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining ion homeostasis by functioning as an ER anion channel, regulating chloride and calcium ion concentrations. The proper functioning of CLCC1 is essential for maintaining cellular health, as it influences membrane potential, osmolarity, and protein folding, thereby preventing ER stress (Jia2022Disruption; Guo2023Disruption). Additionally, CLCC1 is involved in lipid metabolism and nuclear pore complex assembly, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Mathiowetz2024CLCC1). Mutations in the CLCC1 gene have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring its clinical significance (Ma2022CLCC1; Guo2023Disruption).

## Structure
The CLCC1 protein is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes three transmembrane segments and an N-terminal signal peptide. It is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it forms homomultimers, indicating a quaternary structure involving multimerization (Guo2023Disruption). The protein's structure is homologous to yeast proteins Brl1p and Brr6p, and it contains a conserved domain known as the 'NPC-biogenesis "h"-shaped (Nbh) domain', which is characterized by the separation of transmembrane helices by a lumenal amphipathic helix (Mathiowetz2024CLCC1). This domain allows CLCC1 to reside in curved membranes and potentially form ring oligomers (Mathiowetz2024CLCC1).

The protein's secondary structure includes an α-helix where specific residues like S263 and W267 are located, which are crucial for its function (Guo2023Disruption). The predicted structure of CLCC1, as analyzed by AlphaFold2, suggests a monomer and a 16-mer oligomer, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not provided (Mathiowetz2024CLCC1). The protein is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as K48-specific ubiquitination, which leads to proteasome-mediated degradation (Guo2023Disruption).

## Function
The CLCC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining ion homeostasis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. It functions as an ER anion channel, primarily involved in regulating chloride (Cl-) and calcium (Ca2+) ion concentrations. This regulation is essential for maintaining the membrane potential and osmolarity, which are crucial for proper protein folding and preventing ER stress (Jia2022Disruption; Guo2023Disruption). CLCC1's activity is modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which enhances its channel activity, and its proper function is vital for cellular health, as mutations can lead to neurodegenerative diseases like ALS (Guo2023Disruption).

In addition to its role in ion homeostasis, CLCC1 is involved in lipid metabolism. It regulates neutral lipid storage and secretion in hepatocytes, influencing the balance between lipid storage in cytosolic lipid droplets and secretion as lipoproteins. Loss of CLCC1 leads to the accumulation of large lipid droplets and liver steatosis, highlighting its importance in lipid homeostasis (Mathiowetz2024CLCC1). CLCC1 also plays a role in nuclear pore complex assembly, promoting the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear envelope membranes, which is crucial for proper nuclear pore complex insertion (Mathiowetz2024CLCC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLCC1 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and retinitis pigmentosa. In ALS, mutations such as S263R and W267R impair the function of the CLCC1 channel, leading to disrupted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ion homeostasis, increased ER stress, and protein misfolding. These mutations are associated with ALS-like pathologies, including motor neuron loss and neurodegeneration (Guo2023Disruption). The K298A mutation, although not found in ALS patients, also shows ALS-like phenotypes in animal models, indicating its potential role in disease development (Guo2023Disruption).

In retinitis pigmentosa, a specific mutation, c.75C > A (p.D25E), has been identified in Pakistani families. This mutation is associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and is believed to have originated from a single founder mutation 2,000–5,000 years ago. The mutation affects the CLCC1 channel's function, contributing to retinal degeneration (Ma2022CLCC1).

Alterations in CLCC1 expression or function can lead to increased sensitivity to ER stress, misfolded protein accumulation, and neurodegeneration, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jia2015Loss).

## Interactions
CLCC1, a protein encoded by the human CLCC1 gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. One significant interaction is with the TMEM41B scramblase. CLCC1 partners with TMEM41B to regulate lipid homeostasis, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is essential for phospholipid equilibration across the ER membrane, and CLCC1 enhances the scramblase activity of TMEM41B when in complex, although it does not exhibit scramblase activity on its own (Wu2024CLCC1).

CLCC1 also forms homomultimers within the ER membrane, as demonstrated by biochemical analyses and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These homomultimers are involved in maintaining ER ion homeostasis, particularly for chloride ions (Guo2023Disruption).

Additionally, CLCC1 interacts with a mitochondrial microprotein called PIGBOS, which is involved in regulating ER stress. This interaction suggests a role for CLCC1 in linking ER and mitochondrial functions, although its exact impact on NTCP function appears minimal (Appelman2020The). These interactions highlight CLCC1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in lipid and ion homeostasis.
