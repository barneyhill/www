# RYBP

## Overview
The RYBP gene encodes the RING1 and YY1 binding protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. As a component of the non-canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (ncPRC1), the RYBP protein is involved in maintaining the repressed state of homeotic genes by interacting with key Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, such as RING1 and YY1 (Bajusz2019Evolving). This intrinsically disordered protein is characterized by its flexible structure, which allows it to interact with various macromolecules, facilitating the assembly of ncPRC1 complexes essential for chromatin compaction and gene repression (AraujoAbad2024Unveiling). Beyond its role in transcriptional repression, RYBP is implicated in DNA repair processes and cardiac progenitor cell development, highlighting its diverse functional repertoire (Henry2020RYBP; Bajusz2019Evolving). Alterations in RYBP expression have been linked to various cancers, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Tong2018Overexpression; Ke2020RYBP).

## Structure
RYBP (RING1 and YY1 binding protein) is a multifunctional intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) characterized by its lack of a stable tertiary conformation, which allows it to interact flexibly with multiple macromolecules (AraujoAbad2024Unveiling). The primary structure of RYBP includes a conserved zinc-finger motif at the N-terminus, which is folded and contains the ubiquitin-binding domain (AraujoAbad2024Unveiling). This is followed by an 'N-term' helix and a nuclear location signal (NLS) that facilitates its nuclear translocation (AraujoAbad2024Unveiling; Neira2021The). The C-terminal region includes a β-hairpin motif, while other regions are unfolded and rich in lysine, arginine, serine, and threonine residues (AraujoAbad2024Unveiling).

RYBP's secondary structure features include a putative α-helix termed the 'N-term helix', comprising amino acids 59-69, which is evolutionarily conserved and essential for the integrity of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (vPRC1) (Silva2023A). The protein's interactions with other components of the vPRC1 complex, such as RING1B and PCGF4, are crucial for its structural integrity and enzymatic activity (Silva2023A). Despite its intrinsic disorder, RYBP establishes extensive interactions with the vPRC1 catalytic core, particularly through the 'N-term helix', which is resistant to proteolysis and crucial for complex assembly (Silva2023A).

## Function
RYBP (RING1 and YY1 Binding Protein) is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of transcription in human cells, primarily through its interactions with Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. It is a component of the non-canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (ncPRC1) and plays a crucial role in maintaining the repressed state of homeotic genes by interacting with key PcG proteins such as RING1 and YY1 (Bajusz2019Evolving). RYBP acts as a bridging factor, facilitating the assembly of ncPRC1 complexes, which are essential for chromatin compaction and gene repression (Bajusz2019Evolving).

RYBP also interacts with transcription factors like E2F2, E2F3, and E2F6, influencing both gene activation and repression. For example, it can activate the Cdc6 promoter, important for DNA replication, and contribute to the repression of germ-cell-specific genes by interacting with E2F6 and DNA methyl-transferase 3b (DNMT3B) (Bajusz2019Evolving). Additionally, RYBP is involved in cardiac progenitor cell development and sarcomere formation, playing a critical role in the expression of genes necessary for cardiac differentiation and function (Henry2020RYBP). It is also implicated in DNA repair processes, particularly in homologous recombination during meiosis (Bajusz2019Evolving).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RYBP gene have been implicated in various cancers. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), overexpression of RYBP inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance to cisplatin by inactivating the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tong2018Overexpression). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), RYBP is significantly downregulated, and its overexpression inhibits cell growth by arresting the G1-S phase transition, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Ke2020RYBP).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low RYBP expression is associated with larger tumor size, metastasis, and poor survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhu2016Expression). In breast cancer, RYBP is downregulated, and its overexpression suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a molecular target for therapy (Zhou2016RING1).

RYBP deficiency, along with TET methylcytosine oxidases, leads to extensive CpG island hypermethylation, contributing to malignant transformation in lung cancer and other solid tumors. This deficiency disrupts normal methylation patterns and is associated with the activation of tumor-promoting pathways (Cui2023Deficiency).

## Interactions
RYBP (RING1 and YY1 Binding Protein) is a component of the mammalian Polycomb group (PcG) complexes and interacts with several key proteins involved in transcriptional repression. It directly interacts with Ring1 proteins (Ring1A and Ring1B) and M33, which are part of the PcG complex. The interaction with Ring1 occurs through the C-terminal domain, while the interaction with M33 involves a different domain of M33 (Garcia1999RYBP). RYBP also interacts with the transcription factor YY1, which is related to the Drosophila pleiohomeotic gene product. This interaction is specific and occurs in tissue culture cells, as demonstrated by a GST pulldown assay (Garcia1999RYBP).

RYBP is involved in forming distinct PRC1 complexes, either with RYBP/YAF2 or CBX/PHC/SCM subunits. These complexes exhibit different enzymatic activities, with RYBP-containing complexes showing stronger ubiquitination activity on H2AK119 compared to those with CBX/PHC subunits (Gao2012PCGF). RYBP competes with CBX8 for binding to RING1B, suggesting that RYBP and its homolog YAF2 may be required at different times or for different aspects of PRC1 function (Gao2012PCGF). Additionally, RYBP interacts with human importin α3, facilitating its nuclear translocation (Neira2021The).
