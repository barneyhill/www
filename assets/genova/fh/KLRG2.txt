# KLRG2

## Overview
KLRG2, or killer cell lectin-like receptor G2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family of inhibitory receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. The KLRG2 protein is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer and other diseases. It is involved in modulating the activity of immune cells, thereby influencing immune surveillance and tumor progression. Alterations in the expression of KLRG2 have been associated with various clinical outcomes, including its potential role as a prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma and its involvement in the immunosuppressive environment of cancer stemness (Li2023Characterization; Miranda2019Cancer). Additionally, KLRG2 has been identified as a highly expressed gene in triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Akhouayri2022Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
KLRG2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lower expression levels of KLRG2 are associated with higher risk scores and poorer prognosis, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker. The Genomic Instability-Associated Gene Index (GSAGI), which includes KLRG2, has been used to stratify LUAD patients into high and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients showing increased genomic instability and more frequent TP53 mutations (Li2023Characterization). 

In the context of cancer stemness, KLRG2 is part of a stemness score that indicates a role in the immunosuppressive environment associated with cancer stemness. This suggests that KLRG2 may contribute to immune evasion and tumor evolution, impacting clinical outcomes negatively (Miranda2019Cancer). 

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), KLRG2 is one of the top expressed genes, indicating its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target. However, its specific interactions and clinical significance in TNBC remain less clear (Akhouayri2022Identification). Overall, KLRG2's expression and interactions are significant in the prognosis and treatment response of certain cancers.
