# NHEJ1

## Overview
NHEJ1 is a gene that encodes the protein non-homologous end joining factor 1, also known as XRCC4-like factor (XLF) or Cernunnos. This protein is a critical component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is a primary mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. The NHEJ1 protein functions by interacting with other key proteins, such as XRCC4 and DNA Ligase IV, to facilitate the ligation of DNA ends, thereby maintaining genomic stability. This process is essential for cellular survival, particularly following exposure to DNA-damaging agents, and plays a significant role in immune system development through V(D)J recombination, which generates diversity in immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes (Sheikh2017Loss; Ahnesorg2006XLF). Mutations in the NHEJ1 gene can lead to severe clinical conditions, including immunodeficiency and neurological dysfunctions, underscoring its importance in both DNA repair and developmental processes (Sheikh2017Loss; Dutrannoy2010Clinical).

## Function
The NHEJ1 gene encodes a protein known as XRCC4-like factor (XLF), which is a crucial component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, a primary mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. This pathway is essential for maintaining genomic stability and is involved in processes such as V(D)J recombination, which is necessary for the diversity of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes (Sheikh2017Loss; Ahnesorg2006XLF). 

NHEJ1 interacts with the XRCC4-DNA Ligase IV complex to facilitate the ligation of DNA ends, a critical step in the NHEJ repair process. This interaction is vital for the efficient repair of DSBs, as XLF forms multimeric complexes with XRCC4 and DNA Ligase IV, promoting DNA end joining (Ahnesorg2006XLF). 

In healthy human cells, NHEJ1 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in ensuring genomic stability by repairing DSBs. This function is crucial for cellular survival following exposure to DNA-damaging agents and is necessary for proper immune function and development, particularly in the formation of diverse lymphocyte antigen receptors (El2014Nhej1; Esmaeilzadeh2019An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NHEJ1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is crucial for DNA repair. Deficiencies in NHEJ1 can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by T and B cell lymphopenia, recurrent infections, and growth retardation (Sheikh2017Loss; Frizinsky2022Novel). Patients with NHEJ1 mutations often present with microcephaly, developmental delays, and radiosensitivity, resembling a Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like phenotype (Dutrannoy2010Clinical).

In some cases, NHEJ1 mutations result in a null phenotype, where no functional protein is produced, leading to severe immunological and developmental conditions (Sheikh2017Loss). The gene is also implicated in central nervous system development, and its disruption can cause brain malformations such as polymicrogyria (Cantagrel2007Truncation). Additionally, alterations in NHEJ1 can affect telomere maintenance, potentially leading to premature aging and lymphocytopenia (Sheikh2017Loss).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used successfully to treat some patients with NHEJ1 deficiencies, indicating its potential as a therapeutic option (Sheikh2017Loss; Frizinsky2022Novel).

## Interactions
NHEJ1, also known as XRCC4-like factor (XLF) or Cernunnos, is a crucial component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. It interacts with several key proteins involved in this pathway, including XRCC4, DNA ligase IV (LIG4), and the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers. These interactions are essential for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which are critical during the development of the central nervous system and immune system (El2014Nhej1).

NHEJ1 promotes the ligation of mismatched and non-cohesive DNA ends and interacts specifically with XRCC4, with its first 128 amino acid residues being essential for this interaction (Sheikh2017Loss). The protein is also involved in the stabilization and alignment of DNA ends for repair, working in conjunction with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and DNA-PKcs (El2014Nhej1).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, NHEJ1 is implicated in mechanisms of maturation and diversity such as V(D)J recombination, which is vital for immune system function. Mutations in NHEJ1 can lead to severe neurological dysfunctions, including microcephaly and growth retardation, highlighting its importance in brain development (El2014Nhej1).
