# ESRRB

## Overview
The ESRRB gene encodes the estrogen-related receptor beta, a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in gene regulation and cellular differentiation. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the protein functions as a transcription factor, influencing various biological processes without the need for ligand activation (Divekar2016Estrogen-related). ESRRB is particularly crucial in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells by interacting with other key pluripotency factors, such as Oct4 and Nanog, and is involved in early developmental processes, including inner ear development (Divekar2016Estrogen-related; Festuccia2017Esrrb). Mutations in the ESRRB gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as nonsyndromic hearing loss and dental caries, highlighting its importance in human health (Weber2014Role; Choi2024Functional).

## Structure
The ESRRB protein, also known as estrogen-related receptor beta, is a nuclear receptor involved in gene regulation. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. The protein includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). The DBD is located in the N-terminal portion and contains a zinc finger domain responsible for DNA binding, while the LBD is located at the C-terminal and is organized in a three-layer sandwich structure with 12 α-helices, contributing to the protein's structural stability and binding ability (Ghasemnejad2022A).

The secondary structure of ESRRB includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of nuclear receptors. The tertiary structure forms the LBD and DBD, allowing the protein to interact with DNA and other molecules. ESRRB can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor (Festuccia2017Esrrb).

ESRRB undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, such as ERRβ2, ERRβ∆10, and ERRβsf, which differ in exon composition and protein structure. These isoforms exhibit different localization and transcriptional activity, with ERRβ2 tending to localize in the cytoplasm, while ERRβsf and ERRβ∆10 are nuclear (Divekar2016Estrogen-related).

## Function
The ESRRB gene encodes the estrogen-related receptor beta, a nuclear receptor involved in various molecular processes crucial for maintaining cellular functions. ESRRB is constitutively active and does not require a ligand to function, allowing it to regulate gene expression by binding to DNA as a monomer. It recognizes specific DNA motifs, such as the estrogen response element (ERE) and a palindromic thyroid hormone response element (TREpal), but not the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) (Divekar2016Estrogen-related).

In embryonic stem cells, ESRRB plays a pivotal role in maintaining pluripotency by interacting with other pluripotency regulators like Oct4 and Nanog. It is essential for the self-renewal of these cells and can substitute for some Yamanaka factors in the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Lu2015Genes; Festuccia2017Esrrb). ESRRB is also involved in early development, particularly in the inner ear, where it is crucial for normal hearing and balance. Mutations in the ESRRB gene are linked to nonsyndromic hearing impairment in humans (Divekar2016Estrogen-related).

ESRRB's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences transcriptional activity, impacting cell differentiation and organismal development (Divekar2016Estrogen-related). Its role extends to regulating energy metabolism and maintaining homeostasis in tissues with high energy demands (Festuccia2017Esrrb).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ESRRB gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting hearing and dental health. ESRRB mutations are linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL), particularly the DFNB35 form of hearing impairment. Specific variants, such as the p.Arg382Cys and c.499G>A (p.Gly167Arg), have been identified as contributing to hearing loss by disrupting the structural stability and transcriptional activity of the ESRRB protein, which is crucial for inner ear function (Ghasemnejad2022A; Choi2024Functional). These mutations can lead to severe-to-profound hearing loss, often symmetric and prelingual, although some cases exhibit progressive or asymmetric patterns (Choi2024Functional).

In addition to hearing loss, ESRRB is implicated in dental caries. Studies have shown that certain ESRRB SNPs are associated with increased susceptibility to dental decay, potentially due to their influence on enamel microhardness and susceptibility to acidic dissolution (Weber2014Role). The gene's expression levels in saliva have been linked to dental caries experience, with variations observed between sexes (Weber2014Role).

ESRRB is also associated with the comorbidity of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and rotator cuff disease (RCD), suggesting a genetic predisposition influenced by specific ESRRB haplotypes (Bonato2016ESRRB). These findings highlight the gene's role in various pathologies, emphasizing the importance of genetic screening and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
ESRRB, a nuclear receptor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in gene regulation and cellular differentiation. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), ESRRB interacts with key pluripotency factors such as NANOG, Oct4, and Sox2, forming complexes that support the maintenance of pluripotency. ESRRB and NANOG co-bind DNA, with their interaction being essential for sustaining the pluripotent state. This cooperative binding is influenced by the presence of motifs like Oct4-Sox2-Tcf-Nanog, which are prevalent at ESRRB binding sites when NANOG is present (Knudsen2023A).

ESRRB also interacts with the Mediator complex and the basal transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcriptional activation. This interaction is crucial for ESRRB's transcriptional activity and efficient reprogramming in ESCs (van2010An; Festuccia2017Esrrb). Additionally, ESRRB can interact with GATA6 in the context of primitive endoderm (PrE) differentiation, suggesting a role in chromatin accessibility and transcription regulation (Knudsen2023A).

The interaction between ESRRB and Ncoa3 is particularly significant, as Ncoa3 acts as a coactivator, enhancing ESRRB's activity at ESC-specific enhancers. This interaction is mediated through the AF-2 domain of ESRRB and is essential for maintaining ESC pluripotency (Percharde2012Ncoa3).
