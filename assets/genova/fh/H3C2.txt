# H3C2

## Overview
The H3C2 gene encodes the H3 clustered histone 2 protein, a member of the histone H3 family, which is integral to the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone proteins, including those encoded by H3C2, are essential for the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby facilitating the regulation of DNA replication, repair, and transcription (Kartchner2023LiteratureBased). The H3 clustered histone 2 protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining chromatin structure, which in turn influences gene expression by modulating DNA accessibility to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins (Kartchner2023LiteratureBased). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and genomic stability, with implications for various diseases when disrupted (Malatesta2024Differential).

## Function
The H3C2 gene encodes a histone protein that is part of the histone H3 family, which plays a crucial role in the organization and packaging of DNA into nucleosomes. This process is essential for DNA replication, repair, and transcription, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development (Kartchner2023LiteratureBased). Histones, including those encoded by H3C2, are fundamental in the formation of chromatin structure, which regulates gene expression by controlling the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins (Kartchner2023LiteratureBased).

In healthy human cells, H3C2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, nucleosome assembly, and the maintenance of DNA integrity. These functions are critical for proper cell cycle progression and the response to DNA damage (Malatesta2024Differential). The gene's role in these processes suggests its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing genomic instability, which can lead to various diseases if disrupted (Kartchner2023LiteratureBased). While specific functions of H3C2 in healthy cells are not detailed extensively, its involvement in these fundamental processes highlights its significance in cell biology and development (Malatesta2024Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the H3C2 gene have been implicated in various pediatric gliomas, including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) and cerebellar glioblastomas. These mutations, particularly the K27M variant, are associated with rare cases of diffuse midline gliomas, which are aggressive and have poor prognoses (HervásCorpión2021Potential). The presence of H3K27M mutations in the H3C2 gene is noted for its potential role in chemoresistance, especially when co-occurring with other mutations such as IDH2 in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Huang2023bamSliceR:). Although the incidence of H3K27M mutations in AML is low, their presence highlights the gene's involvement in altering the genetic landscape of these cancers and potentially impacting treatment outcomes (Huang2023bamSliceR:).

The differential expression of histone H3 variants, including those encoded by H3C2, is also significant in distinguishing between low- and high-grade gliomas. High expression levels of H3.1 and H3.2, which are related to H3C2, are associated with more aggressive glioblastomas, while lower levels are linked to less aggressive forms (HervásCorpión2021Potential). These findings suggest that H3C2 expression levels could serve as potential biomarkers for glioma classification and prognosis.
