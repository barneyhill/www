# DHDDS

## Overview
The DHDDS gene encodes the enzyme dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, a critical component of the cis-prenyltransferase complex involved in the biosynthesis of dolichol, an essential lipid for protein N-glycosylation. This enzyme catalyzes the elongation of farnesyl diphosphate by adding isopentenyl diphosphate units, forming dehydrodolichyl diphosphate, a precursor for dolichol-phosphate. The DHDDS protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a catalytic cis-prenyltransferase homology domain, and forms a heterodimeric complex with the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR), enhancing its enzymatic activity. Mutations in the DHDDS gene are linked to various clinical conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa and congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its significance in maintaining proper cellular function and glycoprotein synthesis (Galosi2021De; Sabry2016A; BarEl2020Structural).

## Structure
The human DHDDS protein is a key component of the cis-prenyltransferase complex, involved in the synthesis of dehydrodolichyl diphosphate. Structurally, DHDDS is composed of three domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-26), a catalytic cis-prenyltransferase homology domain (residues 27-250), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 251-333) (BarEl2020Structure). The catalytic domain consists of 7 α-helices and 6 β-strands, forming an elongated active site cavity, and shares high homology with bacterial medium-chain cis-prenyltransferase homologs (BarEl2020Structural).

The NTD is wrapped around the catalytic domain, with its single α-helix packed against helix α7 through hydrophobic interactions. The CTD features a 'helix-turn-helix' motif composed of two helices, stabilized by a salt bridge and various electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (BarEl2020Structural). DHDDS forms a monodisperse homodimer in solution, confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering, with a mass of approximately 77.0 ± 4.0 kDa (Barel2019Integrative).

The protein's quaternary structure involves a heterodimeric interaction with the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR), forming a large interaction interface that facilitates intersubunit communication (BarEl2020Structural). The C-terminal domain is not directly involved in subunit interactions but may interact with other proteins (Lisnyansky2019Structural).

## Function
The DHDDS gene encodes the enzyme dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of dolichol, a key component in the protein N-glycosylation process. This enzyme is part of the human cis-prenyltransferase complex, which also includes the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR). DHDDS catalyzes the elongation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) by adding isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) units to form dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (DHDD), a precursor for dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) (Barel2019Integrative; Sabry2016A).

Dolichol-phosphate is essential for the synthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (DLOs), which are necessary for N-linked protein glycosylation. This process involves attaching an oligosaccharide to a polypeptide chain, influencing protein folding, stability, and function (Sabry2016A). DHDDS activity ensures adequate levels of Dol-P, maintaining normal glycosylation processes in human cells (Sabry2016A).

In healthy cells, DHDDS is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the production of glycoproteins essential for cellular communication and function (Buczkowska2014Genetic). The enzyme's activity is enhanced by NgBR, which increases the expression and activity of the complex without having catalytic activity itself (Barel2019Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHDDS gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the nervous system and vision. One of the most notable conditions linked to DHDDS mutations is retinitis pigmentosa (RP), specifically RP59, a form of inherited retinal dystrophy. This condition is characterized by progressive vision loss due to retinal degeneration. The K42E mutation in DHDDS is particularly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews, accounting for 10-20% of autosomal recessive RP cases in this population (Ramachandra2020Retinal; Brandwine2021Knockdown). 

DHDDS mutations are also implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. De novo pathogenic variants in the gene have been identified in patients with conditions characterized by epilepsy, movement disorders such as myoclonus and ataxia, and cognitive decline (Galosi2021De). These disorders often involve a slow neurological decline with movement disorders and psychiatric disturbances (Galosi2021De). 

Additionally, DHDDS mutations can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), which are marked by abnormal glycosylation patterns and nervous system involvement (Sabry2016A; Galosi2021De). These mutations can result in protein hypoglycosylation, potentially causing protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Sabry2016A).

## Interactions
The DHDDS protein forms a critical complex with the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR), encoded by the NUS1 gene, to constitute the cis-prenyltransferase (cis-PTase) enzyme. This complex is essential for the biosynthesis of dolichyl monophosphate, a key component in protein N-glycosylation processes within the endoplasmic reticulum (Galosi2021De). The interaction between DHDDS and NgBR is characterized by a heterotetrameric assembly, consisting of two DHDDS and two NgBR subunits, which enhances the enzymatic activity compared to the DHDDS homodimer alone (BarEl2020Structural).

NgBR interacts with DHDDS through its C-terminal RxG motif, which is crucial for forming the active site and facilitating intersubunit communication. This interaction allows NgBR to allosterically modulate the activity of DHDDS, significantly enhancing the hcis-PT activity when NgBR is overexpressed (Edani2020Structural; BarEl2020Structural). The structural organization of the DHDDS protein includes a catalytic domain that shares high homology with bacterial medium-chain cis-prenyltransferase homologs, and a C-terminal domain that stabilizes the tetrameric assembly through homotypic interactions (BarEl2020Structural).

Mutations in DHDDS and NgBR that affect these interactions are associated with various human diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and congenital glycosylation disorders, highlighting the importance of the DHDDS-NgBR complex in maintaining proper cellular function (Galosi2021De; BarEl2020Structural).
