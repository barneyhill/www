# ALDH1B1

## Overview
The ALDH1B1 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member B1, which is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, including acetaldehyde, a byproduct of ethanol metabolism, and retinaldehyde, which is crucial for retinoic acid signaling (Stagos2010Aldehyde; Jackson2014Human). ALDH1B1 is a NAD+-dependent enzyme that plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis and detoxification processes, particularly in the liver, pancreas, and intestinal tract (Jackson2014Human). The protein's structure allows it to form homotetramers and heterotetramers, influencing its enzymatic activity (Jackson2013Comparative). ALDH1B1 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is associated with tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chen2011Aldehyde; Feng2022Targeting).

## Structure
The ALDH1B1 protein is a NAD+-dependent mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolism of aldehydes, including acetaldehyde and all-trans retinaldehyde. It shares significant amino acid identity with other aldehyde dehydrogenases, such as ALDH2 and ALDH1A1, suggesting potential similarities in structure and function (Jackson2014Human). The primary structure of ALDH1B1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with key residues such as Glu285, Cys319, and Asn186 crucial for substrate binding and transition state stabilization (Jackson2013Comparative).

The secondary structure of ALDH1B1 includes conserved alpha helices and beta sheets, which are important for maintaining the protein's stability and function (Jackson2013Comparative). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, forming a catalytic domain that facilitates its enzymatic activity (Jackson2014Human).

In terms of quaternary structure, ALDH1B1 is capable of forming homotetramers, similar to ALDH2, and may also form heterotetramers with ALDH2 subunits, potentially affecting its catalytic activity (Jackson2013Comparative; Jackson2014Human). The protein's structure is further characterized by a NAD+ binding domain, which is conserved across species (Jackson2013Comparative).

## Function
The human gene ALDH1B1 encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in the metabolism of aldehydes, particularly acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of ethanol consumption. ALDH1B1 is a NAD+-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, contributing to detoxification processes in healthy cells (Stagos2010Aldehyde; Jackson2014Human). This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the liver, intestinal tract, and pancreas, indicating its involvement in first-pass and systemic detoxification of acetaldehyde (Jackson2014Human).

ALDH1B1 also metabolizes other aldehydes, including medium-chain aldehydes like hexanal and nonanal, and is involved in retinoic acid signaling by oxidizing retinaldehyde to retinoic acid, which is crucial for cellular development and differentiation (Stagos2010Aldehyde; Jackson2014Human). The enzyme's activity is sensitive to disulfiram, a drug used to treat alcoholism, suggesting potential therapeutic implications (Stagos2010Aldehyde).

In the pancreas, ALDH1B1-expressing cells function as progenitor cells, contributing to the maintenance and regeneration of pancreatic lineages, including acinar, ductal, and endocrine cells (Mameishvili2019Aldh1b1). This highlights ALDH1B1's role in both detoxification and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ALDH1B1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. The ALDH1B1*2 polymorphism is catalytically inactive due to poor NAD+ binding, which can impact ethanol metabolism and is associated with increased alcohol hypersensitivity reactions, higher systolic blood pressure, and increased non-drinking behaviors, suggesting a link to acetaldehyde toxicity (Jackson2014Human). 

In cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, ALDH1B1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis. This overexpression is associated with altered cell morphology, reduced proliferation rates, increased chemoresistance, and enhanced migratory potential, contributing to cancer progression (Tsochantaridis2021Aldehyde; Chen2011Aldehyde). ALDH1B1 is also implicated in the modulation of key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and PI3K/Akt, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Singh2015ALDH1B1a). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ALDH1B1 is required for KRAS-driven tumor growth, and its inhibition has been shown to suppress cancer cell growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Feng2022Targeting).

## Interactions
ALDH1B1 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. Computational modeling and docking studies suggest that ALDH1B1 can form heterotetramers with ALDH2, including its variant ALDH2*2. This interaction is energetically favorable and involves numerous hydrogen bonds at the monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interfaces. The binding of ALDH2*2 to ALDH1B1 may repress ALDH1B1's catalytic activity, similar to its effect on ALDH2 activity (Jackson2013Comparative).

In the context of thyroid cancer, ALDH1B1 interacts with transcription factors such as CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and membrane-bound proteins like mucin 1 (MUC1). These interactions suggest that changes in ALDH1B1 expression can affect multiple protein expressions and intracellular signaling pathways (Cui2022Transcriptional).

In colorectal cancer, ALDH1B1 is linked to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Its expression is associated with increased β-catenin levels in adenomas, and knockdown of ALDH1B1 results in down-regulation of this pathway, indicating its role in promoting colon carcinogenesis (Golla2020Interplay).
