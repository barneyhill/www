# ADAMTS15

## Overview
ADAMTS15 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 15, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role as secreted, matrix-associated enzymes involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent). The ADAMTS15 protein is a metalloproteinase, which means it contains a metalloproteinase domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity, particularly in the cleavage of ECM components such as proteoglycans (PORTER2005The). It is implicated in various physiological processes, including tissue organization, vascular homeostasis, and cell migration, and has been identified as having potential tumor-suppressing roles in certain cancers (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent; Wagstaff2010ADAMTS15). The protein's structure, which includes thrombospondin type 1 repeats, allows it to interact with the ECM and modulate cell-ECM interactions, contributing to its functional roles in both normal physiology and disease contexts (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent).

## Structure
ADAMTS15 is a member of the ADAMTS family of secreted, matrix-associated enzymes characterized by a complex domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, a pro-region, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a central thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR), a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer region, followed by a variable number of additional TSRs (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent; Takeda2016ADAM). The metalloproteinase domain contains a zinc-binding motif, crucial for its catalytic activity, and is involved in the cleavage of extracellular matrix proteoglycans (PORTER2005The). 

ADAMTS15 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-terminal processing by signal peptidase and removal of the pro-domain, which is important for enzyme latency and correct protein folding (PORTER2005The). The protein is associated with the extracellular matrix via heparin sulfate proteoglycans and can be inhibited by Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent). 

The protein's structure allows it to bind to the extracellular matrix, a feature often mediated through the TSRs and the spacer region (PORTER2005The). ADAMTS15 has been identified as having tumor-suppressing roles, with higher expression correlating with a good prognosis in breast cancer (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent).

## Function
ADAMTS15 is a member of the ADAMTS family of secreted, matrix-associated enzymes that play a crucial role in tissue organization and vascular homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, which are essential for maintaining normal tissue architecture and preventing excessive cell migration (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent). ADAMTS15 affects cell migration by modulating cell-ECM interactions, likely involving syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that cooperates with integrins for cell adhesion (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent).

The protein's antiangiogenic action requires its catalytic functionality, and its effects on metastasis are tissue niche-dependent (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent). ADAMTS15 is also implicated in the processing of procollagen molecules and cleaving extracellular matrix proteoglycans, contributing to the structural integrity of tissues (Wagstaff2010ADAMTS15). The presence of thrombospondin-1 domains in ADAMTS15 may contribute to its ability to inhibit pathways associated with tumor progression (Viloria2009Genetic).

In healthy cells, ADAMTS15 may contribute to maintaining normal tissue architecture and preventing excessive cell migration, which is crucial for preventing tumor spread (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent). Its ability to bind heparin and its association with the ECM suggest it plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and regulating cell movement (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent).

## Clinical Significance
ADAMTS15 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, higher expression levels of ADAMTS15 are associated with increased relapse-free survival, suggesting a tumor suppressive role. Overexpression of ADAMTS15 in breast cancer cell lines reduces cell migration, indicating its potential to modulate interactions between carcinoma cells and their environment (Kumar2012Emerging; Wagstaff2010ADAMTS15). In prostate cancer, ADAMTS15 expression is down-regulated, and its levels decrease further upon TGF-β stimulation, which correlates with increased levels of versican, a marker of poor prognosis (Kumar2012Emerging).

In colorectal cancer, ADAMTS15 is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Mutations such as G849fs affect its protein localization and function, impacting clonogenicity and invasiveness. Overexpression of ADAMTS15 reduces colony formation and invasion, while knockdown increases these traits. The G849fs mutation diminishes these effects, highlighting the importance of terminal TSRs in its anti-tumor function (Kumar2012Emerging). ADAMTS15 expression is higher in normal tissues and inversely correlates with colorectal tumor grade, suggesting its role as a differentiation marker (Kumar2012Emerging). There is no evidence of epigenetic silencing of ADAMTS15 in tumors, but it is located in a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in colorectal cancers (Kumar2012Emerging).

## Interactions
ADAMTS15 interacts with various proteins, influencing cell migration and extracellular matrix remodeling. It modulates cell migration in breast cancer cells through interactions with syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan involved in cell adhesion and migration. Although direct binding between ADAMTS15 and syndecan-4 has not been confirmed, ADAMTS15 may transiently interact with syndecan-4 or affect other molecules involved in its shedding, leading to syndecan-4 accumulation on the cell surface. This interaction is suggested to modulate the activation of PKCa, a downstream effector of syndecan-4 (Kelwick2014Metalloproteinase‐dependent).

ADAMTS15 also plays a role in myoblast fusion by processing versican, a component of the pericellular matrix. It acts as a versican-degrading proteinase, facilitating myoblast fusion and compensating for reduced ADAMTS5 activity. This function highlights its involvement in the degradation of versican, which is crucial for myoblast fusion into multinucleated myotubes (Stupka2013Versican).

These interactions underscore the role of ADAMTS15 in modulating cell-ECM interactions and influencing cellular processes such as migration and fusion, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts.
