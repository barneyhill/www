# TMCO6

## Overview
The TMCO6 gene encodes the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 6 protein, which is characterized by its structural features, including transmembrane domains and coiled-coil regions. These structural motifs suggest that TMCO6 may play a role in cellular processes that involve membrane dynamics or protein-protein interactions. While the precise biological function of the TMCO6 protein remains to be fully elucidated, its structural characteristics imply potential involvement in signaling pathways or cellular structural integrity. Further research is needed to clarify its specific roles and interactions within the cell.
