# PLCB1

## Overview
Phospholipase C beta 1 (PLCB1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase C beta 1, a critical component in cellular signal transduction pathways. This enzyme belongs to the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C family and is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate the secondary messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which play pivotal roles in regulating intracellular calcium levels and various cellular processes (Cocco2015Phosphoinositidespecific; Luo2016Upregulated). PLCB1 is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant roles in the brain, where it influences cortical development and synaptic plasticity, and in the immune system, where it affects cell differentiation and activation (Cocco2015Phosphoinositidespecific; Ratti2017Nuclear). Mutations in the PLCB1 gene are linked to neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, and have been implicated in mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Desprairies2020Three; Lo2012Phosphoinositidespecific).

## Structure
Phospholipase C beta 1 (PLCB1) is a signaling enzyme characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in membrane interactions and activation by Gβγ subunits (Kanemaru2023Activation). It also features EF-hand motifs, a catalytic core, and a C2 domain, which are common among PLC isozymes and contribute to its enzymatic activity and interactions with membranes (Kanemaru2023Activation).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of PLCB1 is particularly significant, as it plays a role in binding to the catalytic core and regulating enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in interactions with Gαq subunits and contains nuclear localization and export signals, phosphorylation sites, and a cleavage site for calpain (Scarlata2019The; Kanemaru2023Activation). The CTD also influences the curvature of the plasma membrane, facilitating efficient cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Kanemaru2023Activation).

PLCB1 exists in two splice variants, PLCβ1a and PLCβ1b, which differ in their C-terminal sequences and intracellular localization. PLCβ1a contains a nuclear export sequence, allowing cytoplasmic localization, while PLCβ1b is primarily nuclear (Kanemaru2023Activation). These structural features and variants enable PLCB1 to participate in diverse cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
Phospholipase C beta 1 (PLCB1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in intracellular signal transduction by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These secondary messengers are essential for various cellular functions, including the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, which influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression (Cocco2015Phosphoinositidespecific; Luo2016Upregulated).

PLCB1 is widely expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it is involved in cortical development and synaptic plasticity. It regulates signaling pathways mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, contributing to cognitive functions and neuronal signaling (Cocco2015Phosphoinositidespecific; Lo2012Phosphoinositidespecific). In the nucleus, PLCB1 is involved in nuclear signaling pathways, where it associates with other signaling molecules and contributes to processes such as chromatin remodeling and RNA splicing (Ratti2017Nuclear).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, PLCB1 is involved in the differentiation and activation of immune cells, affecting both the innate and adaptive immune systems (Cocco2015Phosphoinositidespecific). It also plays a role in myogenic and adipogenic differentiation, influencing cell cycle regulation and the expression of cyclins such as Cyclin D3 (Ratti2017Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLCB1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EE). Patients with PLCB1-related EE often exhibit severe to profound intellectual disability, epileptic spasms, developmental arrest or regression, and drug-resistant epilepsy. The phenotypic spectrum includes infantile spasms, profound intellectual disability, truncal hypotonia, and sometimes microcephaly (Desprairies2020Three; Ngoh2014Severe). 

Biallelic mutations in PLCB1 can lead to early onset epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by fever-induced status epilepticus, developmental regression, and multiple seizure types. These mutations result in a narrow phenotypic spectrum that does not define a recognizable clinical entity (Schoonjans2016PLCB1). 

In addition to epilepsy, PLCB1 has been implicated in mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Deletions of the PLCB1 gene have been observed in patients with these conditions, suggesting a potential role in their pathogenesis (Lo2012Phosphoinositidespecific). 

Alterations in PLCB1 expression are also linked to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), where downregulation of circ-PRKCI, which regulates PLCB1, affects cell migration and proliferation, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Zhou2018Downregulation).

## Interactions
Phospholipase C beta 1 (PLCB1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. PLCB1 interacts with lamin B1, a protein associated with the nuclear membrane and chromatin, particularly during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This interaction is significant for lamin B1 phosphorylation, which is essential for cell cycle progression (Fiume2008Involvement). PLCB1 also interacts with protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, such as PKCα and PKCβI, which are recruited to the nucleus to facilitate lamin B1 phosphorylation (Fiume2008Involvement).

In Friend erythroleukemia cells, PLCB1 interacts with the splicing factor SRp20, leading to its down-regulation. This interaction occurs in nuclear speckles, which are involved in splicing events, suggesting a role for PLCB1 in nuclear signaling and cell cycle regulation (Bavelloni2006Proteomicbased).

In cardiomyocytes, the PLCβ1b isoform specifically interacts with the scaffolding protein Shank3 at the cardiac sarcolemma. This interaction is mediated by the unique C-terminal sequence of PLCβ1b and is crucial for its activation and signaling in response to Gq-coupled receptor activation (Grubb2010Phospholipase).
