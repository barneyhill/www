# REG1A

## Overview
The REG1A gene encodes the protein regenerating family member 1 alpha (Reg1α), which is a member of the regenerating islet-derived protein family. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration, particularly within the pancreas and other tissues. Reg1α is categorized as a secretory protein, functioning predominantly in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it plays a crucial role in tissue repair and inflammation modulation. It is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, influencing pathways such as JAK/STAT3 and GSK-3β/β-catenin, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting tissue regeneration (Parikh2012Regenerating; Varilh2020Reg1α; Mao2021Protective). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as calpain-2 and its involvement in signaling pathways like ERK and Akt, further underscore its significance in physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and neural development (HARA2015Effect; Lebart2022Reg1α).

## Function
REG1A, a member of the regenerating islet-derived protein family, plays a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, influencing cellular growth and differentiation processes. In healthy human cells, REG1A is involved in the regeneration of pancreatic islet cells and is implicated in various physiological processes, including inflammation and tissue repair (Parikh2012Regenerating).

REG1A is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. It modulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-8, thereby playing a protective role in inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This modulation is mediated through the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, where cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-22 activate REG1A transcription, promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells (Mao2021Protective).

In the context of neural development, REG1A is involved in the differentiation and migration of neural precursor cells. It interacts with the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, enhancing neuritic outgrowth and facilitating neural precursor cell differentiation (Varilh2020Reg1α). These molecular activities underscore REG1A's crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting tissue regeneration.

## Clinical Significance
The REG1A gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), REG1A is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and adenomas compared to normal colorectal tissues. Its elevated expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and is a significant predictor of disease-free survival in CRC patients (Astrosini2008REG1A). 

In the context of diabetes, particularly HNF1A-MODY and type 1 diabetes mellitus, elevated serum levels of REG1A, also known as pancreatic stone protein (PSP)/reg1A, indicate increased beta-cell apoptosis. This suggests its potential as a non-invasive marker for beta-cell apoptosis, aiding in early diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic approaches (Bacon2012Serum).

REG1A is also associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) susceptibility. A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the REG1A gene, 2922C/T, has been linked to an increased risk of NPC in a Southern Chinese population, highlighting its potential as a genetic marker for NPC susceptibility (Xing2019Association).

In oral facial clefts (OFC), REG1A is identified as a regulator of cell motility and adhesion, with its overexpression linked to increased cell motility and poor prognosis in certain cancers. Inhibition of REG1A can rescue aberrant epithelial movement in OFC mutants, suggesting its role in modulating cell migration (Pereira2024Ecadherin).

## Interactions
REG1A, also known as regenerating islet-derived 1 alpha, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the protein calpain-2, a calcium-activated protease. REG1A is identified as a substrate for calpain-2, which cleaves REG1A at a specific site between Gln 4 and Thr 5. This interaction is modulated by the glycosylation status of REG1A, as glycosylation at Thr 5 can prevent cleavage by calpain-2. This suggests that glycosylation plays a crucial role in regulating the interaction and subsequent functional outcomes of REG1A in cellular environments (Lebart2022Reg1α).

REG1A is also implicated in signaling pathways related to angiogenesis and cancer progression. In gastric cancer tissues, REG1A interacts with endothelial cells, promoting cell growth and anti-apoptosis through the ERK and Akt signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in the context of tumor angiogenesis, as it enhances the expression of phosphorylated ERK and Akt, contributing to increased microvessel density in cancerous tissues (HARA2015Effect).
