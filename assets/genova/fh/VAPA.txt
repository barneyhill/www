# VAPA

## Overview
The VAPA gene encodes the VAMP-associated protein A, a type II integral membrane protein predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is characterized by its major sperm protein (MSP) domain, which facilitates interactions with proteins containing the FFAT motif, playing a crucial role in lipid transport and membrane contact site formation (Kamemura2019Multiple; Prosser2008FFAT). VAPA is involved in the regulation of ER-to-Golgi transport and the formation of ER/plasma membrane junctions, impacting processes such as lipid metabolism and neuronal signaling (Lev2008The; Johnson2018Kv2). The protein's ability to form homo- or hetero-dimers and its interactions with various proteins, including viral proteins, underscore its versatility and importance in cellular homeostasis (Prosser2008FFAT; Murphy2016VAP). VAPA's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenic processes, further emphasizing its role in human health and disease (Lohoff2008Association; Yoon2019Oncogenic).

## Structure
The VAPA protein, also known as VAMP-associated protein A, is a type II integral membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is characterized by an N-terminal major sperm protein (MSP) domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) (Kamemura2019Multiple; Prosser2008FFAT). The MSP domain, which consists of seven immunoglobulin-like β-sheets, is crucial for interactions with proteins containing the FFAT motif, facilitating the formation of membrane contact sites (James2021The; Kors2022VAP). 

The coiled-coil domain is important for dimerization, allowing VAPA to form homo- or hetero-dimers with other VAP family members, such as VAPB (James2021The; Prosser2008FFAT). The TMD anchors VAPA to the ER membrane, playing a role in its function as a scaffold for lipid transfer and organelle tethering (Kamemura2019Multiple). 

VAPA can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its interactions with FFAT motif-containing proteins (Kors2022VAP). The VAP family includes splice variants, such as VAPC, which lacks the coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (James2021The).

## Function
The VAPA gene encodes a type II membrane protein that is primarily localized to the early secretory pathway, where it colocalizes with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers and microtubules. VAPA is involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of membrane proteins, where it inhibits this transport by decreasing the segregation of membrane cargo into ER vesicles and by inhibiting the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins. This is likely due to its stable association with microtubules, which helps anchor the ER but can also create immobile obstacles that impede the movement of proteins to ER exit sites (Prosser2008FFAT).

VAPA interacts with proteins containing the FFAT motif, which are involved in lipid-binding, sensing, or transport. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of lipid transport and metabolism, as well as membrane trafficking (Lev2008The). VAPA also plays a role in forming endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions, which are important for the clustering of Kv2 potassium channels on the neuronal surface. This interaction is facilitated by FFAT motifs and is regulated by neuronal activity and stress (Johnson2018Kv2).

VAPA is broadly expressed, suggesting it performs a function required by all cells, and it interacts with a number of proteins involved in the regulation of sterol and lipid biosynthesis or trafficking (Prosser2008FFAT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VAPA gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and oncogenic conditions. In the context of bipolar disorder (BPD), polymorphisms in the VAPA gene, particularly in the 3' UTR region, have been associated with the disorder. These genetic variations may influence post-transcriptional regulation and neurotransmission, potentially contributing to the clinical manifestations of depression and mania observed in BPD patients (Lohoff2008Association).

In oncology, the VAPA gene is part of a novel fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, identified in lung adenocarcinoma. This fusion gene has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and promote tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its role as an oncogenic driver in lung cancer. The VAPA-Rab31 fusion gene increases the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and activates CREB, providing a survival advantage to cancer cells (Yoon2019Oncogenic).

While the VAPA gene itself is not directly linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), its close relation to VAPB, which is associated with ALS, suggests that disruptions in VAPA interactions could potentially contribute to similar neurodegenerative processes (Kamemura2019Multiple).

## Interactions
VAPA (VAMP-associated protein A) is a versatile protein that interacts with a wide range of other proteins, primarily through its N-terminal major sperm protein (MSP) domain. This domain contains conserved binding sites that facilitate interactions with proteins possessing FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) motifs, which are crucial for targeting proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear membrane (James2021The; Murphy2016VAP). VAPA binds to proteins such as oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and ceramide transfer protein (CERT), playing significant roles in lipid transport and homeostasis (de2021Nanoscale).

VAPA also interacts with viral proteins, such as the hepatitis C virus proteins NS5A and NS5B, through its MSP domain (Murphy2016VAP). In the context of norovirus replication, VAPA interacts with the viral protein NS1/2, which mimics host FFAT motifs to hijack host processes (McCune2017Noroviruses).

In neurons, VAPA forms ER/plasma membrane junctions by interacting with Kv2 potassium channels, specifically Kv2.1, through a noncanonical FFAT motif. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects the clustering of Kv2 channels and ER remodeling (Johnson2018Kv2).
