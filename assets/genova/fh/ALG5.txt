# ALG5

## Overview
ALG5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase, which is integral to the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is responsible for the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to dolichyl-phosphate, a critical step in the synthesis of glycoproteins. The activity of ALG5 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the formation of dolichyl-phosphate-glucose, a precursor necessary for assembling lipid-linked oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides are essential for proper protein folding and stability, impacting various cellular functions such as cell communication and immune responses (Jiang2021In; Gücüm2020The). Mutations in the ALG5 gene have been linked to autosomal dominant fibrocystic kidney disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Lemoine2021Mutations). The gene's role in glycosylation underscores its importance in maintaining protein integrity and cellular homeostasis (Akiyoshi2019Omics‐based).

## Function
ALG5, also known as dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a vital process for protein folding and stability in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to dolichyl-phosphate, resulting in the formation of dolichyl-phosphate-glucose. This reaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, which is necessary for glycoprotein synthesis (Jiang2021In).

The proper function of ALG5 is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring protein quality control. By contributing to the supply of glycan building blocks, ALG5 supports the glycosylation processes that are essential for the correct folding and function of proteins (Gücüm2020The). This enzyme's activity is integral to the broader glycosylation pathway, which impacts various cellular functions and organismal outcomes, including cell communication, protein interactions, and immune responses (Akiyoshi2019Omics‐based). The role of ALG5 in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of proteins within the cell.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG5 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant fibrocystic kidney disease, a condition characterized by fibrocystic changes in the kidneys that can impair kidney function (Lemoine2021Mutations). The specific mechanisms by which ALG5 mutations lead to this disease are not detailed in the available literature, but the association suggests a significant clinical impact.

In Drosophila, the ortholog of ALG5, known as wollknäuel (wol), plays a crucial role in epidermal differentiation during late embryogenesis. Mutations in wol result in hypoglucosylation, which affects protein glycosylation and secretion, leading to developmental defects (Shaik2011The). Although these findings are in Drosophila, they provide insights into the potential consequences of ALG5 dysfunction in humans, particularly in processes involving protein glycosylation.

While the direct link between ALG5 mutations and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) in humans is not explicitly mentioned, the role of ALG5 in glycosylation suggests that alterations in its function could contribute to such disorders, which are characterized by defective extracellular matrices and various developmental abnormalities (Shaik2011The).
