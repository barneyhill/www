# FGFR3

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase protein, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The FGFR3 protein is a transmembrane receptor characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Ornitz1992Ligand; Keegan1991Isolation). This receptor is primarily involved in skeletal development, where it regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, crucial for cartilage formation and bone growth (Narayana2015FGFR3). FGFR3 is activated upon binding to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), leading to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, which subsequently triggers several downstream signaling pathways, including MAP kinase, STAT, and PI3K/AKT (Lemmon2010Cell). Mutations in the FGFR3 gene are linked to various skeletal dysplasia syndromes and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Hafner2006FGFR3; Helsten2015Fibroblast).

## Structure
FGFR3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of FGFR3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a protein of approximately 801 to 806 amino acids, depending on the splice variant (Ornitz1992Ligand; Keegan1991Isolation). The secondary structure includes three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Ornitz1992Ligand; Keegan1991Isolation). 

The tertiary structure of FGFR3 involves the three-dimensional conformation of these domains, which is crucial for its function as a receptor. The quaternary structure is characterized by dimerization upon ligand binding, which is essential for signal transduction (Reddy2014Primary). FGFR3 contains a signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain, with the kinase domain split by a 14-amino acid insert sequence (Keegan1991Isolation).

Post-translational modifications of FGFR3 include glycosylation, with seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain, and phosphorylation, which is typical for tyrosine kinase receptors (Keegan1991Isolation). FGFR3 also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as IIIb and IIIc, which differ in their ligand binding properties and tissue expression (Chellaiah1994Fibroblast). These splice variants contribute to the receptor's specificity and functional diversity.

## Function
FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is primarily involved in skeletal development, particularly in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, which are essential for cartilage formation and bone growth (L’Hôte2005Cell; Narayana2015FGFR3). FGFR3 is activated by binding to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), leading to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, which triggers downstream signaling pathways such as MAP kinase, STAT, and PI3K/AKT (L’Hôte2005Cell; Lemmon2010Cell).

In healthy human cells, FGFR3 functions as a negative regulator of bone growth, ensuring that bones do not grow excessively. This regulation is achieved by controlling the proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes, thereby influencing the volume of cartilage template produced (L’Hôte2005Cell; Narayana2015FGFR3). FGFR3 is active in the cell membrane, where it interacts with extracellular ligands to initiate intracellular signaling (Lemmon2010Cell). The receptor's activity is tightly regulated through mechanisms such as ubiquitination, which targets it for degradation, thus controlling the duration and intensity of its signaling (Narayana2015FGFR3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGFR3 gene are associated with a range of skeletal dysplasia syndromes, including achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH), thanatophoric dysplasia (TD), and severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN) syndrome. These conditions are primarily caused by germline mutations that lead to increased receptor activation, often through ligand-independent mechanisms (Hafner2006FGFR3; PassosBueno1999Clinical). The G382R mutation is notably present in about 97% of ACH cases, making it the most common cause of dwarfism (Hafner2006FGFR3).

FGFR3 mutations are also implicated in various cancers, such as bladder carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and urothelial carcinoma. These mutations often mirror those found in skeletal dysplasia syndromes and contribute to cancer progression through abnormal cell signaling (van2002Novel; Helsten2015Fibroblast). In benign skin tumors, such as seborrheic keratoses and epidermal nevi, FGFR3 mutations like R248C and S249C are common and may result from postzygotic mutations leading to mosaicism (Blomberg2010&lt; FGFR3&lt; Hafner2006Mosaicism; i&gt). These mutations can lead to increased proliferation and survival of keratinocytes, contributing to tumor development (Hafner2006FGFR3).

## Interactions
FGFR3 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It forms complexes with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), specifically the p85α and p85β isoforms, in an activation-dependent manner. This interaction is independent of the adaptor protein Gab1 and is crucial for the regulation of the ERK pathway in multiple myeloma cells (Salazar2009A). FGFR3 also interacts with the GRB2-Sos complex via phosphorylated proteins such as 80K-H and Shc, facilitating the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (Kanai1997Signal).

FGFR3 is involved in the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2), which aids in the regulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. It also recruits GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) to phosphorylated FRS2, activating PI3K-AKT signaling (Ferguson2021Fibroblast). FGFR3 interacts with intestinal cell kinase (ICK), influencing primary cilium length and function. This interaction involves specific motifs within FGFR3, such as the 751 VLTVTSTDEY 760 motif, and is essential for ICK binding and phosphorylation (Kunova2019Fibroblast).

Proteomic analyses have identified FGFR3 interactions with various proteins, including adapter protein STAM1, transcriptional regulator SHOX2, and serine/threonine kinases ICK, MAK, and CCRK, highlighting its role in complex signaling networks (Balek2018Proteomic).
