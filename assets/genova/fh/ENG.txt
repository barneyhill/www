# ENG

## Overview
The ENG gene encodes endoglin, a homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in vascular biology. Endoglin is predominantly expressed on endothelial cells and functions as a co-receptor in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, particularly influencing the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling axis. It is involved in critical processes such as endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis, which are essential for vascular remodeling and homeostasis (Abdalla2005Hereditary; Letteboer2015Genetic). The protein's structure includes a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail, with the extracellular domain being highly glycosylated and featuring a multimodular structure (Mallet2014Functional; RuizLlorente2021Generation). Mutations in the ENG gene are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a vascular disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations, highlighting its clinical significance (McDonald2015Hereditary; RichardsYutz2010Update).

## Structure
Endoglin (ENG) is a homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein primarily expressed on endothelial cells. The protein forms a 180-kDa disulfide-linked homodimer, with each monomer consisting of a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Mallet2014Functional; RuizLlorente2021Generation). The extracellular domain is highly glycosylated and features a multimodular structure, including an orphan domain and two zona pellucida (ZP) domains, ZP-N and ZP-C (Mallet2014Functional). The ZP domain contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, which is crucial for integrin binding and cell adhesion (Rossi2017Human).

Endoglin's extracellular domain directly binds bone morphogenetic proteins BMP9 and BMP10 with high affinity, but not transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Mallet2014Functional). The protein is involved in the TGF-β receptor complex, although it lacks intrinsic kinase activity (Mallet2014Functional). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is essential for its proper localization and function (Mallet2014Functional).

Alternative splicing of the ENG gene results in different isoforms, which may influence its role in angiogenesis and cardiovascular development (RuizLlorente2021Generation). The soluble form of endoglin (sEng) can be generated by metalloproteases acting on the ectodomain, and it is implicated in various pathologies (RuizLlorente2021Generation).

## Function
Endoglin (ENG) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a co-receptor for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) isoforms, specifically TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, and is predominantly expressed on vascular endothelial cells. It plays a crucial role in the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways, which are essential for maintaining vascular integrity and function (Abdalla2005Hereditary; Letteboer2015Genetic). Endoglin interacts with multiple receptor complexes, including ALK-1 and ALK-5, influencing endothelial cell behavior by potentiating ALK-1/Smad1 dependent signaling and inhibiting the ALK-5/Smad3 pathway (Abdalla2005Hereditary). This dual role is critical for regulating endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis, which are vital for vascular remodeling and homeostasis (RuizLlorente2017Endoglin).

In healthy cells, endoglin is involved in preventing abnormal vascular remodeling, which can lead to capillary breakdown and direct shunting of arterioles into venules, thereby maintaining the integrity of blood vessels (Letteboer2015Genetic). It is also crucial for the recruitment and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, which are necessary for forming the vascular smooth muscle cell layer around major vessels (Goumans2017Bone). These functions underscore endoglin's importance in vascular development and the prevention of vascular pathologies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ENG gene are primarily associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), specifically the HHT1 variant. HHT is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in various organs, including the lungs, brain, and liver. These mutations lead to insufficient production of the endoglin protein, resulting in abnormal angiogenesis and vascular lesions (McDonald2015Hereditary; RuizLlorente2017Endoglin; RichardsYutz2010Update). 

ENG mutations are linked to a higher frequency of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (pAVMs) compared to mutations in other related genes, such as ACVRL1. Individuals with ENG mutations often exhibit more severe clinical manifestations, including a higher HHT Severity Score and increased need for interventional procedures to manage pAVMs (Mu2018Characterization). 

Alterations in the expression of endoglin are also implicated in other conditions, such as preeclampsia, cancer progression, and cardiovascular diseases, due to their impact on normal vascular function and integrity (RuizLlorente2017Endoglin). These alterations can exacerbate the effects of haploinsufficiency, further contributing to the pathogenesis of HHT and related vascular abnormalities (RuizLlorente2017Endoglin).

## Interactions
Endoglin (ENG) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that interacts with several proteins, primarily within the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. It functions as a co-receptor and forms complexes with TGF-β type I receptors, such as ALK1 and ALK5, and a TGF-β type II receptor, facilitating the binding of bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) and leading to the phosphorylation of Smad transcription factors (Rossi2019Endoglin). ENG enhances TGF-β/ALK1 signaling and can interfere with TGF-β/ALK-5 signaling, suggesting its role in modulating endothelial responses to TGF-β (Blanco2005Interaction).

ENG also interacts with integrins, such as αIIbβ3 on platelets and α5β1 on leukocytes, through its RGD motif, which is crucial for platelet adhesion and leukocyte trafficking (Rossi2017Human; Rossi2019Endoglin). This interaction is significant for platelet-endothelium interactions, particularly under inflammatory conditions (Rossi2017Human).

In endothelial cells, ENG associates with proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, including VE-cadherin and p21-activated kinase (PAK-1), which are important for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and cytoskeletal remodeling (Rossi2019Endoglin). ENG-deficient endothelial cells exhibit increased permeability and impaired TGF-β signaling, highlighting its role in vascular stability (Jerkic2015Increased).
