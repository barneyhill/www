# MECOM

## Overview
The MECOM gene, also known as the MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, encodes a transcription factor that is pivotal in various cellular processes, particularly in hematopoiesis and oncogenesis. The protein products of MECOM, including the MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, are characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. These proteins are involved in the regulation of endothelial cell identity and function, playing a crucial role in angiogenesis and maintaining endothelial cell phenotypes (Lv2023Epigenetic). MECOM's activity is marked by its interactions with various proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes, influencing gene expression and contributing to its role in leukemogenesis and other cancer-related processes (BardChapeau2013EVI1; Ivanochko2018Direct). Mutations and alterations in MECOM expression are associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, including myeloid malignancies and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Germeshausen2018MECOMassociated; Tang2019Deciphering).

## Structure
The MECOM gene encodes a transcriptional regulator with multiple isoforms, including EVI1, MDS1-EVI1, and EVI1-Δ324, each with distinct roles in cellular processes. The protein structure of MECOM features zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Maicas2017The; Kiehlmeier2021Identification). These zinc fingers are part of the protein's primary structure and contribute to its ability to interact with DNA and other proteins.

The EVI1 isoform, in particular, contains a proline-rich repressor domain and a small acidic domain, which are involved in its regulatory functions (Maicas2017The). The presence of these domains suggests a complex tertiary structure that facilitates interactions with co-repressors and coactivators, influencing gene expression (Valipour2013Polymorphic).

MECOM's splice variant isoforms, such as EVI1-145kDa and MDS1-EVI1, exhibit different biological activities, with EVI1-145kDa enhancing hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and MDS1-EVI1 acting as a repressor (Maicas2017The). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, may further modulate MECOM's activity and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The structural diversity of MECOM isoforms underscores their varied roles in hematopoiesis and oncogenesis.

## Function
The MECOM gene, also known as MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating endothelial cell (EC) identity and function. MECOM is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes essential for EC differentiation, angiogenesis, and maintaining EC phenotypes. It binds to enhancers and forms chromatin loops to activate target genes, such as those in the VEGF signaling pathway, which is vital for angiogenesis and EC differentiation (Lv2023Epigenetic).

In healthy human cells, MECOM is essential for the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into ECs, as well as for maintaining EC functions, including tube formation, cell migration, and nitric oxide production (Lv2023Epigenetic). MECOM's role extends to the regulation of arteriovenous identity, where it helps maintain arterial EC identity by suppressing the expression of non-arterial markers (McCracken2022Mapping).

MECOM is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcription by binding to DNA, impacting cell proliferation and survival. Its activity is marked by specific epigenetic signatures, such as broad H3K4me3 and super-enhancers, which are indicative of its role in cell identity (Lv2023Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MECOM gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting hematopoiesis and skeletal development. MECOM mutations can lead to radioulnar synostosis with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (RUSAT), a condition characterized by congenital fusion of the radius and ulna and bone marrow failure (Niihori2015Mutations). These mutations often occur in the C-terminal zinc finger domain of the EVI1 protein, resulting in transcriptional dysregulation (Germeshausen2018MECOMassociated).

MECOM-associated syndromes exhibit a broad phenotypic spectrum, including congenital thrombocytopenia, B-cell deficiency, renal and cardiac malformations, and sensorineural deafness (Lozano2023Expanded; Germeshausen2018MECOMassociated). The gene's involvement in myeloid malignancies is significant, with rearrangements leading to overexpression or fusion transcripts, contributing to poor prognosis in conditions like acute myeloid leukemia (Ripperger2017MDS1; Tang2019Deciphering).

Alterations in MECOM expression are linked to both overexpression in cancers, which correlates with poor outcomes, and reduced expression in bone marrow failure syndromes (Lozano2023Expanded). These genetic and expression changes underscore MECOM's critical role in various hematological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
The MECOM gene encodes a transcription factor that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and oncogenesis. MECOM interacts with polycomb group (PcG) proteins, recruiting histone methyltransferases like EZH2 to the PTEN promoter, leading to repressive chromatin modifications and activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway (Yoshimi2011Evi1). It also interacts with CtBP1 and CtBP2, which are involved in transcriptional repression (BardChapeau2013EVI1; Iida2024MECOM).

MECOM forms complexes with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and DNA repair, such as SMAD3, SMARCA4, EHMT2, and GCN5L2 (BardChapeau2013EVI1). It also interacts with the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex, particularly through its association with RBBP4 (Ivanochko2018Direct). The protein is phosphorylated by CK2, which modulates its DNA-binding activity and oncogenic potential (BardChapeau2013EVI1).

MECOM's interaction with SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase, facilitates transcription repression by methylating histone H3 at lysine 9 (Cattaneo2008EVI1). These interactions highlight MECOM's role in regulating gene expression and its involvement in leukemogenesis and other cancer-related processes.
