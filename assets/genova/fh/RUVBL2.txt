# RUVBL2

## Overview
RUVBL2 is a gene that encodes the protein RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2, which is a member of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. This protein is characterized by its ATPase activity and is involved in a variety of essential cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and RNA processing. RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2 forms part of several multiprotein complexes, such as the INO80 and TIP60 complexes, which are crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. It also plays a role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and interacts with oncogenic pathways, notably those involving c-Myc. The protein's structure includes a hexameric ring with a central channel, facilitating its function in binding and remodeling nucleic acids. RUVBL2's involvement in cancer biology, particularly its overexpression in various cancers, highlights its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yan2019Multilevel; Silva2018Xray; Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2).

## Structure
RUVBL2, also known as RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2, is a protein that forms a hexameric ring structure, which is crucial for its function in various cellular processes. The protein consists of several domains, including a Rossman-like αβα fold (domain I), an all-α subdomain (domain III), and a mobile domain II, which is unique to the RuvB-like family and plays a significant role in protein-protein interactions and ATPase activity regulation (Silva2018Xray). The hexameric structure of RUVBL2 is characterized by a central channel capable of binding single-stranded DNA, with a surface charge distribution that is more positive in the inner channel and ATPase core compared to its homolog RUVBL1 (Silva2018Xray).

Domain II is particularly flexible and can adopt various conformations, which may complicate crystallization efforts. This domain is involved in the assembly and stability of the protein's oligomeric forms, including hexamers and dodecamers (Niewiarowski2010Oligomeric; Silva2018Xray). The protein's ATPase activity is regulated by nucleotide binding, which induces structural rearrangements, particularly in domain II, facilitating its mechanical action (Silva2018Xray). RUVBL2 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as methylation at K67, which can affect its function under certain conditions like hypoxia (Silva2018Xray).

## Function
RUVBL2, also known as RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2, is a protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is a component of large multi-protein complexes involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and RNA processing. RUVBL2 is part of the INO80 and TIP60 complexes, which are essential for chromatin remodeling activities such as nucleosome sliding and histone exchange, contributing to gene regulation and maintaining genomic stability (Niewiarowski2010Oligomeric; Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2).

RUVBL2 functions as an ATPase, providing the energy required for these processes. Its ATPase activity is crucial for the formation and function of complexes like INO80, although it is not always necessary for other complexes such as TIP60 (Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2). The protein is also involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), where it regulates the phosphorylation of Upf1, a key step in the NMD pathway (Izumi2010AAA+).

RUVBL2 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, although its cytoplasmic functions are less understood. It interacts with various transcription factors and is implicated in oncogenic pathways, particularly those involving c-Myc (Gorynia2011RuvBL1; Izumi2010AAA+).

## Clinical Significance
RUVBL2, also known as RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2, plays a significant role in cancer biology due to its involvement in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. Alterations in RUVBL2 expression are linked to various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes malignant phenotypes through pathways such as HSP90-CDC37, AKT, and ERK. High RUVBL2 expression in HCC is associated with poor differentiation and shorter recurrence-free survival, with its overexpression attributed to promoter hypomethylation, copy number gain, and MYC amplification (Yan2019Multilevel).

In other cancers, RUVBL2 is overexpressed in liver, colorectal, B-cell lymphoma, and thymoma, and is particularly abundant in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including glioma, sarcoma, and lung adenocarcinoma (Su2022A; Wang2022The). RUVBL2's role as a transcriptional coactivator involves interactions with oncogenes like c-Myc and Ccnd1, contributing to cancer progression (Wang2022The).

Mutations in RUVBL2 can also impact immune function, as seen in a genetic screen identifying a mutation that affects humoral immunity and lymphocyte development (Arnold2012A). These findings underscore RUVBL2's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RUVBL2, also known as RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions and is a component of several multiprotein complexes. It forms a hetero-hexameric complex with RUVBL1, which acts as a scaffold for interactions with other proteins, referred to as 'clients' (Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2). This complex is part of the R2TP cochaperone complex, which includes RPAP3 and PIH1D1, and is involved in the assembly and maturation of complexes such as snoRNPs, RNA polymerase II, and PIKK family kinases (Serna2021CryoEM; Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2).

RUVBL2 interacts with ZNHIT2, a zinc-finger protein, which mediates its association with the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and regulation of the U5 snRNP, affecting its protein composition and splicing activity (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). RUVBL2 also interacts with PRPF8, a component of the U5 snRNP, forming part of a network of interactions that includes other proteins like AAR2 and ECD (Serna2021CryoEM).

RUVBL2's interactions extend to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, where it is part of complexes such as INO80 and TIP60, and interacts with oncogenic factors like c-Myc (Gorynia2011Structural). These interactions highlight RUVBL2's involvement in diverse cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription regulation.
