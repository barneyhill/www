# PLCD3

## Overview
PLCD3 is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipase C delta 3, a member of the phospholipase C (PLC) family, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular signal transduction. The protein is categorized as an enzyme involved in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, where it hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate second messengers that are crucial for various cellular processes, including calcium release and protein kinase C activation (Lo2011Expression; Runkel2012Alopecia). PLCD3 is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, and is implicated in physiological functions like angiogenesis and neuronal migration (Suh2008Multiple; Runkel2012Alopecia). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as flotillin2 and elements of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, underscore its involvement in cancer progression and other pathological conditions (Wang2023PLCD3; Liu2017PLCD3). Additionally, PLCD3 is essential for normal embryonic development, particularly in placental formation, highlighting its critical biological roles (Suh2008Multiple).

## Structure
PLCD3, a member of the phospholipase C delta family, is characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role in intracellular signal transduction. The protein includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is crucial for targeting the enzyme to phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane, facilitating its enzymatic activity (Runkel2012Alopecia). The catalytic activity of PLCD3 is mediated by the X and Y domains, which form the catalytic core necessary for its function (Liu2017PLCD3). Additionally, PLCD3 contains EF-hand motifs and a C2 domain, which are typical of the PLC delta family and are involved in calcium binding and membrane association, respectively (Runkel2012Alopecia).

A novel mutation in the Plcd3 gene, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the PH domain, has been identified, highlighting the importance of this domain for proper function (Runkel2012Alopecia). The full-length PLCD3 protein has a molecular weight of approximately 88 kDa, while the truncated version is about 75 kDa (Runkel2012Alopecia). The protein's stability and activity are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and the presence of splice variants may lead to isoforms with distinct regulatory properties (Ghosh1997Phospholipase).

## Function
PLCD3 (phospholipase C delta 3) is an enzyme involved in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, where it plays a crucial role in hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These products act as second messengers in various cellular processes, including calcium release and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and signal transduction (Lo2011Expression; Runkel2012Alopecia).

PLCD3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Suh2008Multiple). In endothelial cells, PLCD3 is implicated in angiogenesis by regulating intracellular calcium levels, which are critical for transendothelial permeability and cell migration (Lo2011Expression). Additionally, PLCD3 is involved in neuronal migration and neurite formation, suggesting a role in the nervous system (Runkel2012Alopecia).

In the context of embryonic development, PLCD3 is essential for normal placental development, as its absence, along with PLC-δ1, results in embryonic lethality due to placental defects (Suh2008Multiple). This highlights its importance in trophoblast function and placental development.

## Clinical Significance
PLCD3 has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PLCD3 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced pathological stages and lymphatic metastasis. Its overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while knockdown results in reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression through the PI3K/AKT/P21 signaling pathway (Wang2023PLCD3).

In gastric cancer, PLCD3 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues. High PLCD3 levels are associated with poor prognosis and are considered an independent risk factor for cancer development. Its expression influences cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, potentially through the JAK2/STAT3 and MTOR pathways (Yu2024PLCD3).

PLCD3 also plays a role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it interacts with flotillin2 to promote tumor progression. Silencing PLCD3 reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its oncogenic potential in this cancer type (Liu2017PLCD3).

In osteosarcoma, PLCD3 is part of a prognostic model linked to immune infiltration and drug responses, highlighting its involvement in cancer-promoting pathways like PI3K/Akt signaling (Hu2023Cuproptosis).

## Interactions
PLCD3 (phospholipase C delta 3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with flotillin2 (Flot2), a protein associated with tumor progression and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This interaction was identified using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical association between PLCD3 and Flot2 in NPC cells (Liu2017PLCD3).

In addition to its interaction with Flot2, PLCD3 has been linked to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This pathway is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. PLCD3's involvement in this pathway suggests it may interact with components of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, influencing the expression of proteins such as MMP2, MMP9, and P21, which are associated with malignant behaviors in cancer cells (Wang2023PLCD3).

PLCD3 is also implicated in interactions with other proteins identified through STRING analysis, including ITRP3, ITPR1, PRKCA, and PIP4K families, highlighting its potential role in diverse signaling networks (Hu2023Cuproptosis).
