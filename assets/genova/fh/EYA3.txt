# EYA3

## Overview
EYA3 is a gene that encodes the EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 3, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is a member of the Eyes absent (EYA) family and is characterized by its dual phosphatase activity, functioning as both a tyrosine and threonine phosphatase. EYA3 plays a critical role in organogenesis, DNA damage repair, and immune regulation, and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cellular migration and transformation (Mentel2018WDR1). The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, such as the Six family and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Src kinase (Mentel2018WDR1; Zhang2018Eya3). EYA3's involvement in disease processes, such as cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2019The; Vartuli2018Eya3).

## Structure
The EYA3 protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal Eya domain (ED), which is responsible for its tyrosine phosphatase activity and is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Mentel2018WDR1; Söker2008Pleiotropic). This domain is highly conserved across species and is involved in interactions with other proteins such as Six1, which is important for its role in cancer metastasis (Zhang2018Eya3). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of EYA3 is less conserved and contains a transactivation domain, which is involved in transcriptional activation and has been associated with threonine phosphatase activity through its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Mentel2018WDR1; Zhang2018Eya3).

EYA3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Src kinase, which affects its subcellular localization and function (Mentel2018WDR1). The protein can autodephosphorylate these residues, indicating a regulatory mechanism for its activity (Mentel2018WDR1). EYA3 also exhibits alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms that may have distinct functions, particularly in the amino-terminal region (Zimmerman1997Cloning). These structural features contribute to EYA3's diverse roles in cellular processes and disease development.

## Function
EYA3, a member of the Eyes absent (EYA) family, is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It possesses transactivation, threonine phosphatase, and tyrosine phosphatase activities, which are crucial for its involvement in organogenesis and physiological processes such as DNA damage repair and innate immunity (Mentel2018WDR1). EYA3 is known to interact with the WD-repeat-containing protein 1 (WDR1), dephosphorylating it at a specific tyrosine residue (Y238). This dephosphorylation is essential for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cellular processes like migration and transformation (Mentel2018WDR1).

EYA3 is also involved in the DNA damage response by dephosphorylating histone H2AX, a key player in DNA repair mechanisms (Mentel2018WDR1). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, with Src kinase phosphorylating EYA3, which can then autodephosphorylate itself, affecting its subcellular localization and function (Mentel2018WDR1). EYA3's phosphatase activity is crucial for maintaining cellular functions, particularly in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (Mentel2018WDR1).

## Clinical Significance
The EYA3 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and immune regulation. In breast cancer, EYA3 promotes tumor-associated immune suppression by upregulating PD-L1, which leads to decreased infiltration and exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Vartuli2018Eya3). EYA3's expression is also linked to increased tumor growth and metastasis through its threonine phosphatase activity, which affects immune regulation and tumor cell survival (Vartuli2018Eya3).

In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), EYA3's tyrosine phosphatase activity is elevated, promoting cell survival under DNA-damaging conditions and contributing to vascular remodeling. Inhibition of EYA3 activity has been shown to reverse vascular remodeling in animal models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in PAH (Wang2019The).

EYA3 is also associated with Ewing sarcoma, where its elevated levels contribute to tumor growth and chemoresistance. Targeting EYA3 in Ewing sarcoma cells has been shown to reduce tumor growth and increase apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer cell survival (Robin2012EWSFLI1; Wang2021Targeting).

## Interactions
EYA3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), specifically associating with the B55α subunit. This interaction is crucial for EYA3's threonine phosphatase activity and is necessary for the stabilization of the oncogene c-Myc, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression (Zhang2018Eya3). The interaction between EYA3 and PP2A-B55α prevents the dephosphorylation of c-Myc at threonine 58, thereby increasing its stability and promoting tumor progression (Zhang2018Eya3).

EYA3 also interacts with Six family proteins, forming complexes that are essential for transcriptional activation. This interaction is mediated through the Eya domain within EYA3, which is necessary for complex formation with Six proteins, such as Six4 and Six5, in the nucleus (Ikeda2002Molecular; Ohto1999Cooperation). Additionally, EYA3 interacts with WD-repeat-containing protein 1 (WDR1), a substrate for its tyrosine phosphatase activity. This interaction involves the dephosphorylation of WDR1, which is phosphorylated by Src kinase, leading to modifications in the cellular actin cytoskeleton (Mentel2018WDR1).
