# MSL2

## Overview
The MSL2 gene encodes the MSL complex subunit 2 protein, which is a critical component of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining biallelic gene expression, particularly in neural progenitor cells, by facilitating chromatin structure and promoter-enhancer interactions. MSL2 is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is significant in the context of its role in ubiquitylating proteins such as the hepatitis B virus X protein, thereby influencing tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma. The gene's function is essential for normal development, as evidenced by the severe developmental defects and perinatal lethality observed in Msl2 knockout mice. Mutations in MSL2 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (Sun2023MSL2; Jin2019Antiviral; Lu2024Novel).

## Function
The MSL2 gene plays a crucial role in maintaining biallelic gene expression in mammals, which is essential for proper gene dosage and cellular function. MSL2 is involved in chromatin structure and promoter-enhancer contacts, facilitating long-range interactions that are vital for gene regulation. It is particularly important in neural progenitor cells, where it helps maintain the expression of genes that would otherwise be expressed monoallelically, including those that are haploinsufficient and require both alleles for normal function (Sun2023MSL2).

MSL2 collaborates with transcription factors such as NRF1, SP1, KANSL1, and KANSL3 to regulate promoter-enhancer contacts and gene accessibility. In the absence of MSL2, these interactions become monoallelic, indicating its role in maintaining biallelic expression (Sun2023MSL2). MSL2 also prevents DNA methylation at certain loci, allowing transcription factors to bind and facilitating gene expression (Sun2023MSL2).

The loss of MSL2 leads to significant developmental issues, as seen in Msl2 knockout mice, which exhibit perinatal lethality and developmental defects. This underscores the gene's importance in regulating dosage-sensitive genes, many of which are critical for normal cellular and organismal function (Sun2023MSL2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MSL2 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. Novel protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in MSL2 have been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These mutations are associated with developmental delays, behavioral problems, and dysmorphic features, supporting MSL2's causal role in syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders (Lu2024Novel).

In the context of cancer, MSL2 has been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. MSL2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can ubiquitylate the HBV-encoded X protein (HBx), enhancing its activity and promoting tumor growth. Elevated levels of MSL2 mRNA have been observed in tumor tissues compared to peri-tumor tissues in patients with HBV-associated HCC, suggesting an oncogenic role for MSL2 in this context (Jin2019Antiviral).

The loss of MSL2 function can lead to impaired neuronal development and perinatal lethality, as observed in Msl2 knockout mice, indicating its essential role in development and its potential involvement in diseases related to gene dosage and expression dysregulation (Sun2023MSL2).
