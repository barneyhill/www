# IQCA1L

## Overview
IQCA1L is a gene that encodes the protein known as IQ motif containing with AAA domain 1 like. This protein is characterized by the presence of an IQ motif, which is a short sequence that typically binds to calmodulin or other EF-hand proteins, and an AAA domain, which is associated with ATPase activity. The IQCA1L protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. It is categorized as a protein with potential regulatory roles due to its structural motifs, which suggest involvement in signal transduction pathways. Further research is needed to clarify its role in cellular physiology and its potential implications in human health and disease.
