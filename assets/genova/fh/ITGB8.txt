# ITGB8

## Overview
The ITGB8 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 8, a critical component of the αvβ8 integrin heterodimer, which functions as a transmembrane receptor. This integrin is involved in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including neurovascular development and immune regulation. The β8 subunit is characterized by its unique structural features, such as a distinct primary sequence and an extended conformation that maintains high ligand-binding affinity. The αvβ8 integrin is essential for normal cerebral blood vessel morphogenesis and the transition of CNS blood vessels from angiogenic to quiescent states. Additionally, ITGB8 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (McCarty2020αvβ8; Zhou2020Integrin; Song2020Atypical).

## Structure
The ITGB8 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 8, which forms part of the αvβ8 integrin heterodimer. The primary structure of β8 integrin is predicted to be 81 kDa based on its amino acid sequence, but post-translational modifications, specifically N-glycosylation at one or more of seven possible sites in the extracellular domain, result in an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa on SDS polyacrylamide gels (McCarty2020αvβ8; Moyle1991Cloning).

The β8 integrin subunit has a unique primary sequence compared to other β integrins, with only 31%-37% identity in amino acid sequence (Moyle1991Cloning; Song2020Atypical). It features a 42-residue N-terminal signal peptide, a large extracellular domain (~639 residues) with four cysteine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain (~30 residues), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (~68 residues) (Moyle1991Cloning). The β8 subunit lacks certain conserved cysteine residues, which affects its secondary structure by preventing the formation of disulfide bonds that stabilize the bent conformation seen in other integrins (Song2020Atypical).

In terms of tertiary structure, the β8 subunit's βI domain is characterized by a unique conformation that does not conform to the typical bidirectional signaling seen in other integrins (Song2020Atypical). The quaternary structure involves dimerization with the αv subunit to form the αvβ8 integrin, which is crucial for its function (McCarty2020αvβ8). The β8 subunit's structure allows for an extended conformation, maintaining high ligand-binding affinity without undergoing global conformational changes upon ligand binding (Song2020Atypical).

## Function
The ITGB8 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 8, which forms part of the αvβ8 integrin complex. This integrin is crucial for activating latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins, which are initially deposited in the extracellular matrix (ECM) as inactive complexes. The αvβ8 integrin binds to the RGD sequence within the latency-associated peptide (LAP) domain of latent TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, facilitating their activation. This activation is essential for various intracellular signaling events, including those mediated by Smad transcription factors (McCarty2020αvβ8).

In the central nervous system (CNS), αvβ8 integrin is expressed in perivascular glial cells and plays a significant role in neurovascular development. It is essential for normal cerebral blood vessel morphogenesis, as evidenced by severe brain angiogenesis defects in Itgb8-null mice (McCarty2020αvβ8). The integrin also regulates the transition of CNS blood vessels from an angiogenic to a quiescent state, highlighting its role in modulating active phases of blood vessel development (McCarty2020αvβ8).

In astrocytes, αvβ8 integrin mediates the activation of TGF-β, which is crucial for maintaining blood vessel integrity and involves metalloproteases like MT1-MMP. This process is important for neural development and function (Cambier2005Integrin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITGB8 gene, which encodes the integrin subunit beta 8, have been implicated in various cancers. In colon cancer, integrin αvβ8 is associated with poor prognosis, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stages. It contributes to immunosuppression by inhibiting CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte responses and activating TGF-β1, which promotes cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhou2020Integrin). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high ITGB8 expression correlates with poor prognosis, lymphatic metastasis, and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. It is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, potentially contributing to immune escape mechanisms (Zheng2020Coexisting; Jin2023Prognostic).

In glioblastoma, ITGB8 is enriched in glioma stem cells and is linked to poor prognosis. It plays a role in vasculogenic mimicry and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, supporting tumor invasion through the TGFβ1/p-Smad/RhoA signaling pathway (Liu2022Paradoxical). ITGB8 expression is also upregulated in prostate cancer, where it is co-regulated with the EPHB4 gene, contributing to cancer onset and metastasis (MertensWalker2015The). These findings suggest that ITGB8 is a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
Integrin subunit beta 8 (ITGB8) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. ITGB8 forms a complex with the alpha v subunit to create the αvβ8 integrin, which interacts with latent TGF-beta, playing a role in its activation. This interaction is crucial for the TGFβ-Smad2/3 and RhoA signaling pathways, which are involved in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) and the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma cells (Liu2022Paradoxical).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, ITGB8 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which modulates ITGB8 by targeting miR-145-5p. This interaction affects the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Wei2020The).

In the context of endometrial receptivity, ITGB8 activates the FAK-VAV-RAC1 signaling axis, which is essential for blastocyst implantation. ITGB8 interacts with Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), leading to the activation of RAC1, a small G protein, through the VAV guanine exchange factor. This interaction is critical for the reorganization of focal adhesion proteins and the development of endometrial receptivity (Kumar2017Integrin).
