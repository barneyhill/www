# TMOD4

## Overview
The TMOD4 gene encodes the protein tropomodulin 4, which is a member of the tropomodulin family involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. Tropomodulin 4 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle tissues by capping the pointed ends of actin filaments. This capping function prevents the elongation and disassembly of actin filaments, which is essential for proper muscle contraction and function. Unlike some other tropomodulin isoforms, TMOD4 does not initiate actin filament formation but is specifically involved in stabilizing existing filaments. The protein's interactions with tropomyosin, a stabilizing protein for actin filaments, are isoform-specific and contribute to its functional role in muscle cells. Although direct clinical implications of TMOD4 mutations have not been established, its involvement in actin dynamics suggests potential impacts on muscle integrity and related conditions (Colpan2013Tropomodulins; Uversky2011Systematic; Gokhin2011Tropomodulin).

## Structure
Tropomodulin 4 (TMOD4) is a protein encoded by the TMOD4 gene, primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells. The protein is part of the tropomodulin family, which plays a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics by capping the pointed ends of actin filaments (Colpan2013Tropomodulins; Gokhin2010Tropomodulin).

The primary structure of TMOD4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that share 60% identity and 70% similarity with other tropomodulin isoforms (Colpan2013Tropomodulins). The protein's secondary structure includes an elongated, unstructured N-terminal domain and a compact, globular C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain contains two tropomyosin-binding sites and a tropomyosin-dependent actin-binding site, while the C-terminal domain includes a tropomyosin-independent actin-binding site (Boczkowska2015How; Colpan2013Tropomodulins).

TMOD4's tertiary structure is characterized by its ability to cap the pointed end of actin filaments, facilitated by its specific domain organization (Boczkowska2015How). The protein undergoes isoform-specific interactions with tropomyosin, which are crucial for its function in muscle cells (Uversky2011Systematic). TMOD4 can replace Tmod1 during muscle development, indicating its functional versatility (Colpan2013Tropomodulins).

## Function
Tropomodulin 4 (TMOD4) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics by capping the pointed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing their elongation and disassembly. This function is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and proper function of muscle tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle cells where TMOD4 is specifically expressed (Colpan2013Tropomodulins). TMOD4, along with Tmod1, caps the pointed ends of sarcomeric thin filaments in skeletal muscle, contributing to the regulation of thin filament lengths, which is crucial for muscle contraction and function (Gokhin2011Tropomodulin).

TMOD4 can compensate for the absence of Tmod1 in embryonic mice skeletal muscle, indicating its ability to maintain actin filament stability in certain contexts (Colpan2013Tropomodulins). Unlike Tmod1, TMOD4 does not perform actin nucleation, highlighting its specific role in capping rather than initiating filament formation (Colpan2013Tropomodulins). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other cytoskeletal proteins to modulate cell shape and motility, contributing to the overall stability and organization of the cytoskeleton in muscle cells (Colpan2013Tropomodulins).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the TMOD4 gene, which encodes tropomodulin 4, is primarily associated with its role in muscle function and potential implications in muscle-related diseases. Although specific mutations in TMOD4 have not been directly linked to particular diseases, its involvement in actin filament regulation suggests that alterations in its expression or function could impact muscle integrity. Studies have shown that TMOD4 plays a distinct role in thin filament capping and myofibril assembly, which is crucial for maintaining muscle structure and function (Berger2022Genetic).

Research has identified significant linkage disequilibrium between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involving TMOD4 and conditions like hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia, a form of dyslipidemia. However, the direct clinical significance of these genetic associations remains unclear (Yamada2018Identification). The genomic organization of TMOD4, including its unusual intergenic splicing with the YL-1 gene, adds complexity to its regulation and potential implications for disease, although no direct clinical significance has been established in the context of specific mutations (Cox2001Genomic). Understanding the intricate genomic structure of TMOD4 may facilitate future mutational analyses and provide insights into its role in muscle-related conditions.

## Interactions
Tropomodulin 4 (TMOD4) is involved in interactions with tropomyosin (TM), a protein that stabilizes actin filaments. TMOD4 specifically binds to TM isoforms, and these interactions are isoform-dependent, meaning that different TMOD isoforms have varying affinities for TM isoforms. This specificity is attributed to the intrinsic disorder of the proteins, which allows for flexible and dynamic interactions (Uversky2011Systematic). TMOD4 is expressed in skeletal muscle cells and can replace TMOD1 during development, indicating its role in muscle structure (Colpan2013Tropomodulins).

The binding sites for TM on TMOD4 are associated with regions of predicted order within the disordered N-terminal domains, suggesting these are molecular recognition features (MoRFs) that undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding (Uversky2011Systematic). TMOD4 shows low affinity for certain TM peptides compared to other TMOD isoforms, which may influence its functional role in actin dynamics (Uversky2011Systematic). Despite its weaker affinity for the pointed end of actin filaments, TMOD4's interactions with TM are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells (Yamashiro2010Mammalian).
