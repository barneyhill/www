# DIO3

## Overview
The DIO3 gene encodes the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase 3 (D3), a selenoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of thyroid hormone activity. As a member of the deiodinase family, D3 is primarily involved in the inactivation of thyroid hormones by catalyzing the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to reverse T3 (rT3) and triiodothyronine (T3) to 3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2), both of which are inactive forms (Bianco2002Biochemistry; Sabatino2021Deiodinases). This enzymatic function is crucial for maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis, particularly in fetal development and the central nervous system (CNS), where it prevents excessive hormone exposure (Hernandez2018The). D3 is characterized by a thioredoxin-fold motif and a selenocysteine residue essential for its catalytic activity (Schweizer2015New; Bayse2020Thyroxine). The gene's expression is notably high in the placenta, fetal tissues, and the CNS, underscoring its importance in developmental processes and neurological functions (Hernandez2018The; Huang2003Type). Dysregulation of DIO3 is associated with various clinical conditions, including developmental abnormalities and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Martinez2022DIO3; Moskovich2021DIO3).

## Structure
The DIO3 protein, also known as iodothyronine deiodinase 3, is a selenoprotein involved in thyroid hormone regulation. Its primary structure includes a selenocysteine residue, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, located in a cleft that serves as the substrate binding site (Schweizer2015New). The protein features a thioredoxin-fold motif, a common structure in proteins that catalyze redox reactions, and is characterized by a two-stranded beta-sheet and a 3_10-helix typical of the peroxiredoxin family within the thioredoxin-fold superfamily (Schweizer2015New; Bayse2020Thyroxine).

The tertiary structure of DIO3 includes a catalytic domain with a thioredoxin-fold and a modified active site containing selenocysteine. This domain is involved in the deiodination mechanism, which includes a halogen-bonded intermediate complex (Bayse2020Thyroxine). The protein also contains an Ω-loop region, which is crucial for substrate binding and catalytic activity. This loop undergoes conformational changes that influence substrate binding, particularly the binding of thyroxine (T4) to a cryptic pocket (Bayse2020Thyroxine).

DIO3 is known to exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Hernandez2018The). The protein's quaternary structure is mainly monomeric, with weak dimerization capability mediated by the transmembrane region and linker region (Schweizer2015New).

## Function
The DIO3 gene encodes the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase 3 (D3), which plays a critical role in the inactivation of thyroid hormones. D3 catalyzes the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to reverse T3 (rT3) and triiodothyronine (T3) to 3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2), both of which are biologically inactive forms of thyroid hormones (Bianco2002Biochemistry; Sabatino2021Deiodinases). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis, particularly during fetal development and in the central nervous system (CNS), where it protects tissues from excessive thyroid hormone exposure (Bianco2002Biochemistry; Hernandez2018The).

D3 is highly expressed in the placenta, fetal tissues, and the CNS, where it regulates local thyroid hormone concentrations, ensuring proper development and function (Hernandez2018The; Huang2003Type). In the CNS, D3 is primarily expressed in neurons and is involved in areas related to learning, memory, and cognitive functions (Bianco2002Biochemistry). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal development and function, and its dysregulation can lead to conditions such as hypothyroidism and developmental abnormalities (Bianco2002Biochemistry; Hernandez2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the DIO3 gene, which encodes the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme, have significant clinical implications. DIO3 deficiency is linked to severe congenital abnormalities, including craniofacial and cardiac defects, particularly in fetuses exposed to excess thyroid hormones due to maternal hyperthyroidism. These defects can manifest as choanal atresia, cleft palate, and cardiac abnormalities, contributing to neonatal lethality and growth retardation (Martinez2022DIO3). The gene's imprinting and expression from the paternal allele are associated with Temple syndrome, characterized by facial dysmorphisms and growth retardation (Martinez2022DIO3).

In cancer, DIO3 is implicated in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), where it promotes tumorigenesis and metabolic reprogramming. The enzyme's upregulation in cancerous tissues leads to the degradation of the tumor-suppressive thyroid hormone T3, facilitating cancer progression (Moskovich2021DIO3). DIO3 is also overexpressed in various solid tumors, contributing to a hypothyroid state that supports tumor growth and proliferation (Ciavardelli2014Type). These findings highlight the dual role of DIO3 in developmental disorders and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance.
