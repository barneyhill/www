# HLA-E

## Overview
HLA-E is a gene that encodes a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, known as HLA-E protein. This protein is characterized by its limited polymorphism and plays a crucial role in immune regulation. Unlike classical MHC class I molecules, HLA-E primarily interacts with natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells through the CD94/NKG2 receptor complex, modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Braud1998HLA-E; Borrego1998Recognition). The HLA-E protein is a transmembrane molecule that presents peptides derived from the leader sequences of other MHC class I molecules, which is essential for its stabilization and surface expression (Lee1998HLAE). Its interactions with NK cell receptors, particularly the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A, prevent NK cell-mediated lysis of healthy cells, thereby playing a protective role in immune surveillance (Iwaszko2011Clinical; Morandi2014Interactions).

## Structure
The HLA-E protein is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule characterized by its limited polymorphism and specific structural features. The primary structure of HLA-E includes a heavy chain encoded by the HLA-E gene, which pairs with β2-microglobulin to form a functional complex (Kanevskiy2019Dimorphism). The heavy chain consists of three extracellular domains: α1, α2, and α3, with the α1 and α2 domains forming the peptide-binding groove (Iwaszko2011Clinical; Kanevskiy2019Dimorphism). This groove is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and contains five conserved hydrophobic pockets that anchor peptides at specific residues (Foroni2014HLAE).

The secondary structure of HLA-E includes α-helices and β-sheets, which contribute to the formation of the peptide-binding groove (Iwaszko2011Clinical). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a compact domain, allowing HLA-E to present peptides to cytotoxic lymphocytes (Kanevskiy2019Dimorphism). The quaternary structure is characterized by the heterodimerization of the HLA-E heavy chain with β2-microglobulin, which is essential for its surface expression (Kanevskiy2019Dimorphism).

HLA-E undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function (Braud1998HLA-E). The protein's structure allows it to interact with CD94/NKG2 receptors on natural killer (NK) cells, playing a crucial role in immune regulation (Kaiser2008Structural).

## Function
HLA-E is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule that plays a crucial role in immune regulation by interacting with natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. It presents peptides derived from the leader sequences of other MHC class I molecules, such as HLA-A, -B, -C, and -G, to the CD94/NKG2 receptor complex on NK cells. This interaction primarily involves the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A, which prevents NK cell-mediated lysis of healthy cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing inappropriate immune responses (Braud1998HLA-E; Lee1998HLAE; Borrego1998Recognition).

HLA-E expression on the cell surface is dependent on the binding of specific nonamer peptides, which are loaded in a transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-dependent manner. This peptide binding is essential for the stabilization and surface expression of HLA-E, allowing it to effectively interact with NK cell receptors (Lee1998HLAE). The presence of HLA-E on the cell surface provides a protective function by inhibiting NK cell activity, which is crucial for immune surveillance and modulation (Iwaszko2011Clinical; Morandi2014Interactions).

## Clinical Significance
HLA-E plays a significant role in various diseases and conditions due to its expression levels, polymorphisms, and interactions with immune cells. In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), HLA-E polymorphisms and mismatches can lead to complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. The HLA-E*01:03 homozygous genotype is associated with better HSCT outcomes, while mismatches increase the risk of CMV infection and acute GvHD (Siemaszko2023Significance).

In cancer, HLA-E expression in tumors can enable immune evasion by protecting cells from NK cell cytotoxicity through interactions with the NKG2A receptor. This is observed in various cancers, including breast cancer, where high HLA-E expression correlates with reduced survival (Wieten2014Clinical). In colorectal carcinoma, high HLA-E expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Benevolo2011High).

HLA-E polymorphisms also influence susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. The HLA-E*01:03 allele is linked to increased risk in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and a lower response to anti-TNF therapy (Iwaszko2015Polymorphisms). In infectious diseases, HLA-E alleles have varying roles, offering protective benefits or increasing susceptibility to infections such as hepatitis C and BK polyomavirus (Kanevskiy2019Dimorphism).

## Interactions
HLA-E is a non-classical MHC class I molecule that interacts primarily with natural killer (NK) cell receptors, particularly the CD94/NKG2 receptor family. HLA-E binds to the CD94/NKG2A, CD94/NKG2B, and CD94/NKG2C receptors, forming a heterodimer with CD94 and members of the NKG2 family. This interaction is crucial for the inhibition of NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells, as it protects cells expressing certain HLA alleles from being lysed by NK cells (Braud1998HLA-E).

The binding of HLA-E to these receptors is dependent on the presence of specific peptides derived from the signal sequences of other MHC class I molecules. These peptides stabilize HLA-E on the cell surface, allowing it to interact effectively with CD94/NKG2 receptors (Lee1998HLAE; Borrego1998Recognition). The interaction between HLA-E and CD94/NKG2A is particularly significant, as it serves as a major ligand for this inhibitory receptor, playing a key role in immune surveillance and the protection of cells from NK cell-mediated lysis (Lee1998HLAE; Llano1998HLAEbound).

HLA-E does not interact with killer-cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs), as demonstrated by the lack of binding of HLA-E tetramers to cells expressing various KIRs (Braud1998HLA-E; Allan2002Tetrameric). The structural basis for the interaction between HLA-E and the NKG2A/CD94 receptor complex has been elucidated, revealing specific residues involved in the binding interface, which are crucial for the recognition of HLA-E by the NKG2A/CD94 complex (Kaiser2008Structural).
