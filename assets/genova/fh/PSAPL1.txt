# PSAPL1

## Overview
PSAPL1 (prosaposin like 1) is a gene that encodes a lysosomal protein involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the processing and transport of sphingolipids. These lipids are essential components of cell membranes and play a critical role in cellular signaling pathways. The PSAPL1 protein functions within the lysosome, an organelle responsible for degrading and recycling cellular waste, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis. By facilitating sphingolipid metabolism, PSAPL1 helps maintain lipid balance and regulate signaling pathways crucial for normal cellular function. Disruptions in PSAPL1 activity can lead to cellular dysfunction and are implicated in various diseases, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Hymel2022Differential; Hu2020Integrated).

## Structure


## Function
PSAPL1 (prosaposin like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to lysosomal function and lipid metabolism. The protein is involved in the processing and transport of sphingolipids, which are crucial components of cell membranes. Sphingolipids play a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes and are involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The PSAPL1 protein is active within the lysosome, an organelle responsible for breaking down and recycling cellular waste, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis. By facilitating the proper metabolism of sphingolipids, PSAPL1 supports the maintenance of cellular lipid balance and the regulation of signaling pathways that are essential for normal cellular function. The activity of PSAPL1 in the lysosome underscores its importance in the degradation and recycling processes that are vital for cell survival and function. Disruptions in these processes can lead to cellular dysfunction and are implicated in various diseases, highlighting the critical role of PSAPL1 in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
PSAPL1 (prosaposin like 1) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, expression alterations, and disruptions in its normal interactions. In the context of cancer, PSAPL1 is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC). Significant hypomethylation of PSAPL1 has been observed, suggesting its role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (Hymel2022Differential). In gastric cancer, high expression levels of PSAPL1 have been correlated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Hu2020Integrated).

In breast cancer, PSAPL1 is one of the genes upregulated across various morphological features, such as tubular differentiation and nuclear pleomorphism, which are used in grading the disease. This suggests a link between PSAPL1 expression and the molecular profiles that influence tumor behavior (Rakha2020Visual). Additionally, PSAPL1 has been associated with breast cancer grade and is involved in pathways related to epithelial cell differentiation and the sphingolipid metabolic process (She2022Differences).

PSAPL1 expression is also noted to decrease following ranibizumab treatment in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, indicating a potential protective effect by reducing angiogenesis and inhibiting cell proliferation (She2022Differences).
