# CAMKK2

## Overview
CAMKK2, or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes. The protein product of CAMKK2 is a member of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase subfamily and is activated through binding with calcium-bound calmodulin, which leads to its autophosphorylation. This kinase plays a critical role in the phosphorylation and activation of downstream kinases such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CaMKI), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 4 (CaMKIV), thereby influencing pathways related to energy metabolism, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic function. CAMKK2 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with learning and memory, and is implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic processes. Dysregulation of CAMKK2 has been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Najar2020A; Luo2013Convergent; Kaiser2023CaMKK2).

## Structure
CAMKK2 is a serine/threonine kinase with a molecular weight of 66-68 kDa in humans, rats, and mice. It features a distinct structure compared to other CaMK family members, consisting of divergent N- and C-terminal domains and a central Ser/Thr-directed kinase domain (Racioppi2012CalciumCalmodulindependent). The kinase domain spans amino acids 161-449 and adopts a canonical protein kinase fold, with a smaller N-terminal lobe composed mostly of β-strands and a larger C-terminal lobe made predominantly of α-helices (Profeta2019Binding). The ATP-binding site is located in a crevice between these lobes, where ATP-competitive inhibitors bind (Profeta2019Binding).

CAMKK2 contains a unique Arg-Pro-rich insert (RP insert) within the N-terminal lobe, crucial for targeting and activating downstream kinases like CaMKI and CaMKIV (Kylarova2018CaMKK2). The protein lacks the αD helix in the C-lobe, which is involved in hydrophobic interactions in other CaMKs (Kylarova2018CaMKK2). The regulatory domain includes overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin-binding regions, which modulate its activity (Racioppi2012CalciumCalmodulindependent).

Post-translational modifications of CAMKK2 include phosphorylation at several sites, such as Ser-129, Ser-133, and Ser-137, which enhance its stability and activity (Racioppi2012CalciumCalmodulindependent). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which affects its role in neuronal differentiation (Racioppi2012CalciumCalmodulindependent).

## Function
CAMKK2 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular and physiological processes. It is part of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase subfamily and becomes fully activated upon binding with Ca2+/calmodulin, leading to autophosphorylation (Najar2020A). CAMKK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of several key proteins, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CAMK1), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 4 (CAMK4), which enhances their kinase activities (Najar2020A).

In healthy human cells, CAMKK2 is crucial for regulating energy metabolism, influencing processes such as fatty acid metabolism, glucose uptake, and gluconeogenesis. It also plays a role in autophagy regulation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation, and the translocation of glucose transporters (Najar2020A). CAMKK2 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, where it is involved in learning, memory, and energy homeostasis (Najar2020A). It influences signaling cascades related to neuronal differentiation, migration, and synapse formation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation (Najar2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CAMKK2 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, CAMKK2 is consistently downregulated, and specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs1063843 are associated with the condition. The T allele of rs1063843, which correlates with lower CAMKK2 expression, is more frequent in individuals with schizophrenia, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Luo2013Convergent). CAMKK2 is involved in cognitive functions, and its dysregulation is observed in both human and animal models of schizophrenia (Luo2013Convergent).

In bipolar disorder, CAMKK2 is linked to neuronal activity and brain function through its role in phosphorylating downstream effectors like CaMK1 and AMPK. Alterations in these pathways may contribute to memory loss and cognitive impairment associated with the disorder (Kaiser2023CaMKK2). The gene's regulation by kinases such as CDK5 and GSK3, which are significant for bipolar disorder, further underscores its clinical relevance (Kaiser2023CaMKK2).

CAMKK2 is also implicated in prostate cancer progression, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer, where its expression is upregulated and associated with androgen receptor signaling (Karacosta2012A).

## Interactions
CaMKK2 interacts with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, which are regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Ser100 and Ser511 on CaMKK2 promotes binding to 14-3-3 proteins, maintaining CaMKK2 in an inactivated state by protecting against dephosphorylation of Ser495 (Langendorf2020CaMKK2; Tokumitsu2022Molecular). The interaction involves specific residues of the 14-3-3 protein, such as Lys49, Arg56, Arg127, and Tyr128, which coordinate the phosphoserines (Langendorf2020CaMKK2). 

The binding of 14-3-3 proteins does not inhibit the catalytic activity of phosphorylated CaMKK2, as shown by experiments using specific substrates (Psenakova20181433). The interaction between CaMKK2 and 14-3-3 proteins can be stabilized by compounds like fusicoccanes, which enhance the binding affinity and slow down dephosphorylation (Lentini2020Stabilization).

CaMKK2 also interacts with various kinases, including AMPK, CaMKI, and CaMKIV, through a unique Arg/Pro-rich domain that aids in substrate recognition (Tokumitsu2022Molecular). These interactions are crucial for the phosphorylation and activation of these target kinases.
