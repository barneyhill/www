# KLHL13

## Overview
KLHL13 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 13, which is part of the kelch-like family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs, which facilitate its role as a substrate adaptor in the CUL3 E3 ligase complex. KLHL13 is involved in various cellular processes, such as ubiquitination and mitophagy, by interacting with Cullin3 and recognizing specific substrates through its Kelch repeat domains. It plays a significant role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways, impacting cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes. KLHL13 is also implicated in pathological conditions, including lung cancer and insulin resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency; Dhanoa2013Update; Xiang2021Targeting).

## Structure
KLHL13 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by specific structural domains that facilitate its function. The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and six Kelch motifs. The BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein dimerization and interaction with other proteins, while the BACK domain connects the BTB and Kelch domains, playing a crucial role in substrate recognition (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). The Kelch motifs form a beta-propeller structure, which is essential for protein-protein interactions and substrate binding (Dhanoa2013Update; Sumara2007Aa).

KLHL13 functions as a substrate adaptor in the CUL3 E3 ligase complex, interacting with Cullin3 through its 3-box domain and recognizing specific substrates via its Kelch repeat domains (Xiang2021Targeting). The protein's structure allows it to participate in various cellular processes, including ubiquitination and mitophagy (Li2023Burkholderia; Xiang2021Targeting). KLHL13 is also involved in the regulation of mitotic progression and cytokinesis, forming complexes with other proteins such as KLHL9 (Sumara2007Aa). The presence of splice variants may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
KLHL13 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signal transduction. KLHL13 functions as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically interacting with CUL3 to facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover.

In the context of insulin signaling, KLHL13, as part of the KLHL9/KLHL13/CUL3 complex, plays a significant role in the degradation of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS1). This process is particularly relevant in conditions where autophagy is impaired, such as in ATG16L1 knockout models, leading to insulin resistance (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency). The degradation of IRS1 by this complex is a key factor in the modulation of insulin signaling pathways, impacting glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency).

KLHL13 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of protein degradation pathways, thereby influencing various cellular functions and organismal outcomes related to metabolic processes (Dhanoa2013Update).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL13 has been implicated in the progression of lung cancer due to its elevated expression in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Overexpression of KLHL13 in lung cancer cell lines has been shown to significantly increase cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting its role in promoting tumorigenesis. Conversely, knockdown of KLHL13 results in reduced cell proliferation, indicating its critical role in the malignant progression of lung cancer (Xiang2021Targeting). High expression levels of KLHL13 are negatively correlated with overall survival in lung cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Xiang2021Targeting).

In addition to its role in cancer, KLHL13 is involved in insulin resistance. The KLHL13 gene, in conjunction with KLHL9 and CUL3, forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the degradation of IRS1, a key component in insulin signaling. Alterations in KLHL13 expression can contribute to insulin resistance, particularly in the context of ATG16L1 deficiency, which leads to reduced IRS1 protein levels and impaired insulin signaling (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency). This suggests a potential link between KLHL13 expression and metabolic conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency).

## Interactions
KLHL13 is known to interact with several proteins, forming part of a complex that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It acts as a substrate adaptor protein within the CRL3 (Cullin3-RING ligase) complex, which is involved in ubiquitination, a process crucial for protein degradation. KLHL13 interacts specifically with Cullin3 through its 3-box domain, which is essential for the ubiquitin transfer process. Deletion of this domain disrupts the interaction, highlighting its importance in the complex's function (Xiang2021Targeting).

KLHL13 also forms a heterodimer with KLHL9, and together with Cullin3, they constitute an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in the degradation of IRS1, a process that is significant in the context of insulin resistance, particularly when the autophagy gene ATG16L1 is deficient (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency). The KLHL9/KLHL13/CUL3 complex also interacts with the bacterial protein BipD from Burkholderia pseudomallei, facilitating the ubiquitination of the mitochondrial protein IMMT, which initiates mitophagy, a process that helps the bacteria evade host defenses (Li2023Burkholderia). These interactions underscore KLHL13's role in both cellular homeostasis and pathogenic processes.
