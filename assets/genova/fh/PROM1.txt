# PROM1

## Overview
PROM1, also known as CD133, is a gene that encodes the prominin-1 protein, a pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein. This protein is characterized by its five transmembrane domains and is involved in the organization of plasma membrane protrusions, such as microvilli and primary cilia, playing a crucial role in cellular architecture and dynamics (Corbeil2000The; Jászai2020Prominins). Prominin-1 is essential for the proper formation of photoreceptor outer segments in the retina and is implicated in various cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance, autophagy regulation, and signaling pathways like the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway (Corbeil2001Prominin:; Bhattacharya2017Prominin-1). Mutations in the PROM1 gene are linked to retinal degenerative diseases and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a significant biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Saha2019PROM1; Zacchigna2009Loss).

## Structure
PROM1, also known as CD133, is a pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PROM1 includes approximately 850 amino acid residues, with variations depending on the splice variant (Corbeil2012Prominin1). The protein features five transmembrane domains, which are integral to its secondary structure, forming alpha-helices within these domains (Corbeil2000The).

The tertiary structure of PROM1 involves alternating short intracellular and large extracellular loops, with the extracellular loops containing potential N-glycosylation sites, which are crucial for its function and recognition by antibodies such as AC133 (Mak2011CD133; Corbeil2012Prominin1). The protein also includes conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular domains, contributing to its structural stability (Corbeil2012Prominin1).

PROM1 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably N-glycosylation, which is essential for its cell surface expression and recognition (Mak2011CD133). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which are ontogenetically regulated and tissue-specific, adding to its functional diversity (Corbeil2012Prominin1). These structural features enable PROM1 to play significant roles in cellular processes and as a marker for stem cells and cancer-initiating cells (Jászai2020Prominins).

## Function
Prominin-1 (PROM1), also known as CD133, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the organization of plasma membrane protrusions such as microvilli, filopodia, and primary cilia. It is involved in the architecture and dynamics of these structures, influencing their structure and function (Pleskač2024Emerging; Jászai2020Prominins). PROM1 is crucial for the proper formation of photoreceptor outer segments in the retina, where it is concentrated in plasma membrane evaginations at the base of the outer segment, essential for photoreceptive disk membrane biogenesis (Corbeil2001Prominin:).

In cellular processes, PROM1 interacts with proteins such as Arl13b and HDAC6, affecting ciliary length dynamics and playing a role in ciliogenesis, which is vital for cilium-based signaling pathways like the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway (Jászai2020Prominins; Singer2018Prominin‐1). PROM1's involvement extends to stem cell maintenance and activation, where it regulates ciliary dynamics and is essential for the self-renewal capabilities of stem cells (Singer2018Prominin‐1).

PROM1 is also implicated in autophagy regulation within the retinal pigment epithelium, interacting with proteins like p62 and HDAC6 to modulate mTOR signaling pathways, which are central to cell metabolism and survival (Bhattacharya2017Prominin-1). These functions highlight PROM1's importance in maintaining cellular structures and signaling pathways in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PROM1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of retinal health, mutations in PROM1 can lead to retinal degeneration, including cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. These mutations often result in defects in photoreceptor disk formation and outer segment morphogenesis, leading to progressive vision loss (Zacchigna2009Loss; CehajicKapetanovic2019Clinical). The clinical phenotypes vary, with recessive mutations typically causing severe early-onset degeneration, while dominant mutations result in milder, later-onset symptoms (CehajicKapetanovic2019Clinical).

In cancer, PROM1 is frequently overexpressed and is linked to poor prognosis in several types, including ovarian, brain, and esophageal cancers. Its overexpression is associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor survival outcomes (Saha2019PROM1; DansonkaMieszkowska2022PROM1). In high-grade serous ovarian cancer, PROM1 overexpression correlates with increased platinum resistance and higher risk of metastasis, particularly in the presence of TP53 mutations (DansonkaMieszkowska2022PROM1). These findings highlight PROM1's role as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Saha2019PROM1).

## Interactions
PROM1, also known as CD133, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with HDAC6 to regulate β-catenin signaling, forming a complex that stabilizes β-catenin and activates gene expression related to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Pleskač2024Emerging). PROM1 also interacts with activin-like kinase 4, inducing Smad2 phosphorylation, which affects cholesterol metabolism and axon regeneration (Pleskač2024Emerging). In liver fibrosis, PROM1 interacts with Smad7, inhibiting its ubiquitination and reducing TGF-β-induced fibrosis (Pleskač2024Emerging).

PROM1 is involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through its interaction with the PI3K p85 subunit, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Pleskač2024Emerging). It also interacts with the Src protein, promoting the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, which is linked to cancer cell migration (Thamm2018Prominin‐1). PROM1's interaction with the Arp2/3 complex is significant for actin network nucleation and cell migration (Thamm2018Prominin‐1).

In the context of autophagy, PROM1 interacts with p62 and HDAC6, influencing autophagosome formation and maturation (Bhattacharya2017Prominin-1). These interactions highlight PROM1's role in membrane architecture and cell signaling pathways, impacting processes like cancer cell proliferation, axon regeneration, and liver regeneration.
