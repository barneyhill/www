# OR2T8

## Overview
The OR2T8 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 8, which is part of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odorants. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. The OR2T8 protein, like other olfactory receptors, is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. While primarily associated with olfactory function, recent studies have suggested that OR2T8 may have additional roles in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression, neurological disorders, and other conditions (Dibattista2020Alzheimer’s; Masjedi2019Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T8 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In invasive breast carcinoma, OR2T8 is significantly upregulated, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression. This upregulation is observed in specific sub-populations of breast cancer patients, indicating that OR2T8 could serve as a marker for certain breast cancer subtypes, although its direct clinical significance in terms of survival probability is not clearly established (Masjedi2019Olfactory).

In the context of Chiari I malformation, a genetic study identified a significant single nucleotide variant in the exon of the OR2T8 gene, suggesting a possible genetic linkage to the condition. However, the study does not provide specific clinical implications of this finding (Musolf2019Small).

OR2T8 has also been associated with bipolar disorder in a Chinese population, where it was identified as one of the top disease-associated variants in an exome-wide association study. The study highlights the genetic complexity of bipolar disorder and suggests a potential role for OR2T8 in its pathogenesis, though specific clinical implications remain unclear (Yang2021SERINC2increases).

In Alzheimer's disease, OR2T8 is upregulated in advanced stages, indicating a potential involvement in disease progression. The exact clinical significance of this upregulation is not detailed, but it suggests that OR2T8 may have functions beyond olfactory perception (Dibattista2020Alzheimer’s).
