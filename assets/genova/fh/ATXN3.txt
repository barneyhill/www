# ATXN3

## Overview
The ATXN3 gene encodes the protein ataxin-3, a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. Ataxin-3 is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including a globular N-terminal Josephin domain and ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which facilitate its interaction with polyubiquitinated substrates. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), by modulating the extraction and degradation of misfolded proteins. Ataxin-3's function is influenced by its interactions with other proteins, including VCP/p97 and Rad23, and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) due to pathological expansions of its polyglutamine tract (Evert2006Ataxin3; Berke2005Defining; Zhong2006Ataxin3).

## Structure
Ataxin-3, encoded by the ATXN3 gene, is a multi-domain protein with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure includes a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract, which is associated with disease pathology (Sicorello2021Capturing). The protein's secondary structure features ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that are α-helical, contributing to its ability to bind ubiquitin (Invernizzi2013The; Song2010Structural).

The tertiary structure of ataxin-3 is characterized by a globular N-terminal Josephin domain, which is a papain-like cysteine protease with a mixed αβ fold. This domain includes a catalytic triad composed of Cys-14, His-119, and Asp-134, and is involved in deubiquitinating activity (Satoh2014Mode; Nicastro2005The). The C-terminal region is flexible and disordered, containing the polyQ tract and UIMs, which are crucial for its interaction with polyubiquitinated substrates (Invernizzi2013The; Sicorello2021Capturing).

Ataxin-3 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with variations in the number of UIMs present. For instance, ataxin-3c contains a third UIM, while ataxin-3a is more unstructured and hydrophobic (Weishäupl2019Physiological). Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation are common, influencing the protein's function and interactions (Song2010Structural).

## Function
The ATXN3 gene encodes the protein ataxin-3, which functions primarily as a deubiquitinating enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. Ataxin-3 binds to polyubiquitinated proteins and interacts with the proteasome, facilitating the removal of ubiquitin chains from substrates, which is essential for their recognition and degradation by the proteasome (Rodrigues2007Functional; Schmitt2007Inactivation). This activity is supported by its ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and the Josephin domain, which are crucial for its deubiquitinating function (Berke2005Defining).

Ataxin-3 also plays a role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with coactivators such as CBP, p300, and PCAF, inhibiting their activity and repressing transcription (Li2002Ataxin3). It binds to chromatin and recruits histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Evert2006Ataxin3). In the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, ataxin-3 regulates the degradation of ERAD substrates by interacting with VCP/p97, modulating the extraction and degradation of misfolded proteins (Zhong2006Ataxin3).

Ataxin-3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as protein quality control, transcriptional regulation, and maintaining cellular structure and function (Rodrigues2010Absence). Its absence can lead to cytoskeletal disorganization and increased cell death, highlighting its importance in cellular integrity and survival (Rodrigues2010Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATXN3 gene are primarily associated with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats within the gene, leading to the production of an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-3 protein. These expansions result in the formation of intranuclear inclusions and protein aggregates, which are believed to disrupt normal cellular processes and contribute to neurodegeneration (Paulson1997Intranuclear).

The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, and peripheral neuropathy. The age at onset is inversely correlated with the number of CAG repeats, with larger expansions leading to earlier onset of symptoms (Li2020Clinical; de2018Genetic). DNA methylation levels at the ATXN3 gene promoter are also significantly higher in SCA3 patients, which is associated with earlier age at onset and intergenerational CAG repeat instability (Wang2017Alteration).

Homozygous SCA3 patients, who possess two expanded alleles of ATXN3, tend to experience more severe symptoms and an earlier age at onset compared to heterozygous patients, suggesting a gene dosage effect (Li2020Clinical).

## Interactions
Ataxin-3 (ATXN3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. It binds to the valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is modulated by the polyglutamine tract in ATXN3, with pathological forms showing stronger binding, which affects the degradation of ERAD substrates by competing with Ufd1 for VCP binding (Zhong2006Ataxin3). ATXN3 also interacts with Rad23 proteins through its ubiquitin-binding site 2 (UbS2), which prevents its proteasomal degradation, suggesting a regulatory role in protein turnover (Blount2014Ubiquitinbinding).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, ATXN3 forms complexes with proteins such as huntingtin (HTT) and participates in transcription-coupled repair (TCR) complexes, interacting with proteins like PNKP and POLR2A. These interactions are significant in the pathology of diseases like Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (Gao2019Mutant). ATXN3's interactions with molecular chaperones and components of the proteasome and cytoskeleton are also altered in disease states, affecting protein aggregation and mitochondrial transport (Piasecki2023Impaired).
