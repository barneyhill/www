# LRCH1

## Overview
The LRCH1 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology domain containing 1, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and calponin homology (CH) domain-containing protein family. This protein is primarily involved in cytoskeletal regulation and immune cell function, particularly within leukocytes. The LRCH1 protein is characterized by an N-terminal LRR domain and a C-terminal CH domain, which facilitate diverse protein-protein interactions and contribute to its regulatory roles in cellular processes. Notably, LRCH1 acts as a negative regulator of natural killer (NK) cell function and is involved in modulating T cell signaling and microglial activation. Its interactions with various proteins, such as LAT and DOCK8, underscore its significance in immune homeostasis and cellular dynamics. Alterations in LRCH1 expression and function have been implicated in several diseases, including knee osteoarthritis and ulcerative colitis, highlighting its potential clinical relevance (Wang2020LRCH1; Rivière2020Structure).

## Structure
The LRCH1 protein is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and calponin homology (CH) domain-containing protein family, which are known for their roles in cytoskeletal regulation and leukocyte biology. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal LRR domain and a C-terminal CH domain. The LRR domain typically consists of nine LRRs, but in the case of LRCH1 in rats, it contains 10 LRRs, forming a horseshoe-shaped, superhelical arrangement that facilitates a wide range of protein-protein interactions (Rivière2020Structure). The LRRs in human LRCH proteins are of the S, PS, and irregular classes, with LRCH1 also containing SDS22 class LRRs (Rivière2020Structure).

LRCH1, along with LRCH4, contains a putative transmembrane (TM) domain within the C-terminus, suggesting a potential role in sensing external stimuli (Rivière2020Structure). The CH domain is involved in regulatory functions rather than actin binding (Rivière2020Structure). The sequence identity among the four human LRCH proteins is modest, but it increases significantly for the LRR and CH domains, indicating potential functional redundancy (Rivière2020Structure). The exact post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of LRCH1 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
LRCH1 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily characterized by leucine-rich repeats and a calponin homology domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and cytoskeletal organization (Rivière2020Structure). In healthy human cells, LRCH1 plays a significant role in regulating the immune system, particularly in leukocytes. It acts as a negative regulator of natural killer (NK) cell function, where its deficiency leads to increased cytotoxicity towards tumor cells and higher secretion of cytokines such as interferon-γ, TNFα, and IL-2 (Dai2020Leucine; Rivière2020Structure). In microglia, LRCH1 negatively regulates activation and function via a p38 MAPK and ERK1/2-dependent pathway, and its knockdown results in a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Chen2020Inhibition; Rivière2020Structure).

In CD8+ T cells, LRCH1 binds to LAT, inhibiting TCR signaling, which affects infection clearance and tumor cell clearance (Rivière2020Structure). In CD4+ T cells, LRCH1 interacts with DOCK8, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration (Rivière2020Structure). LRCH1's role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its interactions with DOCK proteins and septin proteins, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Rivière2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRCH1 gene have been linked to several diseases. In the context of knee osteoarthritis (OA), single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LRCH1 gene, particularly the rs912428 C/T polymorphism, have been associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. The T allele of this SNP is more prevalent in individuals with knee OA, suggesting a genetic predisposition linked to LRCH1 variations (Spector2006Association).

In ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, LRCH1 expression is significantly decreased in the colonic mucosa and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients. This reduction in expression correlates negatively with disease activity, indicating that LRCH1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of UC by modulating CD4+ T cell migration (Wang2020LRCH1).

LRCH1 also acts as a negative regulator of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Knockout studies in NK-92 cells have shown that the absence of LRCH1 enhances their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, suggesting potential implications for cancer immunotherapy (Dai2020Leucine).

## Interactions
LRCH1 is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune cell functions. In natural killer (NK) cells, LRCH1 acts as a negative regulator by interacting with the surface receptor NKp30 and Src family kinases, which affects cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Dai2020Leucine; Rivière2020Structure). The knockout of LRCH1 in NK-92 cells enhances their cytotoxicity against tumor cells, associated with increased cytokine secretion and granzyme B expression, suggesting that LRCH1 modulates these processes through its interactions (Dai2020Leucine).

In CD8+ T cells, LRCH1 binds to the linker for activation of T cells (LAT), inhibiting TCR signaling, which impacts infection clearance and tumor cell cytotoxicity (Rivière2020Structure). In CD4+ T cells, LRCH1 interacts with DOCK8, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. This interaction is significant in autoimmune disease models, where LRCH1 overexpression reduces CD4+ T cell infiltration, while its deficiency increases migration and inflammation (Rivière2020Structure).

In microglia, LRCH1 regulates activation through a p38 MAPK and ERK1/2-dependent pathway, affecting inflammatory responses and neuronal death (Chen2020Inhibition). These interactions highlight LRCH1's role in modulating immune responses and cellular functions.
