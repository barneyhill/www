# MRPS14

## Overview
The MRPS14 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S14, a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for mitochondrial function and energy production. MRPS14 is characterized by its basic nature, with a high isoelectric point, and includes a mito-specific N-terminal extension that interacts with other ribosomal proteins, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Kaushal2014CryoEM; Cavdar2001The; O’Brien2003Properties). The protein's interactions within the ribosome are critical for the assembly and function of the mitochondrial translation machinery, underscoring its importance in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).

## Structure
The MRPS14 protein is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The primary structure of MRPS14 consists of 128 amino acids, with a full-length molecular mass of 15.1 kDa and a mature protein mass of 12.3 kDa after cleavage (Cavdar2001The). The protein has a high isoelectric point (pI) of 11.5, indicating a basic nature (O’Brien2003Properties).

In terms of secondary structure, MRPS14 includes a mito-specific N-terminal extension (NTE), which is oriented on the solvent side and potentially interacts with other ribosomal proteins such as MRP S24 (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The tertiary structure of MRPS14 is not detailed in the available sources, but it is known to be part of a central cluster in the head of the mitochondrial small subunit, suggesting a role in stabilizing the ribosomal structure (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

MRPS14 is involved in quaternary interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome, particularly with proteins like MRPS7/uS7m, which helps create binding sites for late proteins, including MRPS14/uS14m (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural). The protein's interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome. Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of MRPS14 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
MRPS14 encodes a protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein is involved in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for mitochondrial function and energy production (O’Brien2003Properties). MRPS14 is part of a central cluster in the head of the mitochondrial small subunit, interacting with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins such as MRPS10 and MRPS24. Its N-terminal extension is oriented on the solvent side, potentially interacting with MRPS24, indicating its structural role in the mitochondrial small subunit (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome, including MRPS14, is responsible for synthesizing 13 membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for cellular respiration and energy production (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The unique structural features of MRPS14 and its interactions within the ribosome suggest its involvement in recruiting mitochondrial-specific mRNAs, contributing to the specialized function of the mitochondrial ribosome in protein synthesis (Kaushal2014CryoEM). This function is vital for maintaining cellular metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPS14 gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions. A notable pathogenic variant, c.322C>T, leads to perinatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, neonatal lactic acidosis, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, and neurological involvement. This mutation results in an amino acid change from arginine to cysteine at position 108, disrupting mitochondrial translation by affecting interactions within the ribosome, particularly with ribosomal protein uS10m and the 12S rRNA (Jackson2018A). Despite the stability of the mitoribosome, this variant impairs translation efficiency, leading to deficiencies in respiratory chain complexes, especially complexes I and IV (Jackson2018A).

The MRPS14 mutation does not affect the assembly or stability of the mitoribosome but disrupts its function during translation elongation or mitochondrial mRNA recruitment, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation (Jackson2018A). The mutation's pathogenicity is further supported by its segregation in affected families and high conservation of the mutation site (Jackson2018A). These findings underscore the critical role of MRPS14 in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on severe mitochondrial disorders.

## Interactions
MRPS14 is a component of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (28S) and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation. It interacts with the ribosomal protein uS10m and the sugar phosphate backbone of 12S rRNA. The R108C mutation in MRPS14 affects the interaction of the lateral chain of Arg108 with these components, likely disrupting the conformation of the mRNA channel or the ribosome decoding center, which impacts mitochondrial translation elongation or mRNA recruitment (Jackson2018A).

MRPS14 is also involved in the recruitment and guidance of mitochondrial mRNAs to the ribosome, which is essential for efficient translation. This interaction is crucial for the function of the mitoribosome during translation elongation or mitochondrial mRNA recruitment, rather than its assembly or stability (Jackson2018A).

Additionally, MRPS14 has been identified as one of the proteins interacting with C4orf14, a protein associated with the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This interaction suggests a role for MRPS14 in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit and its involvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis or mtRNA metabolism (He2012Human).
