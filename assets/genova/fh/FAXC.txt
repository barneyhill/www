# FAXC

## Overview
FAXC is a gene that encodes the protein known as "Failed Axon Connections Homolog," which is characterized by its metaxin-like GST domain. This protein is part of the metaxin family, which is known for its involvement in cellular processes related to mitochondrial function and protein import. The FAXC protein is distinguished by its structural features, including conserved GST_N_Metaxin and GST_C_Metaxin domains, and is predominantly composed of α-helical segments. It is predicted to form heterodimers with other metaxin family members, such as MTX2, MTX1, and MTX3, although it does not form homodimers. The protein's structural and interaction characteristics suggest a potential role in axonal development, although its specific functions and clinical significance remain to be fully elucidated (Adolph2023FAXC; Oakley2023Hidden).

## Structure
The FAXC protein, encoded by the human gene FAXC, exhibits structural features characteristic of metaxin-like proteins. It contains conserved domains such as GST_N_Metaxin and GST_C_Metaxin, which are typical of the metaxin protein family (Adolph2024CDR; Adolph2023FAXC). The secondary structure of FAXC is dominated by α-helical segments, specifically arranged in a pattern similar to metaxin proteins, with helices labeled H1 through H8 (Adolph2024CDR; Adolph2023FAXC). Additionally, FAXC proteins contain a conserved β-sheet motif, known as the metaxin β-sheet motif, which is shared with metaxin and CDR proteins (Adolph2024CDR).

In terms of tertiary structure, FAXC is predicted to form homodimers with MTX2, a protein with the highest sequence similarity to FAXC, and potentially heterodimers with MTX1 and MTX3 (Oakley2023Hidden). The GST-like domains of FAXC are predicted to have helices inserted between the canonical α4 and α5 helices, blocking the 'G-site' and preventing GSH binding, a feature shared among metaxins (Oakley2023Hidden). FAXC lacks the transmembrane α-helix found in vertebrate metaxin 1 proteins, indicating differences in membrane association (Adolph2024CDR).

## Function


## Interactions
FAXC, also known as "Failed Axon Connections Homolog," is predicted to interact with proteins within the metaxin family. It is particularly noted for forming a heterodimer with MTX2, a member of the metaxin family, with a high MC score of 0.90, indicating a strong interaction (Oakley2023Hidden). Phylogenetic analysis supports the prediction that FAXC is an outlying member of the metaxin family, suggesting its interactions are specific and significant within this group (Oakley2023Hidden).

While FAXC is predicted to form heterodimers with MTX2, MTX1, and MTX3, it does not form homodimers (Oakley2023Hidden). The human protein with the highest sequence similarity to FAXC is MTX2, reinforcing the likelihood of their interaction (Oakley2023Hidden). Despite these predictions, there is limited experimental or clinical data on FAXC interactions, and its specific roles in cellular processes remain largely unexplored (Adolph2023FAXC; Oakley2023Hidden). The potential role of FAXC in axonal development is suggested by its structural similarities to Drosophila proteins, but specific interactions in various species are not detailed (Adolph2023FAXC).
