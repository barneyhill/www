# GOLGA6L25

## Overview
GOLGA6L25 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 25, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil structure and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, playing a crucial role in maintaining its structure and function. Golgin A6 family like 25 is involved in vesicle tethering and trafficking processes within the cell, contributing to the proper sorting and modification of proteins and lipids. The specific functions and interactions of golgin A6 family like 25 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be important for cellular homeostasis and may have implications in various diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
