# METTL14

## Overview
METTL14 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 14, N6-adenosine-methyltransferase subunit, which is a crucial component of the m6A methyltransferase complex. This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, although it is catalytically inactive, and it plays a significant role in RNA metabolism by facilitating the methylation of adenosine residues in RNA. METTL14 forms a heterodimer with METTL3, contributing to the structural integrity and RNA binding capacity of the complex, which is essential for post-transcriptional modifications that influence RNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation (Śledź2016Structural; Liu2013A). The METTL3-METTL14 complex is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA methylation patterns crucial for gene expression and cellular differentiation (Liu2013A). METTL14's interactions with other proteins and its role in RNA processing underscore its importance in both normal cellular functions and disease states, such as cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes (Jiang2024The; Weng2018METTL14).

## Structure
METTL14 is a component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, forming a heterodimer with METTL3. The METTL14 protein features a methyltransferase domain (MTD) that adopts a Rossman fold, characterized by a central, curved, eight-stranded beta sheet flanked by four alpha helices (Śledź2016Structural). Despite its structural similarity to METTL3, METTL14 lacks catalytic activity due to a degenerate active site and the absence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding sites (Śledź2016Structural). The METTL14 structure includes an N-terminal extension that interacts with METTL3 and a C-terminal extension with RGG repeats, which are crucial for RNA substrate recognition and binding (Schöller2018Interactions; Zhou2021The).

The METTL3-METTL14 complex forms a compact pseudosymmetric heterodimer, with METTL14 playing a non-catalytic role in maintaining the integrity of the complex and facilitating RNA binding (Śledź2016Structural). The dimerization involves an extensive interface with hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, and the N-terminal helical motif of METTL14 shields the hydrophobic dimerization interface from solvent exposure (Śledź2016Structural). The METTL14 protein also features a Cys338-Cys388 disulfide bridge, although disulfide bond formation is not required for its function (Śledź2016Structural).

## Function
METTL14 is a critical component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, which plays a significant role in RNA metabolism by catalyzing the methylation of adenosine residues in RNA. This modification is a prevalent post-transcriptional modification that influences RNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation. METTL14 forms a stable heterodimer with METTL3, and together they are responsible for m6A deposition on nuclear RNAs, impacting gene expression and cellular differentiation (Liu2013A).

The METTL3-METTL14 complex is co-localized with splicing factors in nuclear speckles, indicating its involvement in RNA processing. This complex is essential for maintaining proper mRNA methylation patterns, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including mRNA stability and degradation (Liu2013A). Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing METTL14 levels leads to decreased m6A levels, highlighting its significant role in maintaining m6A levels (Liu2013A).

In addition to its role in RNA methylation, METTL14 is involved in regulating mRNA translation, particularly in the context of cellular differentiation and development, such as in murine spermatogenesis (Lin2017Mettl3Mettl14mediated). The stability and localization of METTL14 within nuclear speckles are maintained by interactions with Lamin A, which prevents its degradation and is crucial for cellular senescence processes (Zhang2020Lamin).

## Clinical Significance
METTL14 plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing disease progression and prognosis. In pancreatic cancer, METTL14 is often upregulated, promoting tumor growth and metastasis, and is associated with poor overall survival (Wang2020Upregulation). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), METTL14 expression is typically downregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis (Shi2022The). This downregulation is linked to reduced survival rates and larger tumor sizes (Hu2023METTL14‑mediated).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), lower METTL14 levels are associated with poor prognosis, as it affects the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration (Hu2023METTL14‑mediated). In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), METTL14 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing PTEN mRNA, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis (Yao2021The). Its downregulation in STAD is linked to larger tumors and advanced stages (Yao2021The).

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), elevated METTL14 expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased bone marrow blasts, and shorter survival, suggesting its role in disease progression (Jiang2024The). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), METTL14 is overexpressed, particularly in cases with specific chromosomal translocations, contributing to leukemogenesis (Weng2018METTL14).

## Interactions
METTL14 is a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, forming a heterodimer with METTL3. This complex is responsible for N6-adenosine methylation in RNA, a modification that affects mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency. METTL14, although catalytically inactive, plays a crucial role in RNA binding and maintaining the structural integrity of the complex. The interaction between METTL3 and METTL14 is essential for the stability and function of the complex, with METTL14 contributing to the architecture of the catalytic center and serving as an RNA binding scaffold (Śledź2016Structural; Schöller2018Interactions).

METTL14 interacts with WTAP, a splicing regulator that is essential for the localization of the METTL3-METTL14 complex to nuclear speckles. This interaction is weaker compared to the METTL3-METTL14 interaction but is crucial for the complex's function in m6A methylation (Liu2013A). The C-terminal RGG repeats of METTL14 are important for RNA binding, and their deletion reduces the methylation activity of the complex. These repeats are thought to recognize secondary RNA structures rather than specific sequences (Schöller2018Interactions; Qi2022RNA). METTL14's interactions with RNA and other proteins highlight its role in the regulation of RNA processing and modification.
