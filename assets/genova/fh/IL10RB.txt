# IL10RB

## Overview
The IL10RB gene encodes the interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta, a type I transmembrane protein that is integral to the immune system's regulatory mechanisms. This protein is a critical component of the receptor complexes for several cytokines, including interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-22, IL-26, and interferon-λ, playing a pivotal role in modulating immune responses. As part of the IL-10 receptor complex, IL10RB forms a heterotetrameric structure with IL10RA subunits, facilitating the activation of the JAK1-TIK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, which is essential for anti-inflammatory responses and immune homeostasis (AcunerOzbabacan2014The; Grk2023Association). Mutations or dysregulation of IL10RB can lead to various immune-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and viral infections (Korol2022Fulminant; Mukhopadhyay2019Loss).

## Structure
The IL10RB protein, or interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta, is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in immune regulation. It is part of the receptor complex for interleukin 10 (IL-10) and other cytokines, including IL-22, IL-26, and IFN-λ. The IL10RB protein is composed of three domains: intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular (AcunerOzbabacan2014The). 

The primary structure of IL10RB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and ligands. The quaternary structure involves its association with IL10RA to form a functional receptor complex, which is necessary for IL-10 signaling (AcunerOzbabacan2014The).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in IL10RB and affect its molecular weight and function. For instance, the W100G variant of IL10RB exhibits aberrant glycosylation, which impacts its molecular weight and surface expression (Korol2022Fulminant). These modifications are crucial for the protein's stability and interaction with other molecules.

## Function
The IL10RB gene encodes the interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta, a critical component of the IL-10 receptor complex, which is essential for IL-10 signaling in immune cells. This receptor subunit is part of a heterotetrameric complex that includes two IL10RA and two IL10RB subunits, facilitating the activation of the JAK1-TIK2-STAT3 signaling cascade. This pathway is crucial for immunoregulation, as it suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreases macrophage activity, and inhibits monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells (Grk2023Association).

IL10RB is ubiquitously expressed and participates in the formation of receptor complexes for other cytokines, such as IL-22, IL-26, and interferon-λ, contributing to immune homeostasis and regulation (Hikami2008Association). In macrophages, IL10RB is vital for mediating IL-10's anti-inflammatory effects, regulating genes involved in cytokine signaling pathways, and maintaining a balanced immune environment (Mukhopadhyay2019Loss). The absence of IL-10 signaling due to IL10RB mutations can lead to excessive macrophage activation and impaired host defense, contributing to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (Mukhopadhyay2019Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL10RB gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in immune regulation. IL10RB mutations can lead to very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) and candidiasis. These mutations result in defects in immune inhibitory mechanisms, causing hyper-activation of the immune response and extensive tissue damage (Yazdani2019Candidiasis). IL10RB deficiency is also linked to fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH), particularly in patients with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease. This deficiency disrupts the IL-10 response pathway, contributing to severe liver conditions upon infection with hepatitis A virus (Korol2022Fulminant).

In the context of COVID-19, increased expression of IL10RB is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including severe disease and death. Overexpression of IL10RB has been shown to increase the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. This gene's dysregulation is linked to severe outcomes such as respiratory failure and tracheostomy complications (Voloudakis2021IL10RB).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of IL10RB in various diseases, emphasizing the importance of understanding its genetic and expression alterations in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
IL10RB, or interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta, is a component of the interleukin-10 receptor complex and plays a crucial role in mediating immune responses. It forms a heterodimer with IL10RA to facilitate IL-10 signaling, which is essential for anti-inflammatory responses. Beyond its interaction with IL10RA, IL10RB also interacts with other cytokine receptors, including those for IL-22, IL-26, and IFN-λ1, allowing it to participate in diverse immune regulatory functions (Sharifinejad2022The; Korol2022Fulminant).

IL10RB is involved in the JAK1-TIK2-STAT3 signaling cascade, which is crucial for immunoregulation. This pathway is activated upon cytokine binding, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, which are key transcription factors in the immune response (Korol2022Fulminant; Grk2023Association). Mutations in IL10RB, such as the W100G variant, can impair these signaling pathways, affecting the cellular response to cytokines like IL-10, IL-22, and IFN-λ1 (Korol2022Fulminant).

IL10RB's ability to interact with multiple cytokines and participate in various signaling pathways underscores its importance in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Sharifinejad2022The).
