# PEX1

## Overview
The PEX1 gene encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 1, a crucial protein involved in the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes, which are essential organelles for various metabolic processes in human cells. As a member of the AAA ATPase family, the PEX1 protein plays a pivotal role in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes, working in concert with other proteins such as PEX6 and PEX26 to facilitate this process (Ott2022Comparison; Tamura1998Human). The PEX1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including two ATPase domains that are vital for its function in ATP hydrolysis and protein interactions (Judy2022Insights). Mutations in the PEX1 gene are the most common cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Crane2005PEX1mutations). Understanding the function and interactions of PEX1 is critical for elucidating the mechanisms underlying these disorders and developing potential therapeutic strategies.

## Structure
The PEX1 protein is a member of the AAA ATPase family and plays a crucial role in peroxisome biogenesis. It forms a hexameric complex with PEX6, characterized by alternating subunits. Each PEX1 subunit contains two N-terminal domains (N1 and N2) and two ATPase domains (D1 and D2) (Judy2022Insights; Gardner2015The). The ATPase domains form two stacked rings around a central pore, with the D1 ring involved in nucleotide binding and the D2 ring responsible for ATP hydrolysis (Judy2022Insights).

The N-terminal domain of PEX1 is composed of two globular subdomains: a double-barrel fold in the N-terminal lobe and a β-barrel in the C-terminal lobe, connected by a short linker (Shiozawa2004Structure). This domain is structurally similar to the N-domains of other AAA-ATPases like NSF and VCP, despite low sequence identity (Shiozawa2004Structure). The N1 domain of PEX1 is mobile and not resolved in cryo-EM structures, likely due to its flexible attachment (Blok2015Unique).

PEX1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Variants in PEX1 are associated with peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger syndrome (Pedrosa2019A).

## Function
The PEX1 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for peroxisome biogenesis and maintenance in human cells. PEX1 is a member of the AAA-type ATPase family and plays a significant role in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes, which are essential for various metabolic pathways, including the beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and the synthesis of ether lipids and bile acids (Tamura1998Human). In healthy cells, PEX1, along with PEX6 and PEX26, forms part of the export complex responsible for extracting the receptor PEX5 from the peroxisomal membrane after it has delivered its cargo. This process is vital for maintaining peroxisome homeostasis and ensuring the proper import of matrix proteins (Ott2022Comparison).

PEX1 is also involved in regulating the number and size of peroxisomes. In PEX1-deficient cells, there is an increased number of smaller peroxisomal vesicles, indicating a role in peroxisome morphology and abundance (Ott2022Comparison). The protein's N-terminal region is particularly important for its function in matrix protein import, while its AAA+ ATPase domains are essential for both protein import and peroxisome abundance (Ott2022Comparison). PEX1's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm and peroxisomal membrane, where it interacts with other peroxisomal biogenesis factors to maintain cellular homeostasis and metabolic functions (Tamura1998Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX1 gene are the most common cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), particularly those within the Zellweger spectrum, which includes Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD) (Rosewich2005Genetic; Crane2005PEX1mutations). These disorders are characterized by impaired peroxisome function, leading to a range of clinical manifestations such as developmental delays, neurological abnormalities, and liver dysfunction (Preuss2002PEX1).

Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form, often resulting in death within the first year of life, while NALD and IRD present with milder symptoms and longer survival (Rosewich2005Genetic). The severity of these disorders is linked to the type of PEX1 mutation. Null mutations, which result in a complete loss of PEX1 function, are associated with severe phenotypes, whereas missense mutations lead to milder forms (Crane2005PEX1mutations; Maxwell2002NovelPEX1).

The PEX1 protein interacts with PEX6, and mutations that disrupt this interaction, such as the G843D mutation, can impair peroxisomal protein import, contributing to disease pathology (Geisbrecht1998Disruption). The clinical significance of PEX1 gene expression alterations is underscored by their impact on disease severity and progression (Preuss2002PEX1).

## Interactions
PEX1, a peroxisomal biogenesis factor, interacts with several proteins to facilitate peroxisome assembly and function. It forms a heterohexameric complex with PEX6, another AAA ATPase, which is crucial for peroxisomal protein import. This complex is ATP-dependent, with ATP binding and hydrolysis playing key roles in their interaction and function (Tamura2006Dynamic; Gardner2015The). The PEX1/PEX6 complex is recruited to peroxisomes by PEX26, forming a ternary complex essential for peroxisomal localization (Tamura2006Dynamic).

PEX1 also interacts with ubiquitinated PEX5, a peroxisomal protein-shuttling receptor. The PEX1/PEX6 complex extracts PEX5 from the peroxisomal membrane in an ATP-dependent manner, a process necessary for initiating a new cycle of protein import into peroxisomes (Pedrosa2018Peroxisomal). The interaction with PEX5 involves the ubiquitin moiety, suggesting that PEX5 is a natural substrate for the PEX1/PEX6 complex (Pedrosa2019A).

PEX1's interaction with PEX6 is also influenced by PEX15, a peroxisome membrane anchor, which modulates the ATPase activity of the PEX1/PEX6 complex, indicating a regulatory role in substrate engagement (Gardner2015The). These interactions are critical for maintaining peroxisomal function and integrity.
