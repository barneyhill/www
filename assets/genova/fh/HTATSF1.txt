# HTATSF1

## Overview
HTATSF1, or HIV-1 Tat specific factor 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in RNA processing and transcriptional regulation. The protein, also referred to as HIV-1 Tat specific factor 1, is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in mRNA maturation, export, and splicing. It is a component of complexes that include SF3B1 and P-TEFb, which are essential for transcription elongation and splicing (Tóth2023ArreSTick; Ansa2024Inhibition). HTATSF1 also interacts with β-arrestin2, influencing its subcellular localization and suggesting a regulatory role in intracellular transport (Tóth2023ArreSTick). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, HTATSF1 is implicated in cancer progression and HIV-1 replication, highlighting its clinical significance in disease contexts (Green2012Impact; Chang2021Metabolic).

## Function
HTATSF1, also known as HIV-1 Tat specific factor 1, is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in RNA processing and splicing, contributing to mRNA maturation and export. HTATSF1 is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in transcriptional regulation and gene expression (Tóth2023ArreSTick). The protein is part of a complex with other factors, such as SF3B1 and P-TEFb, which are essential for transcription elongation and splicing (Ansa2024Inhibition).

HTATSF1 interacts with β-arrestin2 (βarr2) through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, which is crucial for its nucleocytoplasmic transport. This interaction allows βarr2 to shift HTATSF1's localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting a regulatory role in intracellular localization similar to its function with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Tóth2023ArreSTick).

In addition to its role in RNA metabolism, HTATSF1 is implicated in cellular homeostasis and may influence cell proliferation by affecting transcription and splicing targets related to the cell cycle and nucleic acid metabolism (Green2012Impact). These functions highlight HTATSF1's importance in maintaining normal cellular activities and its potential impact on organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
HTATSF1 (HIV-1 Tat specific factor 1) is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. In lung cancer, HTATSF1 is associated with poor clinical outcomes. High expression levels of HTATSF1, along with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), correlate with decreased overall survival and disease-free survival in lung cancer patients. The interaction between HTATSF1 and PGK1 promotes cancer cell migration and metastasis, suggesting that HTATSF1 plays a significant role in cancer progression (Chang2021Metabolic).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, HTATSF1 functions as a host dependency factor (HDF) for viral replication. Suppression of HTATSF1 using RNA interference techniques has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells, although the effect is modest compared to other cofactors like LEDGF/p75. This suggests that while HTATSF1 is involved in enhancing viral processes such as transcription elongation and splicing, it is not critical for these activities. The potential for targeting HTATSF1 as a therapeutic strategy against HIV-1 is limited due to the modest impact on viral replication and possible growth disadvantages in cells (Green2012Impact).

## Interactions
HTATSF1, also known as HIV-1 Tat specific factor 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in transcriptional regulation and cancer metastasis. It interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), a glycolytic enzyme, in lung cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for promoting lung cancer cell migration, as demonstrated by the inhibition of migration upon HTATSF1 knockdown (Chang2021Metabolic). HTATSF1 also interacts with β-arrestin2 through the arreSTick motif, a phosphorylation-dependent interaction that influences its subcellular localization by shifting HTATSF1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Tóth2023ArreSTick).

In the context of transcription, HTATSF1 is part of a chromatin complex with SF3B1 and P-TEFb, which includes CDK9 and Cyclin T1. This complex is involved in recruiting P-TEFb to chromatin, facilitating transcription elongation (Ansa2024Inhibition). HTATSF1 also interacts with the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), as identified through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, indicating its role as a transcriptional cofactor (Tappenden2013The). These interactions highlight HTATSF1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including transcription regulation and cancer progression.
