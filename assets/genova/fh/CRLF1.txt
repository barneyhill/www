# CRLF1

## Overview
The CRLF1 gene encodes the cytokine receptor-like factor 1, a secreted protein that is part of the cytokine type I receptor family. This protein plays a crucial role in immune system regulation and fetal development by forming a complex with cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1). The CRLF1/CLCF1 complex is essential for activating the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) pathway, which is involved in neuronal survival, development, and immune response regulation. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating its involvement in hematopoiesis and immune function (Kass2011Cytokinelike; Crisponi2022CRLF1). Mutations in the CRLF1 gene are linked to clinical conditions such as Crisponi syndrome and cold-induced sweating syndrome type 1, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal physiological processes (Buers2019Crisponicold‐induced; Crisponi2007Crisponi).

## Structure
The CRLF1 protein is encoded by the CRLF1 gene, which consists of nine exons located on chromosome 19p13.11. The protein is a precursor of 422 amino acids, including a 37 amino acid signal peptide, and has a molecular weight of 46 kDa (Crisponi2022CRLF1). CRLF1 is part of the cytokine type I receptor family and contains a hematopoietin domain with fibronectin type III modules and a conserved WSXWS motif, which is indicative of its functional role (Crisponi2022CRLF1). The protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, suggesting it is a secreted protein (Kass2011Cytokinelike).

CRLF1 forms a stable complex with cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLCF1), which is secreted only when complexed with CRLF1. This complex is involved in signaling through the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), leading to downstream activation of pathways such as JAK1/STAT3 (Crisponi2022CRLF1). The CRLF1/CLCF1 complex is a more potent inducer of STAT3 phosphorylation than CLCF1 alone, suggesting that CRLF1 stabilizes CLCF1 and increases its affinity for CNTFR (Crisponi2022CRLF1). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (Crisponi2022CRLF1).

## Function
The CRLF1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cytokine type I receptor family, playing a significant role in immune system regulation and fetal development. CRLF1 is involved in forming a complex with cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), which activates the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) pathway. This complex is crucial for neuronal survival and development, as well as immune response regulation (Dagoneau2007Mutations; Crisponi2022CRLF1).

In healthy human cells, CRLF1 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, indicating its involvement in hematopoiesis and immune function. It is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses during inflammation (Crisponi2022CRLF1). CRLF1 also interacts with SorLA, which influences the cellular response to the CRLF1/CLCF1 complex by mediating endocytosis and degradation or enhancing signaling, particularly in CNTFR-deficient cells (Crisponi2022CRLF1).

The CRLF1/CLCF1 complex is involved in the activation of signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, which are important for various cellular functions, including the regulation of NK and T cell activities (Crisponi2022CRLF1). This signaling is essential for maintaining normal physiological processes, including respiratory and musculoskeletal functions (Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRLF1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily Crisponi syndrome and cold-induced sweating syndrome type 1 (CISS1). These conditions are characterized by autonomic dysfunction and skeletal abnormalities. Crisponi syndrome presents with severe neonatal symptoms such as febrile crises, orofacial muscle contractions, and feeding difficulties, often leading to early mortality (Dagoneau2007Mutations; Crisponi2007Crisponi). In contrast, CISS1 manifests with milder symptoms, including cold-induced sweating and skeletal deformities, which typically appear later in life (Buers2019Crisponicold‐induced; Crisponi2022CRLF1).

CRLF1 mutations disrupt the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) pathway, affecting peripheral sudomotor functions and leading to paradoxical sweating (Crisponi2007Crisponi). The gene's role in cholinergic differentiation of sympathetic neurons is crucial for proper sweat gland function, and its impairment is linked to thermoregulatory abnormalities (Buers2019Crisponicold‐induced; Crisponi2022CRLF1).

Altered expression of CRLF1 has also been implicated in papillary thyroid carcinoma, where it promotes tumorigenesis through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2018CRLF1).
