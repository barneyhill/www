# RTN4RL1

## Overview
RTN4RL1 is a gene that encodes the protein reticulon 4 receptor-like 1, which is a member of the Nogo receptor family. This protein functions primarily as a receptor involved in the inhibition of axonal growth and regeneration within the central nervous system (CNS). It is a transmembrane protein that forms part of multi-subunit receptor complexes, interacting with proteins such as Nogo-A, p75, TROY, and LINGO1 to mediate signaling pathways that restrict neural plasticity, particularly following CNS injuries (ThiedeStan2015Attractive). Beyond its role in neural processes, RTN4RL1 is implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with integrins to influence tumor growth and neuroendocrine differentiation, notably in prostate cancer (Quaglia2022The). The gene has also been associated with various clinical conditions, including 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 17p13.3 microdeletions, highlighting its significance in both neural development and disease (Emrick2019Microdeletions; Perlstein2014White).

## Function
RTN4RL1, also known as reticulon 4 receptor-like 1, encodes a protein that is part of the Nogo receptor family, which plays a crucial role in inhibiting axonal growth and regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). This protein is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it forms multi-subunit receptor complexes with other proteins such as Nogo-A, p75, TROY, and LINGO1. These complexes are involved in signaling pathways that restrict axonal regeneration and structural plasticity, particularly after CNS injuries (ThiedeStan2015Attractive).

The RTN4RL1 protein interacts with myelin-associated inhibitors like Nogo-A, which binds to the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) to inhibit neurite outgrowth and fibroblast spreading. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper neural circuitry and preventing inappropriate axonal growth, which is essential for the correct formation of neural pathways during development and in response to injury (ThiedeStan2015Attractive). The protein's activity at the neuronal growth cone involves the recruitment of co-receptors and additional complex partners, influencing the cytoskeleton and affecting transcription factors that control gene expression related to growth promotion or restriction (ThiedeStan2015Attractive).

## Clinical Significance
The RTN4RL1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in neural development and its interactions with other proteins. In individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), variations in the RTN4RL1 gene, specifically the rs701428 SNP, have been associated with white matter abnormalities and symptoms of psychosis. These alterations in white matter integrity, particularly in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, suggest a potential link to schizophrenia in these patients (Perlstein2014White).

RTN4RL1 has also been identified as a candidate gene for white matter changes in individuals with 17p13.3 microdeletions. These deletions are associated with brain malformations and leukoencephalopathy, indicating that RTN4RL1 haploinsufficiency may contribute to these phenotypes (Emrick2019Microdeletions).

In prostate cancer, RTN4RL1, also known as NgR2, is involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor progression. It acts as an effector of the αVβ3 integrin, promoting tumor growth and cell motility, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer treatment (Quaglia2022The).

RTN4RL1 has also been associated with breast cancer risk in African American women, although the clinical significance of this association requires further investigation (Haddad2016An).

## Interactions
RTN4RL1, also known as the Nogo receptor NgR2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In prostate cancer cells, NgR2 interacts with the αVβ3 integrin, forming a complex that promotes neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor growth. This interaction is novel and suggests that NgR2, when associated with αVβ3 integrin, may contribute to a pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic phenotype in prostate cancer cells (Quaglia2022The).

NgR2 is also part of the Nogo receptor family, which includes NgR1 and NgR3. These receptors share a similar domain structure, featuring leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and are anchored to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. NgR2 specifically binds to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) with high affinity, distinguishing it from NgR1, which binds MAG with lower affinity, and NgR3, which does not bind MAG or other tested ligands (Venkatesh2005The).

These interactions highlight the role of NgR2 in both cancer progression and neural processes, where it participates in complex signaling pathways that regulate cell motility and growth.
