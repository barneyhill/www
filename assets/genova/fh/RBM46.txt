# RBM46

## Overview
RBM46 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 46, which is categorized as an RNA-binding protein. This protein plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation by interacting with both proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of mRNA stability and degradation. In particular, RBM46 has been shown to target β-Catenin mRNA for degradation, thereby influencing the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for stem cell differentiation and development (Zhai2017Rbm46). Additionally, RBM46 is implicated in spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis, where it binds to mRNAs with specific motifs, forming complexes with other proteins essential for these processes (Peart2022The). The presence of RBM46 in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells suggests its conserved function across species in stem cell-related activities (Dvir2021Uncovering).

## Interactions
RBM46 is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), RBM46 targets β-Catenin mRNA for degradation, influencing the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for stem cell differentiation (Zhai2017Rbm46). This interaction is independent of GSK-3β activity, a component of the β-Catenin destruction complex, indicating a specific regulatory mechanism by RBM46 (Zhai2017Rbm46).

RBM46 also interacts with P-bodies, cellular structures involved in mRNA degradation, suggesting that it may target β-Catenin mRNA for degradation through these interactions. Mass spectrometry analysis has identified interactions with several proteins, including Pabpc1, a component of P-bodies (Zhai2017Rbm46).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), RBM46 is identified as a specific RNA-binding protein, suggesting its involvement in stem cell-related processes across species (Dvir2021Uncovering). In the context of spermatogonial differentiation in mice, RBM46 binds to mRNAs with a U-rich motif, which are involved in RNA processing, meiosis, and translation regulation. It forms part of a complex with proteins such as MEIOC, XRN1, and YTHDC2, which are essential for meiosis and spermatogenesis (Peart2022The).
