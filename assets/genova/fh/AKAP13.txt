# AKAP13

## Overview
AKAP13, or A-kinase anchoring protein 13, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein, also referred to as AKAP13, is characterized by its ability to anchor protein kinase A (PKA) to specific subcellular locations, thereby facilitating the regulation of diverse molecular processes. As a scaffold protein, AKAP13 plays a pivotal role in the modulation of mTORC1 activity, influencing cell growth and metabolism. Additionally, it functions as a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), crucial for the activation of RhoA, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movement. AKAP13 is implicated in several physiological processes, including cardiac development and signal transduction pathways, and is associated with various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer (Diviani2001AKAPLbc; Zhang2021AKAP13; Mayers2010The).

## Structure
AKAP13 is a large protein composed of 2817 amino acids and contains several domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins. These domains include ankyrin repeats (AR) for protein-protein interactions, a PKA RIIα subunit domain for anchoring PKA, a C1 domain that binds phorbol esters, a dbl homology (DH) domain associated with guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity for RhoA, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Zhang2021AKAP13). The DH domain interacts with the switch I and switch II loops of RhoA, while the PH domain is dispensable for nucleotide exchange but important for localization and transformative activity (Abdul2014The).

The AKAP13 protein functions as a scaffold, positioning PKA in proximity to mTORC1, which leads to the phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser 791 and subsequent inhibition of mTORC1 (Zhang2021AKAP13). AKAP13 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and does not localize to the lysosome (Zhang2021AKAP13). It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and has multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. The protein's structure allows it to form signaling complexes with RhoA and PKA, as well as interact with several hormones (Cayton2022AKAP13).

## Function
AKAP13, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 13, functions as a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways. It anchors protein kinase A (PKA) to specific cellular locations, facilitating the regulation of various molecular processes. AKAP13 is involved in the regulation of mTORC1 activity, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. It positions PKA near mTORC1, leading to the phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser 791, which inhibits mTORC1 activity. This regulation is significant for controlling cell size, proliferation, and tumorigenesis (Zhang2021AKAP13).

AKAP13 also acts as a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the activation of RhoA, a small GTPase involved in actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly. This activity is crucial for maintaining cell structure and movement (Diviani2001AKAPLbc). The protein is activated through a Gα12-mediated pathway, which is triggered by extracellular ligands such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and thrombin, indicating its role in signal transduction pathways that respond to external stimuli (Diviani2001AKAPLbc).

In cardiac development, AKAP13 is essential for the differentiation of cardiomyocytes and sarcomere formation, influencing the expression of transcription factors like MEF2C, which are vital for heart morphogenesis (Mayers2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AKAP13 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In cardiovascular diseases, AKAP13 is associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease due to its role in the MAPK signaling pathway. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11638762, located in the GATA-3 binding site of AKAP13, has been linked to high blood pressure and may alter AKAP13 expression, potentially affecting cardiac development and blood pressure regulation (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations).

In cancer, AKAP13 mutations are associated with endometrial cancer prognosis, where they correlate with longer overall survival. These mutations result in lower mRNA levels in endometrial cancer samples compared to wild-type samples (Qiao2019Mutations). AKAP13 is also involved in breast cancer, where it is essential for the phosphorylation of ERαS305, leading to tamoxifen resistance (Qiao2019Mutations).

In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), AKAP13 expression levels predict response to tipifarnib treatment. Low expression is associated with a higher response rate, while overexpression increases resistance to the drug (Raponi2007Identification).

AKAP13 also plays a role in bone metabolism, with genetic variants linked to atypical femoral fractures and changes in bone density (del2024High).

## Interactions
AKAP13, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 13, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. AKAP13 interacts with the PKA holoenzyme, specifically binding to both the RII and catalytic subunits of PKA. This interaction is crucial for its role as an anchoring protein, facilitating the localization of PKA to specific cellular sites (Diviani2001AKAPLbc).

AKAP13 also interacts with the 14-3-3 protein family, including 14-3-3β, 14-3-3ε, and 14-3-3ζ. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of AKAP13 on serine 1565 by PKA, which is necessary for 14-3-3 binding. The binding of 14-3-3 proteins inhibits the Rho-GEF activity of AKAP13, maintaining it in an inactive state under basal conditions (Diviani2004Anchoring).

AKAP13 forms a signaling complex with PKNα, MLTK, MKK3, and p38α, linking RhoA activation to the p38 MAPK pathway. The interaction with PKNα is modulated by 14-3-3, which inhibits the binding of PKNα to AKAP13, thereby affecting the activation of the p38α signaling complex (Cariolato2011AKinase).

AKAP13 specifically interacts with RhoA, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, in its GDP-bound or nucleotide-free conformations, but does not bind to other Rho family members like Rac1 and Cdc42. This interaction is essential for its function as a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (Diviani2001AKAPLbc).
