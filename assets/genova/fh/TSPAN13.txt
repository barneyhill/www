# TSPAN13

## Overview
TSPAN13 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 13, a member of the tetraspanin family of integral membrane proteins. Tetraspanin 13 is characterized by its four transmembrane segments and is involved in the organization of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) within the cell membrane. These microdomains facilitate interactions with other membrane proteins, influencing cellular processes such as signaling, adhesion, and migration (Mallmann2013Tetraspanin13; Charrin2009Lateral). TSPAN13 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including immune function and cancer progression, where it interacts with specific microRNAs and calcium channels, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2023The; Wang2019miR‐4732‐5p).

## Structure
Tetraspanin 13 (TSPAN13) is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane segments and two extracellular loops, with the large extracellular loop containing a conserved CCG motif (Mallmann2013Tetraspanin13; Charrin2009Lateral). The transmembrane segments S1 and S2 of TSPAN13 are crucial for its interaction with the CaV2.2 calcium channel, containing conserved amino acids that mediate tight interactions (Mallmann2013Tetraspanin13). Mutations in these segments, particularly at phenylalanine residues 55 and 57, abolish the modulation effect on CaV2.2, indicating their critical role (Mallmann2013Tetraspanin13).

TSPAN13 undergoes post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, with cysteine residues near the membrane-cytosol interface being sites for palmitate attachment (Charrin2009Lateral). The protein also features a bipartite nuclear localization signal from positions 107 to 140, suggesting potential nuclear functions (Jiang2024Tetraspaninenriched). The small intracellular loop (SIL) of tetraspanins, including TSPAN13, contains a conserved sequence that forms an M-shaped inter-helix turn, crucial for structural integrity (Reppert2022A). This structural motif is characterized by specific dihedral angles and interactions between charged residues (Reppert2022A).

## Function
TSPAN13, or tetraspanin 13, is a member of the tetraspanin family, which are integral membrane proteins involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Tetraspanins, including TSPAN13, organize membrane microdomains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), which facilitate interactions with other membrane proteins such as integrins and growth factor receptors, influencing several signaling pathways (Zhou2023The). These interactions are crucial for processes like cell adhesion and migration, which are essential for maintaining cellular communication and organization (Zou2018Expression).

In the context of immune function, TSPAN13 is expressed in certain human B cell subsets, suggesting a potential role in B cell biology, although specific molecular processes involving TSPAN13 in these cells are not detailed (Zou2018Expression). Tetraspanins, including TSPAN13, are also involved in antigen presentation and T cell activation, indicating their importance in immune responses (Zhou2023The). The expression of TSPAN13 in dendritic cells further supports its role in immune system interactions, particularly in processes like antigen presentation and migration (Zuidscherwoude2017Differential). These functions highlight TSPAN13's involvement in modulating immune responses and cellular interactions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN13 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and various cancers, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In Alzheimer's disease, the rs34331204 variant is associated with the expression of TSPAN13, with sex-specific effects. The C allele of this variant is linked to increased TSPAN13 expression in males, potentially offering a protective effect against tau pathology, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (Hu2020rs34331204).

In breast cancer, TSPAN13 is identified as a differentially expressed gene, with its expression levels varying across different subtypes and stages of the disease. It is overexpressed in several breast cancer subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, and HER2-enriched tumors, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for breast cancer progression (Mendonça2024Unlocking). However, its expression does not significantly differ between tumor and normal samples in some analyses, indicating that its role may be context-dependent (Mendonça2024Unlocking).

TSPAN13 is also a target of miR-4732-5p, a microRNA involved in breast cancer progression. This interaction suggests that TSPAN13 may play a role in tumor growth and metastasis, with miR-4732-5p acting as a tumor suppressor in early stages but promoting progression in later stages (Wang2019miR‐4732‐5p).

## Interactions
Tetraspanin 13 (TSPAN13) is known to interact with the CaV2.2 calcium channel, specifically the alpha 1 subunit, through a hydrophobic interaction involving the membrane-spanning domain IV of CaV2.2 and the transmembrane segment S2 of TSPAN13. This interaction modulates the voltage-dependent activation and inactivation kinetics of the CaV2.2 channels, suggesting a regulatory role in neurotransmitter release (Mallmann2013Tetraspanin13). The interaction was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation experiments in CHO cells, and TSPAN13 was shown to specifically affect N-type channels, not L- or T-type channels (Mallmann2013Tetraspanin13).

In cancer research, TSPAN13 is a direct target of microRNAs such as miR-369-3p and miR-4732-5p. MiR-369-3p inhibits the proliferation and promotes apoptosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma cells by targeting TSPAN13 (Zhang2024Tspan). MiR-4732-5p targets the 3′-UTR of TSPAN13, down-regulating its expression and influencing breast cancer progression (Wang2019miR‐4732‐5p). These interactions highlight TSPAN13's involvement in cancer cell behavior and its potential as a therapeutic target.
