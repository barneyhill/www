# SLC23A1

## Overview
SLC23A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 23 member 1, also known as sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 1 (SVCT1). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in the uptake and distribution of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in mammals. SVCT1 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including those in the renal proximal tubules and intestinal enterocytes, where it facilitates the reabsorption and absorption of vitamin C, respectively. The protein functions as a homodimer and is characterized by 14 transmembrane segments, which are organized into core and gate domains essential for its transport activity. The transporter's activity is driven by the sodium gradient across the plasma membrane, allowing for the concentration of ascorbate within cells. The regulation of SVCT1 involves various mechanisms, including interactions with microRNAs and protein kinases, which modulate its expression and function in response to physiological needs and environmental stressors (Subramanian2019MicroRNA103a; She2023Structural; May2011The).

## Structure
The SLC23A1 gene encodes the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 1 (SVCT1), which is crucial for vitamin C uptake and distribution in mammals. The protein structure of SVCT1 includes 14 transmembrane segments organized into two main domains: the core domain and the gate domain. The core domain is responsible for binding vitamin C, while the gate domain forms the dimeric interface, essential for the transporter's function (She2023Structural).

SVCT1 operates as a homodimer, with each protomer containing a core and a gate domain. The dimeric nature of SVCT1 is similar to other transporters in the nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) family, such as UraA and UapA, which also exhibit dimeric structures necessary for their transport activities (Yu2017Dimeric).

The binding site for vitamin C is located between transmembrane helices TM3 and TM10, surrounded by polar residues that facilitate substrate recognition. Sodium ions are also involved in the transport mechanism, binding at specific sites to aid in vitamin C binding (She2023Structural). The transport mechanism involves an elevator-like movement of the substrate-bound core domain relative to the gate domain (She2023Structural).

## Function
The SLC23A1 gene encodes the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 1 (SVCT1), which is essential for the uptake and maintenance of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in human cells. SVCT1 is primarily located in epithelial cells, particularly in the renal proximal tubules, where it plays a significant role in reabsorbing ascorbate from the renal filtrate, thus preventing its loss in urine and maintaining plasma ascorbate levels (Corpe2010Vitamin; May2011The). This transporter operates by utilizing the sodium gradient across the plasma membrane, generated by Na+/K+ ATPase, to drive the active transport of ascorbate into cells, concentrating it 20 to 60-fold over plasma concentrations (May2011The).

SVCT1 is also crucial for intestinal absorption of ascorbic acid, occurring at the apical membrane of polarized enterocytes, which is vital for maintaining physiological vitamin C homeostasis (Subramanian2019MicroRNA103a). The function of SVCT1 is regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, translational, and post-translational modifications. Protein kinases A and C acutely regulate its function, while low intracellular ascorbate and oxidative stress can increase its expression (May2011The). The proper functioning of SVCT1 is critical for various cellular processes, including acting as an antioxidant and a cofactor in enzymatic reactions, which are essential for overall health and development (Subramanian2019MicroRNA103a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SLC23A1 gene can significantly impact vitamin C transport and metabolism, leading to various health conditions. In mice, the absence of the Slc23a1 gene results in increased perinatal mortality due to low plasma ascorbate levels, which can be reversed with ascorbate supplementation. This suggests that similar genetic disruptions in humans could potentially affect perinatal survival, although this has not been directly confirmed in human studies (Corpe2010Vitamin).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC23A1 gene have been associated with reduced transport activity, leading to decreased plasma ascorbate concentrations. For instance, the SNP A772G rs35817838 is linked to an 80% reduction in transport activity, which could affect ascorbate homeostasis and increase the risk of conditions related to vitamin C deficiency (Corpe2010Vitamin).

The potential clinical relevance of SLC23A1 gene alterations in humans is underscored by the possibility that these genetic variations could influence ascorbate intake and metabolism, potentially leading to conditions associated with vitamin C deficiency, such as impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms and increased susceptibility to certain diseases (Corpe2010Vitamin).

## Interactions
The SLC23A1 gene encodes the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-1 (SVCT1), which is involved in the uptake of ascorbic acid in intestinal epithelial cells. This transporter interacts with various microRNAs that regulate its expression post-transcriptionally. Notably, microRNA-103a (miR-103a) binds to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of SLC23A1, leading to decreased transcription and reduced ascorbic acid uptake. This interaction was demonstrated using luciferase reporter assays, where the presence of miR-103a significantly reduced luciferase activity, indicating decreased expression of SVCT1. Conversely, inhibition of miR-103a increased luciferase activity and ascorbic acid uptake, suggesting enhanced SVCT1 expression (Subramanian2019MicroRNA103a).

In the context of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection, the expression of microRNAs such as miR-103a, miR-141, and miR-200a is significantly increased, which contributes to the inhibition of vitamin C uptake by targeting SVCT1 and SVCT2 transporters. This suggests a role for these microRNAs in the post-transcriptional regulation of SLC23A1 during pathogenic infections (Heskett2020Enteropathogenic).

Additionally, human glyoxalate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (hGRHPR) is identified as an important protein interactor of hSVCT1, playing a role in ascorbic acid uptake. EPEC infection leads to a marked decrease in GRHPR expression, which may also contribute to the inhibition of vitamin C uptake (Heskett2020Enteropathogenic).
