# OR6C4

## Overview
The OR6C4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 4, a protein that belongs to the extensive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a pivotal role in the olfactory system. Characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, the protein facilitates the initiation of signal transduction pathways upon binding with specific odorants, ultimately leading to the perception of smell. Beyond its primary olfactory function, OR6C4 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including sensory impairments associated with long-COVID-19, suggesting its involvement in broader sensory perception mechanisms (Corda2022GProtein; Danzer2024Impaired; Eszlari2024Olfactory). The expression of OR6C4 in non-olfactory tissues further hints at potential roles in cellular communication and other biological processes, although these functions are not yet fully understood (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Structure
The OR6C4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of OR6C4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with odorant molecules and initiate signal transduction. While quaternary structure is less common in olfactory receptors, it is not typically a feature of OR6C4. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's stability and function. These modifications are important for the proper localization and activity of the receptor within the olfactory system (Corda2022GProtein; Cheng2017The).

## Function
The OR6C4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the activation of a G-protein, which subsequently triggers a cascade of intracellular events leading to neuronal signaling and ultimately, the brain's interpretation of different odors (Eszlari2024Olfactory).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR6C4 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. For instance, altered expression levels of OR6C4 have been observed in individuals with sensory impairments related to long-COVID-19, suggesting a potential involvement in broader sensory perception mechanisms (Danzer2024Impaired). Although primarily associated with olfactory functions, the expression of OR6C4 and other olfactory receptors in non-olfactory tissues indicates potential roles in cellular communication and other biological processes beyond smell detection (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). However, the specific functions of OR6C4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
