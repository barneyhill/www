# FAM200C

## Overview
FAM200C is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 200 member C. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The FAM200C protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including regulatory roles in gene expression and signal transduction pathways. While the precise mechanisms of action are not yet completely understood, ongoing research aims to clarify its involvement in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
