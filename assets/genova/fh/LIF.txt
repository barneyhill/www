# LIF

## Overview
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) is a gene that encodes a cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6 family, known as LIF interleukin 6 family cytokine. This cytokine is characterized by a four-alpha-helix bundle structure, typical of long-chain cytokines, and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (Simpson1997Interleukin‐6:). LIF functions by interacting with its receptor, LIFR, and the signal transducer gp130, forming a complex that activates several intracellular signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt (Ip1992CNTF). These pathways are essential for mediating cellular responses, including growth arrest and differentiation, particularly in neuronal cells (Ip1992CNTF). Clinically, LIF is significant in cancer progression, reproductive health, and immune modulation, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2021The; Jorgensen2022Leukemia).

## Structure
The leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6 family, characterized by a four-alpha-helix bundle structure, typical of long-chain cytokines (Simpson1997Interleukin‐6:). This structure includes helices that are longer and more closely packed than those in short-chain cytokines, with a distinctive AB-loop forming a small helix alongside the CD-loop (Simpson1997Interleukin‐6:). 

LIF interacts with its receptor, LIFR, through a unique binding mechanism involving the central Ig-like domain, which is distinct from other cytokine receptor complexes that typically bind through cytokine-binding modules (Huyton2007An). The receptor-ligand interface is saddle-shaped, involving 22 residues from LIF and 25 from LIFR, with key residues such as Pro-51, Lys-153, Phe-156, and Lys-159 playing critical roles in receptor binding (Huyton2007An). 

LIF can form a trimeric complex with LIFR and gp130, a common signal transducer in the IL-6 family, which is crucial for its signaling mechanism (Simpson1997Interleukin‐6:). The molecular structure of LIF, like other cytokines in its family, comprises four α helices linked by polypeptide loops, and its signaling is mediated through receptor complexes involving LIFR (Du2021Crossreactivity).

## Function
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, LIF is involved in the regulation of embryonic development, hematopoiesis, and inflammation. It functions by signaling through the LIF receptor and the gp130 signal transducing component, which is shared with other cytokines like Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Ip1992CNTF).

LIF activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. These pathways are crucial for mediating the cellular responses to LIF, such as growth arrest and differentiation in neuronal cells. For instance, in the MAH cell line derived from rat sympathoadrenal progenitors, LIF induces growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enhances cholinergic properties, as evidenced by increased choline acetyltransferase activity (Ip1992CNTF).

The phosphorylation of gp130 is essential for the signaling processes initiated by LIF, leading to the activation of immediate early response genes and subsequent cellular responses. This phosphorylation is specific to LIF and does not occur in response to unrelated growth factors like EGF (Ip1992CNTF). LIF's actions are primarily active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, influencing stem cell maintenance and immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) plays a significant role in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, LIF is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. High LIF expression is linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer (Zhang2021The; Jorgensen2022Leukemia). Conversely, in gastric cancer, LIF is downregulated, which is associated with poor outcomes (Zhang2021The).

LIF also impacts reproductive health. Mutations in the LIF gene and reduced expression levels are associated with infertility, as LIF is crucial for blastocyst implantation. LIF-/- female mice exhibit implantation failure, and lower LIF levels are observed in women with infertility (Nicola2015Leukemia; Auernhammer2000LeukemiaInhibitory).

In addition to its role in cancer and reproduction, LIF is involved in immune modulation and inflammation. It influences immune cell differentiation and can create an immunosuppressive environment, which may contribute to immune evasion in tumors (Zhang2021The). These diverse roles highlight LIF's clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) is a cytokine that interacts with its receptor, LIFR, and the signal transducer gp130 to form a heterodimeric receptor complex. This complex is crucial for initiating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which involves the activation of Janus kinases (JAKs) and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT proteins, such as STAT1 and STAT3. These phosphorylated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (West2019Coordination; Ip1992CNTF).

LIF also shares signaling pathways with other cytokines in the IL-6 family, such as Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), through the common use of gp130. This shared component is essential for the high-affinity binding and optimal signal transduction of these cytokines (Ip1992CNTF).

Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins, particularly SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, interact with the LIF signaling pathway to inhibit its activity. SOCS-1 can inhibit JAK kinase activity, while SOCS-3 modulates the pathway through different mechanisms, highlighting their role in regulating LIF-induced signal transduction (Nicholson1999Mutational).
