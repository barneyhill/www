# C4orf51

## Overview
C4orf51 is a gene located on chromosome 4 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 4 open reading frame 51. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its precise function, C4orf51 is believed to be involved in various cellular pathways, potentially influencing gene expression and protein interactions. Ongoing research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with C4orf51, which may provide insights into its role in health and disease.
