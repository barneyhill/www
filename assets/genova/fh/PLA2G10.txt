# PLA2G10

## Overview
PLA2G10 is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group X (sPLA2-X), a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 family. This enzyme is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, which plays a crucial role in the production of signaling molecules such as eicosanoids that are important in inflammation and immune responses (Curfs2008Macrophage; AitOufella2013Group). sPLA2-X is characterized by a conserved His-Asp catalytic dyad and requires calcium for its activity, sharing structural similarities with other sPLA2 enzymes (Lambeau2008Biochemistry; Murakami2014Emerging). It is expressed in various tissues, including immune cells, and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as cholesterol metabolism, immune regulation, and inflammatory diseases like asthma and coronary artery disease (Murakami2016The; Curfs2008Macrophage). The enzyme's interactions with specific receptors and signaling pathways underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions involving inflammation and lipid dysregulation (Nolin2019Function; Ogden2020Secreted).

## Structure
The PLA2G10 gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group X (sPLA2-X), which is involved in lipid metabolism. The enzyme is characterized by a conserved His-Asp catalytic dyad, typical of the secreted phospholipase A2 family, and requires calcium for its activity (Murakami2014Emerging). Structurally, sPLA2-X shares a common three-dimensional fold with other sPLA2s, such as groups IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, and V, which is supported by available X-ray structures (Lambeau2008Biochemistry). This common fold includes a deep active site slot where phospholipid molecules bind, positioning the enzyme-susceptible ester next to catalytic residues (Lambeau2008Biochemistry).

The enzyme's interfacial binding surface is distinct from the active site and is crucial for its interaction with membrane surfaces, influencing substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency (Lambeau2008Biochemistry). Group X sPLA2, including PLA2G10, has a high affinity for both anionic and zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles (Lambeau2008Biochemistry). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability. Splice variants of PLA2G10 may result in different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
PLA2G10 encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group X (sPLA2-X), which plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine, in cellular membranes. This hydrolytic activity releases free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, which are precursors for the production of eicosanoids, signaling molecules involved in inflammation and immune responses (Curfs2008Macrophage; AitOufella2013Group). sPLA2-X is highly active in hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine-rich membranes, making it efficient in modifying low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which can lead to foam cell formation and influence cholesterol metabolism (Curfs2008Macrophage).

In healthy human cells, sPLA2-X is expressed in various tissues, including leukocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, and is involved in modulating immune responses. It influences the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the regulation of inflammation (Curfs2008Macrophage; AitOufella2013Group). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the modulation of toll-like receptor 4 signaling in macrophages, which plays a role in immune system activation (AitOufella2013Group). Through these molecular processes, sPLA2-X impacts cellular and organismal outcomes, including lipid metabolism and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
The PLA2G10 gene, encoding phospholipase A2 group X, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. In soft tissue leiomyosarcoma (STLMS), PLA2G10 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth by facilitating the G1/S transition in the cell cycle through increased expression of cyclin E1 and CDK2. This overexpression is associated with worse relapse-free survival in STLMS patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2020PLA2G10).

In coronary artery disease (CAD), polymorphisms in PLA2G10 have been studied for their potential impact. Although individual polymorphisms do not show a direct association with CAD risk, certain alleles, such as the minor allele of T-512C, are linked to a decreased risk of cardiovascular events, indicating a complex role in cardiovascular health (Gora2009Molecular).

PLA2G10 also plays a role in asthma, where its expression contributes to proinflammatory responses. Mice lacking PLA2G10 show resistance to asthma, highlighting its involvement in inflammatory pathways and its potential as a target for asthma treatment (Murakami2016The). Additionally, PLA2G10 influences fertility, with its absence in sperm leading to decreased male fertility, emphasizing its significance in reproductive health (Abi2022Treatment).

## Interactions
PLA2G10, encoding the enzyme secreted phospholipase A2 group X (sPLA2-X), participates in several interactions that influence its function in inflammatory and immune responses. sPLA2-X interacts with the M-type PLA2 receptor, Pla2r1, which is a paralog, and this interaction is crucial for its enzymatic activity and the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (Ogden2020Secreted). The enzyme is also known to bind to the C-type lectin receptor, PLA2R1, which may regulate its activity, particularly in the context of asthma where PLA2R1 expression is elevated (Nolin2019Function).

sPLA2-X is involved in the regulation of eicosanoid synthesis and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) formation, processes that are significant in asthma pathogenesis. This regulation occurs through the activation of cPLA2α, leading to augmented CysLT release, and is mediated via receptor-mediated signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK and JNK (Nolin2019Function). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in modulating inflammatory responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in asthma and allergic diseases. The enzyme's interactions with various receptors and signaling pathways underscore its complex role in lipid metabolism and immune regulation.
