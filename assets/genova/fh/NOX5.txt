# NOX5

## Overview
NOX5 is a gene that encodes the protein NADPH oxidase 5, a member of the NADPH oxidase family, which is primarily involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The NOX5 protein is characterized as a transmembrane enzyme with a unique regulatory mechanism that is dependent on intracellular calcium levels. It features a conserved N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding domain and a C-terminal flavoprotein domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Kawahara2011Nox5; García2023Structure). NOX5 is expressed in various tissues, including the cardiovascular system, immune cells, and reproductive organs, where it plays critical roles in cellular signaling, differentiation, and vascular function (García2023Structure). Dysregulation of NOX5 expression or activity is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Touyz2019NOX5:; García2023Structure).

## Structure
NOX5 (NADPH oxidase 5) is a member of the NADPH oxidase family characterized by its unique molecular structure. The primary structure of NOX5 includes a conserved N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding domain and a C-terminal flavoprotein domain, which contains binding sites for FAD and NADPH (Kawahara2011Nox5; García2023Structure). The EF-hand domain consists of four motifs that bind calcium ions, with the C-lobe having a higher calcium affinity and playing a significant role in regulating the catalytic domain (Bánfi2004Mechanism; Millana2019On).

The secondary structure of NOX5 features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the EF-hand domain undergoing a structural transition upon calcium binding, which is crucial for enzyme activation (Millana2019On). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains, facilitating electron transfer and activation through calcium-induced conformational changes (Petrushanko2016Oxidation).

NOX5 forms a functional oligomer, likely a tetramer, mediated by the self-association of its dehydrogenase domain, which is essential for its activity (Kawahara2011Nox5). The protein is not N-glycosylated and is regulated by calcium binding and phosphorylation, which influences its function and stability (García2023Structure). NOX5 has several splice variant isoforms, with differences mainly at the amino terminus, affecting its activity and localization (García2023Structure).

## Function
NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are crucial for various cellular processes. NOX5 is unique among the NOX family due to its regulation by intracellular calcium levels, facilitated by its four Ca2+ binding domains at the N-terminus (García2023Structure). This enzyme is primarily located in intracellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the perinuclear area, with limited presence in the plasma membrane (García2023Structure).

In healthy human cells, NOX5 is involved in oxidative signaling, cellular differentiation, and cardiovascular function. It is expressed in human monocytes, macrophages, and oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to cellular differentiation (García2023Structure). In the cardiovascular system, NOX5 is a major source of ROS in the vasculature, influencing vascular tone regulation, angiogenesis, and muscle cell contraction (García2023Structure). NOX5 is also expressed in sperm, where it regulates motility and viability, highlighting its role in reproductive biology (García2023Structure).

The activity of NOX5 is modulated by posttranslational modifications and interactions with proteins such as calmodulin, Hsp90, and caveolin 1, which affect its activity and cellular localization (García2023Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NOX5 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In cancer, elevated NOX5 levels are observed in several tumor types, including lymphoma, Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric, melanoma, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. This overexpression is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to enhanced cell proliferation, DNA damage, angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis, thereby promoting tumor growth and invasiveness (Touyz2019NOX5:; García2023Structure). In prostate cancer, NOX5 expression is notably higher at the invasive front of tumors, contributing to their aggressive behavior (García2023Structure).

In cardiovascular diseases, NOX5 is linked to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, contributing to conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Increased NOX5 expression in vascular cells and macrophages is observed in atherosclerosis, where it promotes ROS production and vascular remodeling (Touyz2019NOX5:; García2023Structure). In renal diseases, NOX5 overexpression is associated with diabetic nephropathy, where it exacerbates kidney damage through increased ROS generation and inflammation (Touyz2019NOX5:). These findings highlight the significant role of NOX5 in the pathophysiology of various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
NOX5 interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity and stability. A key interaction is with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which binds to the C-terminal region of NOX5, specifically between amino acids 490-550. This interaction is crucial for the stability and superoxide production of NOX5. Hsp90, along with co-chaperones such as Hsp70, HOP, Hsp40, and p23, forms complexes with NOX5, regulating its activity. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to the degradation of NOX5, highlighting the importance of this interaction for maintaining NOX5 protein stability (Chen2015Nox5).

NOX5 also interacts with calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein that enhances NOX5's sensitivity to calcium, which is crucial for its activation. This interaction is calcium-dependent and can be inhibited by calmodulin inhibitors (Bedard2012NOX5:; García2023Structure). Additionally, NOX5 binds with caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which negatively regulates its activity. This interaction is similar to the regulation of other enzymes by Cav-1, where calcium influx can displace Cav-1, potentially activating NOX5 (Fulton2019The; García2023Structure).
