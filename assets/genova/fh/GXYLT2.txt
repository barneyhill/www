# GXYLT2

## Overview
GXYLT2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glucoside xylosyltransferase 2, which is a type of glycosyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically by adding xylose residues to O-linked glucose on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. This modification is critical for the proper folding and function of proteins, particularly those involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell signaling and development (Urata2020Xylosyl; Mehboob2021Structure). The enzyme operates within the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the glycosylation pathways that regulate the stability and surface expression of Notch receptors (Urata2020Xylosyl). GXYLT2, along with its homolog GXYLT1, is responsible for the initial xylosylation of O-glucose glycans on the extracellular domains of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 receptors, a process that is crucial for the quality control and trafficking of these receptors (Urata2020Xylosyl).

## Function
GXYLT2 encodes the enzyme glucoside xylosyltransferase 2, which plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins by adding xylose residues to O-linked glucose on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. This modification is essential for the proper folding and function of proteins, particularly those involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is vital for cell signaling and development (Urata2020Xylosyl; Mehboob2021Structure).

GXYLT2, along with GXYLT1, is responsible for the initial addition of the first xylose residue to O-glucose glycans on the extracellular domains of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 receptors. This xylosylation process is important for the quality control and trafficking of Notch receptors, especially when they are overexpressed (Urata2020Xylosyl). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in glycosylation pathways that regulate the stability and surface expression of these receptors (Urata2020Xylosyl).

The xylosyl extension of O-Glc glycans by GXYLT2 is crucial for the proper trafficking and function of Notch receptors, affecting their ability to mediate cell signaling processes that are essential for development and cellular differentiation (Lee2013Negative; Urata2020Xylosyl).
