# MICA

## Overview
MICA, or MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the MHC class I family. Unlike classical MHC class I molecules, the MICA protein does not associate with β2-microglobulin and functions independently of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) (Risti2017MICA). The MICA protein serves as a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, an activating immunoreceptor expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and γδ T cells, playing a pivotal role in immune surveillance by promoting the destruction of stressed or transformed cells (Groh1996Cell; Bauer1999Activation). MICA is highly polymorphic, with variations influencing its interaction with NKG2D and impacting immune responses in conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (Wang2024Functional; Unknownauthors2013MICAPolymorphism). The protein is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues and is upregulated in response to cellular stress, facilitating the immune system's ability to target and eliminate potentially harmful cells (Ghadially2017MHC).

## Structure
The MICA protein is a member of the MHC class I family and exhibits a structure similar to classical MHC class I molecules, with distinct α1, α2, and α3 domains. The α1 and α2 domains form a platform composed of four α helices on an eight-stranded antiparallel β sheet, resembling the domain organization of the α chain of MHC class I molecules (Li2001Complex; Risti2017MICA). Unlike classical MHC class I proteins, MICA does not associate with β2-microglobulin and is independent of any transporter-associated protein (Risti2017MICA).

The MICA protein is highly polymorphic, particularly in its α domains, and has a unique exon-intron structure distinct from classical class I genes (Unknownauthors2013MICAPolymorphism). It is a glycosylated membrane-anchored cell surface protein, with glycosylation occurring at multiple sites, enhancing the stability of its complexes with NKG2D (Steinle2001Interactions). MICA exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with isoform 1 being the longest (Risti2017MICA).

In its quaternary structure, MICA interacts with the NKG2D receptor, forming a complex where the NKG2D homodimer binds to a MICA monomer. This interaction involves extensive contacts between the α1 and α2 domains of MICA and the NKG2D receptor (Li2001Complex).

## Function
The MICA gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is structurally similar to MHC class I molecules and functions as a ligand for the activating immune receptor NKG2D. This receptor is expressed on CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. The interaction between MICA and NKG2D promotes cytokine release and the killing of target cells, playing a crucial role in immune surveillance, particularly in cancer and antiviral immunity (Lin2018Intragenic).

MICA is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium and is regulated by cell stress conditions, such as heat shock. Unlike conventional MHC class I molecules, MICA does not associate with the TAP peptide transporter or require cytosolic peptide ligands for its transport and surface expression. This suggests a unique role in the immune system, potentially related to its expression in stressed cells and its ability to interact with immune cells through non-conventional pathways (Groh1996Cell).

In healthy cells, MICA is stored intracellularly and can be rapidly transported to the cell surface upon stress or infection. This allows stressed cells to be recognized and targeted by cytotoxic lymphocytes, facilitating immune responses to cellular stress, damage, or transformation (Ghadially2017MHC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MICA gene are associated with various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and cancers. In autoimmune diseases, specific MICA alleles have been linked to increased susceptibility. For instance, the MICA*010 allele is associated with a higher risk of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Taiwanese populations, while MICA*045 is linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility (Wang2024Functional). Conversely, alleles like MICA*002 and MICA*009 offer protection against RA and psoriasis, respectively (Wang2024Functional).

The MICA-129Met/Val polymorphism significantly impacts immune responses. The MICA-129Met variant enhances NKG2D signaling, leading to increased natural killer (NK) cell activity and interferon-γ release, which can influence the progression of diseases like multiple myeloma and affect outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Isernhagen2015The; Zingoni2018MICA129). This polymorphism is also associated with autoimmune diseases such as RA and type I diabetes (Isernhagen2015Thea).

In cancer, MICA expression can be upregulated in response to stress, allowing immune cells to target transformed cells. However, tumors may evade immune surveillance by shedding soluble MICA, which downregulates NKG2D and impairs immune responses (Chen2014MICA). Elevated soluble MICA levels are linked to cancer progression and metastasis (Chen2014MICA).

## Interactions
MICA interacts with the NKG2D receptor, a C-type lectin-like activating immunoreceptor found on natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and γδ T cells. This interaction is crucial for immune surveillance, as it stimulates cytotoxic responses against cells expressing MICA, such as tumor cells or cells under stress (Li2001Complex; Bauer1999Activation). The MICA-NKG2D complex involves a homodimer of NKG2D binding to a monomer of MICA, with a highly complementary interface characterized by polar, hydrophobic, and ionic interactions (Li2001Complex).

The binding affinity of MICA to NKG2D can vary among different MICA alleles, influenced by specific amino acid substitutions, such as the methionine/valine bimorphism at position 129, which affects the binding indirectly through conformational changes (Steinle2001Interactions). Glycosylation of MICA enhances the stability of the complex, although it is not essential for binding (Steinle2001Interactions).

Soluble forms of MICA (sMICA), shed from tumor cells, can impair NKG2D expression on T cells, leading to reduced T-cell activation and cytolytic responses, which may contribute to tumor immune evasion (Groh2002Tumourderived). This interaction is significant in modulating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (Groh2002Tumourderived).
