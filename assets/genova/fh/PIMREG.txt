# PIMREG

## Overview
PIMREG, or PICALM interacting mitotic regulator, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. The PIMREG protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in chromosomal segregation and cell division. It interacts with PICALM, a protein associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, to ensure the accurate distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells, thereby maintaining cellular proliferation and tissue homeostasis. PIMREG's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in the orchestration of mitotic events and underscores its potential implications in cancer biology, where its altered expression is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhu2021PanCancer; Wang2021Tumorpromoting).

## Function
PIMREG (PICALM interacting mitotic regulator) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for cell cycle regulation, particularly during the mitotic phase. The PIMREG protein is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in chromosomal segregation and cell division. By interacting with PICALM, a protein associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, PIMREG contributes to the proper progression of mitosis, ensuring accurate distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. This function is essential for maintaining normal cellular proliferation and tissue homeostasis. The activity of PIMREG in these processes underscores its importance in the regulation of cell division, which is vital for the growth and maintenance of healthy tissues. The precise molecular mechanisms by which PIMREG influences these processes involve its interactions within the nuclear environment, highlighting its role in the orchestration of mitotic events.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIMREG gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In breast cancer, PIMREG overexpression is associated with sustained NF-κB signaling, which promotes tumor growth and metastasis. This overexpression correlates with advanced clinical stages and poorer survival outcomes, making PIMREG a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Jiang2019Overexpression).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), PIMREG is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High PIMREG expression is linked to increased tumor malignancy and poor prognosis, as well as enhanced cell proliferation and invasion. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for ccRCC, with potential implications for treatment strategies (Yao2023PIMREG).

PIMREG is also highly expressed in gliomas, where it promotes cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Its expression is associated with the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to tumor progression and aggressiveness. This makes PIMREG a potential target for therapeutic intervention in gliomas (Wang2021Tumorpromoting).

Pan-cancer analyses have shown that PIMREG is highly expressed in at least 24 cancer types, often correlating with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. Its expression is linked to immune system-related functions, suggesting a role in the tumor immune microenvironment (Zhu2021PanCancer).

## Interactions
PIMREG, also known as PICALM interacting mitotic regulator, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes. The GeneMANIA tool has predicted interactions of PIMREG with several proteins, including TDRD7, PICALM, HDAC1, HDAC2, RBBP4, MTA2, and CCNE1. These interactions suggest PIMREG's involvement in chromosome segregation, cell cycle transitions, and DNA replication (Zhu2022Predictive). The STRING tool also predicts interactions with proteins such as CDCA8, CENPF, AURK8, CCNA2, BIRC5, KIF20A, and DLGAP5, further supporting its role in cell cycle regulation (Zhu2022Predictive).

In glioma, PIMREG has been shown to activate the β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with increased expression of β-catenin and c-myc, promoting cell proliferation and invasion (Wang2021Tumorpromoting). This activation is linked to decreased E-cadherin and increased levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, and Vimentin, indicating PIMREG's role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Wang2021Tumorpromoting). The interaction between PIMREG and UHMK1 has also been noted, suggesting a regulatory role in PIMREG's function and/or localization, although the specific implications of this interaction remain unclear (Arfelli2018UHMK1).
