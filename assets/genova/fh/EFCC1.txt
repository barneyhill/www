# EFCC1

## Overview
EFCC1, or EF-hand and coiled-coil domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs and coiled-coil domains. These structural features suggest that the EFCC1 protein may be involved in calcium binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively. While the precise biological functions of EFCC1 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural domains imply a potential role in cellular signaling pathways. The gene has garnered attention due to its altered expression in various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, indicating its possible significance in disease mechanisms and as a biomarker (Yu2020EFCC1; Krainer2023Patients; Ye2023Optimized).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The EFCC1 gene, also known as coiled-coil domain containing 48 (CCDC48), has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), EFCC1 expression is significantly down-regulated, with lower levels associated with advanced tumor stages, shorter overall survival, and quicker disease progression. This makes EFCC1 a potential unfavorable prognostic biomarker for lung ADC (Yu2020EFCC1). 

In colorectal cancer (CRC), EFCC1 is associated with DNA methylation sites, although no significant correlation between methylation and EFCC1 expression was found. The study suggests that while EFCC1 is linked to methylation sites, its role in CRC remains unclear (Ye2023Optimized).

In systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), EFCC1 is identified as one of the most reactive antigens in active disease states, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's autoantibody profile (Krainer2023Patients).

Despite these associations, the exact function of EFCC1 in these conditions remains unknown, and further research is needed to elucidate its role and potential as a therapeutic target.
