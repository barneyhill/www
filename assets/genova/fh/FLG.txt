# FLG

## Overview
The FLG gene encodes the protein filaggrin, a key structural protein involved in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. Filaggrin is synthesized as a large precursor protein, profilaggrin, which undergoes post-translational modifications to become active. This protein plays a critical role in aggregating keratin intermediate filaments, thereby contributing to the mechanical strength and integrity of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin (Kypriotou2012The; Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). Filaggrin is also involved in the production of natural moisturizing factors (NMF), which are essential for maintaining skin hydration and pH balance (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). Mutations in the FLG gene are associated with several dermatological and allergic conditions, including atopic eczema and ichthyosis vulgaris, due to their impact on skin barrier function (Sandilands2007Comprehensive; Brown2008Atopic).

## Structure
The filaggrin (FLG) protein is derived from its precursor, profilaggrin, which is synthesized as a large, phosphorylated polymer. Profilaggrin contains 10 to 12 repeating units, each consisting of 324 amino acids, with a conserved linker sequence of seven amino acids (FLYQVST) (Hoober2022The). The primary structure of filaggrin is rich in histidine and glutamine, contributing to its role in skin hydration and barrier function (Hoober2022The). 

The secondary structure of filaggrin is characterized by a high content of beta-sheets, which facilitate its aggregation with keratin intermediate filaments (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). The tertiary structure involves the formation of macrofibrils through the interaction with keratin filaments, providing mechanical strength to the epidermis (Hoober2022The). 

Filaggrin undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which are crucial for its activation and function. Deimination, a process that converts arginine residues to citrulline, is another significant modification that influences its interaction with keratin (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). The N-terminal domain of profilaggrin includes an S-100-like domain with EF-hand sequences that bind calcium ions, playing a role in keratinocyte differentiation (Hoober2022The). 

The quaternary structure of filaggrin involves its assembly into larger complexes with keratin filaments, essential for the formation of the stratum corneum (Hoober2022The).

## Function
The FLG gene encodes profilaggrin, a precursor protein that is crucial for skin barrier function. Profilaggrin is processed into filaggrin, which aggregates keratin filaments into higher molecular structures, essential for the formation of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin (Kypriotou2012The; Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). This aggregation contributes to the mechanical strength and integrity of the skin, providing a barrier against environmental factors and preventing excessive water loss (Winge2011Filaggrin; Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting).

Filaggrin is further degraded into free amino acids, which are part of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) that help maintain skin hydration and pH balance (Kypriotou2012The; Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). These amino acids include urocanic acid, which modulates skin pH and provides protection against UV light (Kypriotou2012The). The protein is active in the granular layer of the epidermis, where it is stored in keratohyalin granules before being processed during keratinocyte differentiation (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting; Furue2020Regulation). Filaggrin's role in maintaining the skin barrier is underscored by its involvement in the formation of the cornified envelope, a specialized cell membrane that provides additional protection (Furue2020Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLG gene, which encodes the protein filaggrin, are significantly associated with several skin and allergic conditions. These mutations are a major predisposing factor for atopic eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis), a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by itchy and inflamed skin. The presence of FLG null mutations increases the risk of developing atopic eczema, with an odds ratio of 4.09 in case/control studies (Brown2008Atopic). FLG mutations are also linked to ichthyosis vulgaris, a condition marked by dry, scaly skin (Sandilands2007Comprehensive).

FLG mutations contribute to an impaired skin barrier, which facilitates allergen penetration and sensitization, leading to other atopic conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The association with asthma is particularly strong when eczema is present, with an odds ratio of 1.48 for asthma in individuals with FLG mutations (Rodríguez2009Metaanalysis). These mutations are also associated with increased total serum IgE levels and allergic sensitization (Weidinger2006Lossoffunction).

The impact of FLG mutations extends to modifying the severity of other genodermatoses and conditions like alopecia areata when comorbid with atopic eczema (Brown2008Atopic). Identifying FLG mutations can aid in classifying eczema cases and targeting therapies to repair the epidermal barrier, potentially reducing the incidence of related conditions.

## Interactions
Filaggrin (FLG) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of the skin by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. It aggregates these filaments into tight parallel arrays, contributing to the mechanical resilience and flexibility of the stratum corneum (SC) (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting). The interaction between filaggrin and keratin filaments is facilitated by ionic interactions with the coiled-coil alpha-helical regions of the keratin filaments, with a stoichiometry of two filaggrin molecules to three keratin filament subunits (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting).

Filaggrin is also involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of corneocytes, where it interacts with other proteins such as loricrin and involucrin, contributing to the skin's barrier function (Čepelak2019Filaggrin). The protein is covalently linked to the cornified envelope by transglutaminases, which are enzymes that facilitate the cross-linking of proteins in the skin (Moosbrugger-Martinz2022Revisiting).

While filaggrin's interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, its processing and degradation release hygroscopic amino acids and derivatives that are vital for skin hydration and pH balance (Drislane2020The). These interactions and processes underscore filaggrin's essential role in maintaining skin barrier function and integrity.
