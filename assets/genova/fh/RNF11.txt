# RNF11

## Overview
RNF11 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 11, a RING E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by a RING-H2 finger motif, which facilitates interactions with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and a PY motif that enables binding with WW-domain containing proteins, such as those in the NEDD4 family of HECT-E3 ligases (Subramaniam2003The; Mattioni2020RNF11). RNF11 plays a significant role in modulating signal transduction pathways, including NF-κB and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, thereby influencing inflammation and cell proliferation (Mattioni2020RNF11; Mattioni2020Ring). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acylation, which affect its localization and function (Mattioni2020RNF11). Alterations in RNF11 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Subramaniam2003The; Pranski2012Neuronal).

## Structure
RNF11 is a 154-amino acid protein characterized by a RING-H2 finger motif located at the carboxyl-terminal end, which is a stable folded monomeric domain with structural similarities to the RING1 domain of RBR E3s (Mattioni2020RNF11). This motif is crucial for its role in ubiquitination processes, facilitating interactions with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Mattioni2020RNF11). The protein also contains disordered regions, particularly at the N-terminal end and the short C-terminal tail following the RING domain, which are influenced by post-translational modifications and interactions with binding partners (Mattioni2020RNF11).

RNF11 features a PY motif (37-PPPY-40) upstream of the RING-H2 domain, which is essential for interactions with WW-domain containing proteins, such as those in the NEDD4 family of HECT-E3 ligases (Subramaniam2003The; Mattioni2020RNF11). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at several serine and threonine residues, with Thr135 being a confirmed phosphorylation site by Protein Kinase B (PKB)/AKT, facilitating its nuclear translocation (Mattioni2020RNF11). RNF11 is also subject to double acylation at the N-terminal end, involving myristoylation and palmitoylation, which is essential for its membrane localization (Mattioni2020RNF11).

## Function
RNF11 (ring finger protein 11) is a RING E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation. It plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including membrane receptor downregulation and intracellular trafficking. RNF11 interacts with E2 enzymes and E3 ligases, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, and is involved in both exocytic and endocytic pathways (Mattioni2020RNF11).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, RNF11 acts as a negative regulator, helping to terminate inflammatory responses. It is part of the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex, which modifies ubiquitin chains on signaling proteins, leading to their degradation and the termination of NF-κB signaling (Mattioni2020RNF11; Pranski2012Neuronal). RNF11 also influences the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway by promoting receptor ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, thus regulating cell growth and proliferation (Mattioni2020RNF11; Mattioni2020Ring).

RNF11 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates signal transduction and maintains cellular homeostasis. Its interactions with various proteins suggest a significant role in cellular signaling and trafficking, impacting processes like inflammation and receptor signaling (Mattioni2020Ring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF11 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In breast cancer, RNF11 is notably overexpressed, interacting with the Smurf2 E3 ligase through its PY motif, which is crucial for its role in ubiquitination processes. This overexpression is linked to cancer progression, as RNF11 modulates TGF-β signaling pathways, potentially impacting tumor growth and metastasis (Subramaniam2003The; Mattioni2020RNF11).

In neurodegenerative diseases, RNF11 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for controlling inflammation. Altered expression of RNF11 can lead to exaggerated inflammatory responses, contributing to conditions such as Parkinson's disease, where chronic NF-κB activation is a significant factor (Pranski2012Neuronal).

In cattle, a splice site variant in the RNF11 gene is associated with stunted growth and increased susceptibility to inflammation, particularly affecting the respiratory tract. This mutation results in a truncated RNF11 protein, leading to compromised regulation of the inflammatory response and increased juvenile mortality (Sartelet2012A).

## Interactions
RNF11 is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with WW-domain containing proteins of the NEDD4 family of HECT-E3 ligases, such as ITCH, NEDD4, SMURF1/2, and WWP1/2, due to its PY motif, which is unique among RING ligases (Mattioni2020RNF11). RNF11 is part of the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex, interacting with proteins like TRAF6 and E2 enzymes, and is involved in regulating NF-κB signaling by modifying ubiquitin chains on signaling proteins (Mattioni2020RNF11).

RNF11 also interacts with ANKRD13A, modulating its ubiquitination, which is crucial for binding to ubiquitinated EGFR and facilitating its lysosomal degradation (Mattioni2020Ring). It forms a complex with SMURF2, influencing TGF-β signaling by modulating the degradation of TGF-β receptors (Mattioni2020RNF11). RNF11's interactions extend to nucleic acids, as it has been shown to bind DNA, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of EGFR transport (Scharaw2016The).
