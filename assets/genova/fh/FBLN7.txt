# FBLN7

## Overview
FBLN7 is a gene that encodes the protein fibulin 7, a member of the fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. Fibulin 7 is characterized by its unique structural features, including a sushi domain and multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules, which contribute to its role in cell adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix organization (Segade2010Molecular; Chakraborty2020The). This protein is predominantly expressed in specialized tissues such as the placenta, eye, blood vessels, and cartilage, where it plays a crucial role in physiological processes like angiogenesis and development, as well as in pathological conditions (Chakraborty2020The). Fibulin 7 interacts with integrins and other receptors to modulate cellular activities, including the inhibition of focal adhesion maturation and the regulation of inflammatory responses (Chakraborty2020The). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including craniofacial malformations, congenital heart disease, varicose veins, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Zhang2024Exome; Tsuda2018Extracellular; Chakraborty2020The).

## Structure
Fibulin 7 (FBLN7) is a member of the fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, characterized by a three-modular structure. The protein consists of 440 amino acids and includes a signal peptide, three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules, a C-terminal domain, and a unique N-terminal sushi domain, also known as the complement control protein (CCP) domain (Chakraborty2020The). The sushi domain is involved in complement system regulation, blood coagulation, cell adhesion, migration, and embryogenesis (Chakraborty2020The). 

The molecular structure of FBLN7 includes a domain I formed by one sushi/CCP protein-protein interaction segment and a domain II with three cbEGF modules (Segade2010Molecular). The C-terminal fragment of FBLN7, known as Fbln7-C, has been studied for its modulatory effects on angiogenesis and is described as having a V shape with exposed domains, which may influence its interaction with other proteins (Ikeuchi2018Extracellular). Fbln7-C is more active in vitro compared to the full-length protein, suggesting structural differences that affect its function (Ikeuchi2018Extracellular). 

The protein is expressed in specialized tissues such as the placenta, eye, blood vessels, and cartilage, indicating its significant role in both physiological and pathological conditions (Chakraborty2020The).

## Function
Fibulin 7 (FBLN7) is a protein involved in various cellular functions, particularly in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. In healthy human cells, FBLN7 plays a crucial role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, influencing processes such as blood vessel formation, development, and cell adhesion across tissues like the placenta, eye, and cartilage (Chakraborty2020The). It regulates angiogenesis by interacting with integrins and heparan sulfate receptors, affecting cell spreading and migration. FBLN7 inhibits the maturation of focal complexes into focal adhesions, a process mediated by the phosphorylation of FAK and p130Cas, and the activation of Rac1 (Chakraborty2020The).

FBLN7 also binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and integrin α5β1, inhibiting the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and ERK1/2, which are crucial for angiogenesis (Chakraborty2020The). The C-terminal fragment of FBLN7, known as Fbln7-C, exhibits more potent activity than the full-length protein, likely due to the exposure of hidden interactive domains. This fragment has been shown to inhibit macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and reduce MHC expression in an endotoxemia model, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic applications (Chakraborty2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBLN7 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. A novel deletion of human chromosome 2q13, which includes the FBLN7 gene, has been linked to craniofacial malformations and congenital heart disease. This deletion has been studied in zebrafish models, where knockdown of fibulin-7 resulted in cardiac and craniofacial defects, reduced cartilage deposition in pharyngeal arches, and impaired branchial arch development (Tsuda2018Extracellular).

FBLN7 is also implicated in the development of varicose veins (VV). Exome sequencing studies have identified loss-of-function variants in FBLN7 that are associated with an increased prevalence of VV. These variants suggest a genetic susceptibility to VV, particularly in females, as the association was found to be significant only in this group (Zhang2024Exome).

Alterations in FBLN7 expression have been observed in certain cancers, such as glioblastoma, indicating a potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Chakraborty2020The). The gene's involvement in angiogenesis and inflammation, through its regulatory functions, further suggests its significance in pathological conditions (Chakraborty2020The).

## Interactions
Fibulin 7 (FBLN7) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cell adhesion and matrix organization. It interacts with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through β1 integrins, inhibiting cell spreading, tube formation, and vessel sprouting. This interaction does not prevent the formation of focal complexes but inhibits their maturation into focal adhesions, which involves the phosphorylation of FAK and p130Cas and the activation of Rac1 (Chakraborty2020The). 

The C-terminal fragment of FBLN7, known as Fbln7-C, binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and integrin α5β1, inhibiting the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and ERK1/2, thereby exerting anti-angiogenic effects (Chakraborty2020The). In the context of inflammation, FBLN7 interacts with monocytes and macrophages through integrins, inhibiting their spreading, adhesion, differentiation, and production of inflammatory mediators (Chakraborty2020The).

FBLN7 is also noted for its potential interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and fibulin-1, particularly in the context of glaucoma, where its expression is significantly downregulated in primary angle closure glaucoma compared to primary open angle glaucoma and control samples (Basu2019Possible).
