# SLC1A3

## Overview
The SLC1A3 gene encodes the protein known as excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which is a member of the solute carrier family 1. EAAT1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of glutamate across cell membranes, primarily in the central nervous system. This protein is essential for maintaining glutamate homeostasis by facilitating the reuptake of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, thereby preventing excitotoxicity and ensuring proper synaptic transmission and neuronal communication. EAAT1 is predominantly expressed in glial cells, such as astrocytes and cerebellar Bergmann glia, and is also found in peripheral tissues, indicating its broader physiological significance. The structure of EAAT1 is characterized by a trimeric formation, with each subunit comprising distinct domains that contribute to its function. Mutations in the SLC1A3 gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, underscoring the importance of this gene in normal brain function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2023Ataxialinked; CanulTec2017Structure; Chivukula2020Functional).

## Structure
The SLC1A3 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), a protein involved in glutamate transport across cell membranes. EAAT1 is a trimeric protein, meaning it consists of three identical subunits that form a symmetric homotrimer. Each subunit is composed of a scaffold domain (ScaD) and a transport domain (TranD). The ScaD includes transmembrane helices TM1-2 and TM4-5, forming a central propeller-like structure that anchors the transporter to the membrane. The TranD, which includes TM3, TM6-8, and re-entrant helical loops, is more peripheral and interacts with the ScaD of its own monomer (CanulTec2017Structure).

The primary structure of EAAT1 includes specific amino acid sequences that form transmembrane domains. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices, which are crucial for the protein's function. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, allowing for the transport of glutamate and ions. The quaternary structure is defined by the oligomerization of the subunits into a trimeric form (Chivukula2020Functional).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in the regulation of EAAT1's activity. The protein's structure also includes specific binding sites for substrates and inhibitors, which are critical for its function and regulation (CanulTec2017Structure).

## Function
The SLC1A3 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which functions as a glutamate transporter and anion channel in human cells. EAAT1 is crucial for maintaining glutamate homeostasis in the central nervous system by removing excess glutamate from the synaptic cleft, thus preventing excitotoxicity. This process is essential for regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal communication, particularly in the cerebellum, where it helps maintain normal motor coordination and cerebellar function (Kanai2004The; Chivukula2020Functional).

In healthy cells, EAAT1 is primarily expressed in glial cells, including astrocytes and cerebellar Bergmann glia, where it facilitates the reuptake of glutamate, a critical neurotransmitter. This reuptake is coupled with the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions and the exchange with potassium ions, which is vital for the transporter's function (Chivukula2020Functional). EAAT1 also plays a role in the retina, where it is expressed in Muller cells and is essential for normal signal transmission between photoreceptors and bipolar cells (Kanai2004The).

Beyond the central nervous system, SLC1A3 is expressed in various peripheral tissues, suggesting roles in glutamate homeostasis and metabolic processes (Berger2006Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC1A3 gene, which encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), are associated with several neurological disorders. Episodic ataxia type 6 (EA6) is a notable condition linked to SLC1A3 mutations, characterized by episodes of ataxia, hemiplegia, seizures, and migraines. Specific mutations such as P290R, M128R, and A329T have been identified in patients with EA6, leading to altered glutamate transport and chloride channel activity, which disrupts central nervous system (CNS) function (Jen2005Mutation; Chivukula2020Functional; Wu2023Ataxialinked).

The P290R mutation, in particular, results in reduced glutamate transport and increased anion channel activity, contributing to cerebellar degeneration and Bergmann glia apoptosis (Chivukula2020Functional). Other mutations, such as 1047C>G, have been linked to decreased EAAT1 expression and function, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and symptoms like seizures and migraines (Jen2005Mutation; Bergeron2008Inherited).

Alterations in SLC1A3 expression levels have also been implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where increased expression of the gene may act as a protective factor against the disorder (Huang2019A). These findings highlight the critical role of SLC1A3 in maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis and its involvement in various neurological conditions.

## Interactions
The SLC1A3 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which is involved in the reuptake of glutamate in the central nervous system. EAAT1 interacts with various proteins and is implicated in several cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the protein PSD-95, which anchors EAAT1 to the postsynaptic density, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the proper function of synapses by regulating glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft.

In the context of glioblastoma, EAAT1, also known as GLAST, is highly expressed and interacts with the cystine-glutamate exchanger xCT. This interaction affects glutamate release and contributes to the pathophysiology of glioblastoma, including tumor invasion and edema. The inhibition of GLAST with UCPH-101 has been shown to increase intracellular glutamate levels, leading to apoptosis in glioma stem cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Corbetta2019Altered).

Additionally, mutations in SLC1A3 can alter the function of EAAT1, affecting its interactions with ions and other proteins. For instance, the M128R mutation disrupts sodium binding, which is crucial for EAAT1's transport process, and introduces an ectopic sodium leak conductance, impacting its role in the central nervous system (Wu2023Ataxialinked).
