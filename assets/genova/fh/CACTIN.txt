# CACTIN

## Overview
CACTIN is a gene that encodes the protein cactin, which functions as a spliceosome C complex subunit. This protein is integral to the process of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression that ensures the accurate removal of introns and the production of functional mRNA. Cactin is also known for its role in the NFκB signaling pathway, where it acts as a negative regulator to modulate inflammatory responses and maintain cellular homeostasis. By providing a negative feedback loop, cactin suppresses NFκB-mediated transcriptional activity without affecting the cytosolic components of the pathway. The gene's expression is upregulated following TNFα stimulation, highlighting its involvement in the cellular response to inflammation (Suzuki2015TRIM39).

## Function
Cactin is a protein that plays a significant role in the NFκB signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator to maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammatory responses. It provides a negative feedback loop in this pathway by suppressing NFκB-mediated transcriptional activity, both in the presence and absence of TNFα stimulation (Suzuki2015TRIM39). Cactin does not affect the cytosolic regulators of the NFκB pathway, such as IKKβ and IκBα, nor does it influence the translocation of NFκB (RelA/p65) into the nucleus after TNFα stimulation. Instead, Cactin is upregulated following TNFα treatment, indicating its induction by NFκB activation (Suzuki2015TRIM39).

Cactin is also involved in the spliceosome C complex, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing, a process essential for gene expression. It is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, ensuring accurate mRNA processing and subsequent protein synthesis. This function is vital for maintaining cellular and organismal health, as proper splicing is necessary for the production of functional proteins (Suzuki2015TRIM39).
