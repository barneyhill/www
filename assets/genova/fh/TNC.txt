# TNC

## Overview
Tenascin C (TNC) is a gene that encodes the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. As a large hexameric glycoprotein, tenascin-C is characterized by its modular structure, including domains such as epidermal growth factor-like repeats and fibronectin type III-like repeats, which facilitate its diverse biological functions (De2013Tenascin; Midwood2011Advances). The protein plays a critical role in modulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, particularly in tissues with high cellular turnover and plasticity, such as the central nervous system and stem cell niches (Giblin2014Tenascin-C:). Tenascin-C is also involved in the regulation of hematopoietic and neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, influencing normal glial cell development (Chiquet-Ehrismann2014Tenascins). The gene's expression and its protein's interactions with various growth factors and cell surface receptors underscore its importance in development, tissue remodeling, and disease pathogenesis (De2013Tenascin; Adamsky2001Glial).

## Structure
Tenascin C (TNC) is a large hexameric extracellular glycoprotein characterized by its modular structure, consisting of four distinct domains. The primary structure includes an assembly domain, a series of epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGF-L), fibronectin type III-like repeats (FNIII), and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like globe (FBG) (De2013Tenascin; Midwood2011Advances). The EGF-L repeats contain six cysteines and possess antiadhesive properties, facilitating cell migration (De2013Tenascin). The FNIII domain includes up to 15 repeats, forming two sheets of antiparallel beta-strands, and is subject to extensive alternative splicing, resulting in many isoforms (De2013Tenascin). 

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains, while the quaternary structure forms a disulfide-bonded hexabrachion (De2013Tenascin). TNC undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and is expressed in multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing (Midwood2011Advances). The FNIII domains, particularly TNCIII5, are crucial for binding various growth factors, highlighting the protein's role in cell signaling and interaction with the extracellular matrix (De2013Tenascin).

## Function
Tenascin-C (TNC) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a significant role in modulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in tissues with high cell turnover and plasticity, such as stem cell niches, the central nervous system, and areas under mechanical stress like tendons and ligaments (Giblin2014Tenascin-C:). TNC is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion by interacting with fibronectin, which affects cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (ChiquetEhrismann2011Tenascins). It acts as an antiadhesive protein, inhibiting cell adhesion to fibronectin and influencing the activities of RhoA and focal adhesion kinase, leading to changes in cell morphology and motility (ChiquetEhrismann2011Tenascins).

In the bone marrow, TNC is crucial for the maintenance and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where it is expressed by stromal cells and acts as an adhesive and mitogenic factor (Chiquet-Ehrismann2014Tenascins). TNC's role in the hematopoietic niche is mediated through its interaction with stromal cells, enhancing HSC proliferation and differentiation (Chiquet-Ehrismann2014Tenascins). It is also involved in the regulation of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, influencing normal glial cell development (Chiquet-Ehrismann2014Tenascins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TNC gene are associated with several diseases. In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), TNC is significantly up-regulated in plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), suggesting its role in tumor progression. The up-regulation of TNC, particularly its splice variants, is linked to the malignant transformation of these tumors (Lévy2007MicroarrayBased). 

TNC is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Polymorphic variants in the TNC gene, such as SNPs rs3789875, rs12347433, and rs4552883, have been associated with atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). These variants may influence disease risk by affecting mRNA structure or splicing efficiency, contributing to the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques (Minear2011Polymorphic).

In the context of hearing loss, a novel splice-altering variant in the TNC gene has been identified in a family with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. This variant disrupts normal splicing, leading to exon skipping and is considered likely pathogenic (He2024A). 

Additionally, TNC variants have been linked to Achilles tendinopathy, with specific SNPs affecting the protein's fibronectin type III repeat domains, which are crucial for tissue remodeling and elasticity (Saunders2012Investigation).

## Interactions
Tenascin C (TNC) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of the key interactions is with growth factors, primarily mediated through its fifth fibronectin type III-like domain (TNCIII5). This domain binds with high affinity to several growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGF-BPs), and neurotrophins. These interactions are crucial for TNC's role in development and tissue remodeling (De2013Tenascin).

TNC also interacts with cell surface receptors such as annexin II. The alternatively spliced region TNfnA-D of TNC binds to annexin II, leading to cellular changes like the loss of focal adhesions and enhanced cell migration. This interaction is significant in contexts such as wound healing and tumor angiogenesis (Chung1996Mitogenesis).

Additionally, TNC interacts with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) through its fibronectin type III domains. This interaction mediates cell adhesion, particularly in glial cells, and may regulate the binding of RPTPβ with other ligands, influencing cell adhesion dynamics (Adamsky2001Glial).
