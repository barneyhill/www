# BRF2

## Overview
BRF2 is a gene that encodes the BRF2 RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor subunit, a critical component of the transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase III, specifically at type 3 promoters, which are responsible for the synthesis of small non-coding RNAs such as U6 snRNA and 7SK RNA (Saxena2005StructureFunction; Lockwood2010Integrative). Structurally, BRF2 is characterized by a conserved TFIIB-like N-terminus and a unique C-terminal region, which are essential for its interaction with other transcription factors and DNA (Ramsay2018Structural; Cabarcas2011RNA). The protein's activity is regulated by redox mechanisms, which influence its role in transcription complex assembly and cellular responses to oxidative stress (Ramsay2018Structural). Clinically, BRF2 is recognized as an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to various cancers, including lung squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis (Lockwood2010Integrative; CabarcasPetroski2020A).

## Structure
BRF2 is a subunit of the RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor complex, characterized by a conserved TFIIB-like N-terminus and a distinct C-terminal region. The N-terminus includes zinc ribbon domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and interaction with other transcription factors (Cabarcas2011RNA). The C-terminal region of BRF2 forms a 'molecular pin' structure that is essential for stabilizing the TFIIIB complex. This structure involves interactions with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and DNA, and it also interacts with the TBP 'anchor domain' and Bdp1 (Ramsay2018Structural).

BRF2's structure allows it to be incorporated into the TFIIIB complex at class III promoters, which have a unique architecture with control elements upstream of the coding sequence, including a TATA box, a proximal sequence element (PSE), and a distal sequence element (DSE) (Ramsay2018Structural). The stability of BRF2-containing TFIIIB complexes is redox-regulated, with a conserved cysteine residue cycling between oxidized and reduced states, affecting complex assembly and selenocysteine tRNA synthesis during oxidative stress (Ramsay2018Structural). BRF2 is also implicated in carcinogenesis, as its overexpression can overcome oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Ramsay2018Structural).

## Function
The BRF2 gene encodes a transcription factor that is a critical component of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription initiation complex. In healthy human cells, BRF2 is specifically required for transcription from type 3 Pol III promoters, which are responsible for the expression of small non-coding RNAs, such as U6 snRNA and 7SK RNA (Saxena2005StructureFunction; Lockwood2010Integrative). These RNAs play essential roles in RNA processing and protein synthesis, fundamental processes for cellular growth and proliferation (Lockwood2010Integrative).

BRF2 functions by forming a complex with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other factors like Bdp1, facilitating the recruitment of Pol III to specific gene promoters (Saxena2005StructureFunction). The C-terminal domain of BRF2 is crucial for its interaction with TBP and the assembly of the transcription initiation complex, which is necessary for efficient transcription initiation (Saxena2005StructureFunction). BRF2 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and participates in the formation of transcription complexes, ensuring the proper transcription of essential non-coding RNAs (Saxena2005StructureFunction). This activity is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
BRF2 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as an oncogene. In breast cancer, BRF2 alterations are present in 21% of patients and are associated with a significant decrease in overall survival. These alterations often co-occur with MYC alterations, further worsening the prognosis. Patients with both BRF2 and MYC alterations have a median survival of 113.73 months compared to 212.09 months for those without these alterations. BRF2 alterations are mutually exclusive with PIK3CA alterations and are particularly detrimental in younger patients aged 35-50, where they significantly decrease survival (CabarcasPetroski2020A).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), BRF2 is identified as a lineage-specific oncogene. It is frequently amplified, with up to 40% of SqCC tumors showing increased copy numbers in the 8p12-8p11.21 region. This amplification is linked to increased RNA polymerase III activity, promoting cell growth and proliferation. Knockdown experiments in SqCC cell lines with BRF2 amplification show decreased proliferation, underscoring its role in tumorigenesis (Lockwood2010Integrative).

BRF2 overexpression is also noted in other cancers, including gastric, kidney, melanoma, and bladder cancers, correlating with poor survival outcomes and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cabarcas2011RNA; Gouge2015Redox).

## Interactions
BRF2 is a transcription factor involved in RNA polymerase III transcription, specifically interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate transcription initiation. It forms part of the TFIIIB complex, which is crucial for recruiting RNA polymerase III to type III promoters. BRF2 interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and Bdp1, forming a complex that binds to the TATA box and proximal sequence element (PSE) on DNA, essential for transcription initiation of small RNA molecules like U6 snRNA (Saxena2005StructureFunction).

The C-terminal domain of BRF2 is particularly important for its interactions. It is essential for binding to the TBP-TATA box complex and recruiting Bdp1, forming a stable transcription complex. This domain also interacts with SNAP c, a transcription factor specific to type 3 promoters, highlighting its role in transcription complex assembly (Saxena2005StructureFunction).

BRF2 also participates in redox regulation, with specific interactions involving its residue C361, which forms bonds with the DNA backbone. This interaction is crucial for the stability of the Pol III pre-initiation complex (Gouge2015Redox). Additionally, BRF2 interacts with human Maf1, a repressor of RNA polymerase III transcription, through direct interactions that inhibit U6 transcription (Rollins2007Human).
