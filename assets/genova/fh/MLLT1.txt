# MLLT1

## Overview
MLLT1, also known as ENL, is a gene that encodes the MLLT1 super elongation complex subunit, a protein integral to transcriptional regulation. This protein is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC), which is crucial for mRNA elongation by RNA polymerase II, thereby playing a significant role in gene expression and chromatin biology. The MLLT1 protein contains a YEATS domain, which functions as an epigenetic reader by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, facilitating chromatin localization and transcriptional activation (Perlman2015MLLT1; Ni2021Structure). Additionally, MLLT1 interacts with various proteins through its ANC1 homology domain, contributing to its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Kabra2022The). Mutations in the MLLT1 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including Wilms tumor and leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Kabra2022The; Perlman2015MLLT1).

## Structure
The MLLT1 protein, also known as ENL, contains a YEATS domain, which is crucial for its function as an epigenetic reader. This domain recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, playing a significant role in chromatin localization and gene expression (Ni2021Structure). The YEATS domain is characterized by a beta-sheet topology and an open, shallow binding channel that accommodates larger lysine modifications, distinguishing it from bromodomains (Ni2019Structural). 

Mutations in the YEATS domain, particularly in loop 8, lead to significant conformational changes that affect the protein's interaction with acetylated and acylated histones. These mutations can alter the binding interface, impacting MLLT1's function as an epigenetic reader (Ni2021Structure). Despite these mutations, the acetyl/acyllysine binding pocket remains largely unperturbed, allowing for the binding of inhibitors with affinities similar to the wild type (Ni2021Structure).

MLLT1 also has an ANC1 homology domain (AHD) located in its C-terminal region, which is involved in interactions with various proteins such as AF4, DOT1L, BCOR, and CBX8. This domain undergoes a coupled binding and folding event upon interaction, transitioning from a disordered to a more structured state (Kabra2022The). 

A novel isoform of MLLT1, resulting from the skipping of Exon 5, has been identified. This isoform, MLLT1-Δ5, is expressed in mouse testes and has a predicted molecular weight of 56.3 kDa, compared to the full-length protein's 60.8 kDa (Wallingford2015Identification).

## Function
MLLT1, also known as ENL, is a crucial component of the super elongation complex (SEC), which regulates mRNA elongation by RNA polymerase II during transcription. This protein plays a significant role in transcriptional elongation, a process essential for normal development and the prevention of neoplastic transformation (Perlman2015MLLT1). MLLT1 interacts with several proteins, including AFF4, PTEFb, and ELL2, to facilitate transcriptional elongation. The C-terminal region of MLLT1 binds to AFF4, which then interacts with PTEFb and ELL2, while the N-terminal YEATS domain binds to the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), linking RNA polymerase II to the chromatin template (Perlman2015MLLT1).

The YEATS domain of MLLT1 is involved in recognizing and binding acetylated histones, specifically H3K9ac, which is a key process in regulating gene expression (Perlman2015MLLT1). MLLT1 is also involved in chromatin biology through its interaction with histones H3 and H1, facilitated by its YEATS domain (Marei2022Exome). This domain's reader activities are crucial for the localization of proteins to chromatin, initiating the expression of target genes (Ni2021Structure). MLLT1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcriptional regulators to modulate gene expression, playing a significant regulatory role in transcription (Ni2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MLLT1 gene have been implicated in several cancers, notably Wilms tumor and certain leukemias. In Wilms tumor, a common pediatric kidney cancer, mutations in the YEATS domain of MLLT1 are recurrent and associated with favorable histology. These mutations lead to altered binding to acetylated histone tails, increased expression of MYC, and dysregulation of HOX genes, contributing to tumorigenesis (Perlman2015MLLT1). MLLT1 mutations are also linked to increased expression of HOXA13 and its adjacent lncRNA HOTTIP, which are not typical in normal renal development and are associated with poor outcomes in other cancers (Perlman2015MLLT1).

In leukemia, MLLT1 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), forming oncogenic fusion proteins that drive aggressive cancer growth. These fusions are observed in a significant percentage of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases (Kabra2022The; Ni2021Structure). Additionally, a frameshift mutation in MLLT1 has been identified in glioblastoma multiforme, suggesting a potential role in glioma pathogenesis (Marei2022Exome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MLLT1 mutations in various cancers, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
MLLT1, also known as ENL, is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC) and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with various proteins. MLLT1 interacts with the SEC components, including AF4, AFF1, and ELL, to enhance transcriptional elongation by concentrating the SEC and facilitating the phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) (Kabra2022The). It colocalizes with the phase-separated SEC component AFF4, and its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) mediate phase separation, which is crucial for concentrating CDK9 in live cells (Kabra2022The).

MLLT1 also forms part of the AF4-ENL-P-TEFb complex (AEP) and the DOT1L complex (DotCom), which are critical for transcription regulation (Kabra2022The). The YEATS domain of MLLT1 acts as an epigenetic reader, binding to acetylated and crotonylated lysines, which is essential for chromatin remodeling and histone modification (Kabra2022The). MLLT1's interactions with other proteins, such as DOT1L, AF4, and CBX8, are mediated through its ANC1 homology domain (AHD), which is important for gene expression and recruiting transcriptional activators (Ui2016Collaboration). These interactions highlight MLLT1's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like leukemia.
