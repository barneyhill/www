# BRMS1

## Overview
BRMS1 (Breast Cancer Metastasis Suppressor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein known as the BRMS1 transcriptional repressor and anoikis regulator, which plays a critical role in the suppression of metastasis in various cancers. The BRMS1 protein is primarily involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling, functioning as part of the mSin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to regulate gene expression through histone deacetylation (Meehan2004Breast). This protein is characterized by structural features such as coiled-coil domains and nuclear localization signals, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to the nucleus (Zimmermann2020BRMS1:; SpínolaAmilibia2011The). BRMS1 is involved in the regulation of microRNAs and transcription factors, contributing to its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cancer progression (Hurst2011Unraveling; Hurst2012Metastasis). Alterations in BRMS1 expression, often due to epigenetic changes, are associated with increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis in cancers such as breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (Yang2011Promoter; Metge2008Epigenetic).

## Structure
The BRMS1 protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function as a metastasis suppressor. The primary structure includes a glutamate-rich region at the N-terminus (amino acids 1-50), two coiled-coil domains (amino acids 51-81 and 147-180), and two nuclear localization signals (NLS) (amino acids 198-205 and 239-245) (Zimmermann2020BRMS1:). The N-terminal coiled-coil region (residues 51-98) forms an antiparallel coiled-coil motif, which oligomerizes into a hexameric structure, specifically a trimer of coiled-coil dimers (SpínolaAmilibia2011The). This hexameric arrangement is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges, with a total buried surface area of 14,355 Å² (SpínolaAmilibia2011The).

The C-terminal region of BRMS1 is crucial for its interactions with the Sin3/HDAC complex, and phosphorylation at serine 237 by CDK2 affects these interactions, impacting metastasis suppression (Zimmermann2021Perturbation). BRMS1 also contains imperfect leucine zippers, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Zimmermann2020BRMS1:). The protein is not entirely evolutionarily conserved but shares homology with Suds3, and murine Brms1 is 95% conserved with the human form (Zimmermann2020BRMS1:). The full-length structure of BRMS1 has not been crystallized, and further studies are needed to fully understand its molecular structure and function (Zimmermann2021Perturbation).

## Function
BRMS1 (Breast Cancer Metastasis Suppressor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, BRMS1 functions primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with the mSin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, including components like HDAC1 and HDAC2, to regulate gene expression through histone deacetylation (Meehan2004Breast). This interaction leads to a more compact chromatin structure, reducing gene expression and potentially influencing cellular processes such as cell adhesion and communication (Meehan2004Breast).

BRMS1 is also involved in the regulation of microRNAs, known as metastamirs, which play roles in metastasis suppression (Hurst2011Unraveling). It modulates the activity of transcription factors like NFκB, which are involved in tumor progression, by recruiting HDAC1 to deacetylate histones and reduce NFκB transactivation (Hurst2012Metastasis). The protein's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation suggests it may help maintain normal cellular functions and prevent abnormal cell proliferation (Hurst2012Metastasis).

BRMS1's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cancer progression by modulating gene expression and maintaining cell adhesion (Hurst2011Unraveling).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BRMS1 gene are associated with various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Loss of BRMS1 expression is linked to increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. This loss is often due to epigenetic silencing, such as hypermethylation of the BRMS1 promoter region, which is observed in aggressive breast cancer cell lines and correlates with reduced expression (Metge2008Epigenetic; Chen2011Recent). In breast cancer, reduced BRMS1 expression is associated with worse outcomes, especially in patients with ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-positive tumors (Hicks2006Loss). Conversely, higher BRMS1 mRNA levels are linked to better prognosis and disease-free survival (Zhang2006Reduced).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BRMS1 promoter methylation is a tumor-specific event associated with lower mRNA expression and poorer survival outcomes. Smoking history is positively correlated with BRMS1 promoter methylation, suggesting tobacco use may contribute to this epigenetic change (Yang2011Promoter). In melanoma, cytoplasmic BRMS1 expression is linked to a less aggressive phenotype and longer survival, indicating a potential role in tumor invasion regulation (Slipicevic2012Cytoplasmic). These findings suggest that BRMS1 expression levels and promoter methylation status could serve as potential biomarkers for cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
BRMS1 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that play a role in transcriptional repression and metastasis suppression. It forms complexes with retinoblastoma-binding protein 1 (RBP1) and components of the mSin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, including HDAC1, HDAC2, mSin3A, mSin3B, SAP30, RbAp46, and RbAp48 (Meehan2004Breast). These interactions are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that BRMS1 is part of a specialized subset of mSin3 HDAC complexes (Meehan2004Breast).

BRMS1's interaction with RBP1 is mediated by a specific region between amino acids 91 and 164, which is crucial for binding (Meehan2004Breast). Despite its interactions with the mSin3-HDAC complex, BRMS1 does not co-immunoprecipitate with Rb or p107, suggesting it is part of a different RBP1 complex that does not include Rb (Meehan2004Breast).

The protein also interacts with ARID4A, another component of the SIN3-HDAC complex, through its second coiled-coil domain (residues 147-180). Mutations in this domain can disrupt the interaction, although BRMS1 can still suppress metastasis, indicating that other interactions within the complex may compensate for the loss of direct BRMS1-ARID4A interaction (Hurst2008Alterations).
