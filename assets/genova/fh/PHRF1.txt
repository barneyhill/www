# PHRF1

## Overview
PHRF1, or PHD and ring finger domains 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, including DNA repair and signal transduction. The protein encoded by PHRF1 is characterized by the presence of a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a RING finger domain, classifying it as a ubiquitin ligase. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a key DNA repair mechanism. Additionally, PHRF1 acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the TGF-β signaling pathway, influencing cell growth and differentiation. The protein's interactions with histone modifications and other nuclear proteins underscore its involvement in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. Beyond its role in cancer biology, PHRF1 is also implicated in neural function, affecting dendritic architecture and memory formation (Chang2015PHRF1; Shih2020An; Ettahar2013Identification).

## Structure


## Function
The PHRF1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity and regulating the TGF-β signaling pathway in healthy human cells. PHRF1 is involved in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a critical DNA repair mechanism. It contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) that recognizes methylated histones, specifically H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, and a RING domain that facilitates ubiquitination of substrates. This protein is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites upon genotoxic stress, where it interacts with NBS1 and mediates PARP1 polyubiquitination for proteasomal degradation, promoting NHEJ and maintaining genomic stability (Chang2015PHRF1).

PHRF1 also functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating the TGF-β signaling pathway. It enforces the decay of the homeodomain protein TGIF by driving its ubiquitination at lysine 130, which is essential for the redistribution of the cytoplasmic variant of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (cPML) into the cytoplasm. This process coordinates the activation of Smad2 by the TGF-β receptor, promoting the TGF-β cytostatic program and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Ettahar2013Identification). PHRF1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin and other nuclear proteins, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and tumor suppression (Ettahar2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
PHRF1 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell migration and invasion. High levels of PHRF1 expression are associated with poor survival outcomes in several cancer types, including ovarian, gastric, lung squamous carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and cervical cell carcinoma (Lee2020PHRF1). PHRF1 promotes cancer progression by modulating ZEB1 expression, a key regulator in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances cancer cell mobility and invasion (Lee2020PHRF1). Overexpression of PHRF1 facilitates EMT in lung cancer cells, leading to increased migration and invasion, while its suppression impedes these processes (Lee2020PHRF1).

In addition to its role in cancer, PHRF1 is involved in dendritic architecture and memory formation in the brain. Loss of PHRF1 in the forebrain of mice results in anxiety-like behaviors and impaired spatial learning and memory, highlighting its importance in neural function (Shih2020An). These findings suggest that alterations in PHRF1 expression or function could have significant implications for neurological disorders characterized by dendritic abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction (Shih2020An).

## Interactions
PHRF1 (PHD and ring finger domains 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. PHRF1 interacts with histone modifications H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 through its PHD domain, acting as a methylated histone reader. This interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage, facilitating its role in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair (Chang2015PHRF1). PHRF1 also associates with NBS1 via the SDTE motif, a conserved CK2 phosphorylation site, which may interact with the FHA domain of NBS1. This interaction is essential for PHRF1's function in NHEJ, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses showing PHRF1 and NBS1 in the same immunocomplex (Chang2015PHRF1).

In the context of TGF-β signaling, PHRF1 interacts with TGIF, a homeodomain repressor factor, targeting it for degradation. This interaction is crucial for the redistribution of cPML into the cytoplasm, facilitating TGF-β signaling (Prunier2015Disruption). PHRF1's interaction with TGIF is modulated by TGF-β signaling, as shown by decreased interaction upon TGF-β exposure (Ettahar2013Identification). PHRF1 also interacts with the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain of Rpb1, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, through its SRI domain, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of ZEB1, a key transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Lee2020PHRF1).
