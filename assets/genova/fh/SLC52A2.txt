# SLC52A2

## Overview
The SLC52A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 52 member 2, also known as riboflavin transporter 2 (RFVT2), which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) across cell membranes. This protein is characterized by its 11 transmembrane helices and is primarily expressed in the brain and spinal cord, playing a crucial role in maintaining riboflavin homeostasis in the central nervous system (Zhao2022First; Console2019Reconstitution). RFVT2 facilitates sodium-independent riboflavin transport, which is essential for the synthesis of coenzymes involved in metabolic processes (Zhao2022First). Mutations in the SLC52A2 gene are linked to Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, a rare neurodegenerative disorder, underscoring the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Haack2012Impaired; Mah2017A.05).

## Structure
The SLC52A2 gene encodes the riboflavin transporter 2 (RFVT2), a protein consisting of 445 amino acids. This protein is characterized by 11 transmembrane helices, which facilitate its role in riboflavin transport across cell membranes (Zhao2022First; Console2019Reconstitution). The RFVT2 protein is predicted to have a large hydrophilic loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane segments, containing several negatively charged amino acids (Console2019Reconstitution). 

The protein's structure includes a large central cavity, as revealed by homology modeling, which is crucial for its function in riboflavin transport (Console2021Impact). The RFVT2 protein is primarily expressed in the brain and spinal cord, playing a significant role in maintaining riboflavin homeostasis in the central nervous system (Zhao2022First). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's orientation in the cell membrane is similar to that in proteoliposomes, suggesting a consistent structural arrangement that supports its transport function (Console2019Reconstitution). The RFVT2 protein's structure and function are critical for its role in riboflavin uptake and homeostasis.

## Function
The SLC52A2 gene encodes the riboflavin transporter 2 (RFVT2), a crucial protein for the transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) across cell membranes. This transporter is primarily active at the basolateral cell membrane and facilitates sodium-independent riboflavin transport, which is optimal at physiological pH (Console2019Reconstitution). Riboflavin is essential for cellular metabolism as it is a precursor for the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids (Zhao2022First).

RFVT2 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in the brain and salivary gland, indicating its significant role in maintaining riboflavin homeostasis in these tissues (Console2019Reconstitution). The protein consists of 11 transmembrane α-helices and two large hydrophilic loops, which are important for its function in riboflavin transport (Console2019Reconstitution). The transporter mediates both the uptake and efflux of riboflavin, ensuring adequate cellular levels of this vital nutrient (Console2019Reconstitution). Proper function of RFVT2 is critical for maintaining normal cellular processes, and its disruption can lead to severe metabolic and neurological disorders (Zhao2022First).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC52A2 gene are associated with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVL), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, bulbar palsy, and respiratory issues. This condition is also known as Riboflavin Transporter Deficiency Type 2 (RTD2) and is caused by impaired riboflavin transport due to mutations in the SLC52A2 gene, which encodes the riboflavin transporter RFVT-2 (Zhao2022First; Haack2012Impaired; Mah2017A.05).

The clinical presentation of BVVL includes symptoms such as ataxia, muscle weakness, optic atrophy, and respiratory insufficiency. These symptoms are linked to the disruption of riboflavin transport, which is crucial for various metabolic processes (Zhao2022First; Shi2019A). Mutations in SLC52A2 can lead to a range of clinical phenotypes, with missense mutations being the most common. The G306R mutation, in particular, is associated with ataxia and respiratory insufficiency (Zhao2022First).

Riboflavin supplementation has been shown to improve clinical symptoms in patients with SLC52A2 mutations, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment (Haack2012Impaired; Shi2019A). The variability in clinical presentation suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic factors may influence the disease phenotype (Zhao2022First).

## Interactions
The SLC52A2 gene encodes the riboflavin transporter 2 (RFVT2), which is involved in riboflavin transport across cell membranes. This transporter has been shown to interact with various proteins and ions that modulate its activity. For instance, RFVT2 activity is inhibited by flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and lumiflavin, indicating competitive binding at the same site on the transporter (Console2021Impact; Console2019Reconstitution). Divalent cations such as Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ also affect RFVT2 function, with Mg²⁺ showing potent inhibition and Ca²⁺ exhibiting a dual-mode effect, initially inhibiting and then reversing inhibition at higher concentrations (Console2019Reconstitution).

Additionally, SLC52A2 has been implicated in genetic interactions with other solute carrier family members. Notably, it interacts with SLC25A32, a putative mitochondrial folate/FAD transporter, suggesting a functional relationship that may influence cellular energetics and growth (Girardi2020A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing riboflavin transport and its integration into broader metabolic pathways.
