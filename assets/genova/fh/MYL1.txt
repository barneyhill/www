# MYL1

## Overview
The MYL1 gene encodes the myosin light chain 1 protein, a crucial component of the myosin complex involved in muscle contraction. This gene is specifically expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscles and produces two splice variant isoforms, MLC1F and MLC3F, through alternative splicing. Myosin light chain 1 is categorized as part of the EF-hand Ca2+ binding protein family, although it has lost the ability to bind calcium ions. The protein plays a significant role in stabilizing the myosin neck lever arm structure, which is essential for the proper function of the molecular motor during muscle contraction. MYL1 is the most abundant myosin light chain across all myofibre types, with a higher prevalence in type IIA/IIX myofibres, indicating its critical role in skeletal muscle function. Mutations in MYL1 are linked to severe congenital myopathy, underscoring its importance in muscle physiology (Sitbon2019Insights; Ravenscroft2018Biallelic). Additionally, MYL1 expression has been implicated in various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, where it influences tumor progression and immune responses (Chen2021MYBPC2; Li2023Analysis).

## Structure
The MYL1 gene encodes the myosin light chain 1 protein, which is involved in muscle contraction. The primary structure of MYL1 includes two splice variant isoforms, MLC1F and MLC3F, which result from alternative splicing. MLC1F is a longer isoform, while MLC3F is shorter due to an NH2-terminal truncation (Hernandez2007Myosin; Sitbon2019Insights). 

The secondary structure of MYL1 proteins is characterized by a significant proportion of alpha helices, as seen in the sheep MYL1 isoforms, which are predicted to have more than half of their structure in alpha-helical form (Zhang2015Molecular). The tertiary structure of MYL1 proteins is predicted to be similar to the human MYL2 protein, forming barrels with helically symmetric ends (Zhang2015Molecular).

MYL1 proteins are part of the myosin multi-protein complex, which includes two essential light chains (ELCs) and two regulatory light chains (RLCs) that bind to the lever arm neck of the myosin cross-bridge/head (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic). These interactions are crucial for muscle contraction, as the ELCs stabilize the neck lever arm structure and fine-tune the molecular motor (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic). The MYL1 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its function (Zhang2015Molecular).

## Function
The MYL1 gene encodes the fast skeletal muscle-specific essential light chain, which plays a critical role in muscle contraction. MYL1 produces two splice isoforms, MLC1F and MLC3F, which are integral components of the myosin multi-protein complex. This complex includes two essential light chains (ELCs), two regulatory light chains (RLCs), and two myosin heavy chains (MHCs). The ELCs and RLCs bind to the lever arm neck of the myosin cross-bridge/head, specifically to the first two IQ motifs, stabilizing the neck lever arm structure to produce steps of a definite size and fine-tuning the molecular motor (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, MYL1 is the most abundant myosin light chain across all myofibre types, with higher abundance in type IIA/IIX compared to type I myofibres. This suggests that while MYL1 is considered a fast-specific essential light chain, it plays a critical role in the function of all skeletal myofibre types (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic). The interaction between ELC and MHC involves both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with the latter playing a major role in proper binding and orientation (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic). The absence of MYL1 protein leads to severe congenital myopathy, highlighting its essential role in muscle function (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYL1 gene are associated with severe congenital myopathy, a condition characterized by muscle weakness and the absence or hypotrophy of type II myofibers. Bi-allelic mutations in MYL1 can lead to significant muscle pathology, including unusual small type II myofibers and severe muscle weakness, often requiring mechanical ventilation shortly after birth (Ravenscroft2018Biallelic). Specific mutations, such as the p.Met163Arg substitution, disrupt the interaction between the essential light chains and myosin heavy chains, impairing muscle contraction and leading to myopathic features (Sitbon2019Insights; Ravenscroft2018Biallelic).

Alterations in MYL1 expression levels have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), MYL1 is down-regulated and identified as a poor prognostic biomarker. Despite its low expression, MYL1 promotes tumor metastasis and is involved in immune infiltration, correlating with the infiltration of CD4+ T cells (Li2023Analysis). In rhabdomyosarcoma, MYL1 is up-regulated, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential target for diagnosis and treatment (Chen2021MYBPC2).

## Interactions
MYL1, or myosin light chain 1, is involved in muscle contraction by interacting with myosin heavy chains to form the myosin complex, which is crucial for muscle function. The N-terminus of MYL1 plays a significant role in actin-myosin interaction, modulating force during muscle contraction. This region can interact with actin, potentially altering force development by acting as a bridge between the myosin head and actin, thereby influencing cross-bridge cycling kinetics (Sitbon2019Insights).

MYL1 is expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscles and is part of the EF-hand Ca2+ binding protein family, although it has lost the ability to bind Ca2+. The C-terminal region of MYL1 interacts with myosin heavy chains and possibly with regulatory light chains, contributing to its role in muscle contraction (Sitbon2019Insights).

In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), MYL1 expression correlates with the infiltration of various immune cells, suggesting that it may influence immune responses in this type of cancer. MYL1 is associated with increased expression of EGF and EGFR proteins, indicating a link to the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway, which is involved in tumor cell viability, migration, and invasion (Li2023Analysis).
