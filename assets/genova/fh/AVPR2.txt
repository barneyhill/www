# AVPR2

## Overview
The AVPR2 gene encodes the arginine vasopressin receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of water balance in the human body. This receptor is primarily located in the kidney's collecting ducts, where it mediates the action of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) to facilitate water reabsorption. Structurally, the AVPR2 receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a defining feature of the GPCR superfamily, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Wildin1998AVPR2). Upon AVP binding, the receptor activates a signaling cascade that increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, ultimately promoting the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels into the cell membrane, thereby enhancing water reabsorption (Wildin1998AVPR2). Mutations in the AVPR2 gene can lead to disorders such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, or nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, which involves excessive water retention (Spanakis2008AVPR2; Erdélyi2023V2). Understanding the structure and function of the AVPR2 gene and its encoded receptor is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying these conditions and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Structure
The AVPR2 gene encodes the arginine vasopressin receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in water reabsorption in the kidneys. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of the GPCR superfamily (Wildin1998AVPR2). These helices form the core of the receptor's secondary structure, facilitating its function in signal transduction.

The AVPR2 receptor includes extracellular and intracellular loops, which are crucial for ligand binding and G-protein interaction, respectively (Wildin1998AVPR2). The receptor also features a significant C-terminal tail, which may play a role in receptor regulation and signaling.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in AVPR2, influencing its stability, localization, and function (Thibonnier1998Molecular). These modifications are essential for the receptor's proper function and regulation.

AVPR2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties and tissue-specific expression (Wildin1998AVPR2). The structural integrity and function of AVPR2 are critical for its role in maintaining water homeostasis, and mutations in this gene are linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Chen2021Valine279).

## Function
The AVPR2 gene encodes the V2 vasopressin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the kidney's collecting ducts. This receptor plays a crucial role in water homeostasis by mediating the effects of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) (Wildin1998AVPR2; Bichet1996Vasopressin). Upon binding of AVP, the V2 receptor activates adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. This signaling cascade results in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB, ultimately promoting the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels into the apical membrane of collecting duct cells (Wildin1998AVPR2).

The insertion of aquaporin-2 channels enhances the kidney's ability to reabsorb water from urine back into the bloodstream, concentrating the urine and maintaining body fluid balance (Wildin1998AVPR2; Bichet1996Vasopressin). This process is essential for preventing dehydration and ensuring proper water conservation in the body. The proper functioning of the AVPR2 gene is critical for effective water reabsorption, and disruptions in this pathway can lead to conditions such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, characterized by an inability to concentrate urine (Wildin1998AVPR2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AVPR2 gene are primarily associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a disorder characterized by the kidney's inability to respond to the antidiuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP), leading to excessive urination and thirst (Spanakis2008AVPR2; García2015Novel). Approximately 90% of hereditary NDI cases are due to mutations in the AVPR2 gene, which is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner (Spanakis2008AVPR2). These mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift deletions, and other types, with missense mutations being the most common (Spanakis2008AVPR2; Sasaki2012Hereditary).

In addition to NDI, gain-of-function mutations in the AVPR2 gene can lead to nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD), characterized by hyponatremia due to excessive water retention (Erdélyi2023V2). The I130N mutation is an example of a gain-of-function mutation that causes NSIAD by leading to a constitutively active receptor (Erdélyi2015Mutation).

Alterations in AVPR2 expression or function can significantly impact water balance and blood pressure regulation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of these conditions (Duzenli2012Mutations). Genetic testing for AVPR2 variants is crucial for early diagnosis and management of these disorders (Joshi2018Novel).

## Interactions
The AVPR2 protein, also known as the vasopressin V2 receptor, interacts with the molecular chaperone calnexin during its biogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the proper folding and quality control of the receptor within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Both wild-type and mutant forms of AVPR2, such as S315R and R337X, have been shown to associate with calnexin. The interaction is prolonged for mutant receptors, particularly the R337X mutant, which is retained in the ER longer than the wild-type receptor. This suggests that calnexin plays a role in retaining misfolded proteins within the ER, preventing their progression to the cell surface (Morello2001Association).

The interaction between AVPR2 and calnexin is part of the protein's quality control mechanism, as calnexin assists in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and targets improperly folded molecules for degradation. This is particularly relevant for AVPR2 mutations that cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, where the receptor is often misfolded and retained intracellularly (Brady2002G). The interaction with calnexin is specific, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in COS-1 cells (Morello2001Association).
