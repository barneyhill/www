# SAFB

## Overview
The SAFB gene encodes the scaffold attachment factor B protein, a multifunctional nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and chromatin organization. As a member of the scaffold/matrix attachment region-binding proteins, SAFB plays a critical role in maintaining chromatin structure and gene expression by binding to specific DNA regions (Oesterreich2003Scaffold; Nayler1998SAFB). The protein is characterized by distinct domains, such as the SAF-Box for DNA binding, an RNA recognition motif, and a nuclear localization signal, which facilitate its diverse functions (Garee2009SAFB1’s). SAFB is also involved in protein-protein interactions, acting as a transcriptional corepressor in pathways involving nuclear receptors like estrogen receptor alpha (Garee2009SAFB1’s). Its regulatory roles extend to stress response and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Garee2009SAFB1’s). Alterations in SAFB expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Huo2020The; Rivers2015iCLIP).

## Structure
The SAFB (scaffold attachment factor B) protein is a multifunctional protein with several distinct domains contributing to its structure and function. It contains a conserved SAF-Box (SAP domain) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for DNA binding, particularly to scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) (Oesterreich2003Scaffold; Nayler1998SAFB). The central region of SAFB includes an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), facilitating its role in RNA processing and nuclear import (Garee2009SAFB1’s). The C-terminal region is rich in glutamic acid and arginine, which are important for protein-protein interactions and transcriptional repression (Nayler1998SAFB; Garee2009SAFB1’s).

SAFB is known to form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Nayler1998SAFB). The protein also exhibits multiple splice variants, which contribute to its functional diversity (Huo2020The). These structural features enable SAFB to participate in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and RNA splicing (Huo2020The; Oesterreich2003Scaffold).

## Function
SAFB (scaffold attachment factor B) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and chromatin organization. In healthy human cells, SAFB acts as a transcriptional repressor, influencing the expression of genes by binding to scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) and regulating chromatin structure (Oesterreich2003Scaffold; Garee2009SAFB1’s). It interacts with nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and functions as a corepressor, affecting multiple signaling pathways (Garee2009SAFB1’s).

SAFB is also involved in RNA processing, where it binds to RNA and interacts with RNA processing proteins, suggesting a role in coupling transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing (Rivers2015iCLIP; Garee2009SAFB1’s). It is particularly active in the nucleus, where it participates in chromatin organization by binding to AT-rich S/MARs and BURs, which are crucial for higher-order chromatin structure and gene expression modulation (Garee2009SAFB1’s).

In terms of organismal outcomes, SAFB is implicated in cell growth, stress response, and apoptosis. It relocates to stress-induced sub-nuclear bodies during stress response and is involved in apoptosis through caspase-3-dependent cleavage (Garee2009SAFB1’s). SAFB's role in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SAFB gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, SAFB1 is associated with sporadic cases, where high rates of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 19p13 locus correlate with poorer survival outcomes in patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy (Garee2009SAFB1’s). SAFB1 acts as a corepressor of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and its low expression is linked to worse survival and aneuploidy in breast cancer patients (Oesterreich2003Scaffold). Although SAFB1 and SAFB2 are not major contributors to hereditary breast cancer, they may still play a role in tumor suppression (Bergman2008No).

SAFB is also involved in the stabilization of heterochromatin architecture, and its deregulation is linked to the etiology of cancers such as breast, prostate, and colon cancers (Huo2020The). In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, SAFB1 is associated with schizophrenia, where SNPs or duplications at the 19p13.3-p13.2 locus increase susceptibility (Rivers2015iCLIP). SAFB1's role in RNA processing and neuronal function suggests its involvement in synaptic function and neuropsychiatric diseases (Rivers2015iCLIP).

## Interactions
SAFB (Scaffold Attachment Factor B) is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. SAFB interacts with the FUS protein and the nuclear matrix-associated protein Matrin3, forming part of a complex involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that SAFB tethers FUS to the chromatin-bound fraction (Yamaguchi2016FUS).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, SAFB associates with nascent RNAs and interacts with RS domain-containing and nuclear speckle-associated proteins, suggesting its role in splicing regulation and gene expression. The carboxy-terminal domain of SAFB is crucial for these interactions (Cherney2023SAFB).

SAFB also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and is involved in regulating AR-mediated transcription in concert with the kinase MST1 and the methyltransferase EZH2. This interaction is significant in prostate cancer, where SAFB acts as a tumor suppressor (Mukhopadhyay2013Scaffold).

In neuronal cells, SAFB1 binds to RNA, particularly purine-rich motifs, and influences alternative splicing. It interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing, such as AUF1/hnRNP D and SRSF1, supporting its role in RNA regulatory complexes (Rivers2015iCLIP).
