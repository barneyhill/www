# HOXB2

## Overview
The HOXB2 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors critical for regulating gene expression during embryonic development. The protein encoded by HOXB2, homeobox B2, plays a pivotal role in the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis in developing embryos and is involved in the differentiation and maintenance of various tissues in adults. As a transcription factor, homeobox B2 influences cellular pathways that are essential for normal lung and breast tissue development and function (Svingen2003Altered; Clemenceau2018Lung). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and varies across different tissues, reflecting its role in maintaining organ specificity and regional identity (Takahashi2004Expression). Additionally, HOXB2 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels can serve as biomarkers for disease progression and prognosis (Kumar2021Estrogen; Paço2020Methylation).

## Function
HOXB2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. It is part of the homeobox gene family, which is crucial for patterning along the anterior-posterior axis in developing embryos. In healthy human cells, HOXB2 is involved in normal lung development and function, as it is expressed along the respiratory tract. This expression is part of the broader role of HOX genes in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (Clemenceau2018Lung).

HOXB2 is also expressed in normal adult human breast tissue, indicating its involvement in maintaining tissue-specific architecture and potentially contributing to normal phenotypic maintenance in a tissue-specific manner (Svingen2003Altered). The expression patterns of HOX genes, including HOXB2, vary across different organs, with some organs expressing almost all HOX genes and others expressing fewer. This suggests a role in maintaining organ specificity and regional identity, similar to their roles during embryogenesis (Takahashi2004Expression).

Overall, HOXB2's function in healthy cells is linked to its role as a transcription factor, influencing various cellular pathways and contributing to the development and maintenance of specific tissues.

## Clinical Significance
The HOXB2 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In bladder cancer, HOXB2 serves as a biomarker for predicting high-grade, noninvasive disease, indicating its role in disease progression (Paço2020Methylation). It is also associated with lymph node metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its hypermethylation is part of a signature found exclusively in metastatic lymph nodes, suggesting its potential utility in early diagnosis and prognosis (Paço2020Methylation).

In breast cancer, HOXB2 expression is influenced by estrogen signaling. Estrogen suppresses HOXB2 expression via the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), with differential effects observed in various breast cancer cell lines. This suppression is linked to the gene's proposed tumor suppressor function, although its exact role remains complex and may vary across different breast cancer subtypes (Kumar2021Estrogen). High expression of HOXB2 has been observed in certain breast cancer subtypes, such as Luminal or HER2+, where it may act as a negative regulator of tumor growth (de2020HOX).

In acute myeloid leukemia, HOXB2 may function as a tumor suppressor, contrasting with its association with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma and non-resectable pancreatic tumors (Kumar2021Estrogen).

## Interactions
HOXB2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, forming complexes that play significant roles in gene regulation. One notable interaction involves the formation of a trimeric complex with Hoxb1, Pbx1a, and Meis1a, which binds to the Hoxb2 r4 enhancer. This complex is crucial for transcriptional activity in the hindbrain, with the Meis component enhancing DNA binding specificity and transcriptional activation. Mutations in the Meis site of the enhancer disrupt this activation, underscoring the necessity of Meis for proper DNA binding and function (Jacobs1999Trimeric).

HOXB2 also interacts with mutant SOD1 proteins in neuronal cells, co-localizing with mutant SOD1 aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This interaction is mediated through the homeodomain of HOXB2, specifically involving amino acids 119-244. The presence of HOXB2 reduces the insolubility of mutant SOD1, suggesting a role in modulating the aggregation state of mutant SOD1 (Zhai2005HoxB2).

In the context of gamma-globin gene regulation, HOXB2 competes with SATB1 for binding to gamma PE sites. While both proteins can bind independently, they do not form a complex on the DNA, indicating a competitive interaction that influences gene expression (Case1999The).
