# GOLGA6D

## Overview
GOLGA6D is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family member D, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil structure and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A6 family member D is thought to play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. Although the specific functions of GOLGA6D and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, they are believed to be involved in cellular processes that are essential for normal cellular function and homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
