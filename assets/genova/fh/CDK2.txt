# CDK2

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 2, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle. The CDK2 protein is essential for the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase and for the progression through the S phase of the cell cycle, primarily through its interactions with cyclins E and A (Liu2020To). As a kinase, CDK2 phosphorylates various substrates, facilitating processes such as DNA replication, centrosome duplication, and DNA damage repair (Hu2001S; Chung2010Cdk2). The structural configuration of CDK2, including its interaction with cyclins and regulatory proteins, is crucial for its activation and function (Johnson2002Structural). Due to its pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, CDK2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Łukasik2021Cyclin-Dependent; Tadesse2020Targeting).

## Structure
The molecular structure of CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) has been extensively studied, revealing important details about its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure of CDK2 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, with a kinase domain that is crucial for its function (Johnson2002Structural). The secondary structure includes an N-terminal lobe rich in β-sheets and a major helix known as the C or PSTAIRE helix, and a C-terminal lobe that is mostly α-helical (Brown1999The). The tertiary structure of CDK2 is a compact, globular form that interacts with cyclins, which is essential for its activation (Johnson2002Structural). 

In its quaternary structure, CDK2 forms complexes with cyclins, such as cyclin A, which induces significant structural changes, including the rotation and shifting of the C helix to enhance contact with the N-terminal lobe (Johnson2002Structural). The activation segment, which includes the phosphorylatable residue Thr160, plays a critical role in substrate binding and phosphoryl transfer (Johnson2002Structural). CDK2 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Thr160, which is necessary for its activation (Brown1999The).

## Function
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a pivotal regulator of cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the transition from the G1 to S phase and the progression through the S phase. CDK2 forms complexes with cyclins E and A, which are crucial for the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB), facilitating the G1/S transition (Liu2020To). During the S phase, CDK2 is involved in DNA replication and centrosome duplication, targeting substrates such as the DNA replication licensing protein CDC6 (Liu2020To).

CDK2 activity is essential for the proper firing of DNA replication origins, particularly those that replicate late in the S phase (Hu2001S). It also plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair processes, particularly in homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways for double-strand break repair (Liu2020To). CDK2 is involved in the ATR-Chk1-Cdc25A pathway, which is crucial for DNA damage response and cell cycle progression (Chung2010Cdk2).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, CDK2 is implicated in various cellular activities, including chromatin remodeling, apoptosis, and meiosis (Liu2020To). Its activity is linked to maintaining genomic stability and ensuring accurate cell division.

## Clinical Significance
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of CDK2 is associated with several malignancies, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers, where it contributes to accelerated cell cycle progression and chromosomal instability, often correlating with poor prognosis (Łukasik2021Cyclin-Dependent). In melanoma, CDK2 expression is specifically regulated by the transcription factor MITF, making it a critical factor for melanoma cell proliferation. This unique regulation suggests that CDK2 could be a potential drug target for melanoma therapy (Du2004Critical).

CDK2 is also overexpressed in ovarian tumors, prostate cancer metastasis, and KRAS-mutant lung cancers, among others. Its inhibition has shown promise in selectively targeting cancer cells without affecting normal cells, making it a viable therapeutic target (Łukasik2021Cyclin-Dependent; Tadesse2020Targeting). In hormone-dependent cancers like breast and prostate cancer, CDK2 mediates the phosphorylation of hormone receptors, enhancing their transcriptional activity, which is linked to cancer progression and therapy resistance (Tadesse2020Targeting). CDK2 inhibitors are being explored in combination therapies to enhance the effectiveness of existing treatments and overcome drug resistance (Tadesse2020Targeting).

## Interactions
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, primarily through its interactions with cyclins and other regulatory proteins. CDK2 forms active complexes with Cyclin A and Cyclin E, which are essential for the G1/S phase transition and S phase progression. These complexes facilitate the phosphorylation of various transcription factors, including SMAD3, FOXM1, and MYC, thereby modulating oncogenic signaling pathways (Zhang2022Inhibition).

CDK2 also interacts with proteins such as CKS1, KAP, and CDC25A. The GDSEID motif on the C-terminal lobe of CDK2 is a key site for these interactions, involving both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Hope2024Crystallographic). The interaction with CDC25A is particularly significant, as it forms extensive hydrogen bonds with the CDK2 aG helix, supporting its recognition of CDK2 as a substrate (Hope2024Crystallographic).

Inhibitory interactions are also critical for CDK2 regulation. Proteins like p21 and p27 bind to CDK2, inhibiting its kinase activity and thus controlling cell cycle progression. The binding of CDK2 to these inhibitors is influenced by the presence of cyclins, which can enhance the binding affinity of several CDK2 inhibitors (Majumdar2021Allostery).
