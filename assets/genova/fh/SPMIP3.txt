# SPMIP3

## Overview
SPMIP3 is a gene that encodes the sperm microtubule inner protein 3, which is a crucial component of the microtubule structure within sperm cells. This protein plays a significant role in the stability and function of the sperm flagellum, which is essential for sperm motility and fertility. As a structural protein, sperm microtubule inner protein 3 is involved in the organization and maintenance of the axoneme, the core of the flagellum, which is critical for the proper movement and function of spermatozoa. Mutations or dysregulation of the SPMIP3 gene can lead to defects in sperm motility, potentially resulting in male infertility. The study of SPMIP3 and its encoded protein is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying sperm function and fertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
