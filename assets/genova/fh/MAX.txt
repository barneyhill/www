# MAX

## Overview
The MAX gene encodes the MYC associated factor X, a transcription factor that is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation by forming heterodimers with other proteins such as MYC, MAD, MNT, and MGA. These complexes bind to E-box sequences in DNA, modulating gene expression and influencing critical cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Grandori2000The; Blackwood1992Myc). The MYC-MAX heterodimer is particularly important for transcriptional activation, while MAD-MAX and MNT-MAX complexes act as transcriptional repressors (Baudino2001The; Grandori2000The). MAX is constitutively expressed and stable across various cell states, serving as a consistent partner for dynamically regulated proteins like MYC (Blackwood1992Myc). Mutations in the MAX gene are implicated in several hereditary and sporadic tumor syndromes, highlighting its significance in oncogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Lian2024Genotype; Romero2014MAX).

## Structure
The MAX protein is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) family of transcription factors. Its primary structure consists of 160 amino acid residues, with a DNA-binding domain that includes a basic region and a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif (Cohen1995Probing). The secondary structure of MAX features a four-helix bundle composed of two pairs of right-handed helices, with the basic region projecting from the N-terminal face to interact with DNA (Nair2003XRay). The C-terminal extensions form a left-handed coiled-coil, known as a leucine zipper, which is crucial for dimerization (Nair2003XRay).

In its tertiary structure, MAX forms a symmetric homodimer, utilizing its N-terminal α-helical basic regions to grip DNA in a 'scissors grip' fashion (Cohen1995Probing). The quaternary structure involves the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other proteins like Myc and Mad, which are essential for its function in transcriptional regulation (Nair2003XRay). The leucine zipper domain, while not essential for DNA binding, plays a significant role in dimerization specificity (Cohen1995Probing). The protein undergoes structural changes upon DNA binding, transitioning from an open and flexible conformation to a more compact and protected structure (Cohen1995Probing).

## Function
The MAX gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation by forming heterodimers with other proteins such as Myc, Mad, Mnt, and Mga. These heterodimers bind to specific DNA sequences, particularly E-box sequences, to modulate gene expression. The Myc-Max complex is essential for transcriptional activation, influencing cell proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis by binding to CACGTG motifs in DNA (Grandori2000The; Blackwood1992Myc). In contrast, Mad-Max and Mnt-Max complexes act as transcriptional repressors, recruiting corepressor complexes that alter chromatin structure and repress transcription (Baudino2001The).

Max is a stable nuclear protein, constitutively expressed across various cell states, and its levels do not fluctuate significantly with cell cycle changes or mitogenic stimulation (Blackwood1992Myc; Wagner1992Expression). This stability allows Max to serve as a consistent partner for Myc, which is more dynamically regulated. Max homodimers are transcriptionally inert, but they may compete for DNA-binding sites, potentially influencing the balance of transcriptional activation and repression (Baudino2001The). The Max network's ability to form different complexes is crucial for converting environmental signals into specific gene-regulatory programs, impacting cell cycle, growth, and differentiation (Grandori2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAX gene are associated with several hereditary and sporadic tumor syndromes. MAX mutations are linked to hereditary pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) syndrome, with a prevalence of 0.8%-1.9% in PPGL cases. These mutations often result in bilateral pheochromocytoma and early onset, with a high incidence of metastatic disease. The clinical phenotype of MAX mutations resembles that of SDHD- and SDHAF2-related PPGL, involving mechanisms such as the Warburg effect and HIF-MYC/MAX interaction (Duarte2021Case; Lian2024Genotype).

MAX mutations are also associated with pituitary adenomas and other neuroendocrine tumors originating from neural crest cells, collectively referred to as '3PA syndrome' (Lian2024Genotype). In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), MAX acts as a tumor suppressor, with inactivation occurring in about 6% of cases. This inactivation is mutually exclusive with MYC amplifications and BRG1 mutations, suggesting a specific pathway involvement in tumorigenesis (Romero2014MAX).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), MAX inactivation is an early event, occurring in 21% of cases, and is linked to cell cycle dysregulation and tumor progression (Schaefer2017MAX). These findings highlight the significant role of MAX in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
MAX (MYC associated factor X) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. MAX forms heterodimers with several proteins, including MYC, MAD, MNT, and MGA, which are part of the MYC-MAX-MAD network. These heterodimers bind to E-box sequences in DNA, influencing transcriptional activities that affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Grandori2000The).

The interaction between MAX and MYC is essential for transcriptional activation. MYC-MAX heterodimers preferentially bind to E-box sites with GC-rich flanking sequences, and this binding is necessary for MYC's biological activities, including proliferation and transformation (Grandori2000The). In contrast, MAD-MAX heterodimers act as transcriptional repressors at E-box sites by recruiting the mSin3 corepressor complex, highlighting the antagonistic roles of MYC and MAD in gene regulation (Grandori2000The).

MAX also interacts with MNT and MGA, which have context-dependent transcriptional activities. MNT recruits the mSin3 corepressor complex, while MGA's transcriptional activation depends on its binding with MAX (Grandori2000The). These interactions underscore the versatility and regulatory complexity of the MAX network in cellular processes.
