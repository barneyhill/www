# PPP1R2C

## Overview
The PPP1R2C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 2 family member C, which is a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. PP1 is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell division, glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility, and protein synthesis. The PPP1R2C protein acts as an inhibitor of PP1, thereby influencing its activity and, consequently, the pathways it regulates. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. Alterations in the expression or function of PPP1R2C have been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its significance in clinical research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
