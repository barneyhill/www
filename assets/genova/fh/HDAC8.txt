# HDAC8

## Overview
HDAC8 is a gene that encodes the enzyme histone deacetylase 8, a member of the class I histone deacetylases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone deacetylase 8 is characterized by its compact α/β-domain structure and a catalytic domain that requires a zinc ion for its deacetylase activity (Dowling2010Structures). Unlike other class I HDACs, HDAC8 can function independently of additional protein cofactors, although it interacts with various proteins to modulate its activity and specificity (Wolfson2012HDAC8). The enzyme plays a significant role in cellular processes such as chromosome segregation, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, and is implicated in several diseases, including Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and certain cancers (Deardorff2012HDAC8; Rahmani2021The).

## Structure
HDAC8 is a member of the class I histone deacetylases, characterized by a compact α/β-domain structure. The primary structure of HDAC8 consists of 377 amino acids, sharing significant similarity with other class I HDAC enzymes, particularly HDAC3 (BUGGY2000Cloning). Its secondary structure includes a central eight-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by 11 α-helices, similar to bacterial HDAC-like proteins (Vannini2007Substrate). 

The tertiary structure of HDAC8 features a catalytic domain with a zinc ion at the active site, crucial for its deacetylase activity. This active site is characterized by a conserved metal-binding site involving two aspartate residues and a histidine residue, forming a square pyramidal coordination geometry with the metal ion (Dowling2010Structures). HDAC8 can also bind other divalent metal ions such as Co2+ and Fe2+, which can enhance its catalytic efficiency (Dowling2010Structures).

HDAC8 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Vannini2007Substrate). The enzyme contains a deacetylase domain and is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and function (Marek2018Characterization). The L1 and L2 loops in HDAC8 are flexible, allowing adaptation to different inhibitors, which is a unique feature compared to other HDAC isozymes (Marek2018Characterization).

## Function
HDAC8 is a class I histone deacetylase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein acetylation, impacting gene expression and cellular processes. It functions as a deacetylase for both histone and non-histone proteins, including the deacetylation of SMC3, a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Deardorff2012HDAC8). HDAC8 is involved in the deacetylation of histone variants such as H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, as well as non-histone proteins like the p53 transcription factor, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways (Wolfson2012HDAC8).

HDAC8 operates independently without the need for additional protein cofactors, although it does interact with other proteins, affecting its biological function and selectivity (Wolfson2012HDAC8). It is active throughout the cell cycle, primarily in the soluble fraction, and is crucial for maintaining the balance of acetylation and deacetylation in cohesin dynamics (Deardorff2012HDAC8). HDAC8's activity is modulated by divalent metal ions, such as Zn2+ and Fe2+, which are essential for its catalytic function (Wolfson2012HDAC8; Dowling2008Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the HDAC8 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a genetic disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities, mutations in HDAC8 affect the cohesin acetylation cycle. These mutations lead to increased acetylation of SMC3, disrupting cohesin dynamics and resulting in altered transcription patterns. This contributes to the clinical features of CdLS, as HDAC8 is crucial for maintaining cohesin binding sites and proper chromosomal segregation (Deardorff2012HDAC8).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HDAC8 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene. Its high expression is associated with tumor progression, invasion, and migration. HDAC8 regulates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway and stabilizes the EMT regulator Snail, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This makes HDAC8 a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in TNBC (Rahmani2021The).

In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), HDAC8 is deregulated, with increased expression observed in patient-derived myotubes. Inhibition of HDAC8 has shown promise in ameliorating DMD phenotypes by enhancing muscle differentiation and reducing inflammation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Spreafico2021Targeting).

## Interactions
HDAC8 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It can catalyze deacetylation independently of a protein complex, unlike other class I HDACs, which require complex formation for substrate specificity (Wolfson2012HDAC8). HDAC8 interacts with proteins such as PP1 phosphatase and CREB, potentially acting as a scaffold to enhance their interaction or catalyzing deacetylation of CREB (Wolfson2012HDAC8; Chakrabarti2015HDAC8:). It also co-localizes with α-actin, and its knockdown affects cell contractility and morphology, suggesting a role in modulating the cell cytoskeleton (Wolfson2012HDAC8).

HDAC8 is involved in deacetylating non-histone proteins, including alpha tubulin, indicating functional redundancy with HDAC6 in tubulin deacetylation (Vanaja2018Overexpressed). The interaction between HDAC8 and alpha tubulin involves specific residues, such as Lys40 of alpha tubulin and Pro205 of HDAC8 (Vanaja2018Overexpressed). HDAC8 also interacts with proteins like Hsp20, myosin heavy chain, and cofilin, which are important for actin dynamics (Wolfson2012HDAC8).

HDAC8's interactions extend to proteins involved in cancer, such as the inv(16) fusion protein and estrogen receptor alpha (ERRα), where it may act as a scaffold or directly deacetylate these proteins (Wolfson2012HDAC8; Chakrabarti2015HDAC8:). These interactions highlight HDAC8's involvement in diverse cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, carcinogenesis, and muscle contraction.
