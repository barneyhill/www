# MMP27

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 27 (MMP27) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase family, which is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components. This protein family plays a critical role in tissue remodeling, repair, and various physiological processes. Unlike many other matrix metalloproteinases, the protein encoded by MMP27 is not secreted or membrane-bound; instead, it is localized within the endoplasmic reticulum due to a unique C-terminal domain, suggesting a specialized function distinct from other MMPs (Eichberger2022Loss). MMP27 is implicated in immune responses and tissue homeostasis, although its precise biological roles remain to be fully understood. Its expression and activity have been associated with various cancers, where it may influence tumor progression and serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis (MURUGAN2013Mutational; Cheng2022Landscape).

## Function
MMP27, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, which is crucial for normal tissue remodeling and repair processes (MURUGAN2013Mutational). Unlike other MMPs, MMP-27 is not secreted or located on the cell membrane but remains in the endoplasmic reticulum due to a unique C-terminal domain (Eichberger2022Loss). This localization suggests a distinct role in cellular processes compared to other MMPs.

In healthy human cells, MMP27 is thought to participate in immune responses and maintain tissue homeostasis, although its specific functions are not well understood (MURUGAN2013Mutational). The enzyme's activity in degrading extracellular matrix components indicates its involvement in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and possibly embryonic development. MMP27's expression in various tissues supports its role in these fundamental biological processes.

While the precise molecular activities of MMP27 in healthy cells remain unclear, its involvement in cancer suggests it may play a role in normal tissue remodeling processes (Eichberger2022Loss). The protein's function in healthy cells is inferred from its activities in pathological conditions, where it influences tumor cell behaviors such as proliferation and invasion.

## Clinical Significance
MMP27 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and prognosis. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), decreased expression of MMP27 is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and mandibular bone invasion, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. Lower MMP27 expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poorer differentiation, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting bone invasion in OSCC (Eichberger2022Loss). 

In breast cancer, MMP27 is differentially expressed and has been associated with clinical stages. High expression of MMP27 is linked to prolonged survival, contrasting with other MMPs that are associated with poor prognosis. This suggests that MMP27 may serve as a prognostic marker in breast cancer (Cheng2022Landscape).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), MMP27 mRNA levels are significantly decreased compared to normal tissues. Although its prognostic significance in HNSC is not highlighted, MMP27 shows a positive correlation with certain immune cells, indicating a potential role in the immune microenvironment of these cancers (Liu2023Identification). 

Overall, MMP27's expression patterns and interactions suggest it may play a role in cancer suppression or progression, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Gobin2019A).
