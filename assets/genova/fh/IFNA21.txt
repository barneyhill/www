# IFNA21

## Overview
The IFNA21 gene encodes interferon alpha 21, a member of the type I interferon family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms. The protein interferon alpha 21 is characterized by its involvement in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication, thereby contributing to the body's defense against viral infections. Structurally, interferon alpha 21 is a cytokine with a high proportion of α-helical regions, forming a compact globular structure stabilized by disulfide bridges. The gene is located within the alpha interferon gene cluster on chromosome 9 and is intronless, which prevents the formation of splice variants. IFNA21 is implicated in various immune signaling pathways, including cytokine and toll-like receptor signaling, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as atopic phenotypes, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Kalpana20199p21.3; Chan2006Variation; Meager1998Interferons).

## Structure
The IFNA21 protein, part of the interferon alpha family, shares structural characteristics common to type I interferons. These proteins are typically composed of 165-166 amino acids and are predicted to have a high proportion of α-helical regions, forming a compact globular structure (stifter2015expression; Meager1998Interferons). The primary structure of IFN-α subtypes, including IFNA21, is highly conserved, with complete identity at 85 of the 166 amino acid positions (Meager1998Interferons). 

The secondary structure of IFNA21 likely includes several α-helices, as is characteristic of the interferon alpha family (Meager1998Interferons). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bridges formed by conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's biological activity (stifter2015expression; Meager1998Interferons). 

While specific details on the quaternary structure of IFNA21 are not provided, type I interferons generally function as monomers. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are not common in IFN-α subtypes, except for specific variants like IFN-α14 (Meager1998Interferons). The IFNA21 gene is intronless, which prevents splice variant isoforms (stifter2015expression).

## Function
IFNA21 encodes interferon alpha 21, a type I interferon involved in the immune response. This protein plays a crucial role in antiviral defense by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which inhibit viral replication. IFNA21 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, contributing to immune signaling and modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Kalpana20199p21.3).

In healthy human cells, IFNA21 is part of the alpha interferon gene cluster located on the short arm of chromosome 9. It is involved in pathways related to cytokine signaling in immune response and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. The protein encoded by IFNA21 is a type I interferon, which may play a specific role in the antiviral response, particularly against the rubella virus (Kalpana20199p21.3). Type I interferons, including IFNA21, are known to have pro-inflammatory cytokine functions that can promote atherosclerosis. They are part of a larger family of cytokines that mediate and regulate immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis (Kalpana20199p21.3).

The gene cluster that includes IFNA21 may be controlled by epigenetic regulation, providing insights into type I IFN gene regulation (Feng2013Bioinformatics). The evolutionary analysis suggests that IFNA21 may fulfill essential, nonredundant functions due to its low levels of amino acid-altering variation, indicating some degree of evolutionary constraint (Manry2011Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The IFNA21 gene, part of the type I interferon family, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in immune response regulation. Variations in IFNA21 have been associated with atopic phenotypes, such as positive skin prick tests to tree/pollen allergens, suggesting a link to allergic responses (Chan2006Variation). Although not strongly associated with asthma, IFNA21, in combination with other genes, has shown associations with broader asthma-related conditions, including bronchial hyperresponsiveness and responses to allergens like house dust mite and cockroach (Chan2006Variation).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, IFNA21 is part of the type I interferon gene signature observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where its expression is upregulated in response to stimuli, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Feng2013Bioinformatics). Additionally, genetic variants near IFNA21 have been linked to melanoma survival, with certain polymorphisms affecting disease-free survival and metastasis development, highlighting its potential impact on cancer prognosis (Lenci2012Influence).

Overall, alterations in IFNA21 expression or genetic variations can influence susceptibility to immune-related conditions, including allergies, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, by affecting the body's immune response mechanisms.
