# S100A16

## Overview
S100A16 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A16, a member of the S100 protein family known for its role in calcium ion binding. This protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which facilitate its interaction with calcium and zinc ions, albeit with a lower affinity for zinc. S100A16 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, stress responses, and various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Notably, S100A16 has been identified as a promoter of adipogenesis, influencing lipid metabolism and energy storage. The protein's interactions with other cellular proteins, such as S100A14 and myosin-9, underscore its involvement in complex cellular pathways, including those related to cancer progression and metabolic disorders (Donato2012Functions; Sun2020Interaction; Basnet2023An).

## Structure
S100A16 is a member of the S100 protein family, characterized by its calcium-binding properties. The primary structure of S100A16 consists of 103 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 11,801.4 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.28 (Basnet2023An). The protein contains two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structural domains. These motifs serve as binding sites for calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+), although S100A16 binds Zn2+ with relatively low affinity at a site distinct from the Ca2+ binding site (Basnet2023An).

In terms of secondary structure, S100A16 undergoes minor conformational changes upon calcium binding. The protein predominantly forms a dimer through interactions between helices I, I', IV, and IV', creating an X-type helix bundle in both calcium-bound and unbound forms (Basnet2023An). The largest angle changes due to calcium binding occur between helices II and III, shifting from 157 ± 5° to 144 ± 4°, which is relatively small compared to other S100 proteins (Basnet2023An).

The quaternary structure of S100A16 involves dimerization, which is a common feature among S100 proteins. This dimerization is crucial for its functional role in cellular processes (Basnet2023An).

## Function
S100A16 is a member of the S100 protein family, which is characterized by its calcium-binding motifs. In healthy human cells, S100A16 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses. It is involved in various molecular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. S100A16 has been identified as a novel adipogenesis-promoting factor, influencing the development of fat cells and lipid metabolism (Donato2012Functions).

The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus suggests its involvement in regulating intracellular processes that are crucial for maintaining cellular balance and responding to stress. S100A16's role in adipogenesis indicates its importance in energy storage and metabolism, which are vital for organismal energy balance and metabolic health. Although the specific molecular mechanisms of S100A16 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in these processes highlights its potential impact on cellular and organismal physiology. The protein's function in promoting adipogenesis and its negative impact on insulin sensitivity suggest that it may also play a role in metabolic disorders when dysregulated (Donato2012Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S100A16 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In lung adenocarcinomas, S100A16 expression, particularly membranous staining, is linked to advanced tumor stages, lower differentiation, and increased lymphatic and vascular invasion, correlating with poorer survival outcomes (Saito2015S100A16). In cervical cancer, high S100A16 expression is associated with rapid disease progression and poor prognosis, and it is linked to chromosomal instability and oncogenesis (Zhang2023Expression). In breast cancer, S100A16 is expressed mainly on the cell membrane and is associated with aggressive cancer characteristics such as ER-negative and HER2-positive status, larger tumor size, and lymph node metastasis, indicating a poor prognosis (Tanaka2015Coexpression).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, high S100A16 expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival time, although it is not an independent prognostic factor (Tu2021Expressional). In bladder cancer, S100A16 expression is linked to biological aggressiveness and poor prognosis, correlating with factors like pT stage and recurrence (Katsumata2023Expression). These findings suggest that S100A16 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
S100A16, a member of the S100 protein family, is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One of the most notable interactions is with S100A14, forming a heterodimer. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting a regulatory relationship where S100A14 influences the protein levels of S100A16, but not vice versa (Sapkota2013S100A14; Basnet2023An).

S100A16 also interacts with myosin-9 (Myh9) in the context of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. This interaction promotes cytoskeleton reorganization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated in HK-2 cells (Sun2020Interaction). Additionally, S100A16 is involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress through its interaction with GRP78, activating the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway, which is significant in renal fibrosis (Jin2021The).

In cancer, S100A16 interacts with various proteins and pathways, including EMT-related proteins like E-cadherin and Vimentin, and pathways such as PI3K-AKT and p53, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Basnet2023An). These interactions highlight S100A16's involvement in both promoting and suppressing tumor progression, depending on the context.
