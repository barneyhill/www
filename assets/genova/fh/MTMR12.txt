# MTMR12

## Overview
MTMR12 is a gene that encodes the protein myotubularin-related protein 12, which is a member of the myotubularin family of proteins. Unlike other members of this family, MTMR12 is a catalytically inactive phosphatase, meaning it lacks enzymatic activity. Despite this, it plays a crucial role in cellular processes by interacting with active myotubularins, such as MTM1, to form heterodimers. These interactions are essential for the proper localization and function of active myotubularins, influencing cellular compartmentalization and phosphoinositide metabolism (Laporte2003Myotubularins; Raess2017WANTED). MTMR12 is involved in regulating cell signaling pathways, including the Akt pathway, and is associated with endosomal membranes, contributing to endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Hnia2012Myotubularin; Raess2017WANTED). Its interactions are significant for maintaining muscle function and structure, with implications in neuromuscular disorders such as centronuclear myopathy (Gupta2013Loss).

## Function
MTMR12, a member of the myotubularin family, is a catalytically inactive phosphatase that plays a significant role in cellular processes through its interactions with other myotubularins. Despite its lack of enzymatic activity, MTMR12 is involved in modulating the function and localization of active myotubularins, such as MTM1, by forming heterodimers. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of these proteins to specific subcellular locations, impacting cellular compartmentalization and phosphoinositide metabolism (Laporte2003Myotubularins; Raess2017WANTED).

MTMR12 is implicated in the regulation of cell signaling pathways, particularly the Akt signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth and survival. Its depletion in HeLa cells has been shown to activate pro-apoptotic markers, indicating its role in promoting cell survival (Hnia2012Myotubularin). Additionally, MTMR12 is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, potentially influencing cell junction assembly and disassembly through its interaction with MTM1 and the regulation of Rac1, a major cytoskeletal regulator (Mruk2010The).

MTMR12 is active in the cytoplasm and associated with endosomal membranes, where it contributes to endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Raess2017WANTED).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the MTMR12 gene have been implicated in neuromuscular disorders, particularly centronuclear myopathy (CNM). MTMR12 interacts with myotubularin (MTM1), and this interaction is crucial for the stability and function of myotubularin. Disruptions in this interaction, due to mutations in MTM1, can lead to reduced stability and function of myotubularin, contributing to the pathology of X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) (Gupta2013Loss). Although direct pathogenic mutations in MTMR12 were not identified in a study of 108 cases of centronuclear myopathy with unknown genetic diagnosis, the gene is considered a potential candidate for cases with low myotubularin levels but no MTM1 mutations (Gupta2013Loss).

In zebrafish models, MTMR12 deficiency results in muscle defects similar to those seen in CNM, including sarcomere disorganization and central nucleation in skeletal muscles. These defects are linked to reduced myotubularin levels, suggesting that MTMR12 is essential for maintaining normal muscle function and structure (Gupta2013Loss). The study also indicates that MTMR12 may interact with other proteins associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, suggesting potential neurological implications (Gupta2013Loss).

## Interactions
MTMR12, a catalytically inactive lipid phosphatase, is known to interact with myotubularin (MTM1) in both zebrafish and mammalian systems. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of myotubularin, as MTMR12 deficiency leads to a significant reduction in myotubularin protein levels, contributing to muscle pathologies such as centronuclear myopathy (Gupta2013Loss). The interaction between MTMR12 and myotubularin has been demonstrated through GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, confirming their direct protein-protein interaction (Gupta2013Loss).

MTMR12 also interacts with other proteins in the myotubularin family, such as MTMR2. These interactions are important for regulating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels, which are involved in cellular processes like endocytosis and autophagy (Raess2017WANTED). The interaction network of myotubularins often involves heterodimers formed between active and inactive phosphatases, with MTMR12 forming such complexes with active myotubularins like MTM1 (Raess2017WANTED).

Mutations in the interaction domains of myotubularin can disrupt its binding with MTMR12, leading to reduced stability and function of the protein complex, which is linked to the pathology of diseases such as X-linked myotubular myopathy (Gupta2013Loss).
