into the host cell genome. The protein forms a homodimer which localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is specifically associated with chromosomes during mitosis. This protein binds to double stranded DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009].", "symbol": "BANF1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1424954"}, "unigene": "Hs.433759", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O75531", "TrEMBL": "E9PJJ8"}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Barrier to autointegration factor 1"}}
