# RASSF10

## Overview
RASSF10 is a gene that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 10, which is a member of the Ras association domain family. This protein is characterized by an N-terminal Ras-association (RA) domain and central coiled-coil domains, which are integral to its function as a tumor suppressor (Richter2019RASSF10; Han2019RASSF10). Unlike other RASSF family members, RASSF10 lacks the SARAH domain, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Volodko2014RASSF). The RA domain allows RASSF10 to interact with Ras-like GTPases, while the coiled-coil domains facilitate interactions with proteins such as ASPP1 and ASPP2, which are crucial for its tumor suppressive activities (Richter2019RASSF10). RASSF10 is expressed in various tissues and plays a significant role in regulating pathways like Wnt signaling, contributing to its function in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing tumor progression (Han2019RASSF10).

## Structure
The RASSF10 protein is characterized by an N-terminal Ras-association (RA) domain and central coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor (Richter2019RASSF10; Han2019RASSF10). Unlike other members of the Ras association domain family, RASSF10 lacks the SARAH domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions in other RASSF proteins (Volodko2014RASSF). The RA domain facilitates interactions with Ras-like GTPases, while the coiled-coil domains are involved in interactions with proteins such as ASPP1 and ASPP2, which are important for its tumor suppressive functions (Richter2019RASSF10).

The protein is encoded by a single exon gene, resulting in a 507 amino acid protein, as confirmed by sequence analysis and prediction software (Hesson2009The). The RASSF10 protein is expressed in various tissues, including bone marrow, thyroid, brain, prostate, and kidney (Volodko2014RASSF). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 57 kDa, although it appears as 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE, possibly due to post-translational modifications or specific amino acid composition (Richter2019RASSF10). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in regulating pathways such as Wnt signaling, which is crucial for its tumor suppressive activity (Han2019RASSF10).

## Function
RASSF10 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular functions in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating cell cycle progression, cell adhesion, and epithelial integrity. RASSF10 contributes to G1 cell cycle arrest and restricts cell growth by being upregulated in response to TGFβ stimulation, although it is not a direct SMAD target (Richter2019RASSF10). The gene is also associated with the regulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression, which is essential for maintaining epithelial cell structure and function, thereby preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Richter2019RASSF10).

RASSF10 interacts with ASPP2, stabilizing it and contributing to the regulation of epithelial plasticity and cell polarity. This interaction is significant for maintaining cell polarity and negatively regulating mitotic and proliferative potential (Richter2019RASSF10). The gene's expression is linked to contact inhibition, a process that prevents cells from proliferating when they become too dense, indicating its role in controlling cell growth in response to cell density (Richter2012The). RASSF10 is also involved in pathways that regulate cell growth and invasion, and its epigenetic inactivation is linked to tumor progression (Richter2019RASSF10).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF10 is a tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated in various cancers due to epigenetic modifications, particularly promoter hypermethylation. This inactivation is observed in kidney, gastric, lung, and other cancers, leading to decreased expression and contributing to tumorigenesis. In kidney cancer, RASSF10 is often hypermethylated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Its loss is associated with upregulation of oncogenic pathways such as KRAS and MYC, and it is linked to reduced survival rates in renal carcinoma patients (Richter2020RASSF10).

In gastric cancer, RASSF10 is frequently hypermethylated, especially in tumors with greater invasion depth and lymph node metastasis. This methylation serves as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for malignancy (LI2014RASSF10).

In lung cancer, RASSF10 suppresses tumor proliferation and invasion by interacting with LRP6, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Its downregulation, often due to methylation, is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer patients (Han2019RASSF10).

Overall, the epigenetic silencing of RASSF10 across various cancers highlights its clinical significance as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.

## Interactions
RASSF10 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP1 and ASPP2). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK cells identified ASPP1 and ASPP2 as reproducible binding partners of RASSF10. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of ASPP2, but not ASPP1, suggesting a specific regulatory role of RASSF10 in maintaining ASPP2 levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism (Richter2019RASSF10).

In gastric cancer, RASSF10 interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM), which stabilizes RASSF10 by downregulating the E3 ligase RNF2, thereby preventing its degradation. This interaction forms a feedback loop where RASSF10 upregulates NPM, which in turn stabilizes RASSF10, highlighting its role in cell proliferation regulation (Lakshmi2021Molecular).

RASSF10 also interacts with LRP6 in non-small cell lung cancer, inhibiting Wnt signaling by reducing phosphorylated LRP6 levels, which prevents β-catenin nuclear translocation. This interaction is mediated through RASSF10's coiled-coil domains, essential for its tumor suppressor function (Han2019RASSF10).
