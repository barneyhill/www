# ARID1B

## Overview
ARID1B is a gene located on chromosome 6q25.3 that encodes the AT-rich interaction domain 1B protein, a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically within the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) subfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, thereby facilitating DNA access. The ARID1B protein is characterized by its involvement in various molecular processes, including the regulation of pluripotency, cell fate determination, and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which are essential for organismal development and cellular differentiation (Pagliaroli2021The; Azad2022ARID1B). Mutations in the ARID1B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Coffin-Siris Syndrome and Nicolaides-Baraitser Syndrome, highlighting its significance in normal brain development and function (Moffat2021Neurobiology; Pascolini2020Striking).

## Structure
The ARID1B protein is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically part of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) complex. It is composed of 2236 amino acids and shares approximately 50% sequence identity with its paralog ARID1A, with about 80% identity in their two main functional domains: the ARID domain and the BAF250 C domain (Odnokoz2021ARID1). The ARID domain, a conserved helix-turn-helix motif of about 100 residues, binds DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, and mutations in this domain can disrupt DNA interaction (Odnokoz2021ARID1). The BAF250 C domain is crucial for interactions with other BAF complex subunits and proteins (Odnokoz2021ARID1).

The EHD2 domain of ARID1B adopts an all-helical armadillo repeat fold and is centrally located in the base module of the complex, engaging in multiple protein-protein interactions to stabilize the structure (MermetMeillon2024Protein). This domain is also involved in interactions with SMARCA4, a core subunit of the BAF complex with ATPase activity (Bosch2024The). Pathogenic variants in the EHD2 domain can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation, forming cytoplasmic aggresomes and nuclear aggregates, which are associated with Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS) (Bosch2024The).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination are known to affect ARID1 proteins, although detailed mechanisms are not fully understood (Odnokoz2021ARID1). The ARID1B gene is located on chromosome 6q25.3, and its expression can be downregulated by promoter methylation and repressive histone modifications (Odnokoz2021ARID1).

## Function
The ARID1B gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a vital role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure to facilitate DNA access. In healthy human cells, ARID1B is involved in several key molecular processes, including the regulation of pluripotency and cell fate determination. It is essential for maintaining stem cell pluripotency, as ARID1B-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells show reduced expression of pluripotency markers like OCT4 and NANOG and tend to differentiate spontaneously (Pagliaroli2021The).

ARID1B also plays a significant role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for organismal development. In zebrafish models, ARID1B haploinsufficiency has been linked to reduced body length due to dysregulation of this pathway (Pagliaroli2021The). Additionally, ARID1B is involved in erythropoiesis, particularly under hypoxic conditions, by modulating the expression of transcription factors such as GATA1 and p53, which are crucial for red blood cell production and apoptosis (Azad2022ARID1B). This regulation helps maintain a balance in erythroid cell production, preventing excessive red blood cell proliferation (Azad2022ARID1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARID1B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, most notably Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS) and Nicolaides-Baraitser Syndrome (NCBRS). These conditions are characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment, and various physical anomalies, including craniofacial dysmorphisms and extremity anomalies (Moffat2021Neurobiology; Pascolini2020Striking). ARID1B mutations are a significant cause of CSS, with a high prevalence of corpus callosum anomalies in affected individuals (Mignot2016ARID1Bmutations).

ARID1B haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient, is linked to intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This condition can lead to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits, contributing to ASD and other developmental disorders (Moffat2021Neurobiology). Approximately one-third of individuals with ARID1B mutations experience epileptic seizures, particularly tonic-clonic seizures (Moffat2021Neurobiology).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, ARID1B mutations have been implicated in growth delays and dysmorphic features, as seen in familial cases of inherited mutations (Smith2016A). The gene's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation underscores its importance in normal brain development and function (Halgren2011Corpus).

## Interactions
ARID1B is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically associating with the BAF subfamily. It interacts with various proteins within this complex, including ATPase subunits such as BRG1 (SMARCA4) and BRM (SMARCA2), to form a fully functional chromatin remodeling complex (WANG2004Two; Odnokoz2021ARID1). ARID1B is mutually exclusive with ARID1A in these complexes, meaning they do not coexist within the same complex (WANG2004Two).

ARID1B also interacts with other SWI/SNF subunits like SMARCC1, SMARCC2, SMARCD, SMARCE1, and SMARCB1, which are crucial for the assembly and function of the complex (Odnokoz2021ARID1). It binds DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, similar to the p270 protein, and this binding is essential for its role in transcriptional regulation (WANG2004Two).

In addition to its role in chromatin remodeling, ARID1B forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with elongin C, cullin 2, and Roc1, targeting histone H2B for monoubiquitination, which is associated with gene activation (Odnokoz2021ARID1). ARID1B's interactions with transcription factors and chromatin regulators suggest its involvement in both activating and repressive transcriptional processes (Raab2015GenomeWide).
