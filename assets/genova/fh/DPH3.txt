# DPH3

## Overview
DPH3 is a gene that encodes the protein diphthamide biosynthesis 3, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of histidine in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This protein is characterized by a CSL-type zinc finger domain, which is essential for its function as an electron donor in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway (Dong2014Dph3). DPH3 is involved in the initial steps of this biosynthetic process, interacting with other proteins such as DPH1 and DPH2, and is also implicated in tRNA wobble uridine modifications (Uthman2013The; Villahermosa2017A). Beyond its biochemical roles, DPH3 has clinical significance, particularly in cancer biology, where its expression influences metastasis and tumor progression (Wang2024Molecular). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
The DPH3 protein is a small protein composed of 82 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of a CSL-type zinc finger domain. This domain is crucial for coordinating a zinc ion through four conserved cysteine residues, which are part of the primary structure of the protein (Dong2014Dph3). The zinc finger domain suggests a typical fold associated with such domains, likely involving beta sheets and alpha helices, although specific details on the secondary structure are not explicitly mentioned (Dong2014Dph3). The tertiary structure of DPH3 has been studied, revealing that it binds a single Zn2+ ion through its cysteine residues, which is essential for its function as an electron donor in diphthamide biosynthesis (Dong2014Dph3). While the quaternary structure is not detailed, DPH3 is known to interact with other proteins such as Dph1 and Dph2, indicating it may form part of a larger protein complex (Dong2014Dph3). The protein is also capable of binding iron, which is significant for its redox activity, as evidenced by its purple color when purified from E. coli (Dong2014Dph3).

## Function
DPH3, also known as Kti11, is a gene involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of histidine in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This modification is crucial for maintaining translational fidelity and proper protein synthesis. DPH3 plays a role in the initial steps of diphthamide biosynthesis by partnering with the Elongator subunit Elp3, an iron-sulfur cluster and radical SAM enzyme involved in protein and tRNA modifications (Uthman2013The). DPH3 functions as an electron carrier, providing electrons to DPH1-DPH2, which are essential for the catalysis of 3-amino-carboxypropyl on a specific histidine of eEF2, eventually leading to diphthamide formation (Villahermosa2017A).

In addition to its role in diphthamide biosynthesis, DPH3 is involved in the first step of tRNA wobble uridine modifications carried out by the Elongator complex, which is important for optimal translation of mRNAs to proteins (Villahermosa2017A). The physiological significance of DPH3 extends to its involvement in cellular resistance to certain cytotoxic drugs and its role in the response to DNA damage and replication stress (Villahermosa2017A). Deficiencies in diphthamide synthesis, including those involving DPH3, can lead to developmental delays and embryonic lethality, highlighting its importance in biological processes (Uthman2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DPH3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In murine models, DPH3 has been shown to play a significant role in the metastasis of melanoma cells. Disruption of DPH3 through insertional mutagenesis or gene silencing significantly inhibits metastasis in B16F10 murine melanoma cells, reducing cell motility and lung metastasis. Conversely, overexpression of DPH3 enhances melanoma cell migration, indicating its pro-metastatic role (Wang2024Molecular). The gene's involvement in promoting metastasis is linked to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway, which is upregulated in DPH3-overexpressing cells (Wang2024Molecular).

In human cancers, DPH3 promoter mutations have been identified in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), with a mutation frequency of 49.1% in studied cases. These mutations are often found at dipyrimidinic sites, suggesting a potential role in UV-induced DNA damage and BCC tumorigenesis (Di2021Molecular). The clinical significance of these mutations remains unclear, but they highlight the potential involvement of DPH3 in cancer development and progression. The gene's role in cancer underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention, particularly in melanoma treatment (Wang2024Molecular).

## Interactions
DPH3, also known as Kti11, is involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a modified histidine residue on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). It interacts with DPH1 and DPH2, forming a complex that is crucial for diphthamide synthesis. This interaction is part of a multimeric complex where DPH3 partners with DPH1 and DPH2, which are iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. DPH3 is thought to chaperone DPH1-DPH2 by maintaining their iron-sulfur clusters in the redox states required for proper ACP radical generation (Uthman2013The; Abdel-Fattah2013Insights).

DPH3 also interacts with the Elongator subunit Elp3, an iron-sulfur cluster and radical SAM enzyme involved in protein and tRNA modifications (Uthman2013The). In addition, DPH3 forms a heterodimer with Kti13, which is part of its role in the tRNA wobble uridine modification pathway (Lin2016Cbr1). The protein is reduced by Cbr1, an NADH-dependent reductase, which is essential for its function in diphthamide biosynthesis and tRNA modifications (Lin2016Cbr1). These interactions highlight DPH3's role in linking cellular metabolic states to protein translation processes.
