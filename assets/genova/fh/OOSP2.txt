# OOSP2

## Overview
OOSP2, or oocyte secreted protein 2, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in the maturation of human oocytes. The protein, also referred to as oocyte secreted protein 2, plays a pivotal role in the translational regulation of gene expression during oocyte maturation. It is characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE) and polyadenylation signals (PAS) in its 3聞-UTR, which are crucial for its high translational expression mediated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4) (Hu2022Singlecell). OOSP2 is co-expressed with other proteins such as BMP15 and H1FOO, indicating its involvement in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation (Hu2022Singlecell). The protein's function as an autocrine factor suggests it may interact with various signaling pathways, enhancing the translational efficiency of genes involved in processes like small GTPase-mediated signal transduction and organelle localization, which are essential for oocyte maturation (Hu2022Singlecell).

## Function
OOSP2 (oocyte secreted protein 2) plays a critical role in the maturation of human oocytes. It is involved in the translational regulation of gene expression, which is essential for oocyte maturation. OOSP2 functions as a secreted protein that can induce in vitro maturation of human oocytes, a process that can be inhibited by antibodies against OOSP2 (Hu2022Singlecell). The protein is co-expressed with BMP15 and H1FOO, indicating its involvement in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation (Hu2022Singlecell).

OOSP2 is the only oocyte secreted protein gene with both cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) and polyadenylation signals (PAS) in its 3聞-UTR, which correlates with its high translational expression in human oocytes. This regulation is mediated by CPEB4, enhancing OOSP2 translation (Hu2022Singlecell). The protein upregulates translation in oocytes, particularly affecting pathways like 'small GTPase-mediated signal transduction' and 'organelle localization,' which are crucial for oocyte maturation (Hu2022Singlecell).

OOSP2's role in oocyte maturation involves upregulating protein levels of certain genes without increasing their transcriptional expression, suggesting a mechanism of direct translational regulation (Hu2022Singlecell).

## Interactions
OOSP2 (oocyte secreted protein 2) is involved in human oocyte maturation and interacts with various proteins and pathways to facilitate this process. It has been shown to co-express with BMP15 and H1FOO, indicating a role in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation (Hu2022Singlecell). OOSP2 upregulates translation in oocytes, significantly increasing the number of high-translation efficiency (TE) genes, suggesting it interacts with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and pathways such as small GTPase-mediated signal transduction (Hu2022Singlecell).

The translational regulation of OOSP2 involves cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4), which binds to the 3聞-UTR of OOSP2, enhancing its translation. This interaction is crucial for the high translational expression of OOSP2 in human oocytes (Hu2022Singlecell). The presence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) and polyadenylation signals (PAS) in the 3聞-UTR of OOSP2 further supports its regulation by CPEB4 (Hu2022Singlecell).

OOSP2's role as an autocrine factor suggests it may also interact with signaling pathways in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, activating these pathways and upregulating their translational expression (Hu2022Singlecell). These interactions highlight OOSP2's critical function in promoting oocyte maturation through complex regulatory mechanisms.
