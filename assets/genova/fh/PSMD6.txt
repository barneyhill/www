# PSMD6

## Overview
PSMD6 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 6, which is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. This protein is integral to the proteasome's function in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, a critical process for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular activities, including the cell cycle and stress responses (Chen2015A; Steinberger2023Method). As a non-ATPase subunit, PSMD6 contributes to the structural integrity and assembly of the proteasome, particularly in the capping of the 20S core particle (Steinberger2023Method). The gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it is associated with prognosis and survival outcomes in several cancer types, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Li2021Integrated; Zhou2021Prognostic).

## Function
PSMD6 is a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle (RP) of the 26S proteasome, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation and maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. The 26S proteasome is responsible for recognizing and degrading ubiquitinated proteins, a process essential for regulating protein turnover and ensuring cellular function (Chen2015A; Steinberger2023Method). PSMD6 contributes to the structural integrity and assembly of the 26S proteasome, particularly in the capping of the 20S core particle (CP) and its subcellular distribution (Steinberger2023Method).

Under normal conditions, PSMD6 is part of the 26S proteasome complex, which is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Steinberger2023Method). The gene is also implicated in the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, which is vital for protein quality control and the regulation of biological processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle progression (Zhou2021Prognostic). PSMD6's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
The PSMD6 gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high expression levels of PSMD6 are associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). A risk-scored model based on RNA expression data identified PSMD6 as a strong predictor of survival, with high-risk patients showing significantly reduced median OS and RFS compared to low-risk patients (Zhou2021Prognostic). PSMD6 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, which is unique among the PSMD family genes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction in PDAC (Zhou2021Prognostic).

PSMD6 is also implicated in other cancers. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), high expression levels of PSMD6 correlate with poor survival outcomes (Li2021Integrated). The gene's expression is associated with the immune microenvironment, showing significant relationships with immune subtypes and immune-related scores across various cancer types (Li2021Integrated). Additionally, PSMD6 has been identified as a target gene of chromosome 3p loss in cervical cancer, where its downregulation might relate to poor prognosis after chemoradiotherapy (Yang2020Immunerelated). These findings highlight the potential of PSMD6 as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in multiple cancer types.
