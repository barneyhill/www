# DIS3L

## Overview
DIS3L is a human gene that encodes the protein DIS3 like exosome 3'-5' exoribonuclease, which is a critical component of the exosome complex involved in RNA processing and degradation. This protein functions as a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, playing a pivotal role in maintaining RNA homeostasis by participating in various RNA decay pathways, including no-go decay, nonsense-mediated decay, and non-stop decay. These pathways are essential for mRNA quality control, ensuring proper protein synthesis and cellular function. The DIS3L protein is characterized by its RNB domain, which is crucial for its ribonuclease activity, and it may undergo post-translational modifications that influence its function. The gene can produce multiple splice variant isoforms, adding a layer of regulatory complexity to its role in RNA metabolism. Mutations or alterations in DIS3L have been linked to diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its significance in cellular and disease processes (Meena2024MYC; Brouze2022DIS3L).

## Structure
The DIS3L protein is characterized by its role as a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, integral to the exosome complex involved in RNA processing and degradation. Its molecular structure includes the RNB domain, which is essential for its ribonuclease activity. This domain is a key feature that facilitates the protein's function in RNA metabolism. DIS3L may undergo various post-translational modifications, which can influence its activity and interactions within the cell. Additionally, the gene encoding DIS3L can produce multiple splice variant isoforms. These isoforms may differ in their functional properties and interactions, potentially affecting the overall activity of the exosome complex. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of regulatory complexity, allowing the protein to adapt to different cellular conditions and requirements. The structural details of DIS3L, including its domain architecture and potential modifications, underscore its critical role in maintaining RNA homeostasis.

## Function
The DIS3L gene encodes a cytoplasmic 3'-5' exonuclease that is a catalytic subunit of the exosome complex, which is involved in RNA decay pathways crucial for RNA control mechanisms. These pathways are comparable to transcription regulation or posttranscriptional modifications, playing a significant role in mRNA quality control essential for proper protein synthesis during embryo development (Brouze2022DIS3L). DIS3L is involved in mRNA and translation quality control pathways, including no-go decay (NGD), nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and non-stop decay (NSD) pathways of RNA degradation. It is crucial for resolving ribosome stalling and collision events on abnormal mRNA particles, which, if unresolved, can lead to global translation initiation block and apoptosis (Brouze2022DIS3L).

In healthy human cells, DIS3L is responsible for the degradation of entire RNA molecules, maintaining the integrity of mRNA and protein synthesis processes. It ensures mRNA quality control by degrading aberrant transcripts that would otherwise accumulate and disrupt protein synthesis (Brouze2022DIS3L). DIS3L's activity is essential for maintaining proper protein synthesis by ensuring mRNA quality control, which is vital for early embryonic development (Brouze2022DIS3L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DIS3L gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, tumor-derived mutations in DIS3L can mitigate MYC-induced cell death, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for DIS3L. These mutations often occur in RNA-interacting domains, including the exonuclease domain, potentially compromising the RNA degradation function of the cytoplasmic exosome. Approximately 30% of breast cancers exhibit shallow genomic deletions in DIS3L, which are associated with lower DIS3L mRNA levels and MYC amplification, indicating that MYC-amplified tumors may select for reduced DIS3L function (Meena2024MYC).

In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), DIS3L has been identified as one of the genes associated with MI in a Korean population through exome sequencing. This association suggests a potential role for DIS3L in cardiovascular diseases, although further research is needed to confirm these findings in other populations and to elucidate the functional mechanisms involved (Lee2017Genomebased).

Overall, the dysregulation of DIS3L function, whether through mutations or altered expression, appears to contribute to oncogenic stress and disease pathogenesis, particularly in MYC-driven cancers (Meena2024MYC).

## Interactions
DIS3L is a human gene encoding a protein that functions as a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, primarily involved in RNA processing and degradation. It is a component of the exosome complex, a multiprotein assembly essential for RNA turnover. DIS3L interacts with other exosome components, facilitating its role in RNA degradation pathways. The protein is known to engage in interactions with RNA substrates, contributing to its function in RNA processing (HojkaOsinska2020Highthroughput).

DIS3L is involved in mRNA splicing and translation, with its interactions enriched in genes related to ribosome complex constituents and spliceosome components. This suggests that DIS3L may play a role in translation-dependent RNA surveillance pathways, where it helps maintain RNA homeostasis by degrading aberrant RNA molecules (HojkaOsinska2020Highthroughput).

While DIS3L's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the provided context, its role within the exosome complex and its involvement in RNA processing imply that it participates in both stable and transient interactions necessary for its enzymatic functions. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of RNA metabolism and the maintenance of cellular RNA integrity.
