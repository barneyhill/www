# BEST3

## Overview
The BEST3 gene encodes the protein bestrophin 3, which is a member of the bestrophin family of proteins. Bestrophin 3 is characterized as a transmembrane protein that functions primarily as a calcium-activated chloride channel. This protein plays a crucial role in ion transport across cell membranes, influencing various physiological processes such as smooth muscle contraction and endothelial function. The BEST3 gene is expressed in multiple tissues, including the heart, smooth muscle cells, endothelium, and kidneys, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and modulates inflammatory responses. Mutations and alterations in the expression of BEST3 have been associated with clinical conditions, including potential links to structural abnormalities and ion homeostasis disorders (Singh2018Targeted; Kajii2019Wholeexome; Song2014Bestrophin).

## Structure
The BEST3 protein, a member of the bestrophin family, is characterized by its role as a calcium-activated chloride channel. The primary structure of BEST3 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the BEST3 gene, with the human BEST3 protein being 668 amino acids in length (Tsunenari2003StructureFunction). The N-terminal domain of BEST3 is highly conserved and includes putative transmembrane regions, which are critical for its function as an anion channel (Tsunenari2003StructureFunction). This domain is shared across species, indicating its importance in channel activity.

The C-terminal domain of BEST3 is less conserved and contains an auto-inhibitory (AI) domain, which regulates channel activity by inhibiting it. This AI domain consists of seven critical residues (356 IPSFLGS 362) and is associated with the channel pore or gating mechanism (Qu2007Activation). Mutations in this domain can activate chloride currents, suggesting its role in channel gating (Qu2007Activation).

BEST3 also has splice variant isoforms, with the longest form being 669 amino acids. Shorter forms result from alternative splicing of the first and last exons (Hartzell2008Molecular). The physiological roles of these variants, particularly in muscle tissues, are still under investigation (Wu2016A).

## Function
Bestrophin 3 (BEST3) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a calcium-activated chloride channel, playing a significant role in ion transport across cell membranes. This protein is involved in regulating smooth muscle contraction and is widely expressed in various tissues, including the heart, smooth muscle cells, endothelium, and kidney (Singh2018Targeted). In endothelial cells, BEST3 is implicated in modulating inflammatory responses. It inhibits the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is crucial for inflammatory processes, thereby reducing the expression of inflammatory markers such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (Song2014Bestrophin). This suggests a protective role against inflammation in endothelial cells by modulating the IKKβ/IκBα signaling pathway (Song2014Bestrophin).

In the cardiovascular system, BEST3 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and may play a role in vascular smooth muscle regulation. Downregulation of BEST3 is associated with a reduction in cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, which is linked to vascular smooth muscle relaxation (Singh2018Targeted). These functions highlight the importance of BEST3 in maintaining normal physiological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target for vascular inflammatory diseases (Song2014Bestrophin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BEST3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. A study by Kajii et al. identified a rare non-synonymous single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in the BEST3 gene as a potential candidate for mandibular prognathism in a Japanese pedigree. This variant was not found in the gnomAD database and had a low frequency in the Japanese population, suggesting its rarity and potential significance in the condition (Kajii2019Wholeexome).

Research on a splice variant of the mouse Best3 gene, known as Best3V2, has shown that it can alter ion balance in lysosome-endosome hybrids and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This variant affects calcium ion balance, which is crucial for cellular functions such as muscle contraction. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to cellular dysfunction and has been linked to lysosome storage diseases, although specific diseases directly associated with BEST3 mutations were not detailed in the study (Wu2016A).

Overall, while the exact clinical implications of BEST3 mutations require further investigation, current studies suggest a role in conditions related to ion homeostasis and structural abnormalities.
