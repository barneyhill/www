# UBAC2

## Overview
UBAC2, or UBA domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, a critical process for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The UBAC2 protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-binding domain, which facilitates the transport of ubiquitinated proteins to proteasomes for degradation. This protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, including the bone marrow, spleen, heart, liver, brain, pancreas, kidney, lung, muscle, and fat, underscoring its broad functional significance in cellular processes (Chen2021PS341). UBAC2 is primarily located in cell and nuclear membranes, where it interacts with key proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways, such as Nur77, IKKβ, and NF-κB, suggesting a regulatory role in inflammation and metabolic processes (Chen2021PS341). Additionally, UBAC2 is implicated in various diseases, including Behçet's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Gu2020UBAC2; Sawalha2011A).

## Function
UBAC2 (UBA domain containing 2) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation processes. The protein contains a ubiquitin-binding domain, which facilitates its involvement in the transport of ubiquitinated proteins to proteasomes for degradation, a critical function in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Chen2021PS341). UBAC2 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including the bone marrow, spleen, heart, liver, brain, pancreas, kidney, lung, muscle, and fat, indicating its broad role in cellular functions (Chen2021PS341).

In healthy human cells, UBAC2 is primarily located in cell and nuclear membranes, where it interacts with proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways, such as Nur77, IKKβ, and NF-κB, which are associated with inflammatory responses (Chen2021PS341). The protein's interaction with these pathways suggests a regulatory role in inflammation and metabolic processes. UBAC2's activity is influenced by free fatty acids, which can modulate its expression levels, particularly in adipose tissues (Chen2021PS341). This regulation is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing chronic inflammation, highlighting UBAC2's protective role against metabolic disorders (Chen2021PS341).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBAC2 gene have been associated with several diseases, most notably Behçet's disease (BD) and certain types of cancer. In Behçet's disease, a systemic inflammatory condition, UBAC2 has been identified as a genetic susceptibility locus. Studies have shown that specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the UBAC2 gene, such as rs7999348 and rs3825427, are associated with increased risk of BD. These SNPs affect the expression levels of UBAC2 transcript variants, potentially contributing to the disease's pathogenesis by altering gene expression levels (Sawalha2011A; Hou2012Replication).

In addition to Behçet's disease, UBAC2 has been implicated in the risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A genome-wide association study identified a variant near UBAC2, rs7335046, as conferring susceptibility to these skin cancers, suggesting that UBAC2 may play a role in their pathogenesis (Nan2011Genomewide).

Furthermore, UBAC2 expression is upregulated in bladder cancer tissues, where it promotes cancer cell proliferation. This upregulation is linked to lower survival rates in bladder cancer patients, indicating its potential as a target for cancer diagnosis and therapy (Gu2020UBAC2).

## Interactions
UBAC2, a protein encoded by the human gene UBA domain containing 2, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In bladder cancer cells, UBAC2 interacts with circular RNA BCRC-3, which acts as a 'miRNA sponge' for miR-182-5p. This interaction influences the expression of the protein p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, thereby affecting cell cycle progression and proliferation (Gu2020UBAC2). UBAC2's binding to BCRC-3 is demonstrated through RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays, indicating a direct interaction (Gu2020UBAC2).

In plants, UBAC2 proteins interact with ATI3 proteins, which are specific to dicots and play a role in selective autophagy. These interactions are crucial for plant stress responses, such as heat tolerance and resistance to pathogens. UBAC2 proteins, including UBAC2A and UBAC2B, are involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and interact with ATI3 proteins through a C-terminal WxxL LIR motif, facilitating the targeting of misfolded ER proteins for degradation (Zhou2018Dicotspecific). These interactions highlight UBAC2's role in both human and plant cellular processes, emphasizing its involvement in protein degradation pathways and stress responses.
