# TCP11

## Overview
TCP11 is a gene that encodes the t-complex protein 11, which is primarily involved in the regulation of sperm morphology and function. The protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in forming complexes with other proteins that are essential for sperm motility and capacitation. TCP11 interacts with various proteins, such as outer dense fiber 1 (ODF1) in humans and sperm PKA interacting factor (SPIF) and PRKACA in mice, highlighting its importance in reproductive biology (Stanger2016A; Liu2011Human). Beyond its reproductive functions, TCP11 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in cervical cancer, where its expression levels correlate with patient survival rates, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Wang2023Increased). The gene's diverse roles in both fertility and oncology underscore its significance in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TCP11 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of male infertility and cancer. In human sperm, TCP11 is crucial for proper sperm morphology and motility. Studies have shown that lower expression levels of TCP11 proteins, specifically TCP11a and TCP11c, are associated with a higher incidence of coiled sperm, a condition linked to infertility (Liu2011Human). This suggests that TCP11 plays a significant role in maintaining normal sperm structure and function, and its dysregulation can lead to fertility issues.

In the realm of oncology, TCP11 has been implicated in cervical cancer. Research indicates that TCP11 is highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with a higher overall survival rate in patients, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. TCP11 overexpression in cervical cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2023Increased). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of TCP11, spanning both reproductive health and cancer biology.

## Interactions
TCP11 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in sperm morphology and function. In human sperm, TCP11 interacts with outer dense fiber 1 (ODF1), a component of the sperm tail, which suggests its involvement in sperm tail morphology and motility. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a stable association between TCP11 and ODF1 (Liu2011Human).

In mouse spermatozoa, TCP11 forms a complex with SPIF (sperm PKA interacting factor) and PRKACA (a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A). This complex is crucial for sperm capacitation, a process necessary for fertilization. The interaction and phosphorylation of these proteins are integral to the molecular mechanisms of sperm capacitation, with TCP11, SPIF, and PRKACA forming a stable complex in both noncapacitated and capacitated spermatozoa (Stanger2016A).

These interactions highlight TCP11's role in sperm function, particularly in processes related to sperm motility and capacitation, which are essential for successful fertilization. The protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins underscores its importance in the regulation of sperm morphology and function.
