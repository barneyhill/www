# MMP25

## Overview
MMP25, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 25 or MT6-MMP, is a gene that encodes a membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane enzyme due to its anchorage to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, distinguishing it from other matrix metalloproteinases (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17)). The protein plays a crucial role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), participating in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cancer progression (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17; PEI1999LeukolysinMMP25MT6MMP:)). MMP25 is involved in the hydrolysis of ECM components and non-ECM proteins, which suggests its involvement in modulating protease activity and inflammatory responses (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17)). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and classification (Liu2023Identification; Simonova2020Abnormal).

## Structure
MMP25, also known as leukolysin or MT6-MMP, is a matrix metalloproteinase with a distinct molecular structure. The protein comprises several key domains: a propeptide domain with a cysteine-switch motif (PRCXXPD), a catalytic domain containing a zinc-binding motif (HEXGHXXXXXH), and a hemopexin-like domain at the C-terminal end (PEI1999LeukolysinMMP25MT6MMP:). The catalytic domain is responsible for the enzyme's proteolytic activity, while the hemopexin-like domain is involved in substrate specificity and interactions (Starr2012Biochemical).

MMP25 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is a unique feature among membrane-type MMPs (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 1 of 7; Jackson2010Update page 1 of 2). This anchoring mechanism involves the removal of a hydrophobic tail during the incorporation of the GPI anchor (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 1 of 7). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and proteolytic activation by proprotein convertases like furin, which cleave at a specific RXR/KR motif between the pro- and catalytic domains (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17; PEI1999LeukolysinMMP25MT6MMP:) page 2 of 7).

MMP25 can form dimeric or oligomeric structures, potentially stabilized by disulfide bonds, which may influence its stability and function (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 1 of 7). The protein is expressed in various forms, including soluble and membrane-bound isoforms, which may have different functional roles (Starr2012Biochemical).

## Function
MMP25, also known as MT6-MMP, is a membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase that plays a significant role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is anchored to the cell surface via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which allows it to interact with substrates in the plasma membrane and pericellular space (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 1 of 7). MMP25 is involved in hydrolyzing various ECM components, including gelatin, collagen IV, fibronectin, and fibrin, as well as non-ECM proteins like α1-antitrypsin inhibitor, which suggests a role in facilitating serine protease activity and potentially aiding the inflammatory response (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 4 of 7).

MMP25 is synthesized as a transmembrane protein precursor and is cleaved to be linked to a GPI-anchor, facilitating its integration into lipid rafts. These microdomains are involved in signal transduction and endocytosis, and MMP25's presence in these rafts suggests it may have unique interactions with specific components of the raft microenvironment (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 2 of 7). MMP25 undergoes endocytosis and recycling, which regulates its activity at the cell surface, similar to MT1-MMP, indicating a role in cell surface enzymatic activity regulation (Sohail2008MT4(MMP17) page 2 of 7).

## Clinical Significance
MMP25, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 25, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), MMP25 shows higher mRNA transcription levels in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Its expression is significantly correlated with the pathological stage of HNSC, decreasing as the disease progresses. This suggests that MMP25 could serve as a prognostic biomarker, as its expression is associated with overall survival in HNSC patients (Liu2023Identification).

In breast cancer, MMP25 is subject to abnormal hypermethylation in its promoter region, particularly in HER2-positive tumors. This hypermethylation is associated with a specific breast cancer subtype characterized by CpG island hypermethylation. Although the direct clinical significance of MMP25 mutations or expression alterations in breast cancer remains unclear, its methylation status may have implications for tumor classification and HER2 expression (Simonova2020Abnormal).

In breast cancer, MMP25 is among the most commonly mutated MMP genes, with a mutation rate of 7%. These mutations are part of a broader pattern of genetic alterations in MMPs that are linked to cancer progression and metastasis (Cheng2022Landscape).
