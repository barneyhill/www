# OR51E1

## Overview
OR51E1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily E member 1, which is a member of the class I olfactory receptors. These receptors are part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, known for their role in olfactory signaling. The OR51E1 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs, and is involved in detecting specific ligands, leading to various physiological responses. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR51E1 is expressed in several non-olfactory tissues, including the kidney and intestinal enteroendocrine cells, where it plays roles in renal physiology and metabolic regulation. Additionally, OR51E1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in prostate cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker and influence tumor progression (Maßberg2016The; Han2018Olfactory; Kalbe2016Olfactory).

## Structure
The OR51E1 protein is a member of the class I olfactory receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in olfactory signaling. The primary structure of OR51E1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific conserved motifs identified in its transmembrane regions. Notably, the YGL motif in transmembrane region 5 (TM5) and the HRFG motif in TM6 are crucial for forming a vestibular site at the solvent/membrane interface, located 2.5 helical turns above the orthosteric-binding pocket (Bushdid2019Mammalian).

The secondary structure of OR51E1 is characterized by alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, which contribute to its tertiary structure by folding into a three-dimensional conformation. This folding creates a vestibular-binding pocket, similar to those found in the β2-adrenergic receptor, which interacts with ligands and affects receptor response (Bushdid2019Mammalian).

OR51E1 does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are typical for GPCRs and may influence receptor function, although specific modifications for OR51E1 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential pharmacological applications (Bushdid2019Mammalian).

## Function
OR51E1 is an olfactory receptor expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including the human kidney and intestinal enteroendocrine L cells. In kidney cells, specifically the HK-2 human proximal tubule cell line, OR51E1 is activated by short-chain fatty acids such as isovaleric acid and 4-methylvaleric acid. This activation leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels through a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway, similar to olfactory signaling in the olfactory epithelium. This calcium influx is associated with the modulation of the epithelial phenotype of proximal tubule cells and may influence renal physiology, including blood pressure regulation (Kalbe2016Olfactory).

In intestinal enteroendocrine L cells, OR51E1 plays a role in the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). When activated by nonanoic acid, OR51E1 significantly increases the secretion of these hormones, which are crucial for regulating gastrointestinal physiology, metabolism, and appetite. This process involves cAMP production and ERK activation, contributing to glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (Han2018Olfactory). The receptor's expression in these tissues suggests its involvement in sensing specific ligands and mediating physiological responses beyond olfaction.

## Clinical Significance
OR51E1, also known as olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily E member 1, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In prostate cancer, OR51E1 is overexpressed in malignant tissues compared to benign prostatic tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for prostate cancer progression. Its activation has been associated with growth suppression of prostate cancer cells, possibly through pathways involving p38 MAPK and independent of intracellular calcium elevation (Maßberg2016The). OR51E1 is also expressed in lymph node and distant metastases, indicating a role in advanced prostate cancer (Maßberg2016The).

In small intestine neuroendocrine carcinomas (SI-NECs), OR51E1 is expressed in a significant proportion of tumor cells, with immunohistochemistry revealing its presence in primary tumors and metastases. This expression pattern suggests OR51E1 as a potential biomarker for SI-NECs (Cui2013Olfactory).

Alterations in OR51E1 expression have also been observed in neurological conditions. In Parkinson's disease, OR51E1 is downregulated in the frontal cortex, indicating a broader dysregulation of sensory perception pathways (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, OR51E1 expression is downregulated in specific subtypes, suggesting subtype-specific expression alterations (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).

## Interactions
OR51E1, also known as olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily E member 1, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, OR51E1 activation by its agonist nonanoic acid (NA) leads to the phosphorylation of various protein kinases, including CREB, p38α MAPK, c-jun, PLCγ1, STAT3, β-catenin, and p70 S6 kinase. The phosphorylation of p38α MAPK is particularly significant and is reduced by a Src kinase inhibitor, suggesting that OR51E1 may interact with Src kinases to mediate its effects on p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Maßberg2016The).

In the context of prostate cancer, OR51E1 has been shown to promote cell death and suppress cell proliferation. This is associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and upregulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to the activation of cell cycle inhibitors p27 Kip1 and p21 Waf1/Cip1. These interactions suggest that OR51E1 influences cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through specific signaling pathways (Pronin2021Ectopically).

OR51E1 is also involved in ligand recognition and receptor activation through conserved motifs and specific residues, such as R265, H264, and Y201, which are critical for ligand-driven activation (Bushdid2019Mammalian).
