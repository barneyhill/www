# GUCY1A1

## Overview
The GUCY1A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a critical enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. This enzyme is a heterodimeric protein complex, categorized as a receptor, that plays a pivotal role in converting guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger involved in various physiological processes. The protein encoded by GUCY1A1, known as guanylate cyclase 1 soluble subunit alpha 1, is essential for the enzyme's function in mediating vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation, thereby regulating blood pressure and vascular tone (Malinowski2022SELL; Curtis2023Analysis). The gene's significance extends to cardiovascular health, as it influences platelet aggregation and is implicated in conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease (Wang2022Pathogenesis; Curtis2024Genetic).

## Structure
The GUCY1A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a heterodimeric enzyme involved in the nitric oxide signaling pathway. The primary structure of the GUCY1A1 protein includes a heme-binding domain, which is crucial for its function as it allows the binding of nitric oxide, and a catalytic domain responsible for the conversion of GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP) (Curtis2023Analysis). The secondary structure of the protein features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function.

In terms of tertiary structure, the GUCY1A1 protein folds into a functional conformation that is essential for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure of sGC involves the formation of a heterodimer with the beta subunit, specifically the sGC-β1 subunit, which is necessary for its full activity and stability (Guo2018Endothelial). Common post-translational modifications of the GUCY1A1 protein include phosphorylation and nitrosylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Curtis2023Analysis). These structural features are critical for the protein's role in mediating vasodilation and other vascular functions.

## Function
The GUCY1A1 gene encodes the α1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP, a second messenger involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, sGC is activated by NO, leading to increased cGMP production, which mediates vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation, contributing to the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone (Curtis2024Genetic; Malinowski2022SELL).

The NO-sGC-cGMP pathway also plays a crucial role in inhibiting platelet aggregation, thereby reducing the risk of thrombotic events and contributing to cardiovascular health (Mauersberger2021Loss). The α1 subunit of sGC, encoded by GUCY1A1, is part of a heterodimeric enzyme complex that includes a β1 subunit, which is essential for the enzyme's activity and its role as a receptor for NO (Vishnolia2021sGC).

In the cellular context, sGC is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences intracellular signaling pathways that regulate vascular smooth muscle cell function and platelet activity, ultimately affecting blood flow and cardiovascular health (Wobst2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GUCY1A1 gene are associated with several cardiovascular conditions. Variants in GUCY1A1 have been linked to hypertension, as they can impair the function of soluble guanylate cyclase, reducing cGMP production and affecting vasodilation, which is crucial for blood pressure control (Curtis2024Genetic; Curtis2023Analysis). Recessively acting variants in GUCY1A1 have also been reported in cases of moyamoya disease, a condition associated with hypertension (Curtis2021Analysis).

In addition to hypertension, loss-of-function mutations in GUCY1A1 are associated with an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) (Wang2022Pathogenesis). These mutations can lead to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-sGC-cGMP signaling, which is important for vascular tone regulation and proatherogenic inhibition (Wang2022Pathogenesis). The gene is also implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), with certain frameshift mutations leading to a premature stop codon, significantly affecting carriers (Vishnolia2021sGC).

Furthermore, genetic variants in GUCY1A1 have been associated with large artery atherosclerotic stroke, highlighting its role in atherosclerosis, a common pathophysiological basis for both CAD and stroke (Li2019Associations).

## Interactions
GUCY1A1 encodes the alpha subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which plays a crucial role in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. This protein interacts with the beta subunit encoded by GUCY1B1 to form a functional heterodimer. The interaction between these two subunits is essential for the enzymatic activity of sGC, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP, a vital second messenger involved in various physiological processes. The formation of the heterodimer is a stable interaction necessary for the proper function of the enzyme complex. The interaction between GUCY1A1 and GUCY1B1 is a key component of the NO signaling pathway, as it facilitates the response to NO by increasing cGMP levels, which in turn regulate processes such as vasodilation, platelet aggregation, and neurotransmission. The interaction is not only structural but also functional, as the presence of both subunits is required for the catalytic activity of sGC, highlighting the importance of this protein-protein interaction in cellular signaling mechanisms.
