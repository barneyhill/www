# COX17

## Overview
COX17 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone COX17, a mitochondrial protein essential for the proper functioning of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as complex IV, in the electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as a copper chaperone, facilitating the transport of copper ions from the cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it delivers these ions to the Cox1 and Cox2 subunits of CcO. These subunits are critical for the enzyme's catalytic activity, which is necessary for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The COX17 protein is characterized by its ability to bind copper ions through its cysteine-rich motifs and its interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as Sco1 and Sco2, to ensure efficient copper delivery and maintain mitochondrial integrity (Vanišová2019Stable; Banci2008A). Deficiencies or mutations in the COX17 gene can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, highlighting its importance in cellular respiration and energy production (Vanišová2019Stable).

## Structure
The COX17 protein is a mitochondrial copper chaperone involved in the delivery of copper ions to cytochrome c oxidase. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids with critical cysteine residues, notably within a CCAC motif, essential for copper binding (Banci2008A). The secondary structure of COX17 features two α-helices, with structured regions spanning residues 26-38 and 45-57, while the rest of the protein remains unstructured (Banci2008A). The tertiary structure is characterized by a coiled coil-helix-coiled coil-helix (CHCH) domain, stabilized by disulfide bonds between Cys 25-Cys 54 and Cys 35-Cys 44, forming an α-hairpin structure (Banci2008A). These disulfide bonds are crucial for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and dynamics (Banci2011Functional).

COX17 can exist in multiple oxidation states, affecting its copper-binding capacity. The partially oxidized form can bind one Cu(I) ion, while the fully reduced form can bind up to four Cu(I) ions, forming a tetracopper-thiolate cluster (Banci2008A). The protein's quaternary structure involves oligomerization, forming dimers and tetramers, with a polycopper cluster coordinated by cysteine residues (Heaton2000The).

## Function
The COX17 gene encodes a copper chaperone protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as complex IV, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. COX17 is primarily active in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates the delivery of copper ions from the cytosol to the mitochondria. This copper transport is essential for the proper functioning of CcO, which is crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Banci2011Functional; Vanišová2019Stable).

COX17 specifically delivers copper ions to the Cox1 and Cox2 subunits of CcO, which are necessary for its catalytic activity. These subunits contain redox-active copper cofactors and are involved in electron transport to oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor (Vanišová2019Stable). The protein also interacts with other assembly factors like Sco1 and Sco2 to facilitate copper delivery and maintain mitochondrial inner membrane integrity through its interaction with the MICOS complex (Vanišová2019Stable).

Deficiencies in COX17 can lead to impaired mitochondrial structure and function, resulting in decreased copper content and impaired CcO biogenesis, which can affect cellular respiration and energy production (Vanišová2019Stable).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or disruptions in the COX17 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial copper transport and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) assembly. In humans, deficiencies in CCO, often linked to mutations in genes involved in its assembly, can result in severe conditions such as lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy, and neurodegeneration (Hamza2002CopperChaperonesforCytochromecOxidaseandHumanDisease). Although specific diseases directly associated with COX17 mutations have not been conclusively identified, the gene is considered a candidate for cytochrome c oxidase deficiency due to its critical function in copper delivery to mitochondria (Hamza2002CopperChaperonesforCytochromecOxidaseandHumanDisease).

In mouse models, homozygous null mutations in COX17 result in embryonic lethality, indicating its essential role in development. These embryos exhibit severe developmental retardation and reduced CCO activity, underscoring the gene's importance in mitochondrial function and embryogenesis (Takahashi2002Mammalian). The absence of COX17 disrupts copper transport to mitochondria, affecting CCO activity and potentially other steps of oxidative phosphorylation, which could lead to conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction (Takahashi2002Mammalian). While no specific human diseases have been directly linked to COX17 mutations, its role in mitochondrial copper transport suggests that alterations could contribute to broader mitochondrial disorders.

## Interactions
The COX17 protein is involved in several interactions crucial for its function as a copper chaperone. It interacts with proteins such as Sco1, Sco2, and Cox11 to facilitate the delivery of copper ions to cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (Horng2004Specific; Banci2008A). In yeast, COX17 transfers copper to Sco1 and Cox11, with a significant portion of copper being transferred to Cox11 (Horng2004Specific). The interaction with Sco1 involves the formation of a specific metal-bridged protein-protein complex, indicating a direct role in copper transfer (Voronova2007Oxidative).

COX17 also interacts with components of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, particularly with the Mic60 subunit. This interaction is independent of its interaction with Sco1 and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the MICOS complex (Chojnacka2015Cox17). The interaction with Mic60 is direct and not mediated by Sco1, highlighting COX17's role in mitochondrial architecture (Chojnacka2015Cox17).

COX17's interactions are primarily transient, facilitating copper transfer rather than forming stable complexes, as evidenced by its inability to co-purify with Sco1 or Cox11 (Horng2004Specific).
