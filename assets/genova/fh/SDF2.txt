# SDF2

## Overview
Stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The SDF2 protein is categorized as a molecular chaperone and plays a significant role in protein folding and quality control, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Siragusa2015Stromal). Additionally, SDF2 is integral to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a key enzyme in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, which is vital for cardiovascular function. This protein facilitates the recruitment of other proteins, such as Hsp90 and calmodulin, to the eNOS complex, enhancing eNOS phosphorylation and subsequent NO production (Siragusa2015Stromal). Through these interactions, SDF2 not only supports vascular health but also modulates the activity of other nitric oxide synthase isoforms, underscoring its importance in maintaining vascular and cellular homeostasis (Siragusa2015Stromal).

## Function
Stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human cells. SDF2 is a component of the eNOS macromolecular complex and is essential for eNOS activation, particularly through its interaction with the molecular chaperone Hsp90. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of Hsp90 and calmodulin to the eNOS complex, facilitating eNOS phosphorylation at Ser 1179, which is critical for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (Siragusa2015Stromal).

SDF2 enhances eNOS activity by promoting its phosphorylation, thereby increasing NO production. This process is vital for cardiovascular homeostasis, as NO is a key signaling molecule in vascular function (Siragusa2015Stromal). SDF2 also modulates the activity of other nitric oxide synthase isoforms, such as inducible NOS (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), by increasing NO production (Siragusa2015Stromal).

In addition to its role in NO synthesis, SDF2 is involved in protein folding and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), contributing to cellular homeostasis. It is active in the ER, where it helps maintain proper protein function and cellular health (Siragusa2015Stromal).

## Interactions
Stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. SDF2 is a client protein of the molecular chaperone Hsp90, interacting specifically with its M domain. This interaction is essential for the formation of a ternary activation complex with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Akt, which is critical for the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS at Ser 1179 (Siragusa2015Stromal). SDF2 is also necessary for the recruitment of Hsp90 and calmodulin to the eNOS complex, particularly in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulation, highlighting its role in eNOS activation (Siragusa2015Stromal).

SDF2's interaction with Hsp90 is stable and independent of the presence of eNOS, as demonstrated in cells lacking eNOS. This suggests that SDF2 may influence other Hsp90-dependent functions, such as steroid receptor maturation, although it does not affect the turnover of other Hsp90 client proteins like Akt (Siragusa2015Stromal). The interaction between SDF2 and Hsp90 remains robust even when PI3K or Akt activation is inhibited or calcium levels are reduced, indicating a strong association between these proteins (Siragusa2015Stromal).
