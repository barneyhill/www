# CADM2

## Overview
The CADM2 gene encodes cell adhesion molecule 2, a transmembrane protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell adhesion, particularly within the nervous system, where it is involved in synaptic connectivity and neurotransmission. CADM2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, influencing cognitive functions and behaviors such as impulsivity and risk-taking. Structurally, the protein features an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like loops, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as scaffolding proteins, to maintain synaptic organization. Beyond its neurological functions, CADM2 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in gliomas and prostate cancer, and is associated with psychological and metabolic traits (Liu2019CADM2; Chang2010Hypoexpression; IbrahimVerbaas2015GWAS).

## Structure
The CADM2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, involved in cell-cell adhesion. The protein has a predicted open reading frame of 1311 base pairs, resulting in a 437 amino acid sequence with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa (Chang2010Hypoexpression). CADM2 contains an extracellular domain with one Ig-like V-type loop and two Ig-like C2-type loops, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain with a protein 4.1-binding motif and a terminal PDZ-binding motif (Chang2010Hypoexpression). These structural features facilitate both heterophilic and homophilic interactions, independent of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Pietri2007Six).

CADM2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. The extracellular domain of the CADM-2a isoform has six NX(S/T) motifs for N-linked glycosylation and one proximal membrane O-glycosylation site (Chang2010Hypoexpression). CADM2 has two main isoforms, CADM-2a and CADM-2b, which differ in their signal peptides and start codons, indicating different promoters (Chang2010Hypoexpression). The CADM-2a isoform includes an additional 27 base pairs found in the 3′ end of the first exon of CADM-2b (Chang2010Hypoexpression). These isoforms are expressed in both brain and prostate tissues, with CADM-2a showing variable expression in prostate cancer cell lines (Chang2010Hypoexpression).

## Function
The CADM2 gene encodes a neuronal adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, playing a crucial role in synaptic connectivity and neurotransmission. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus (IbrahimVerbaas2015GWAS). CADM2 is involved in several biological processes, including the glutamate signaling pathway, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport, and neuron cell-cell adhesion, which are essential for maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication (IbrahimVerbaas2015GWAS).

The protein is active in the cell membrane, where it influences the formation and maintenance of synapses, impacting cognitive functions such as processing speed and executive function (Ibrahim2018Investigation; IbrahimVerbaas2015GWAS). CADM2 has been associated with various psycho-behavioral traits, including impulsivity, risk-taking behaviors, and cognitive abilities, suggesting its involvement in the neurobiological underpinnings of these behaviors (Pasman2022The; SanchezRoige2022CADM2is). The gene's expression in brain tissues is linked to synaptic connectivity, potentially influencing learning and behavior-related processes (Pasman2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CADM2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and psychological traits. In gliomas, a type of brain tumor, CADM2 is significantly downregulated, with lower expression levels correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. Overexpression of CADM2 in glioma cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Liu2019CADM2).

In prostate cancer, CADM2 expression is reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with tumorigenesis. The gene acts as a tumor suppressor, and its reactivation can inhibit cancer cell growth (Chang2010Hypoexpression). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma, CADM2 is downregulated, promoting tumor metastasis through the FAK/AKT pathway. Its expression is linked to the inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process crucial for cancer metastasis (Li2018CADM2).

CADM2 is also associated with psychological and metabolic traits. Genetic variants in CADM2 have been linked to risk-taking behavior, neuroticism, and obesity-related traits, suggesting a role in both psychological and metabolic conditions (Morris2019Genetic).

## Interactions
CADM2, also known as cell adhesion molecule 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and synaptic organization. CADM2 interacts with multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1), a scaffolding protein containing 13 PDZ domains. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail region of CADM2, similar to other Cadm family members. MUPP1's role as a scaffold suggests it may mediate interactions between CADM2 and cytoskeletal proteins, potentially influencing cell signaling and structural integrity (Jang2014CadmsSynCAMsNeclsTSLCs).

In zebrafish, cadm2a, the homolog of human CADM2, exhibits heterophilic interactions with cadm1a and cadm4, similar to interactions observed in mouse Cadm proteins. These interactions are important for adhesive processes in the nervous system, such as synapse assembly and axon guidance (Hunter2011Localization). Although homophilic interactions for cadm2a were not detected in zebrafish, such interactions have been observed in mouse homologs using more sensitive techniques (Hunter2011Localization). These findings suggest that CADM2's interactions are evolutionarily conserved and play significant roles in nervous system development and function.
