# S100A12

## Overview
S100A12 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A12, also known as calgranulin C, which is a member of the S100 protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, which are crucial for the protein's function in calcium homeostasis and signaling (Moroz2003Multiple). The S100A12 protein is primarily expressed in neutrophils and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. It functions as a chemotactic agent, facilitating the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation, and interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), influencing signal transduction pathways (Donato2012Functions; Moroz2003Multiple). Additionally, S100A12 is involved in cellular processes such as growth arrest and differentiation, and its metal-binding properties, particularly with zinc and copper, are integral to its role in antimicrobial activity and cellular signaling (Moroz2009The; Moroz2003Multiple). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have been implicated in various diseases, including inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Allgöwer2020Friend; Oesterle2015S100A12).

## Structure
The S100A12 protein, also known as calgranulin C, is a member of the S100 protein family characterized by EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. The primary structure of S100A12 consists of 92 amino acids (Wang2019Ca(II) page 0 of 6). Its secondary structure includes four α-helices connected by calcium-binding loops, which are typical of S100 proteins (Moroz2003Multiple). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a compact form, with specific residues coordinating calcium and zinc ions, which are crucial for its function (Moroz2009The; Wang2019Ca(II) page 5 of 6).

In terms of quaternary structure, S100A12 forms non-covalent homodimers, which are essential for its biological activity. These dimers can further assemble into higher-order oligomers, such as hexamers and tetramers, depending on the presence of metal ions like calcium and zinc (Wang2019Ca(II; Moroz2003Multiple) page 0 of 6). The dimerization and oligomerization are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and are important for target recognition and signaling (Wang2019Ca(II; Moroz2003Multiple) page 5 of 6).

S100A12 also binds to zinc and copper, with zinc binding enhancing its calcium affinity and influencing its structural conformation (Moroz2009The; Moroz2003Structure). These metal-binding properties are integral to its role in immune responses and inflammation (Wang2019Ca(II; Moroz2003Structure) page 5 of 6).

## Function
S100A12, a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is primarily expressed in neutrophils and is involved in modulating interactions between cytoskeletal elements and membranes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function (Donato2012Functions; Moroz2003Multiple). S100A12 has Ca2+-dependent chaperone-like functions and is associated with growth arrest in epithelial cells, indicating its role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Donato2012Functions).

In healthy human cells, S100A12 is involved in calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal dynamics, contributing to cell growth and differentiation (Donato2003Intracellular). It also plays a role in immune responses by acting as a chemotactic agent for monocytes and mast cells, facilitating their migration to sites of inflammation (Donato2012Functions; Moroz2003Multiple). S100A12 interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is implicated in signal transduction pathways that can lead to neurite outgrowth in neurons (Moroz2003Multiple). This interaction suggests a role in neuronal development and function. The protein's ability to bind metals like zinc and copper further indicates its involvement in cellular signaling and antimicrobial activity (Moroz2003Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S100A12 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), S100A12 is highly expressed in certain subtypes, such as M4 and M5, while being downregulated in others, suggesting its potential role in the heterogeneity of AML (yang2020expression). In cardiovascular diseases, S100A12 is considered a biomarker for atherosclerosis and is associated with plaque instability in coronary artery disease, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction and mortality (Oesterle2015S100A12). Its interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is significant in mediating proinflammatory effects, contributing to vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis (Oesterle2015S100A12).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), S100A12 expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and higher expression levels correlate with favorable overall survival, indicating a potential protective role (Zheng2021Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also linked to inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, where it acts as a danger-associated molecular pattern, triggering inflammatory responses (Allgöwer2020Friend). These findings highlight the clinical significance of S100A12 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
S100A12 interacts with several proteins and metal ions, playing a significant role in inflammatory responses and immune regulation. It binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a multiligand receptor involved in proinflammatory signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for mediating effects on lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes, contributing to inflammatory cascades and attracting granulocytes to inflammation sites (Moroz2003Multiple). The binding of S100A12 to RAGE is enhanced by the presence of calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+), which are essential for its oligomerization and function. These metal ions facilitate the formation of higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers and hexamers, which are important for its interaction with RAGE (Moroz2009Both).

S100A12 also interacts with paramyosin, a protein relevant to host-parasite responses, particularly in nematodes. This interaction is modulated by zinc and calcium, forming a stable complex only in the presence of both metals (Moroz2009The). The protein's ability to bind zinc and copper at the same site, involving specific histidine and aspartate residues, further influences its oligomerization and interaction capabilities (Moroz2009The).
