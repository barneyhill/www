# BHMT

## Overview
The BHMT gene encodes the enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, a zinc-dependent enzyme primarily expressed in the liver and kidney. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, a critical process in the methionine and folate cycles. Structurally, the BHMT protein is a tetramer, with each monomer featuring a (β/α)8 barrel that houses the active site, including a catalytic zinc site essential for its enzymatic function. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining methionine levels and regulating osmotic stress, as betaine serves as a cellular osmolyte. BHMT's function is significant in preventing hyperhomocysteinemia, which is linked to liver fibrosis and vascular complications. The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with various health conditions, including neural tube defects and ventricular septal defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Boyles2006Neural; Luo2022Association; Pellanda2013Betaine; Pajares2006Betaine).

## Structure
The BHMT protein is a tetramer composed of four identical monomers, each consisting of 406-407 amino acids (Ganu2015Evolutionary; Pajares2006Betaine). The primary structure of BHMT includes a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by a (β/α)8 barrel, which is a common fold in enzymes and forms the core of the monomer (GONZÁLEZ2003Activesitemutagenesis; Pajares2006Betaine). This barrel structure contains the enzyme's active site, including a catalytic zinc site crucial for its function (Ganu2015Evolutionary).

The tertiary structure of BHMT involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is stabilized by zinc binding to three conserved cysteine residues (GONZÁLEZ2003Activesitemutagenesis). The quaternary structure is described as a dimer of dimers, with a dimerization arm and a tetramerization interface contributing to its oligomeric state (Ganu2015Evolutionary; Pajares2006Betaine). The oligomerization domain, essential for forming the tetrameric structure, includes residues 319-406/7, with specific regions like the dimerization arm and C-terminal helix playing key roles (Ganu2015Evolutionary).

BHMT is expressed primarily in the liver and kidney, with its activity influenced by dietary factors (Pajares2006Betaine). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The BHMT gene encodes the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, a process integral to the methionine and folate cycles. This zinc-dependent enzyme is primarily active in the liver and kidney, where it catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from betaine to homocysteine, resulting in the formation of dimethylglycine and methionine (Li2008Human; Pajares2006Betaine). This reaction is one of the two major pathways for homocysteine remethylation, with BHMT accounting for up to half of the remethylation capacity in the liver (Li2008Human).

BHMT's activity is significant in maintaining methionine levels and regulating osmotic stress, as betaine acts as a cellular osmolyte (Pajares2006Betaine). The enzyme's function is essential for preventing hyperhomocysteinemia, which is associated with liver fibrosis and vascular complications (Pellanda2013Betaine). In healthy liver cells, BHMT supports DNA methylation, crucial for genomic stability and proper gene expression (Pellanda2013Betaine). The enzyme's activity is influenced by dietary components, with supplements like methionine, choline, and betaine increasing its activity (Pajares2006Betaine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BHMT gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In liver health, BHMT is crucial for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, a process vital for maintaining the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio, which is essential for cellular methylation reactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there is a significant reduction in BHMT expression, often due to a splicing variant that results in a truncated, non-functional protein. This reduction is associated with decreased homocysteine remethylation and SAM production, contributing to methionine dependence in cancer cells and potentially affecting DNA methylation, which may play a role in liver carcinogenesis (Pellanda2013Betaine).

BHMT gene polymorphisms have also been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs). The gene's interaction with folate pathway genes suggests that abnormal methylation due to improper folate levels or gene expression can lead to NTDs. BHMT polymorphisms may affect NTD risk, particularly in conjunction with other genetic variants like MTHFR (Boyles2006Neural).

Additionally, BHMT gene variants have been associated with the risk of ventricular septal defect (VSD) in offspring, with certain polymorphisms showing significant associations with VSD risk, especially when combined with specific maternal dietary habits (Luo2022Association).

## Interactions
Betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in methionine and homocysteine metabolism. BHMT interacts with proteins such as tubulin, hepatitis B virus, tissue-type transglutaminases, prion protein PrP, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). It forms a complex with 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (Aldh1l1) and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). 

BHMT also interacts with methionine adenosyltransferases MATα1 and MATα2, which are crucial for S-adenosylmethionine synthesis, suggesting a role in channeling methionine recovered by homocysteine remethylation for AdoMet synthesis (Garrido2018Identification). The interaction with protein kinase A catalytic subunit alpha (Prkaca) may lead to phosphorylation of BHMT, affecting its activity and subcellular localization (Garrido2018Identification). 

BHMT2, a counterpart of BHMT, forms a strong and stable interaction with BHMT, potentially forming a heterotetramer that enhances methionine production (Garrido2018Identification). This interaction was validated by two independent methods, indicating a potential advantage for homocysteine recycling (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight BHMT's involvement in regulating methionine and homocysteine metabolism and its links to other metabolic pathways.
