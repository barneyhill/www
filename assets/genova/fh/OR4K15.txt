# OR4K15

## Overview
The OR4K15 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 15, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules and is a subset of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure. These receptors play a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell. The OR4K15 gene, like other olfactory receptor genes, is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and contributes to the vast diversity of olfactory receptors that enable the detection of a wide range of odorants (Qiu2020aarFDC).
