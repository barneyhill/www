# KSR2

## Overview
KSR2 (kinase suppressor of ras 2) is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is critical for regulating cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival. The KSR2 protein facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes by interacting with key components like Raf, MEK, and ERK, thereby enhancing signal transduction efficiency (Dougherty2009KSR2). As a scaffold protein, KSR2 is integral to cellular energy balance and metabolism, interacting with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to influence glucose and fatty acid metabolism (CostanzoGarvey2009KSR2). The protein's unique interactions, including those with calcineurin and 14-3-3 proteins, underscore its role in modulating cellular responses to calcium signals and phosphorylation states (Dougherty2009KSR2). Mutations in the KSR2 gene have been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and insulin resistance, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Pearce2013KSR2).

## Structure
KSR2 is a 945 amino acid protein that shares 43% sequence identity with KSR1. It contains several conserved domains, labeled CA1 to CA5, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins such as MEK, ERK, Raf, and 14-3-3 proteins (Dougherty2009KSR2). A unique feature of KSR2 is a 63 amino acid region located between the CA2 and CA3 domains, which includes an LxVP motif crucial for binding to calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase (Dougherty2009KSR2). This motif is absent in KSR1, highlighting a specific interaction unique to KSR2 (Dougherty2009KSR2).

KSR2 functions as a scaffold protein in the ERK signaling cascade, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes by binding to proteins like B-Raf, MEK, and ERK. These interactions are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues, which influence its binding to 14-3-3 proteins and its subcellular localization (Dougherty2009KSR2). The phosphorylation state of KSR2 is regulated by calcineurin, which dephosphorylates KSR2 in response to calcium signals, affecting its localization and function (Dougherty2009KSR2). KSR2's role as a scaffold protein is further supported by its ability to form complexes with over 100 proteins, as identified in proteomic studies (Liu2009Proteomic).

## Function
KSR2 (kinase suppressor of ras 2) is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes, enhancing the efficiency of signal transduction by coordinating the interactions between Raf, MEK, and ERK proteins (Dougherty2009KSR2). KSR2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it influences metabolic processes and energy balance in cells (Pearce2013KSR2).

In healthy human cells, KSR2 interacts with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy status, suggesting its involvement in energy homeostasis. This interaction influences glucose and fatty acid metabolism, contributing to maintaining energy balance (CostanzoGarvey2009KSR2). KSR2 also plays a role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by facilitating the formation of STIM1-ORAI1 complexes, which are essential for calcium influx following the depletion of intracellular calcium stores (Giurisato2014The).

Disruption of KSR2 function can lead to obesity, insulin resistance, and impaired cellular fuel oxidation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal metabolic functions (Pearce2013KSR2). The protein's activity in the brain is particularly significant, as it regulates energy balance and glucose homeostasis, impacting feeding behavior and adaptive thermogenesis (Guo2017Kinase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KSR2 gene are associated with severe early-onset obesity, insulin resistance, and impaired cellular fuel oxidation. These mutations often disrupt the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular metabolism and growth. Specific mutations, such as V511Cfsx29 and Y569X, result in truncated proteins that lack the kinase domain, rendering KSR2 nonfunctional. Other mutations, like P662L, R684C, and R818Q, impair the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK and reduce B-Raf binding, leading to significant metabolic disturbances (Pearce2013KSR2).

Clinically, individuals with KSR2 mutations exhibit a phenotype characterized by obesity, increased food-seeking behavior in childhood, reduced basal metabolic rate, and severe insulin resistance. These mutations are linked to a lower basal metabolic rate and increased respiratory quotient, indicating altered energy metabolism. Acanthosis nigricans, a marker of severe insulin resistance, is also present in all mutation carriers (Pearce2013KSR2).

The interaction of KSR2 with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suggests a mechanism for these effects, as AMPK is involved in energy homeostasis and glucose control. Some KSR2 mutation carriers have experienced weight loss when treated with metformin, an antidiabetic drug that stimulates AMPK activation, indicating a potential therapeutic avenue (Pearce2013KSR2).

## Interactions
KSR2 (kinase suppressor of ras 2) is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway by facilitating the assembly of key signaling components. It interacts with several proteins, including MEK1, MEK2, ERK2, B-Raf, and A-RAF, forming a complex that is crucial for signal transduction (Liu2009Proteomic; Dougherty2009KSR2). KSR2 also binds constitutively to MEK, while its interaction with B-Raf and ERK is induced by growth factor treatment, with MEK and ERK being in their activated states (Dougherty2009KSR2).

KSR2 interacts with chaperone proteins such as HSP90 and CDC37, which are involved in stabilizing the complex and facilitating protein folding (Liu2009Proteomic; Dougherty2009KSR2). It also associates with 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate its localization and function through phosphorylation-dependent interactions (Dougherty2009KSR2). The phosphatase PP2A is involved in releasing KSR2 from 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm, suggesting a regulatory mechanism similar to that of KSR1 (Liu2009Proteomic).

KSR2 uniquely interacts with calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase, which dephosphorylates KSR2 in response to calcium signals, affecting its localization and activity (Dougherty2009KSR2). This interaction is mediated by an LxVP motif on KSR2, which is crucial for binding to calcineurin (Dougherty2009KSR2). KSR2 also interacts with AMPK, suggesting a role in energy balance and metabolic regulation (Liu2009Proteomic).
