# TMEM139

## Overview
TMEM139 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 139, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including the MAPK (Erk1/2) and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways, which are critical in regulating cell proliferation, survival, and cancer progression. TMEM139 has been implicated in the development and metastasis of several cancers, such as pancreatic cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with disease outcomes and therapeutic responses. The protein's interactions within these pathways suggest its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in the context of drug resistance and cancer recurrence (He2019A; Lee2023Antiproliferative).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM139 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and patient outcomes. In pancreatic cancer, particularly in oxaliplatin-resistant cases, TMEM139 is associated with cancer development and metastasis. Higher expression levels of TMEM139 correlate with decreased overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. The downregulation of TMEM139 by krukovine (KV) in oxaliplatin-resistant pancreatic cancer cells is associated with the suppression of the MAPK (Erk1/2) pathway, indicating its role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Lee2023Antiproliferative).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), TMEM139 is part of a risk score model developed to predict recurrence. Higher expression levels of TMEM139 are negatively correlated with PTC recurrence, meaning that increased expression is associated with a lower risk of recurrence. This suggests that TMEM139 may serve as a predictive marker for PTC recurrence, although its specific role in the disease requires further investigation (He2019A).

TMEM139 is also noted for its differential expression in renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its potential role in predicting patient response to immunotherapy, although specific details on its function in this context are limited (Jeanneret2023Microenvironment).

## Interactions
TMEM139 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly within the context of cancer signaling pathways. It has been shown to interact with proteins involved in the MAPK3/1 (Erk1/2) and RPS6KA3 signaling pathways. These interactions are significant in the regulation of the MAPK (Erk1/2) pathway, specifically the Erk-RPS6K-TMEM139 axis, which is implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Lee2023Antiproliferative).

In pancreatic cancer, TMEM139 expression is associated with cancer development and metastasis. The suppression of TMEM139 by krukovine (KV) treatment in oxaliplatin-resistant AsPC-1 cells is linked to the downregulation of the MAPK (Erk1/2) signaling pathway. This suggests that TMEM139 may play a role in modulating the activity of this pathway, potentially affecting cancer cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy (Lee2023Antiproliferative).

Additionally, TMEM139 is implicated in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, where KV treatment decreases the levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-AKT, and phospho-mTOR, indicating a potential regulatory role of TMEM139 in this pathway as well (Lee2023Antiproliferative).
