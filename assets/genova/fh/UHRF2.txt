# UHRF2

## Overview
UHRF2, or Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger Domains 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in epigenetic regulation and DNA repair processes. The UHRF2 protein is characterized by several domains, including a ubiquitin-like domain, tandem Tudor domain, plant homeodomain, SET and RING-associated domain, and a RING finger domain, which collectively contribute to its role as a ubiquitin E3 ligase (Chen2017Structure; Ginnard2021Molecular). This protein is integral to the maintenance of genomic stability, acting in pathways such as base excision repair and DNA interstrand crosslink repair, where it facilitates the recruitment and modification of key repair proteins (Motnenko2018Identification; Liu2021UHRF2). UHRF2's interactions with histone marks and other proteins underscore its importance in chromatin dynamics and cell cycle regulation, positioning it as a critical player in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis, including cancer and neurological disorders (Li2020UHRF2; Liu2017UHRF2).

## Structure
UHRF2 is a multi-domain protein that plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation. It contains several functional domains, including a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a tandem Tudor domain (TTD), a plant homeodomain (PHD), a SET and RING-associated (SRA) domain, and a really interesting new gene (RING) finger domain (Chen2017Structure). The TTD and PHD domains are particularly important for histone binding, with the TTD showing a higher affinity for the histone H3 tail compared to the PHD (Ginnard2021Molecular). The TTD of UHRF2 contains aromatic amino acids that form a 'cage' for engaging in cation-pi interactions with trimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) (Ginnard2021Molecular).

The PHD domain of UHRF2 includes a distinct asparagine residue that reduces binding affinity by weakening electrostatic interactions with the H3 tail (Ginnard2021Molecular). UHRF2 also features a unique 35 amino acid insertion known as the 'TTD stretch,' which is predicted to be disordered and is not required for histone binding (Ginnard2021Molecular). This region may influence protein stability and structure, as its removal slightly enhances thermal stability (Ginnard2021Molecular).

UHRF2 interacts with PCNA through a PIP box, which is crucial for its role in DNA damage response. The interaction is mediated by hydrophobic interactions and a specific hydrogen bond between UHRF2-D792 and PCNA-H44 (Chen2017Structure).

## Function
UHRF2 is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in DNA demethylation and repair processes in human cells. It is involved in the base excision repair (BER) complex, where it interacts with XRCC1, a key component of the complex. This interaction is mediated by the SRA domain of UHRF2, which is essential for its association with the BER complex. UHRF2 functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, facilitating the polyubiquitination of XRCC1, a process enhanced by the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). This polyubiquitination promotes the incorporation of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) into the BER complex, enhancing DNA repair and demethylation (Liu2021UHRF2).

UHRF2 is also involved in the DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair process, acting as a sensor protein that facilitates the recruitment and monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key protein in the ICL repair pathway. This role is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression in healthy cells (Motnenko2018Identification). UHRF2's activity is modulated by its interaction with specific histone marks and is influenced by the chromatin context, which affects its epigenetic regulatory dynamics (Liu2021UHRF2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the UHRF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). UHRF2 is upregulated in human adenoma tissues and its expression increases from normal colon tissue to adenoma to carcinoma. This upregulation is negatively correlated with patient survival, indicating that higher UHRF2 levels are associated with poorer outcomes in CRC patients (Li2020UHRF2). Mechanistically, UHRF2 promotes intestinal tumorigenesis by stabilizing TCF4 through SUMOylation, which sustains Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a critical pathway for tumor growth (Li2020UHRF2). Uhrf2 deficiency in mouse models leads to a significant reduction in tumor initiation and progression, suggesting its oncogenic role in the gut (Li2020UHRF2).

In the brain, UHRF2 is crucial for maintaining 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels at specific genomic loci. Uhrf2 knockout mice exhibit frequent spontaneous seizures, highlighting its role in neural function. The loss of UHRF2 leads to decreased 5mC levels at promoters of ion transport genes, which may contribute to seizure susceptibility (Liu2017UHRF2). These findings suggest that UHRF2 alterations could have clinical significance in neurological disorders characterized by seizures.

## Interactions
UHRF2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in epigenetic regulation and cell cycle processes. It forms direct protein-protein interactions with FANCD2, which is crucial for the recruitment and retention of FANCD2 at DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), facilitating the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 necessary for DNA repair (Motnenko2018Identification). UHRF2 also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through its PIP box, engaging in hydrophobic interactions that are conserved across different PIP box-containing proteins (Chen2017Structure).

In the context of histone binding, UHRF2's tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and plant homeodomain (PHD) cooperate to bind histone H3, particularly recognizing trimethylated lysine 9 (H3K9me3). The TTD has a higher affinity for H3K9me3 compared to the PHD, which contains a distinct asparagine that weakens its binding affinity (Ginnard2021Molecular). UHRF2 also interacts with N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), suggesting a functional linkage in DNA repair pathways (Liang2013Identification).

UHRF2's interactions extend to cell cycle regulation, where it binds with cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and other core cell cycle proteins, acting as an "intermodular hub" that integrates the cell cycle machinery with the ubiquitin-proteasome and epigenetic systems (Mori2012NIRFUHRF2).
