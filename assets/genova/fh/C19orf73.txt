# C19orf73

## Overview
C19orf73 is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 73. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting a role in cellular signaling or transport across the cell membrane. Research has indicated potential interactions with other proteins, which may implicate C19orf73 in broader biological pathways and processes. Further studies are required to fully understand the clinical significance and potential implications of C19orf73 in human health and disease.
