# WDR62

## Overview
WDR62 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 62 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in brain development. The protein is characterized by multiple WD40 repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role as a scaffold protein in mitotic spindle organization and neurogenic signaling pathways (Nicholas2010WDR62; Wasserman2010A). WDR62 is involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle orientation and progression, crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (Dell’Amico2023Microcephalyassociated; Shohayeb2017The). Mutations in the WDR62 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, highlighting its significance in normal cortical development (Xu2014MicrocephalyAssociated; Dell’Amico2023Microcephalyassociated). Additionally, WDR62's interactions with kinases like Aurora A and JNK underscore its role in maintaining spindle pole organization and neural migration (Zhi2021Pathophysiological; Shohayeb2017The).

## Structure
The WDR62 protein is characterized by its multiple WD40 repeats, which are motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to the formation of a beta-propeller structure (Nicholas2010WDR62; Wasserman2010A). The protein contains 12 to 15 WD40 domains, depending on the source, and these domains are crucial for its role in cellular processes (Nicholas2010WDR62; Wasserman2010A). The WD40 domains are depicted in light blue in schematic diagrams and are known for their role in protein-protein interactions (Wasserman2010A).

WDR62 also contains a JNK binding domain (JBD) located at the carboxyl terminus, which is required for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) interaction (Qin2019WDR62). The protein is phosphorylated by JNK, and this post-translational modification is necessary for spindle maintenance and mitotic progression (Qin2019WDR62). Additionally, WDR62 has a loop helix domain (LHD) at the carboxyl terminus, necessary for homodimerization (Qin2019WDR62).

The WDR62 gene has several splice variant isoforms, which may result in proteins with differing functions or localizations (Wasserman2010A). These isoforms include a large isoform (~200-kD) expressed in adult testes and a smaller isoform (~170-kD) in the brain and ovary (Qin2019WDR62).

## Function
The WDR62 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in brain development, particularly in the formation of the mammalian central nervous system. In healthy human cells, WDR62 is involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle organization, which is essential for proper cell division. It localizes to the spindle poles during mitosis, ensuring correct spindle orientation and mitotic progression, which is particularly important in neuroprogenitors where spindle orientation influences the balance between proliferative and neurogenic divisions (Dell’Amico2023Microcephalyassociated; Shohayeb2017The).

WDR62 interacts with several kinases, including Aurora A and JNK isoforms, to facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes that regulate neurogenic divisions. This interaction is necessary for maintaining spindle pole organization and ensuring correct spindle orientation and mitotic progression (Zhi2021Pathophysiological; Shohayeb2017The). The protein is also involved in neural migration to the cortical plate during late neurogenesis (Shohayeb2017The).

Mutations in WDR62 can lead to microcephaly and other neurological disorders, indicating its importance in normal brain development and function. The protein's role in maintaining neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation is critical for normal cortical development (Xu2014MicrocephalyAssociated; Dell’Amico2023Microcephalyassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR62 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH2). This condition is characterized by a significantly reduced head circumference and various cortical malformations, such as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephaly. Patients with MCPH2 often exhibit neurological and behavioral manifestations, including delayed psychomotor development and mental retardation (Bastaki2016Novel; Shohayeb2017The).

WDR62 mutations can lead to defects in neuronal proliferation and migration, resulting in abnormal cortical architecture. These mutations disrupt the normal function of WDR62 in centrosome-associated processes, affecting mitotic progression and spindle pole localization during cell division (Sgourdou2017Disruptions; Yu2010Mutations). In particular, disruptions in WDR62's interaction with the Chromosome Passenger Complex, including Aurora kinase B, have been linked to altered mitotic cycle progression and centrosome inheritance, contributing to microcephaly and related brain malformations (Sgourdou2017Disruptions).

In addition to its role in microcephaly, WDR62 overexpression has been implicated in gastric cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. High levels of WDR62 expression correlate with poor differentiation and increased proliferation of cancer cells (Zeng2013WD40).

## Interactions
WDR62 is a scaffold protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in cell division and signaling pathways. It associates with the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC), interacting with core components such as Aurora kinase B (AURKB), CDCA8/borealin, and BIRC5/survivin, which are crucial for mitosis. WDR62 transiently co-localizes with AURKB at the spindle and kinetochores during mitosis, and disruptions in WDR62 can affect the levels of CPC components at centromeres (Sgourdou2017Disruptions).

WDR62 also plays a significant role in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, specifically associating with MAPK8/JNK. It recruits JNK1 to the spindle pole during mitosis, which is essential for spindle regulation and neural development (Lim2014Opposing; Zhi2021Pathophysiological). The interaction with JNK is crucial for various cellular processes, including stress responses and mitosis (Lim2014Opposing).

In spermatogenesis, WDR62 interacts with the centriole-associated protein CEP170, which is essential for proper spindle assembly. The deletion of WDR62 leads to downregulation of CEP170, resulting in spindle assembly defects (Qin2019WDR62). WDR62 is also involved in recruiting Aurora A to the spindle pole, and its phosphorylation by Aurora A is important for spindle maintenance and mitotic progression (Qin2019WDR62).
