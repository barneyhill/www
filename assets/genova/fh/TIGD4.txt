# TIGD4

## Overview
TIGD4 is a gene that encodes the protein tigger transposable element derived 4, which is part of the tigger subfamily of DNA-mediated transposons. This protein is implicated in maintaining genomic stability, although its precise biological functions are not fully understood. TIGD4 is notably expressed at the myotendinous junctions in skeletal muscle cells, indicating a potential role in muscle structure and function (Kim2020Single-nucleus). The gene's expression is also upregulated in conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, suggesting a possible involvement in metabolic pathways (Liu2019Key). While its association with genomic integrity hints at a broader significance in diseases characterized by genomic instability, such as cancer, further research is necessary to delineate its specific contributions (Fiuza‐Luces2018Muscle).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TIGD4 gene has been implicated in several conditions due to its altered expression levels. In Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), TIGD4 is among the genes that are upregulated, although the specific clinical implications of this upregulation are not detailed (Liu2019Key). The gene's role in T2DM suggests a potential involvement in the metabolic pathways affected by the disease, but further research is needed to clarify its exact contribution.

In the context of muscle diseases, TIGD4 has been identified as a marker gene at the myotendinous junction (MTJ) in skeletal muscle cells. Its expression is particularly noted at the fiber ends, which are crucial for muscle function and integrity (Kim2020Single-nucleus). This suggests that alterations in TIGD4 expression could impact muscle structure and function, potentially contributing to muscle-related conditions.

Additionally, TIGD4 is part of the tigger subfamily of DNA-mediated transposons, which are related to genomic stability. While its exact function remains unclear, its involvement in genomic integrity suggests that mutations or dysregulation could potentially be linked to diseases involving genomic instability, such as cancer (Fiuza‐Luces2018Muscle). However, specific roles in cancer have not been established, and further studies are required to elucidate its clinical significance.
