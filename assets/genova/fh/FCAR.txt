# FCAR

## Overview
The FCAR gene encodes the Fc alpha receptor (CD89), a type I transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating interactions with immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. This receptor is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and certain dendritic cells, where it facilitates critical immune functions such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine release (Wu2007FcαRI). The receptor's structure includes a hydrophobic signal sequence and an extracellular domain with multiple glycosylation sites, contributing to its functional complexity (Maliszewski1990Expression). CD89 is involved in both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, depending on its molecular interactions, and is implicated in various clinical conditions, including chronic hepatitis C and IgA nephropathy (Watanabe2006Genetic; Launay1999Fcα). Through its interactions with the Fc receptor γ chain, CD89 is essential for transmembrane signal transduction, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and pathogen clearance (Morton1995Functional; Tsuge2003Monocyte).

## Structure
The FCAR gene encodes the Fc alpha receptor (CD89), a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily expressed on myeloid cells. The protein is composed of 287 amino acids, with the first 21 amino acids forming a hydrophobic signal sequence. The mature receptor sequence begins at Gln22, resulting in a peptide with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 29,900 Da (Maliszewski1990Expression). The extracellular domain of CD89 includes 206 amino acids and contains six potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which contribute to the higher observed molecular mass of around 60 kDa for the native protein (Maliszewski1990Expression). 

CD89 shares homology with other Ig Fc receptors and contains conserved residues typical of Ig-like sequences in two contiguous domains. These domains include cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, crucial for the Ig fold structure (Maliszewski1990Expression). The transmembrane region is characterized by a 19-residue hydrophobic stretch and contains a charged residue (Arg 230), which is atypical for protein-anchored transmembrane proteins, suggesting potential membrane attachment through a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol linkage or association with another membrane-bound protein (Maliszewski1990Expression). Alternative splicing of the FCAR gene results in multiple isoforms, which may affect the protein's structure and function (toyabe1997iga).

## Function
The FCAR gene encodes the Fc alpha receptor (FcαRI or CD89), a type I transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on myeloid lineage cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and some dendritic cells (Wu2007FcαRI). This receptor plays a crucial role in immune defense by binding to the Fc region of IgA antibodies, facilitating various immune responses such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine release (Wu2007FcαRI).

FcαRI is involved in several molecular processes, including degranulation, endocytosis, and the respiratory burst, which are essential for pathogen clearance and immune regulation (Wu2007FcαRI). The receptor can bind both monomeric and dimeric IgA, activating immune responses through receptor clustering (Wu2007FcαRI). It also plays a role in calcium mobilization, a critical signaling event in immune cell activation, with different alleles of the receptor showing varying efficiencies in mediating intracellular calcium release (Wu2007FcαRI).

In healthy human cells, FcαRI contributes to mucosal immunity and systemic immune responses, potentially modulating inflammation by incorporating foreign antigens into immune complexes for removal by the phagocytic system (Wu2007FcαRI). The receptor's function in immune regulation is complex, with evidence suggesting both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles depending on its molecular interactions (Wu2007FcαRI).

## Clinical Significance
The FCAR gene, encoding the Fc alpha receptor (CD89), is implicated in several clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression or function. In chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, specific promoter variants of the FCAR gene, such as -311C and -142C, are associated with increased transcriptional activity. These variants are more prevalent in CHC patients and may regulate the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection process by potentially mediating the entry of HCV into host cells, particularly peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which could serve as a reservoir for viral replication. These variants may also up-regulate FcαR expression on PBMCs, increasing the uptake of IgA-complexed HCV and contributing to the establishment of chronicity in HCV infection (Watanabe2006Genetic).

In IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s disease, the interaction between polymeric IgA and CD89 results in the release of pathogenic soluble CD89-IgA complexes, contributing to the disease. Transgenic mice expressing human CD89 develop symptoms similar to human IgAN, such as mesangial IgA deposition and hematuria, indicating CD89's significant role in IgAN pathogenesis (Launay1999Fcα). However, specific mutations in the FCAR gene have not been directly linked to IgAN (Launay1999Fcα).

## Interactions
The FCAR gene encodes the Fc alpha receptor (CD89), which is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in immune response. CD89 interacts with the Fc receptor γ chain (FcR γ chain), a crucial association for signal transduction. This interaction is facilitated by a positively charged arginine residue (Arg 209) in the transmembrane domain of CD89, which promotes its association with the FcR γ chain. This interaction is necessary for CD89-mediated transmembrane signal transduction, including intracellular calcium increase, tyrosine phosphorylation, and IL-2 release (Morton1995Functional).

CD89 can also form complexes with the FcR γ chain in transfected cells, where the γ chain acts as a signaling molecule containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This motif is phosphorylated upon CD89 activation, facilitating downstream signaling events (Tsuge2003Monocyte). The interaction between CD89 and the FcR γ chain is essential for the activation of immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, and is involved in processes like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (Morton1995Functional). These interactions highlight the role of CD89 in immune cell signaling and response.
