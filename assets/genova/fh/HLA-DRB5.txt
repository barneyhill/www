# HLA-DRB5

## Overview
HLA-DRB5 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, specifically the DR beta 5 chain. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by presenting extracellular antigens to CD4+ T-helper cells, a process essential for initiating immune responses and maintaining immune surveillance. The HLA-DRB5 protein is primarily expressed in antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it forms part of the HLA-DR heterodimers on the cell surface (Barsakis2019Complete). As a member of the MHC class II family, the HLA-DRB5 protein is involved in the presentation of a diverse array of peptides, contributing to the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to a wide range of antigens (Scholz2017Human). The gene is also implicated in various autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases, highlighting its significance in both health and disease contexts (Dendrou2018HLA; Enz2020Increased).

## Function
The HLA-DRB5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is crucial for the immune system's ability to present extracellular antigens to CD4+ T-helper cells. This process is essential for initiating immune responses and maintaining immune surveillance. The HLA-DRB5 protein is primarily active in antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it forms part of the HLA-DR heterodimers on the cell surface (Barsakis2019Complete).

HLA-DRB5, along with other HLA-DR molecules, contributes to the diversity of the peptide repertoire presented to T cells. It has been shown to present complementary peptide repertoires alongside HLA-DRB1, enhancing the diversity of antigens that can be recognized by the immune system (Scholz2017Human). The DRB5 gene is particularly noted for its role in expanding the class II ligandome, often contributing more significantly than the accompanying DRB1 molecule in certain haplotypes (Kaabinejadian2022Accurate).

The protein encoded by HLA-DRB5 is involved in presenting antigens derived from proteins located in the endocytic pathway, confirming its role as a bona fide HLA-DR ligand (Scholz2017Human). This function is critical for the immune system's ability to distinguish between self and non-self, thereby preventing autoimmune responses while effectively targeting pathogens.

## Clinical Significance
HLA-DRB5 is implicated in several diseases due to its genetic variations and expression levels. It is notably associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease. In MS, the HLA-DRB5 gene, particularly when co-expressed with HLA-DRB1*15:01, is part of the HLA-DR15 haplotype, which is the strongest genetic factor linked to the disease. This haplotype presents complementary peptide repertoires to T cells, potentially influencing disease pathogenesis by enhancing T-cell activation and brain inflammation (Scholz2017Human; Enz2020Increased). 

In Parkinson's disease, HLA-DRB5, along with HLA-DRB1*15:01, may present peptides from α-synuclein, a protein aggregated in the brains of patients, suggesting an autoimmune component in the disease (Dendrou2018HLA). 

HLA-DRB5 is also associated with an increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with studies indicating a 1.87-fold increased risk in familial cases linked to this gene region (Zhong2019The). These associations highlight the gene's role in immune-mediated diseases and its potential impact on disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
HLA-DRB5 is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune response by presenting processed antigens to CD4+ T cells. HLA-DRB5 forms a heterodimer with HLA-DRA, and this complex interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the CD4 co-receptor, facilitating immune signaling. The interaction between HLA-DRB5 and TCR is essential for the recognition of specific antigens, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) peptides, which are implicated in autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis (Quandt2012Myelin).

The peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB5 accommodates various peptides, with specific anchor positions such as P1, P4, P6, and P9 playing a significant role in determining binding affinity and specificity. These interactions are crucial for the presentation of a diverse array of peptides to T cells, thereby influencing the immune response (Kaabinejadian2022Accurate; Scholz2017Human).

HLA-DRB5 also contributes significantly to the class II DR immunopeptidome, often complementing the peptide repertoire of primary DRB1 molecules. This complementary role enhances the diversity of peptides presented to T cells, which is vital for effective immune surveillance and response (Kaabinejadian2022Accurate).
