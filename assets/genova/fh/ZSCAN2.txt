# ZSCAN2

## Overview
ZSCAN2, or zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various biological processes, including spermatogenesis and tissue repair. The protein encoded by ZSCAN2 is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding, and a SCAN domain, which is implicated in protein-protein interactions. This transcription factor is notably expressed in the testes, where it plays a critical role in maintaining spermatogonial stem cell populations and ensuring the regenerative capacity of the spermatogenic lineage, particularly under conditions of cytotoxic stress (Lord2022A). Beyond its role in reproductive biology, ZSCAN2 has been implicated in lung tissue repair, with increased expression observed in models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease following liver growth factor treatment, suggesting a broader role in tissue regeneration and immune response modulation (PérezRial2023Lung; Sánchez2024Differential).

## Function
ZSCAN2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of spermatogenic stem cell functions. It is highly expressed in the testes, particularly in undifferentiated spermatogonia, where it is involved in maintaining the spermatogonial stem cell populations. The protein is detected in both ID4-eGFP Bright and Dim spermatogonia, indicating its presence in various stages of spermatogonial development (Lord2022A). ZSCAN2 is crucial for the regenerative capacity of the spermatogenic lineage, especially following cytotoxic stress, as it influences key cellular processes such as translation, chromatin modification, and ubiquitination (Lord2022A).

In addition to its role in spermatogenesis, ZSCAN2 has been identified as a novel player in tissue repair, particularly in the context of lung tissue. In experimental models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ZSCAN2 expression is significantly increased following liver growth factor (LGF) treatment, suggesting its involvement in lung tissue repair and immune response modulation (PérezRial2023Lung; Sánchez2024Differential). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in regulating inflammation and immune response during tissue regeneration.
