# EID3

## Overview
EID3, or EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcriptional activity. The protein, also referred to as EID3, functions as a transcriptional inhibitor by interacting with the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which are co-activators essential for various cellular processes such as cell growth and development. EID3 achieves this inhibition by binding to the SRC-1 interacting domain of CBP, thereby preventing the recruitment of CBP to nuclear receptor-regulated promoters. This mechanism allows EID3 to modulate transcription without altering the expression levels of nuclear receptors. Predominantly expressed in the testis, EID3 plays a significant role in processes like steroid hormone regulation and spermatogenesis, contributing to the transcriptional control of testicular tissue homeostasis (Bavner2005EID3).

## Function
EID3 (EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating transcriptional activity by interacting with the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, both of which are co-activators involved in various cellular functions, including cell growth and development. EID3 functions as an inhibitor of CBP/p300-dependent transcription by binding to the SRC-1 interacting domain of CBP, thereby preventing the recruitment of CBP to nuclear receptor-regulated promoters. This inhibition occurs without altering the expression levels of nuclear receptors, suggesting that EID3 interferes with their activity through a different mechanism (Bavner2005EID3).

EID3 is predominantly expressed in the testis, where it plays a role in regulating transcriptional activity, potentially affecting processes like steroid hormone regulation and spermatogenesis (Bavner2005EID3). The protein is involved in the transcriptional control of testicular tissue homeostasis by inhibiting nuclear receptor transcriptional activity more potently than EID1, another member of the EID family (Bavner2005EID3). EID3's inhibition of CBP-dependent transcriptional activation is achieved by binding to the C-terminus of CBP, indicating functional conservation within the EID family (Bavner2005EID3).
