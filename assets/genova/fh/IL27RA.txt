# IL27RA

## Overview
IL27RA, or interleukin 27 receptor subunit alpha, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the interleukin-27 receptor complex, which is a type I cytokine receptor. This receptor complex is crucial for mediating the biological effects of interleukin-27 (IL-27), a cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. The IL27RA protein, also known as WSX-1, forms a heterodimeric receptor complex with glycoprotein 130 (gp130) to facilitate signal transduction. This receptor is predominantly expressed on immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as on certain non-immune cells like hepatocytes (Han2022Interleukin). Through its involvement in the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, IL27RA plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses, influencing T cell differentiation, and maintaining immune homeostasis (Yoshida2015The; Wynick2014Interleukin27). The receptor's function is significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including immune regulation, viral infections, and cancer (RuizRiol2017Identification; Aghayev2022IL27).

## Function
IL27RA, or interleukin 27 receptor subunit alpha, is a critical component of the IL-27 receptor complex, which also includes glycoprotein 130 (gp130). This receptor is involved in the signal transduction of IL-27, a cytokine that plays a significant role in immune regulation. IL27RA is expressed on various immune cells, including T and B lymphocytes, NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as non-immune cells like hepatocytes (Han2022Interleukin). 

The IL-27 receptor complex, through IL27RA, activates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, particularly STAT1 and STAT3, which are crucial for modulating immune responses (Wynick2014Interleukin27; Han2022Interleukin). This signaling influences T cell differentiation, promoting Th1 responses while inhibiting Th2 and Th17 differentiation, thus maintaining a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses (de2014IL27R–Mediated; Wynick2014Interleukin27).

IL27RA also plays a role in the regulation of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, contributing to immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Yoshida2015The). The receptor's activity is primarily on the cell surface, where it modulates immune responses and helps maintain defense against pathogens (Han2022Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL27RA gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly those affecting the hematopoietic system. IL27RA signaling plays a critical role in the aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where increased expression due to aging-related inflammation leads to impaired HSC function and a bias towards myeloid lineage differentiation. This process is mediated by the TNFα→ERK→ETS1→IL27Ra pathway, and deletion of IL27Ra in mice has been shown to rescue the functional decline and myeloid bias of HSCs, suggesting its significant role in age-related hematopoietic conditions (He2020Aginginduced).

In the context of immune regulation, IL27RA is crucial for the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in controlling inflammation. IL27RA-deficient Tregs fail to suppress inflammation effectively, leading to severe disease in models of T cell-mediated colitis, indicating that IL27RA signaling is essential for Treg-mediated suppression under inflammatory conditions (Do2016An).

Additionally, IL27RA has been associated with HIV infection, where its expression levels correlate with viral load and proviral copy numbers, suggesting that the IL-27/IL-27RA axis is a critical immune pathway for antiviral response (RuizRiol2017Identification).

## Interactions
IL27RA, also known as WSX-1, is a receptor subunit that forms a heterodimeric complex with gp130 to create the interleukin-27 receptor. This receptor complex interacts with the cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27), which is involved in various immune regulatory functions. The IL-27/IL27RA interaction is crucial for activating signaling pathways that involve the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, which are transcription factors that influence T-cell differentiation and immune responses (Aghayev2022IL27).

In the context of HIV infection, IL27RA expression is associated with viral load and proviral DNA levels, suggesting that IL-27 signaling through IL27RA may influence the immune response to the virus. The receptor's expression is increased in individuals with uncontrolled HIV infection, indicating a potential role in modulating immune responses during chronic infection (RuizRiol2017Identification).

IL27RA also plays a role in atherosclerosis by regulating antigen presentation and myeloid cell activation. It influences the interactions between antigen-presenting cells and CD4+ T cells, thereby affecting the progression of atherosclerosis (Peshkova2017IL27R). In hepatocellular carcinoma, IL27RA signaling acts as an immunological checkpoint, modulating the activity of natural killer cells and impacting tumor development (Aghayev2022IL27).
