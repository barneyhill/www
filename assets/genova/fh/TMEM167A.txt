# TMEM167A

## Overview
TMEM167A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 167A, which is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of gliomas. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a significant role in vesicular trafficking and the endo-lysosomal system. It is essential for the proper localization and degradation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), influencing the EGFR-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation (SeguraCollar2020The; Portela2018Oncogenic). TMEM167A's interactions with other proteins, such as TSSC1, facilitate retrograde transport and recycling processes at the trans-Golgi network, impacting cellular signaling and autophagy (Portela2018Oncogenic). The gene has clinical significance in gliomas, where its expression levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness and patient survival, and it has also been implicated in congenital heart disease (SeguraCollar2020The; Fahed2013Genetics).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM167A has been implicated in the progression and aggressiveness of gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, which are common and aggressive brain tumors. High expression levels of TMEM167A are associated with decreased patient survival, with studies showing that patients with high TMEM167A expression have a median survival of 396 days compared to 837 days for those with low expression (SeguraCollar2020The). TMEM167A is involved in vesicular trafficking, which is crucial for the regulation of the endo-lysosomal system and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling. Its downregulation has been shown to impair glioma growth by promoting EGFR degradation and disrupting EGFR-AKT signaling, particularly in gliomas with wild-type p53 (SeguraCollar2020The; Portela2018Oncogenic).

In gliomas with wild-type p53, TMEM167A is essential for maintaining EGFR signaling, contributing to tumor aggressiveness. However, in gliomas with mutant p53, TMEM167A's role appears to be dispensable, as EGFR signaling becomes independent of TMEM167A (SeguraCollar2020The). TMEM167A has also been linked to congenital heart disease, specifically Tetralogy of Fallot, through gain mutations located on chromosome 5q14.1-q14.3 (Fahed2013Genetics). These findings suggest that TMEM167A plays a significant role in disease pathogenesis through its effects on cellular signaling and trafficking pathways.

## Interactions
TMEM167A, also known as transmembrane protein 167A, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in gliomas. It plays a crucial role in vesicular trafficking and is associated with the endo-lysosomal system, impacting the localization and degradation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). TMEM167A interacts with TSSC1 and other Golgi/vesicular proteins, facilitating retrograde transport at the trans-Golgi network and recycling to the plasma membrane (Portela2018Oncogenic). 

The protein is essential for the acidification of lysosomes, which is necessary for the degradation of EGFR through the proteasomal pathway. TMEM167A's role in maintaining the EGFR-AKT signaling axis is particularly significant in glioma cells with wild-type p53, where it regulates vesicular acidification and autophagy processes (SeguraCollar2020The). In the presence of mutant p53, the dependency on TMEM167A for EGFR signaling is reduced, suggesting that p53 mutations may alter receptor turnover and EGFR/AKT activation mechanisms (SeguraCollar2020The).

TMEM167A's interactions are crucial for glioma cell survival and proliferation, making it a potential therapeutic target for EGFR-dependent gliomas (Portela2018Oncogenic).
