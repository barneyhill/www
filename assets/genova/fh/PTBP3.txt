# PTBP3

## Overview
PTBP3, or polypyrimidine tract binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing. The protein encoded by PTBP3 is involved in various post-transcriptional regulatory activities, including alternative splicing, mRNA stabilization, and translation regulation. It contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that enable it to bind to polypyrimidine-rich sequences in pre-mRNA, influencing splice site selection. PTBP3 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, indicating its significant role in the hematopoietic system. The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and translation initiation, each with distinct structural features and subcellular localizations, which contribute to its diverse functional roles in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Tan2015Generation; Coelho2016Functional).

## Structure
PTBP3, also known as polypyrimidine tract binding protein 3, is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family and is involved in RNA processing. The protein contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its binding to RNA sequences. PTBP3 undergoes alternative splicing and translation initiation, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct structural features. These isoforms include AUG1, AUG4, and AUG11, each differing in their N-terminal truncations and the presence of RNA recognition motifs (Tan2015Generation).

The AUG1 isoform is the full-length version, while AUG4 and AUG11 are truncated, lacking parts of the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the RRM1 domain. Despite the truncation, the AUG11 isoform retains RNA binding capability, suggesting that the residual part of RRM1 still contributes to RNA binding (Tan2015Generation). The AUG4 isoform lacks 31 N-terminal residues, including part of the NLS and serine-17, which is phosphorylated by protein kinase A in PTBP1 (Tan2015Generation).

PTBP3 isoforms are distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm, with the full-length AUG1 being predominantly nuclear, while AUG4 and AUG11 show higher cytoplasmic localization (Tan2015Generation). This distribution affects their functional roles, including splicing activity and potential involvement in mRNA stability and translation (Tan2015Generation).

## Function
PTBP3, also known as polypyrimidine tract binding protein 3, is involved in various RNA processing activities, including alternative splicing, mRNA stabilization, and translation regulation. It binds to polypyrimidine-rich sequences in pre-mRNA, influencing splice site selection and playing a role in post-transcriptional regulation (Tan2015Generation; Coelho2016Functional). PTBP3 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, suggesting a significant role in the hematopoietic system (Tan2015Generation). 

The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it demonstrates splicing repressor activity and is involved in nonsense-mediated decay (Tan2015Generation). PTBP3 generates multiple isoforms through alternative splicing and translation initiation, which differ in their RNA binding properties and subcellular localization, indicating distinct functional roles (Tan2015Generation). 

In particular, PTBP3 isoforms such as AUG4 and AUG11 show greater cytoplasmic localization, suggesting potential roles in mRNA stability and translation (Tan2015Generation). Despite the truncation of certain domains in some isoforms, PTBP3 maintains RNA binding and splicing regulatory activity, highlighting its functional versatility (Tan2015Generation).

## Clinical Significance
PTBP3 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PTBP3 is overexpressed, correlating with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. It promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by enhancing the expression of HIF-1α protein and stabilizing UBE4A mRNA, which are crucial for cancer progression (Xie2022PTBP3; Hou2019PTBP3). In gastric cancer, PTBP3 is upregulated and associated with lymph node metastasis. It influences metastasis by regulating alternative splicing of the CAV1 gene, affecting cell motility pathways (Liang2018PTBP3).

PTBP3 is also highly expressed in breast, colon, and hepatocellular carcinomas, where its overexpression is linked to poor survival outcomes (Fang2022New). In adrenocortical carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high PTBP3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, while low expression predicts poor outcomes in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Fang2022New). PTBP3's expression correlates with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response (Fang2022New; Chen2022PTBPs:). These findings highlight PTBP3's significant role in cancer pathology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PTBP3, or polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 3, is involved in various interactions with RNA and other proteins, influencing RNA processing and splicing regulation. PTBP3 interacts with mitochondrial tRNA Thr (mt tRNA Thr) in the cytosol, a specific interaction that is conserved across human and mouse cells. This interaction is mediated by the RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) of PTBP3, which are crucial for binding to the T-loop and D-stem-loop of mt tRNA Thr (Marnef2015Human).

PTBP3 is also regulated by PTBP1, which influences the inclusion of exon 2 in PTBP3 mRNA, affecting the protein's cytoplasmic localization. This regulation is evidenced by eCLIP peaks at the 3′ splice site of PTBP3 exon 2, containing U-rich motifs bound by PTB family proteins (Van2020A). PTBP3 isoforms, generated through alternative splicing and translation initiation, exhibit different RNA binding properties. The AUG11 isoform, despite lacking most of the RRM1 domain, shows higher RNA binding efficiency compared to other isoforms, indicating that PTBP3 can interact with RNA substrates in a manner that is not solely dependent on the full RRM1 domain (Tan2015Generation).
