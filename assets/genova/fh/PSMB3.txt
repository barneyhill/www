# PSMB3

## Overview
The PSMB3 gene encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 3, a critical component of the 20S proteasome complex, which is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins within the cell. This protein is categorized as a protease, specifically functioning as part of the proteolytic core of the proteasome. The 20S proteasome is a cylindrical structure that plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by degrading damaged or misfolded proteins, thus regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair (Elenich1999The; Coux1996STRUCTURE). PSMB3's involvement in these processes is crucial for normal cellular function and its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Integrated; Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9).

## Structure
The PSMB3 gene encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, a cylindrical complex involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMB3 consists of 205 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 23,000 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.50 (Elenich1999The). The secondary structure of the beta subunit, including PSMB3, features a core of antiparallel beta sheets flanked by alpha helices, similar to other proteasome subunits (Löwe1995Crystal; Coux1996STRUCTURE).

In terms of tertiary structure, the beta subunits, including PSMB3, form a hydrophobic cleft that is crucial for substrate interaction and proteolytic activity (Löwe1995Crystal). The quaternary structure of the 20S proteasome involves the assembly of PSMB3 into the inner rings of the proteasome, which are composed of seven different beta subunits, forming the catalytic core of the complex (Elenich1999The; Coux1996STRUCTURE).

Post-translational modifications of proteasome subunits, such as phosphorylation, may regulate their function, although specific modifications for PSMB3 are not detailed in the provided context (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMB3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly glioblastoma (GBM). Overexpression of PSMB3 is associated with increased tumor formation and aggressiveness in glioblastoma models, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9). Knockdown of PSMB3 disrupts the proteasome system, leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and affecting tumor suppressor pathways such as TP53 and PTEN, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and mitosis (Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9). 

In glioblastoma, PSMB3 overexpression is linked to the activation of Notch signaling pathways, promoting tumorigenesis and maintaining cancer stem cell characteristics (Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9). This overexpression does not significantly alter proteasome activity, indicating a proteasome-independent mechanism (Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9).

Beyond glioblastoma, high expression levels of PSMB3 are associated with poor survival in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) and kidney chromophobe (KICH) (Li2021Integrated). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), higher PSMB3 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and shorter overall survival (Jiang2022Comprehensive). These findings suggest that PSMB3 could serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
PSMB3, a subunit of the 20S core proteasome, plays a significant role in protein homeostasis and recycling within cells. It is involved in both proteasome-dependent and independent mechanisms, contributing to gliomagenesis. PSMB3 interacts with BIN1, a tumor suppressor, forming a PSMB3-BIN1-MYC axis. This interaction is crucial as BIN1 binds specifically to PSMB3, leading to the downregulation of c-myc, a key factor in cancer cell survival. Knockdown of PSMB3 results in increased BIN1 levels and decreased c-myc expression, indicating that disrupting this axis is detrimental to cancer cells (Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9).

PSMB3 also appears to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates Notch signaling pathways, promoting tumorigenesis. This activation is associated with increased expression of Notch isoforms and stem cell markers such as Sox2 and Nestin. The nuclear localization of PSMB3 correlates with elevated Notch1 protein levels, suggesting that PSMB3 facilitates the transcription of Notch downstream genes (Baisiwala2021CRISPR-Cas9). These interactions highlight PSMB3's role in regulating pathways critical for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma multiforme.
