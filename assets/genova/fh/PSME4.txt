# PSME4

## Overview
PSME4 is a gene that encodes the proteasome activator subunit 4, also known as PA200, a protein involved in the regulation of proteasome activity. PA200 is a monomeric protein that interacts with the 20S proteasome, facilitating the degradation of specific substrates, including acetylated histones and tau proteins, and playing a crucial role in DNA repair and genomic stability (Douida2020The; Yazgili2022The). The protein is characterized by its ability to enhance trypsin-like activity while modulating other proteolytic activities of the proteasome, thereby influencing cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, and response to stress (Yazgili2022The). PA200's involvement in cellular homeostasis and its implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders underscore its biological significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Javitt2021The; Yazgili2022The).

## Structure
The PA200/PSME4 proteasome activator is a 200 kDa monomeric protein that forms an asymmetric, hollow, dome-like structure. It binds to the outer alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome, except for α7, as a monomer, facilitating the opening of the 20S gate. This interaction involves two anchor points near the α5-α6 and α1-α2 interfaces, causing rearrangements in the α-subunits and allosteric effects on the β-subunits, which alter their activity (Yazgili2022The).

The structure of PA200 reveals two positively charged grooves that may serve as potential substrate entry sites. These grooves can be obstructed by negatively charged molecules like InsP6, suggesting a regulatory role in substrate entry. This structural feature implies that PA200 might block large substrates and increase selectivity for negatively charged substrates (Yazgili2022The).

PA200 is highly conserved among mammals and has homologs in other species, although the sequence similarity between human PA200 and yeast Blm10 is only 17%, raising questions about their functional similarity (Yazgili2022The). The exact molecular structure of PA200 without bound molecules remains unknown, and its precise functions in different proteasome complexes are still being explored (Yazgili2022The).

## Function
PSME4, also known as PA200, is a proteasome activator involved in various cellular processes. It primarily localizes in the nucleus and enhances the proteolytic activity of the 20S and 26S proteasome complexes, facilitating the degradation of unstructured substrates such as acetylated histones and tau proteins (Douida2020The; Yazgili2022The). PA200 plays a crucial role in DNA repair by recruiting proteasomes to sites of double-strand breaks, where it aids in the degradation of chromatin proteins, thus exposing DNA for repair (Ustrell2002PA200). It is also involved in maintaining genomic stability through enhanced post-glutamyl cleavage by proteasomes (Douida2020The).

In healthy cells, PA200 regulates proteasome activity by binding to the alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome, which leads to rearrangements affecting the catalytic activity of the beta subunits. This interaction increases trypsin-like activity while decreasing chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities (Yazgili2022The). PA200 is implicated in cellular homeostasis, influencing gene expression related to cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death, particularly in response to mitochondrial stress (Douida2020The). Its role in protein degradation and cellular stress responses is essential for maintaining cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The PSME4 gene, also known as proteasome activator subunit 4, plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, PSME4 is frequently upregulated, contributing to immune evasion and tumor progression. High expression of PSME4 is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (Javitt2021The). PSME4 overexpression leads to a reduction in CD8+ T cell activity and an increase in regulatory T cell populations, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Javitt2021The). Additionally, PSME4 mutations, particularly missense mutations, are prevalent in certain cancers, such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Larsson2022Pancancer).

In neurodegenerative diseases, PSME4 expression is typically downregulated, which may contribute to the accumulation of ubiquitin-positive inclusions and neuroinflammation (Yazgili2022The). The gene's role in DNA repair and genomic stability suggests that its dysfunction could lead to DNA damage, further exacerbating neurodegenerative conditions (Yazgili2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PSME4 in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

## Interactions
The human gene PSME4 encodes the proteasome activator PA200, which interacts with the 20S proteasome core particle to form singly or doubly-capped complexes. PA200 binds specifically to the alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome, inducing structural rearrangements that affect the catalytic activity of the beta subunits. This interaction enhances trypsin-like activity while reducing chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities (Toste2019Characterization; Yazgili2022The).

PA200 also forms hybrid proteasomes with 19S caps and 20S core proteasomes, which accumulate on chromatin in response to ionizing radiation. This accumulation is associated with increased proteasome activity, particularly postglutamyl cleavage, and is dependent on DNA-PK activity (Blickwedehl2008Role).

In the context of fibrotic tissue remodeling, PA200 interacts with the 20S proteasome to form alternative complexes that are upregulated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It acts as a negative regulator of myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a role in modulating cellular responses to pro-fibrotic stimuli (Welk2019Proteasome).

PA200 is also involved in the degradation of acetylated histones following DNA damage-induced replication stress, a process independent of protein ubiquitylation. This interaction highlights PA200's role in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage response pathways (Mandemaker2018DNA).
