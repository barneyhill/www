# RPTN

## Overview
The RPTN gene encodes the protein repetin, which is a member of the S100 fused-type protein family, known for its calcium-binding capabilities. Repetin is primarily involved in the formation of the epidermal cornified cell envelope, playing a crucial role in maintaining skin barrier function. It is characterized by the presence of EF-hand domains, which facilitate calcium binding, and is rich in glutamine residues that may serve as substrates for transglutaminases, enzymes essential for cross-linking epidermal proteins. Although repetin is not highly expressed in the homeostatic epidermis, its expression can be upregulated in response to epidermal barrier disruptions and ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, indicating its role in stress response and skin repair mechanisms. Additionally, repetin is expressed in the brain, suggesting potential involvement in emotional and cognitive processes, although its specific functions in the central nervous system remain to be fully elucidated (Makino2024Ultraviolet; Wang2015Diminished; Trzeciak2017Altered).

## Function
Repetin (RPTN) is a protein involved in the formation of the epidermal cornified cell envelope, contributing to skin barrier function. It is part of the fused-type S100 protein family and is expressed in the granular layer of the epidermis. In healthy human cells, RPTN is not highly expressed in homeostatic epidermis but can be upregulated in response to epidermal barrier alterations (Trzeciak2017Altered). The protein is rich in glutamine residues, which may serve as substrates for transglutaminases, enzymes crucial for cross-linking epidermal proteins during the formation of the stratum corneum (Trzeciak2017Altered).

RPTN is also expressed in the brain, with relatively high levels in regions such as the choroid plexus, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Its expression in the brain suggests a potential role in emotional and cognitive processing, although its specific function in the central nervous system remains unclear (Wang2015Diminished). The protein contains EF-hand domains similar to calcium-binding proteins, which are important in various cellular processes (Wang2015Diminished). Despite its low expression in non-irradiated skin, RPTN expression increases significantly in response to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, indicating a role in the epidermal response to UVB-induced stress (Makino2024Ultraviolet).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RPTN (repetin) gene have been implicated in several diseases. In neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, serum levels of RPTN are significantly diminished compared to healthy controls. This reduction is not correlated with medication use or illness duration, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Wang2015Diminished). 

In atopic dermatitis (AD), RPTN expression is elevated in both lesional and nonlesional skin, possibly as a compensatory mechanism to repair the altered epidermal barrier. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RPTN gene, such as rs3001978, are associated with more severe AD symptoms, including early onset and pruritus, particularly in patients without FLG mutations (Trzeciak2017Altered). 

In mastocytosis, a genome-wide association study identified the SNP rs7601511 in the RPTN gene as less prevalent in cutaneous mastocytosis patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential protective role against the disease (Nedoszytko2020Results). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RPTN in various conditions, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.
