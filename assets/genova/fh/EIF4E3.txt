# EIF4E3

## Overview
EIF4E3 is a gene that encodes the protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family member 3 (eIF4E3), which is part of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family. This protein plays a crucial role in the initiation of mRNA translation by recognizing the 5' cap structure of mRNA, thereby facilitating ribosome binding and translation initiation. Unlike its family member eIF4E1, eIF4E3 binds the mRNA cap structure through an atypical mode involving Van der Waals interactions (Frydryskova2016Distinct). The protein exists in two isoforms, eIF4E3_A and eIF4E3_B, with the former being involved in translation initiation and stress response, while the latter lacks significant functional domains (Frydryskova2016Distinct). eIF4E3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including stress response and cancer biology, where it may influence tumor progression and metastasis (Maimaiti2023N7methylguanosin). Its ability to form a novel eIF4F cap-binding complex, termed eIF4F-3, further underscores its role in mRNA translation initiation (Landon2014MNKs).

## Structure
The EIF4E3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family, which plays a role in the initiation of protein synthesis. The human eIF4E3 protein is 224 amino acids long, differing from its mouse counterpart by six amino acid residues (Frydryskova2016Distinct). The protein is known to bind the mRNA cap structure, although it does so via an atypical mode using Van der Waals interactions, unlike the aromatic sandwich typical of eIF4E1 (Frydryskova2016Distinct).

eIF4E3 has two isoforms, eIF4E3_A and eIF4E3_B, resulting from alternative splicing. The eIF4E3_A isoform is involved in translation initiation and localizes to stress granules under stress conditions, interacting with translation initiation factors such as eIF4G1, eIF4G3, and PABP1 (Frydryskova2016Distinct). In contrast, the truncated eIF4E3_B isoform lacks significant parts of the eIF4G-binding consensus and does not localize to stress granules or processing bodies (Frydryskova2016Distinct).

The protein's structure includes a cap-binding domain, but specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available literature (Frydryskova2016Distinct; Piserà2018Structure).

## Function
EIF4E3, a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family, plays a significant role in the initiation of mRNA translation in human cells. It is involved in the recognition of the 5' cap structure of mRNA, facilitating ribosome binding and translation initiation. EIF4E3 can bind the m7G-cap, although with lower affinity than eIF4E1, and may compete with eIF4E1 for mRNA transcripts, potentially reducing eIF4E1-cap-mediated translation (Landon2014MNKs). EIF4E3 is capable of forming a novel eIF4F cap-binding complex, termed eIF4F-3, by interacting with eIF4A and eIF4G, indicating its role in mRNA translation initiation (Landon2014MNKs).

In healthy human cells, eIF4E3 is recruited to stress granules (SGs) under stress conditions, such as heat shock and arsenite treatment, suggesting a role in translation initiation during cellular stress responses (Frydryskova2016Distinct). The full-length isoform, eIF4E3_A, interacts with components of the translation initiation complex, including eIF4G and PABP, and is involved in active translation, as indicated by its presence in monosome and light polysome fractions (Frydryskova2016Distinct). This localization to SGs rather than processing bodies (PBs) supports its function in translation initiation rather than mRNA decay (Frydryskova2016Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
EIF4E3 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lower-grade glioma (LGG), EIF4E3 is part of the m7G score hub genes, which are associated with the immune microenvironment and drug sensitivity. Although EIF4E3 expression levels are higher in LGG samples compared to healthy brain tissues, its protein levels do not significantly differ, suggesting a complex role in tumor biology (Maimaiti2023N7methylguanosin). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), EIF4E3 is upregulated in response to the inhibition of MNK kinase activity, which affects the balance between EIF4E1 and EIF4E3, potentially sustaining cell viability and contributing to tumor relapse (Landon2014MNKs). EIF4E3 can also form a novel eIF4F cap-binding complex, termed eIF4F-3, which may play a role in mRNA translation initiation and influence oncogenic processes (Landon2014MNKs). The dysregulation of EIF4E3, through its interactions and expression changes, may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Maimaiti2023N7methylguanosin). However, specific clinical conditions directly resulting from EIF4E3 mutations are not detailed in the available literature.

## Interactions
EIF4E3 is involved in various protein interactions, particularly under stress conditions. It can form an active eIF4F complex by interacting with eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, especially when the mTOR pathway is inhibited by agents like Torin1. This complex is translationally active and selectively engages transcripts with short 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) (Weiss2021eIF4E3). Unlike eIF4E1, EIF4E3 does not interact with 4EBP1, which is a known inhibitor of eIF4E1 (Weiss2021eIF4E3).

EIF4E3 also interacts with other proteins such as Angel1, CDC5L, and several heat shock proteins, although these interactions are not directly linked to translation (Weiss2021eIF4E3). In Trypanosoma brucei, EIF4E3 forms a complex with EIF4G4, which is crucial for cell viability and morphology. This complex is associated with proteins like PABP2, SCD6, DRBD2, and several zinc-finger proteins, indicating a role in translation initiation and mRNA storage (Bezerra2022Distinct).

In human cells, the eIF4E3_A isoform interacts with eIF4G1, eIF4G3, and PABP1, suggesting its involvement in translation initiation. This isoform localizes to stress granules during stress conditions, indicating a role in the cellular stress response (Frydryskova2016Distinct).
