# DCAF13

## Overview
DCAF13, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 13, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, specifically as a substrate receptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing it to form stable multi-protein complexes essential for its role in ubiquitination processes (Lee2007DCAFs). DCAF13 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the brain and muscle, and exists in multiple isoforms, which may influence its functional properties (Manzoor2023A). The protein plays a critical role in regulating protein turnover, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression, and its dysregulation has been implicated in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma and certain neuromuscular disorders (Wei2024DCAF13; Manzoor2023A).

## Structure
DCAF13, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 13, is a protein encoded by the DCAF13 gene in humans. It is a component of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The protein may contain WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These repeats contribute to the protein's ability to form a stable platform for the assembly of multi-protein complexes, which is crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, could influence the function of DCAF13, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The presence of these modifications suggests a regulatory mechanism that could modulate the activity of the protein in response to cellular signals.

DCAF13 may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could lead to differences in its functional or structural properties. These isoforms might exhibit variations in their interaction capabilities or stability, thereby influencing the overall activity of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The existence of these isoforms highlights the complexity and adaptability of the protein's function in cellular processes.

## Function
DCAF13, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 13, is a protein that functions as a substrate receptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is crucial for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression (Lee2007DCAFs). In healthy human cells, DCAF13 is involved in rRNA processing and protein ubiquitination, interacting with proteins such as UTP18, WDR46, and RPR9, which are involved in rRNA processing (Manzoor2023A).

DCAF13 is expressed in various tissues, with high expression levels in brain regions like the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and moderate levels in muscle cells (Manzoor2023A). It is transcribed into multiple isoforms, some encoding proteins of 597 amino acids, and is part of the protein orthologous group KOG0268, which includes Sof1-like rRNA proteins (Manzoor2023A). The protein's role in maintaining protein stability is suggested by the conservation of the amino acid Asp303 across eukaryotes, indicating its functional significance (Manzoor2023A). DCAF13's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DCAF13 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DCAF13 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It acts as a substrate receptor in the CRL4 E3 ligase complex, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This leads to the downregulation of p53 target genes, facilitating cancer progression and correlating with shorter overall and disease-free survival in patients (Wei2024DCAF13). 

In a separate study, a biallelic variant of DCAF13 was linked to a neuromuscular disorder in a consanguineous family. The variant, c.907 G > A:p.(Asp303Asn), was associated with symptoms such as facial nerve palsy and severe waddling gait. This variant is extremely rare and predicted to be damaging, suggesting its pathogenic role in the disorder (Manzoor2023A). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of DCAF13 in both cancer and neuromuscular disorders, suggesting it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in conditions where its normal function is disrupted.

## Interactions
DCAF13, as part of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. It acts as a substrate receptor within this complex, facilitating interactions between substrate proteins and the complex components, including DDB1, CUL4A, CUL4B, and RBX1 (Wei2024DCAF13; Sun2023Targeting). DCAF13 is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of the p53 protein, a key tumor suppressor. It binds directly to p53, leading to its K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting the p53 signaling pathway (Wei2024DCAF13).

In colorectal cancer, DCAF13 interacts with the core domain of TOP1 (Topoisomerase 1) through its WD40 domains, facilitating the ubiquitylation of TOP1-DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP1-DPCs) by the CRL4 complex (Sun2023Targeting). This interaction is crucial for the repair of these DNA lesions during DNA replication. DCAF13 also targets the MeCP2 protein for ubiquitination and degradation, which is essential for normal follicle growth and preventing DNA hypermethylation (Ren2024CRL4DCAF13). These interactions highlight DCAF13's role in regulating protein stability and function through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
