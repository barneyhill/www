# RNF208

## Overview
RNF208 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 208, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by its RING domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of protein stability and cellular motility through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It is known to target specific proteins, such as Vimentin, for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby influencing cellular architecture and motility. RNF208 is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where its expression levels have been linked to tumor progression and metastasis, especially in triple-negative breast cancer and low-grade gliomas. The gene's expression is modulated by estrogen, and its activity is associated with the suppression of metastatic potential in cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (cheng2021RNF208; Pang2019RNF208).

## Function
RNF208, an estrogen-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a significant role in regulating protein stability and cell motility in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as Vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein associated with cell structure and integrity (Pang2019RNF208). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular architecture, which in turn influences cell motility and stability (Pang2019RNF208).

RNF208's function involves recognizing and binding to phosphorylated Vimentin at the Ser39 residue, facilitating its K27-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. This process is essential for reducing the metastatic potential of cells by decreasing the stability of soluble Vimentin, which is linked to increased cell migration and invasiveness (Pang2019RNF208). The protein's activity is dependent on specific cysteine-rich motifs within its RING domain, which are essential for its E3 ligase function (Pang2019RNF208). Through these mechanisms, RNF208 contributes to the suppression of unwanted cell migration and proliferation, highlighting its role in cellular processes that impact cancer metastasis and progression (Pang2019RNF208).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF208 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). RNF208 is an estrogen-inducible E3 ligase that targets soluble Vimentin for degradation, thereby suppressing metastasis in TNBC cells. The gene is significantly underexpressed in TNBC compared to luminal breast cancer subtypes, and this underexpression is associated with aggressive cancer behavior and poor clinical outcomes, such as shorter relapse-free survival times (Pang2019RNF208). Overexpression of RNF208 in TNBC cells has been shown to reduce tumor growth and lung metastasis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Pang2019RNF208).

RNF208's activity is crucial for the degradation of Vimentin, a protein associated with the mesenchymal phenotype of aggressive cancer cells. This degradation is achieved through K27 ubiquitin-linked polyubiquitination, leading to Vimentin's proteasomal degradation (Pang2019RNF208). The loss of RNF208 does not induce aggressive phenotypes in luminal breast cancer subtypes, indicating that its tumor-suppressive effects may be specific to TNBC (Pang2019RNF208).

In low-grade gliomas (LGGs), RNF208 expression is negatively correlated with immune infiltration and is associated with a favorable prognosis. High RNF208 expression is linked to better clinical outcomes and is significantly associated with WHO grade groups in LGGs (cheng2021RNF208).

## Interactions
RNF208, a ring finger protein, is known to participate in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer biology. In low-grade gliomas (LGGs), RNF208 expression is negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. This suggests that RNF208 may play a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (cheng2021RNF208). 

In breast cancer, RNF208 has been shown to interact with vimentin, a type of intermediate filament protein. RNF208 binds to vimentin phosphorylated at Ser39, leading to the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of vimentin at the Lys97 residue. This interaction is significant in triple-negative breast cancer, where downregulation of RNF208 is associated with increased malignancy due to greater stability of vimentin (Patteson2020Mechanical).

RNF208 is also implicated in the genomic landscape of resistance to aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer. It is included in a protein-protein interaction network cluster with other genes like COMTD1, HSD3B1, and RNF151, indicating potential interactions within this cluster that may contribute to drug resistance (Sadasivam2023The).
