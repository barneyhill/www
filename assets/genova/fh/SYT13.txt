# SYT13

## Overview
SYT13 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptotagmin 13, a member of the synaptotagmin family involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Unlike other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin 13 operates in a calcium-independent manner and lacks an extracellular N-terminus sequence, which distinguishes its function within the family (TarquisMedina2021Synaptotagmin13). This protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pancreas, and intestine, with significant roles in neuroendocrine cells (TarquisMedina2021Synaptotagmin13). Synaptotagmin 13 is involved in the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton and cell-matrix adhesion, influencing cellular dynamics and morphogenesis (Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13). Its interactions with proteins related to vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics underscore its importance in cellular processes (Bakhti2021Synaptotagmin; Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13). Alterations in SYT13 expression have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Lehmann2024Heterozygous; Li2019Silencing).

## Function
Synaptotagmin-13 (SYT13) is an atypical member of the synaptotagmin protein family, primarily involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT13 operates in a calcium-independent manner and lacks an extracellular N-terminus sequence, which distinguishes its function from other family members (TarquisMedina2021Synaptotagmin13). SYT13 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pancreas, and intestine, with significant expression in neuroendocrine cells (TarquisMedina2021Synaptotagmin13).

In the pancreas, SYT13 plays a crucial role in pancreatic endocrine cell egression and islet morphogenesis. It is involved in the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton, influencing the stability and dynamics of microtubules through post-translational modifications of tubulin. SYT13-expressing cells exhibit increased levels of α-tubulin and β3-tubulin, and SYT13 colocalizes with various forms of α-tubulin (Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13). SYT13 also modulates cell-matrix adhesion, which is essential for endocrine cell egression from the ductal epithelium (Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13).

In the nervous system, SYT13 is highly expressed in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing and oxytocin-producing neuroendocrine cells, suggesting its role in neuroendocrine functions (TarquisMedina2021Synaptotagmin13). Its expression pattern aligns with other synaptotagmin family proteins, indicating a broad role in neuroendocrine signaling and cellular processes (TarquisMedina2021Synaptotagmin13).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SYT13 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SYT13 is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Studies have shown that a heterozygous knockout of SYT13 in human motor neurons can mimic ALS features, including the activation of the transcription factor TP53, which is linked to stress and pro-apoptotic pathways. This suggests that reduced SYT13 expression contributes to motor neuron vulnerability and degeneration in ALS (Lehmann2024Heterozygous). SYT13 is also expressed in oculomotor neurons, which are more resistant to degeneration, indicating a potential neuroprotective role (Nizzardo2020Synaptotagmin).

In cancer, SYT13 is upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, promoting tumor growth and progression. Knockdown of SYT13 in colorectal cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion, alongside increased apoptosis, suggesting that SYT13 acts as a tumor promoter (Li2019Silencing). Additionally, SYT13 has been identified as a potential liver tumor suppressor, with its attenuation leading to increased tumorigenicity and decreased expression of the tumor suppressor gene Wt1 (Jahn2008Reexpression).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 13 (SYT13) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. SYT13 interacts with several proteins related to vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. It shows high colocalization with α-tubulin and β3-tubulin, and its interactions with these proteins are important for the stability and dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13). SYT13 also interacts with acetylated-tubulin (Ac-tub), Map1b, and dystonin, forming a complex that is upregulated during endocrinogenesis (Bakhti2021Synaptotagmin).

SYT13 is involved in vesicle trafficking, interacting with proteins such as Caveolin-1, Hgs, and Small GTPases Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11, which are essential for endocytosis and membrane trafficking (Bakhti2021Synaptotagmin; Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13). These interactions suggest a role in protein endocytosis, trafficking, degradation, and recycling.

Additionally, SYT13 interacts with phosphoinositide phospholipids, particularly PIP3, which likely directs vesicles carrying SYT13 to specific cellular domains, linking it to PI3K signaling pathways (Bakhti2022Synaptotagmin13). This interaction is crucial for the repolarization of endocrine cells and their migration during morphogenesis. These interactions highlight SYT13's role in regulating cell dynamics and adhesion.
