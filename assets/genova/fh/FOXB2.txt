# FOXB2

## Overview
FOXB2 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box B2 protein, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which allows them to regulate the expression of target genes. The forkhead box B2 protein plays a significant role in the modulation of Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Unlike classical Wnt signaling that involves LRP6 and β-catenin, FOXB2 engages in a non-classical pathway involving WNT7B/RECK/GPR124, highlighting its unique mechanism of action (Moparthi2019Wnt). The interactions of FOXB2 with other proteins such as YAP1, JUN, and DDX5 further underscore its importance in transcriptional regulation and its potential implications in cancer biology, particularly in the context of aggressive prostate cancer (Moparthi2019Wnt).

## Structure


## Interactions
FOXB2 is involved in Wnt signaling and interacts with several proteins to facilitate its function. It requires interaction with proteins such as YAP1, JUN, and DDX5 for FOXB2-dependent Wnt signaling. These interactions were identified through mass spectrometry and confirmed by functional assays, which demonstrated that depletion of these proteins impairs FOXB2's ability to activate the Wnt pathway. Conversely, the depletion of ZNF703 was found to enhance FOXB2-induced Wnt pathway activation, suggesting an inhibitory role for ZNF703 in this context (Moparthi2019Wnt).

FOXB2 also interacts with FOXC1, as confirmed by in-situ proximity ligation assays, indicating its involvement in a multi-protein transcriptional complex that promotes Wnt activity (Moparthi2019Wnt). The study further suggests that FOXB2 does not activate Wnt signaling through the classical LRP6 and β-catenin pathway but instead engages a non-classical WNT7B/RECK/GPR124 signaling module. This indicates that FOXB2's interaction with DNA and possibly other proteins is crucial for its role in Wnt signaling (Moparthi2019Wnt).

These interactions highlight FOXB2's role in regulating gene transcription and its potential involvement in cancer progression, particularly in aggressive prostate cancer (Moparthi2019Wnt).
