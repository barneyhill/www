# TYW5

## Overview
The TYW5 gene encodes the tRNA-yW synthesizing protein 5, a crucial enzyme in the wybutosine biosynthesis pathway, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA. This protein functions as a tRNA hydroxylase, utilizing 2-oxoglutarate and Fe2+ as cofactors to catalyze the hydroxylation of guanosine at position 37 of tRNAPhe, ultimately forming hydroxy wybutosine (OHyW) (Li2021Regulatory). The modification is essential for the accuracy and efficiency of protein translation. TYW5 is expressed in various cell types, including neural cells, and plays a significant role in neurodevelopment and spine morphogenesis (Li2021Regulatory). The gene's expression is stable across different brain regions, underscoring its importance in brain function (Li2021Regulatory). Additionally, alterations in TYW5 expression have been linked to schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2022Comprehensive; Li2021Regulatory).

## Function
The TYW5 gene encodes the tRNA-yW synthesizing protein 5, which is a tRNA modification enzyme involved in the wybutosine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme functions as an RNA hydroxylase, forming the OHyW nucleoside by carbon hydroxylation using 2-oxoglutarate and Fe2+ ion as cofactors (Li2021Regulatory). TYW5 is part of a sequence of six enzymes that modify the nucleoside at position 37 of tRNAPhe into hydroxy wybutosine (OHyW), a modification crucial for maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of protein translation (Li2021Regulatory).

TYW5 is expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of various cell types, including HEK293T, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH, mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), and rat neurons (Li2021Regulatory). It plays a significant role in neurodevelopment and spine morphogenesis, affecting the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs and the density of dendritic spines in neurons (Li2021Regulatory). TYW5 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and forebrain neurons, suggesting its involvement in early neural development (Li2021Regulatory). The gene is stably expressed across different brain regions throughout life, highlighting its importance in brain function (Li2021Regulatory).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TYW5 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Studies have shown that TYW5 is significantly upregulated in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's development (Zhang2022Comprehensive; Li2021Regulatory). The gene is associated with regulatory variants at the 2q33.1 locus, specifically SNPs rs796364 and rs281759, which act as enhancers for TYW5 expression. These variants are linked to schizophrenia risk by modulating TYW5 expression levels (Li2021Regulatory).

TYW5 expression is also associated with changes in brain structure, such as gray matter volume abnormalities in the frontal-parietal regions, which are relevant to schizophrenia (Zhang2022Comprehensive). The SNP rs203772, associated with higher TYW5 expression, is linked to schizophrenia and brain gray matter abnormalities, indicating that it may confer risk through alterations in TYW5 expression (Zhang2022Comprehensive).

In addition to its role in schizophrenia, TYW5 has been noted for its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes, affecting the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and the morphology of dendritic spines, which are often dysregulated in schizophrenia (Li2021Regulatory).

## Interactions
TYW5, a tRNA-yW synthesizing protein, is involved in the hydroxylation of tRNA, specifically binding to tRNA Phe to convert guanosine at position 37 into wybutosine or hydroxywybutosine. This interaction highlights its role as a tRNA hydroxylase, expanding the functional repertoire of JMJD proteins to include RNA modification (Oh2019The). Structurally, TYW5 dimerizes via a C-terminal alpha-helix bundle, which is distinct from other proteins like FIH, and this dimerization is proposed to facilitate tRNA binding. The positively charged patch formed by the C-terminal alpha-helices is thought to enable RNA binding, similar to the mechanism observed in JMJD6 (Markolovic2016Structure–function).

TYW5 shares structural similarities with JMJD5, as revealed by structural homology searches. Both proteins have conserved active-site residues, such as the Fe(II)-coordinating His-X-Asp-Xn-His triad, although they likely hydroxylate different substrates due to differences in their binding pocket residues. For instance, Arg-149 in TYW5 may interact with the phosphate backbone of an RNA substrate, suggesting distinct substrate specificities and functions compared to JMJD5 (Del2012Crystal). Despite these insights, specific protein-protein interactions involving TYW5 are not detailed in the available literature.
