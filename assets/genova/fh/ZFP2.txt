# ZFP2

## Overview
ZFP2 is a gene that encodes the ZFP2 zinc finger protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. The ZFP2 zinc finger protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein plays a crucial role in gene expression and regulation, contributing to the modulation of various biological pathways. The precise functions and interactions of ZFP2 zinc finger protein are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding its role in health and disease.
