# CYP51A1

## Overview
CYP51A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 51 subfamily A member 1, also known as lanosterol 14α-demethylase. This enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is characterized by its role in catalyzing the oxidative demethylation of lanosterol, a critical step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other sterols in mammals (Park2017Nitric; Režen2017Evaluation). The protein is categorized as a monooxygenase and is ubiquitously expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells, underscoring its essential function in maintaining cellular membrane integrity and supporting steroid hormone production and embryonic development (Kaluzhskiy2021Human; Lewińska2013Polymorphisms). The structural features of CYP51A1, including its conserved P450 fold and substrate recognition sites, are crucial for its enzymatic activity and interaction with various proteins, such as cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (Ryu2017Membrane; Režen2017Evaluation). Mutations and alterations in CYP51A1 expression have been implicated in several diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and Antley-Bixler syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Cokan2020Chronic; Keber2011Mouse).

## Structure
The human CYP51A1 protein, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Its structure is characterized by a conserved P450 fold, which includes a heme-binding domain surrounded by helices E, I, J, K, and L (Strushkevich2010Structural). The protein exhibits a typical P450 fold with a well-conserved structural core, and its tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape (Strushkevich2010Structural).

CYP51A1 shares structural features with both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytochromes P450, including the positioning of the beta-domain and the orientation of the A-propionate side chain, which is directed towards the distal side of the heme plane (Denisov2012Structural). The enzyme's active site is shaped by the heme and adjacent I-helix, with flexible regions such as the F and G helices contributing to substrate binding (Denisov2012Structural).

The protein's structure includes conserved amino acids clustered in six substrate recognition sites (SRS1-6), specific to CYP51A1 (Režen2017Evaluation). These structural features are crucial for its function in sterol metabolism and its interaction with azole inhibitors, which bind to the heme iron via the nitrogen of the imidazole moiety (Strushkevich2010Structural). The binding of azole inhibitors induces conformational changes, particularly in the B′ helix and F-G loop regions, facilitating substrate entry from the membrane (Strushkevich2010Structural).

## Function
The CYP51A1 gene encodes the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative removal of the 14α-methyl group from lanosterol, a key step in the conversion of lanosterol to 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8(9),14,24-trien-3β-ol, which is essential for the production of cholesterol and other sterols in mammals (Park2017Nitric; Režen2017Evaluation). The reaction occurs in three steps and requires a NADPH type reducing agent and the presence of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) (Režen2017Evaluation).

CYP51A1 is ubiquitously expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells, highlighting its vital role in cellular function (Park2017Nitric). Cholesterol synthesized by CYP51A1 is crucial for maintaining cellular membrane integrity, producing steroid hormones, and supporting embryonic development (Kaluzhskiy2021Human; Lewińska2013Polymorphisms). The enzyme's function is substrate-specific, with certain amino acids conserved across species, clustered in six substrate recognition sites (SRS1-6) specific to CYP51A1, which are crucial for the enzyme's interaction with its substrates and redox partners (Režen2017Evaluation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CYP51A1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Disruption of CYP51A1 in hepatocytes can lead to morphological changes and malignant liver tumors, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a higher incidence observed in females (Cokan2020Chronic). The gene's disruption is associated with the accumulation of sterol intermediates, affecting cellular signaling pathways and potentially contributing to cancerogenesis (Cokan2020Chronic). 

Mutations in CYP51A1 have also been associated with infant liver failure and death, and certain polymorphisms are linked to female-specific breast cancer (Cokan2020Chronic). In the context of Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), mutations in CYP51A1 have been associated with ABS-like phenotypes, characterized by skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital abnormalities (Keber2011Mouse). 

The gene's low somatic mutation frequency in various cancers suggests its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, with alterations in its expression linked to cancer, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome (Kaluzhskiy2021Human). Inhibition of CYP51A1 can induce apoptosis in cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Kaluzhskiy2021Human).

## Interactions
CYP51A1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and interacts with several proteins to perform its function. It forms a complex with cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), which is essential for its enzymatic activity by providing the necessary electrons for the oxidative demethylation of lanosterol (Režen2017Evaluation). Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that mutations in CYP51A1 can affect its interaction with POR, potentially altering its enzymatic efficiency (Režen2017Evaluation).

CYP51A1 also interacts with progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), which is crucial for its activity in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. This interaction is thought to stabilize CYP51A1 and enhance its function (Ryu2017Membrane). In yeast models, a homolog of PGRMC1, Dap1, is required for the activation of Erg11/CYP51, suggesting a conserved role across species (Ryu2017Membrane).

Additionally, neuferricin has been implicated in stabilizing CYP51A1, as its knockdown leads to reduced CYP51A1 levels and increased sensitivity to cholesterol synthesis intermediates (Ryu2017Membrane). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein-protein interactions that regulate CYP51A1's function in sterol biosynthesis.
