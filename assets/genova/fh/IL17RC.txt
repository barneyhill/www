# IL17RC

## Overview
The IL17RC gene encodes the interleukin 17 receptor C, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating responses to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F. This receptor is a critical component of the IL-17 receptor complex, which is essential for host defense mechanisms, particularly in mucocutaneous immunity against fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans (Ling2015Inherited; Ho2010IL17RC). The IL17RC protein is characterized by its extracellular IL17R_N domain and intracellular SEFIR domain, which are crucial for its function in signaling pathways that activate inflammatory mediators (Harada2021Identification). The gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can influence ligand specificity and receptor function (Gaffen2009Structure). Mutations in IL17RC have been linked to clinical conditions such as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, highlighting its significance in both immune response and pathological processes (Ling2015Inherited; Wang2019IL17RC).

## Structure
The IL17RC protein is a type I transmembrane protein with a full-length sequence translating into a 720-amino acid protein. It consists of a 447-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a 21-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 232-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Haudenschild2002Soluble). The extracellular domain is acidic, with a predicted isoelectric point of 4.71, and contains nine potential N-linked glycosylation sites. It also has 22 cysteines, 66 leucines, and 38 prolines, suggesting potential for extensive secondary structure (Haudenschild2002Soluble). The cytoplasmic domain is basic, with an isoelectric point of 10.04, and contains potential phosphorylation sites, including 16 serines, 5 threonines, and 3 tyrosines (Haudenschild2002Soluble).

IL17RC undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, some of which lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, leading to secreted forms (Haudenschild2002Soluble). More than 90 splice isoforms have been identified, with some showing ligand preference for IL-17A or IL-17F (Gaffen2009Structure). The protein's structure includes an extracellular IL17R_N domain and an intracellular SEFIR domain, with a transmembrane region between them (Harada2021Identification).

## Function
The IL17RC gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the IL-17 receptor complex, which is essential for mediating immune responses, particularly in the context of IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines. In healthy human cells, IL-17RC forms a heterodimeric receptor complex with IL-17RA, facilitating the signaling pathways that lead to the induction of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, CXC chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides (Ling2015Inherited; Ho2010IL17RC). This signaling is crucial for host defense against extracellular pathogens and plays a significant role in mucocutaneous immunity, particularly against fungal infections like Candida albicans (Ling2015Inherited; Ho2010IL17RC).

IL-17RC is expressed at high levels in glandular tissues and is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to infection sites, a key aspect of the immune response (Ho2010IL17RC). The protein contains a SEFIR domain necessary for IL-17-dependent signaling, and an additional sequence, termed SEFEX, is required for the activation of NF-kB-dependent genes (Ho2010IL17RC). IL-17RC interacts with the adaptor molecule Act1, which is crucial for downstream signaling, highlighting its role in the activation of specific immune pathways (Ho2010IL17RC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL17RC gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One significant condition linked to IL17RC mutations is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), characterized by persistent infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes by Candida species, primarily Candida albicans. Patients with autosomal recessive IL17RC deficiency exhibit impaired responses to IL-17A and IL-17F, leading to susceptibility to CMC. These mutations result in premature stop codons, causing a loss of function in the IL17RC gene, which is crucial for mucocutaneous immunity (Ling2015Inherited; Noma2023Isolated).

A novel duplication variant of IL17RC has been identified in patients with isolated CMC, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon that disrupts the SEFIR domain essential for signaling. This variant abolishes the cellular response to IL-17A, confirming its role in the pathogenesis of CMC (Noma2023Isolated).

Alterations in IL17RC expression are also implicated in thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (T-OPLL), a condition that can cause spinal stenosis. A specific mutation, rs199772854A, increases IL17RC expression, contributing to the development of T-OPLL by promoting bone formation in ligament tissue (Wang2019IL17RC).

## Interactions
IL17RC interacts with several proteins as part of the IL-17 signaling pathway. It forms a receptor complex with IL-17RA, which is essential for IL-17A and IL-17F signaling. This interaction is ligand-dependent and involves a glycosylated isoform of IL-17RA, although it does not require the cytoplasmic tail of IL-17RC (Ho2010IL17RC). The SEFIR domain within IL-17RC is crucial for signaling, but an additional sequence termed SEFEX is also necessary (Ho2010IL17RC).

IL17RC directly interacts with the adaptor protein Act1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is essential for linking IL-17RA to downstream signaling pathways like TRAF6 and NF-κB. This interaction is independent of IL-17RA and involves a phosphorylated isoform of Act1 (Ho2010IL17RC).

AnapC5, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex, also associates with IL17RC. It acts as an inhibitory regulator of IL-17 signaling by interacting with A20, a negative feedback regulator. AnapC5 binds to the SEFIR domain of IL17RC and the C-terminal domain of IL-17RA, suggesting its role in dampening IL-17-mediated signal transduction (Ho2013The).
