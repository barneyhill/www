# FER1L5

## Overview
FER1L5 is a gene that encodes the protein fer-1 like family member 5, which is part of the ferlin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in membrane fusion, repair, and intracellular trafficking processes. FER1L5 is distinguished by its multiple C2 domains, which are typically associated with phospholipid binding and membrane interactions, although its C2 domains may not bind calcium ions due to specific structural features (Dominguez2022Redefining). The protein is classified as a Type-I ferlin, containing a DysF domain, and is primarily localized within the cytoplasm, indicating a role in intracellular processes rather than direct membrane repair (Redpath2016Ferlins; Bulankina2020Functions). FER1L5 is expressed in the pancreas and undergoes alternative splicing, suggesting a specialized function in this tissue (Redpath2016Ferlins). It interacts with proteins involved in vesicle scission and actin cytoskeleton regulation, such as EHD1, EHD2, and GRAF1, which are crucial for muscle cell processes like myoblast fusion (Bulankina2020Functions; Lenhart2014GRAF1).

## Structure
The FER1L5 protein is part of the ferlin family, characterized by multiple C2 domains, which are approximately 130 residues long and typically form a β-sandwich structure (Dominguez2022Redefining). FER1L5 contains a C2A domain, but it lacks the capacity to bind Ca2+ due to having only one acidic residue in the Ca2+ binding region. It may, however, bind to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces due to a poly-basic region and hydrophobic residues (Dominguez2022Redefining). The C2B domain of FER1L5 lacks the typical Ca2+ binding motif but may have lipid-binding residues (Dominguez2022Redefining). The C2D domain has a unique loop 1 α-helix with hydrophobic residues for phospholipid membrane binding (Dominguez2022Redefining).

FER1L5 also includes a FerA domain, a four-helix bundle with a positive charge, similar to otoferlin (Harsini2018FerA). The A-B linker in FER1L5 is the shortest among human ferlins, with 42 amino acids, and models predict two α-helices in the linker, which are oppositely charged and electrostatically coupled (Dominguez2022Redefining). The protein is classified as a Type-I ferlin due to the presence of the DysF domain, which consists of two DysF domains with a complex topology (Dominguez2022Redefining; Bulankina2020Functions). There is no specific mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for FER1L5 in the provided context.

## Function
FER1L5 is a member of the ferlin family of proteins, which are involved in membrane fusion, repair, and intracellular trafficking. In healthy human cells, FER1L5 is predominantly localized within the cytoplasm and is not found at the plasma membrane, suggesting its role in intracellular processes rather than direct membrane repair (Redpath2016Ferlins). FER1L5 is expressed in the pancreas and undergoes alternative splicing, which affects its luminal domain, indicating a specialized function in this tissue (Redpath2016Ferlins).

Structurally, FER1L5 contains multiple C2 domains, which are typically involved in phospholipid binding and membrane interactions. However, its C2 domains may not bind calcium ions, unlike other ferlins, due to specific structural features (Dominguez2022Redefining). FER1L5 is implicated in vesicle trafficking and membrane-related processes, potentially mediating intracellular trafficking events necessary for myoblast fusion in muscle cells (Peulen2019Ferlin; Bulankina2020Functions). It interacts with proteins involved in vesicle scission and actin cytoskeleton regulation, such as EHD1, EHD2, and GRAF1, suggesting a role in the regulation of cellular cargo and vesicle dynamics (Bulankina2020Functions).

## Interactions
FER1L5, a member of the ferlin protein family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for muscle cell processes. It is known to bind with EHD1 and EHD2, which are dynamin-related ATPases involved in vesicle scission, suggesting a role in intracellular trafficking and myoblast fusion (Peulen2019Ferlin; Bulankina2020Functions). FER1L5 also interacts with GRAF1, a protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and membrane sculpting. This interaction is important for the recruitment of fusogenic proteins to the plasma membrane, facilitating myoblast fusion (Lenhart2014GRAF1).

The presence of an NPF motif in the C2B domain of FER1L5, similar to myoferlin, allows it to interact with EHD proteins, indicating a role in endocytic recycling and cytoskeleton reorganization during muscle differentiation (Peulen2019Ferlin). Despite these known interactions, the exact mechanisms and additional partners of FER1L5 remain to be fully elucidated, as its precise function and interactions are still under investigation (Dominguez2022Redefining).
