# RAB39B

## Overview
RAB39B is a gene that encodes a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, specifically the RAB39B protein, which plays a critical role in intracellular vesicular trafficking. This protein is predominantly expressed in neurons within the brain, including regions such as the hippocampus, neocortex, and substantia nigra, where it is essential for maintaining neuronal function and homeostasis (Koss2021Dysfunction; Tang2020RAB39B’s). As a GTPase, RAB39B is involved in endosomal trafficking, regulation of α-synuclein homeostasis, and synaptic activity, particularly through its influence on AMPA receptor subunit trafficking (Koss2021Dysfunction; Mignogna2015The). Additionally, RAB39B is implicated in autophagy, contributing to the formation of autophagosomes and regulation of autophagic flux, which are vital for cellular homeostasis (Koss2021Dysfunction; Niu2020RAB39B). Mutations in the RAB39B gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as X-linked intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and early-onset Parkinson's disease, underscoring its significance in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration (WoodburySmith2017Mutations; Tang2020RAB39B’s).

## Structure


## Function
RAB39B is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are pivotal in intracellular vesicular trafficking. This protein is highly expressed in brain neurons, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus, neocortex, and substantia nigra, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal function and homeostasis (Koss2021Dysfunction; Tang2020RAB39B’s). RAB39B is involved in endosomal trafficking, a process essential for the regulation of α-synuclein homeostasis, which is critical for preventing its aggregation and maintaining cellular health (Koss2021Dysfunction).

RAB39B also regulates the trafficking of AMPA receptor subunits, particularly GluA2, affecting synaptic activity and plasticity. This regulation is crucial for synaptic development and function, influencing postsynaptic currents and preventing excitotoxic events (Mignogna2015The; Tang2020RAB39B’s). The protein interacts with other cellular components, such as PICK1, to modulate these processes (Mignogna2015The).

In addition to its role in synaptic function, RAB39B is implicated in autophagy, where it is involved in the formation of autophagosomes and the regulation of autophagic flux, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Koss2021Dysfunction; Niu2020RAB39B). Its activity in these pathways underscores its importance in neuronal health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB39B gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), macrocephaly, and early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). These mutations often result in a loss of protein expression or functional impairment, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (WoodburySmith2017Mutations; Tang2020RAB39B’s). Specific mutations, such as T168K and G192R, have been linked to early-onset PD, characterized by movement disorders, Lewy body pathology, and loss of dopaminergic neurons (Tang2020RAB39B’s; Mata2015The).

RAB39B mutations can lead to disruptions in vesicular trafficking, affecting synaptic development and neuronal viability. This dysfunction is implicated in the aggregation of α-synuclein, a hallmark of Lewy body diseases (LBDs) like PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (Koss2021Dysfunction). The gene's role in regulating AMPA receptor subunit trafficking and synaptic activity further underscores its importance in maintaining neuronal function (Tang2020RAB39B’s).

Alterations in RAB39B expression or interactions can also lead to hyperactivation of signaling pathways, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders such as macrocephaly and ASD (Tang2020RAB39B’s). Despite the rarity of these mutations, their impact on neuronal processes highlights the critical role of RAB39B in neurological health (Koss2021Dysfunction).

## Interactions
RAB39B, a member of the RAB GTPase family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in intracellular vesicular trafficking. It interacts with the protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1), which is essential for the trafficking of the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is dependent on specific amino acids in the effector-binding region of RAB39B and the PDZ domain of PICK1, and is necessary for the proper trafficking and surface expression of GluA2, affecting synaptic AMPAR composition (Mignogna2015The).

RAB39B also interacts with the dynein/dynactin motor complex and myosin Va, which are involved in vesicle transport and trafficking (Mignogna2015The). It is associated with the regulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) homeostasis, a protein linked to Parkinson's disease, and interacts with Beclin 1, a component of the PI3K complex involved in autophagosome formation (Koss2021Dysfunction). Additionally, RAB39B forms a complex with C9orf72, WD repeat domain 41 (WDR41), and Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosome region candidate 8 (SMCR8), which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAB8 and RAB39B (Tang2020RAB39B’s).
