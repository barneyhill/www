# SNAP47

## Overview
SNAP47 is a gene that encodes the synaptosome-associated protein 47, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family. This protein is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and fusion processes, particularly within neuronal cells. Unlike other SNARE proteins, synaptosome-associated protein 47 is not directly involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis or neurotransmitter release but plays a significant role in the postsynaptic regions of neurons, especially in the regulation of AMPA receptor insertion during long-term potentiation (LTP) (MünsterWandowski2017Distinct). It interacts with various SNARE proteins and is localized to intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (Arora2017SNAP-25). Additionally, SNAP47 is implicated in viral capsid assembly during Coxsackievirus B3 infection, highlighting its diverse functional roles beyond synaptic transmission (Xiang2021SNAP47).

## Function
SNAP47 is a member of the SNARE protein family, which plays a crucial role in vesicle fusion processes within neurons. Unlike other SNAP proteins, SNAP47 is not directly involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis or neurotransmitter release. Instead, it is implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking and fusion events, particularly in the postsynaptic regions of neurons (MünsterWandowski2017Distinct). SNAP47 is found in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, with a significant presence in the dendritic spines of glutamatergic synapses, where it is involved in the fusion machinery required for regulated AMPA receptor insertion during long-term potentiation (LTP) (MünsterWandowski2017Distinct).

In the presynaptic terminals, SNAP47 is present at lower levels and may play a role in the vesicular exocytosis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (MünsterWandowski2017Distinct). It interacts with various SNARE proteins, such as VAMP-4, -7, and -8, and is localized to intracellular compartments like the endoplasmic reticulum and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (Arora2017SNAP-25). Despite its involvement in these processes, SNAP47 does not support synaptic transmission or cell viability in the absence of SNAP-25, indicating a distinct functional role within the SNARE family (Arora2017SNAP-25).

## Interactions
SNAP47, a member of the SNAP family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the autophagy-related protein ATG14, a relationship that plays a significant role in the maturation of the viral capsid protein VP1 during Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. This interaction is hypothesized to facilitate viral capsid assembly, enhancing VP1 conjugation, which is essential for CVB3 propagation (Xiang2021SNAP47). 

SNAP47 is also part of the SNARE complex, interacting with proteins such as Syntaxin-1A and Synaptobrevin-2. This interaction is important for synaptic transmission, as it leads to the formation of a ternary complex that precedes liposome fusion, indicating SNAP47's role in synaptic vesicle fusion (Sivakumar2024Synergistic). 

In the hippocampus, SNAP47 is localized in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, suggesting its involvement in receptor trafficking and synaptic function. It is found in postsynaptic elements like dendritic spines and presynaptically in mossy fiber boutons, indicating potential roles in receptor trafficking and vesicular exocytosis (MünsterWandowski2017Distinct).
