# SLC19A1

## Overview
The SLC19A1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 19 member 1 protein, a crucial component of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein is primarily responsible for the transport of folate across cell membranes, playing a vital role in maintaining folate homeostasis necessary for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation processes (Dang2022Moleculara; Alam2020Clinical). Structurally, the SLC19A1 protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices that facilitate its function as a folate transporter through an alternating access mechanism (Dang2022Molecular). Beyond its primary role in folate transport, SLC19A1 also interacts with cyclic dinucleotides, contributing to immune signaling pathways (Cordova2019SLC19A1). Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC19A1 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including increased risk of hepatotoxicity, immunodeficiency, and congenital heart defects, underscoring its significance in human health (Cwiklinska2020Polymorphisms; Gök2022Immunodeficiency; Hernandez2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
The SLC19A1 protein, a member of the solute carrier family, is integral to folate transport across cell membranes. It is composed of 591 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 65 kDa (Dang2022Molecular). The protein structure is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices, which are typical of its major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold. This fold consists of two distinct transmembrane bundles, TM1-6 and TM7-12, forming a central cavity where substrates bind (Dang2022Molecular).

The tertiary structure of SLC19A1 was elucidated using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing an inward-facing conformation with an open intracellular gate and a closed extracellular gate. This conformation is crucial for its function as a transporter (Dang2022Molecular). The substrate-binding site is formed by transmembrane segments TM1, 4, 7, and 10, with key residues such as Glu123, Thr49, Arg133, Tyr281, Arg373, and Gln377 playing significant roles in substrate recognition through hydrogen bonding and polar interactions (Dang2022Molecular).

The protein also exhibits hydrophobic interactions with residues like Ile68, Thr69, Leu72, and others, which aid in binding the pterin and p-aminobenzoyl groups of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (Dang2022Molecular). The structure of SLC19A1 is conserved across species, indicating a conserved mechanism of substrate recognition (Dang2022Molecular).

## Function
The SLC19A1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a folate transporter, crucial for the uptake of folate across cell membranes in human cells. This protein is primarily composed of 12 transmembrane helices and adopts a major facilitator superfamily fold, facilitating the transport of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), a form of folate, through an alternating access mechanism (Dang2022Moleculara). The transporter operates by cycling between inward-facing and outward-facing conformations, allowing it to carry substrates across the cell membrane (Dang2022Moleculara).

SLC19A1 plays a central role in maintaining folate homeostasis, which is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation processes. It is involved in one-carbon transfer biochemical reactions, crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Dang2022Moleculara). The transporter also functions as an antiporter, coupling folate intake with the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in the opposite direction, which may contribute to cellular metabolic regulation (Dang2022Moleculara).

The protein's activity is vital for normal cellular processes and development, impacting organismal health by supporting DNA/RNA synthesis and cellular methylation reactions (Alam2020Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC19A1 gene, which encodes the reduced folate carrier (RFC), have been associated with various clinical conditions. The SLC19A1 80 G>A polymorphism is linked to increased risk of hepatotoxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with high doses of methotrexate. The AA genotype of this polymorphism is associated with elevated methotrexate concentrations, leading to impaired liver function (Cwiklinska2020Polymorphisms). 

A novel pathogenic variant, c.1042G>A resulting in a p.G348R substitution, has been identified in association with immunodeficiency. This mutation impairs folate transport, affecting T cell proliferation and leading to symptoms such as low IgG levels and recurrent infections. Patients with this variant show resistance to methotrexate-induced apoptosis, indicating a functional defect in the transporter (Unal2022A; Gök2022Immunodeficiency).

The SLC19A1 gene has also been implicated in congenital heart defects (CHD) due to its role in folate metabolism. The G80A polymorphism, particularly the GA genotype, has been associated with an increased risk of CHD (Hernandez2024Comprehensive). Additionally, a homozygous deletion in SLC19A1 has been linked to recurrent severe megaloblastic anemia, highlighting its critical role in folate transport (Svaton2020A).

## Interactions
SLC19A1, also known as the reduced folate carrier, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is primarily recognized for its role as a folate transporter, where it forms a complex with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) within its central cavity, although this interaction does not induce significant conformational changes in the protein (Dang2022Molecular). SLC19A1 also interacts with cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), such as 2'3'-cGAMP, facilitating their uptake into cells. This interaction is specific and can be competitively inhibited by folic acid and sulfasalazine, indicating a shared transport pathway for folate and CDNs (Luteijn2019SLC19A1; Cordova2019SLC19A1).

The protein's role as a CDN transporter is crucial for activating the STING pathway, which is involved in immune responses. SLC19A1's ability to import CDNs like cGAMP and other bacterial CDNs highlights its importance in immune signaling (Cordova2019SLC19A1). Despite these interactions, specific details on SLC19A1's physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its transport functions are not extensively documented in the provided context.
