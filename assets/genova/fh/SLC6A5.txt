# SLC6A5

## Overview
The SLC6A5 gene encodes the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), a member of the solute carrier family 6, which is integral to the regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. GlyT2 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices and is primarily responsible for the reuptake of glycine from the synaptic cleft into presynaptic neurons. This process is crucial for maintaining low extracellular glycine levels, thereby modulating synaptic transmission and ensuring proper nervous system function (Rudnick2013The; Kristensen2011SLC6). The protein's function is facilitated by its structural features, including a central substrate binding site and sodium and chloride ion binding sites, which are essential for its neurotransmitter transport activity (BenitoMuñoz2018Modification). Mutations in SLC6A5 are associated with neurological disorders such as hyperekplexia, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining normal inhibitory neurotransmission (Rees2006Mutations; Pramod2013SLC6).

## Structure
The SLC6A5 gene encodes the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), a member of the solute carrier family 6. GlyT2 is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices, a common feature of the SLC6 family, with intracellular N- and C-termini (Pramod2013SLC6; Kristensen2011SLC6). The protein's structure includes a 5+5 inverted repeat fold, where two similar five-helix bundles (TM1-TM5 and TM6-TM10) are arranged in a pseudosymmetric inverted-repeat architecture (Kristensen2011SLC6). This structural motif is crucial for its function as a neurotransmitter transporter.

The central substrate binding site (S1) is formed by a four-helix bundle (TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8) and is lined with polar, aromatic, and aliphatic amino acid side chains. This site is divided into a polar region for the α-amino and α-carboxylate groups of substrates and a hydrophobic pocket for hydrophobic substrate side chains (Kristensen2011SLC6). GlyT2 also features sodium and chloride ion binding sites, which are essential for its function in neurotransmitter transport (BenitoMuñoz2018Modification).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, have been observed, with some mutations affecting the glycosylated forms of the protein (Eulenburg2006Mutations). These structural features are critical for GlyT2's role in glycine reuptake at inhibitory synapses.

## Function
The SLC6A5 gene encodes the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), which is crucial for the reuptake of glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, from the synaptic cleft into presynaptic neurons. This transporter operates using a co-transport mechanism that involves the movement of 3 Na+ ions and 1 Cl- ion per glycine molecule, allowing it to function with a high driving force (Rudnick2013The). GlyT2 is predominantly expressed in the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord, where it plays a vital role in maintaining low extracellular glycine levels, thus modulating synaptic transmission and ensuring proper nervous system function (Pramod2013SLC6; Rudnick2013The).

In healthy human cells, GlyT2's activity is essential for maintaining normal inhibitory neurotransmission. It regulates glycine concentrations, which are critical for the function of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors and as a co-agonist with glutamate at NMDA receptors (Rudnick2013The). The proper function of GlyT2 is necessary to prevent neurological disorders associated with glycine imbalance, such as hyperekplexia, a genetic disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle reflex (Pramod2013SLC6; Rudnick2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC6A5 gene, which encodes the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), are primarily associated with hyperekplexia, a neurological disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle response, hypertonia, and potentially life-threatening neonatal apnea episodes. These mutations can be missense, nonsense, or frameshift, leading to defective subcellular localization and decreased glycine uptake, which affects glycine and Na+ binding sites (Rees2006Mutations). The disorder is often inherited in a recessive pattern, with many cases showing compound heterozygosity (Rees2006Mutations).

In humans, SLC6A5 mutations result in a presynaptic form of hyperekplexia, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining proper inhibitory neurotransmission (Pramod2013SLC6). The condition can be confused with neonatal epilepsy but is distinguished by the patient's consciousness during attacks (Dafsari2019Novel). Some mutations in SLC6A5 are linked to a benign form of hyperekplexia, which may not require continuous pharmacotherapy (Dafsari2019Novel).

Additionally, polymorphisms in SLC6A5 have been nominally associated with schizophrenia, suggesting that the gene may contain a susceptibility locus for this disorder (Deng2008Association). This association is based on the role of glycine transporters in NMDA receptor function, which is implicated in schizophrenia (Deng2008Association).

## Interactions
The SLC6A5 gene encodes the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function and regulation. GlyT2 interacts with the chaperone protein calnexin (CNX), which assists in its proper folding and maturation. This interaction is influenced by the glycosylation status of GlyT2, as demonstrated by experiments showing that N-glycan-deficient mutants of GlyT2 have altered interactions with CNX (ArribasGonzález2013CalnexinAssisted).

GlyT2 is also regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligases LNX1 and LNX2, which modulate its ubiquitination, affecting its expression and activity. LNX1 interacts with GlyT2 through its PDZ2 domain, and this interaction promotes GlyT2 ubiquitination, targeting it for degradation. LNX2 similarly interacts with GlyT2, and its overexpression leads to increased ubiquitination and reduced GlyT2 expression (de2019E3).

Additionally, GlyT2's interaction with the coat-protein complex II component Sec24D is altered by the S512R mutation, which causes transporter misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing its surface expression (ArribasGonzález2015Molecular). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing GlyT2's function in glycinergic neurotransmission.
