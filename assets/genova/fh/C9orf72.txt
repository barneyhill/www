# C9orf72

## Overview
C9orf72 is a gene located on chromosome 9, which encodes a protein that is a subunit of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including autophagy and lysosomal pathways. The C9orf72 protein, characterized by a DENN domain, functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), interacting with various Rab GTPases to regulate membrane trafficking and autophagy (Diab2023Autophagy; Jiang2021The). Structurally, the protein forms a trimeric complex with SMCR8 and WDR41, which has been elucidated using cryo-electron microscopy (Nörpel2021Structure). Mutations in the C9orf72 gene, particularly hexanucleotide repeat expansions, are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), leading to neurodegenerative processes through the formation of toxic RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins (Todd2016Insights; Mackenzie2013The).

## Structure
The C9orf72 protein forms a trimeric complex with SMCR8 and WDR41, which has been studied using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal its detailed structure. The C9orf72 protein contains a DENN module characterized by a tripartite domain structure: the upstream DENN (uDenn) domain, the central DENN (cDenn) domain, and the downstream DENN (dDenn) domain. The uDenn domain adopts a longin-like fold, while the cDenn domain has a mixed α/β fold (Nörpel2021Structure). The C-terminal tail of C9orf72 is crucial for the dimerization of the complex, interacting with the DENN domain of SMCR8 (Tang2020CryoEM).

The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex resembles the FLCN-FNIP2 complex, suggesting potential GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity. The Arg147 residue of SMCR8 is critical for this GAP activity, particularly for Rab8a and Rab11a (Tang2020CryoEM; Su2020Structure). The coiled-coil region within the uDenn domain of SMCR8 serves as a potential interaction platform for other proteins, influencing the complex's activity (Nörpel2021Structure). The structure of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex is consistent with previous models, with some variations in the interaction surface between WDR41 and SMCR8 (Nörpel2021Structure).

## Function
The C9orf72 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in autophagy and lysosomal pathways. In healthy human cells, C9orf72 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for the degradation of cytoplasmic contents through autophagosomes and lysosomes. It interacts with RAB proteins, which are critical for endosomal and lysosomal trafficking, thereby regulating various steps in autophagy and lysosomal pathways (Diab2023Autophagy). C9orf72 forms a complex with SMCR8 and WDR41, which exhibits guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and interacts with the ULK1 complex, a key regulator of autophagy initiation (Diab2023Autophagy; Jiang2021The).

The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for small GTPases, including RAB8A and RAB11A, indicating its role in regulating the GTP-GDP cycle of these proteins (Jiang2021The). This complex is involved in nutrient sensing and lysosomal biogenesis, particularly during cellular starvation, where C9orf72 is recruited to lysosomes (Diab2023Autophagy). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in maintaining neuronal health, with dysfunction linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Maharjan2016C9ORF72).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C9orf72 gene, particularly the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion, are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Todd2016Insights; Mackenzie2013The; SimónSánchez2012The). These mutations lead to the formation of toxic RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins, which contribute to neurodegeneration by sequestering RNA-binding proteins and impairing RNA processing (Todd2016Insights; Gendron2017Disease). The repeat expansion is associated with the accumulation of TDP-43 protein in neuronal inclusions, a hallmark of both ALS and FTD (Todd2016Insights; Mackenzie2013The).

The clinical manifestations of C9orf72 mutations include muscle weakness, atrophy, cognitive and behavioral changes, and in some cases, parkinsonism (Boeve2012Characterization; Gendron2017Disease). The mutation is also linked to psychiatric presentations such as late-onset psychotic disorders, including mania and bipolar disorder (Ducharme2017Psychiatric). The C9orf72 repeat expansion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and shows incomplete penetrance, with some carriers remaining asymptomatic into old age (Patel2015Cognitive; Majounie2012Frequency). The mutation's prevalence varies across populations, being more common in individuals of European ancestry (Patel2015Cognitive; Majounie2012Frequency).

## Interactions
The C9orf72 protein forms a multiprotein complex with SMCR8, WDR41, and ATG101, playing a significant role in autophagy regulation. This complex interacts with the ULK1 complex, which is crucial for autophagy initiation, particularly under starvation conditions (Yang2016A). C9orf72 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAB39B, influencing membrane trafficking and autophagy (Yang2016A). The interaction with RAB39B is dependent on the DENN domain of C9orf72 (Yang2016A).

C9orf72 also interacts with other Rab GTPases, including RAB1, RAB5, RAB7, and RAB11, and functions as a GEF for RAB8A, impacting endocytosis and autophagy (Yang2016A). The C9orf72/SMCR8 complex is involved in the regulation of ULK1 and ATG13, with SMCR8 being necessary for the stable interaction with ULK1 (Yang2016A).

The C9orf72 protein has two isoforms, with the long isoform (C9-L) co-immunoprecipitating with SMCR8 and WDR41, indicating strong protein-protein interactions (Goodier2020C9orf72associated). The complex also interacts with the FIP200/Ulk1/ATG13/ATG101 complex, suggesting a role in autophagy initiation (Sullivan2016The).
