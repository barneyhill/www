# MAK16

## Overview
The MAK16 gene encodes the MAK16 homolog protein, which is a crucial component in cellular processes, particularly in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. The MAK16 homolog is categorized as a nucleolar protein, indicating its primary localization within the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits. This protein is highly conserved across eukaryotic species, underscoring its essential function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proliferation. Mutations or dysregulation of the MAK16 gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Qiu2020aarFDC).
