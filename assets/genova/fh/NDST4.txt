# NDST4

## Overview
NDST4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 4, which is involved in the biosynthesis and modification of heparan sulfate (HS), a critical glycosaminoglycan in various cellular processes. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase and is responsible for catalyzing the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues in HS chains, contributing to their structural diversity and functional specificity (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:). NDST4 is distinguished by its higher sulfotransferase activity compared to its deacetylation activity, setting it apart from other NDST isoforms (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:). The gene is located on chromosome 4q26 and has been implicated in colorectal cancer as a potential tumor suppressor, with its deletion associated with advanced cancer stages and poorer prognosis (Tzeng2013NDST4). Additionally, NDST4 has been linked to circulating resistin levels, although it does not directly regulate this hormone (Qi2012Genomewide). Despite these associations, NDST4 knockout mice develop normally, suggesting that its absence does not lead to overt pathological outcomes (Ouidja2022Variability).

## Function
NDST4 (N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 4) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis and modification of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan that plays a crucial role in various cellular functions, including cell signaling, adhesion, and growth factor regulation. NDST4 catalyzes the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues, which are essential steps in the modification of HS chains. This enzymatic activity contributes to the structural diversity and functional specificity of HS, impacting processes such as development, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:).

NDST4 is noted for having a higher sulfotransferase activity compared to its deacetylation activity, which distinguishes it from other NDST isoforms like NDST3. This suggests that NDST4 plays a significant role in determining the specific pattern of N-sulfation in HS, influencing the biological function of these chains (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of HS, affecting the overall sulfation patterns and, consequently, the biological activities of HS chains (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:). The expression levels and specific characteristics of NDST4 influence the extent and pattern of N-sulfation, which is crucial for the biological function of HS (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:).

## Clinical Significance
The NDST4 gene has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Located at chromosome 4q26, NDST4 is frequently deleted in CRC, with studies showing a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at this locus. This genetic loss is associated with advanced pathological stages and poorer overall survival in CRC patients, suggesting that NDST4 may play a significant role in colorectal tumorigenesis and could serve as a prognostic marker for CRC (Tzeng2013NDST4).

In addition to its role in cancer, NDST4 has been associated with circulating resistin levels, a hormone linked to insulin resistance and inflammation. A genome-wide association study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the NDST4 locus and resistin levels, although the gene is not known to directly regulate resistin (Qi2012Genomewide).

Despite these associations, NDST4 has not been linked to any specific human disease phenotype. Knockout mice for NDST4 develop normally, indicating that while the gene may have roles in certain conditions, its complete absence does not result in overt pathological outcomes (Ouidja2022Variability).
