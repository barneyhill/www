# CHRM5

## Overview
The CHRM5 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 5 (M5), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. As a member of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family, M5 is involved in modulating neurotransmitter release, particularly dopamine, and is implicated in various physiological processes, including reward processing and cerebral blood flow regulation. The receptor is predominantly expressed in dopamine-rich areas of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta, where it influences dopaminergic signaling pathways (Bender2018The; Zell2023Characterization). M5's interaction with intracellular proteins, such as AGAP1 and the AP-3 adaptor complex, is essential for its endocytic recycling and functional maintenance on the cell surface (Bendor2010AGAP1AP3dependent). The receptor's involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Foster2014M5Receptor; Anney2007Variation).

## Function
The CHRM5 gene encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. M5 is primarily expressed in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), regions critical for modulating dopamine (DA) signaling (Bender2018The; Zell2023Characterization). The receptor is coupled to Gq/11 proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase-C and mobilization of intracellular calcium, which is crucial for various cellular responses (Bender2018The).

M5 receptors play a significant role in dopamine release, particularly in the striatum, influencing neurocircuits related to reward processing and reinforcement mechanisms (Zell2023Characterization). They are also involved in the regulation of cerebral blood flow through acetylcholine-induced dilation of cerebral blood vessels, which is important for maintaining proper vascular tone and may have implications in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Bender2018The). The receptor's activation by cholinergic inputs can lead to increased striatal dopamine release, affecting dopaminergic function and potentially influencing behaviors related to addiction and neuropsychiatric disorders (Foster2014M5Receptor).

## Clinical Significance
The CHRM5 gene, encoding the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Alterations in CHRM5 expression or function are associated with substance dependence, particularly in the context of addiction. Studies have shown that M5 receptors play a significant role in the reinforcing properties of drugs such as cocaine and morphine. Mice lacking M5 receptors exhibit reduced self-administration of cocaine and diminished morphine-induced conditioned place preference, indicating a decreased reinforcing effect of these substances (Basile2002Deletion; Fink‐Jensen2003Role; Thomsen2005Reduced).

In humans, genetic variations in CHRM5, such as the rs7162140 polymorphism, have been linked to increased cigarette consumption and a higher risk of cannabis dependence, though no association with alcohol addiction has been found (Anney2007Variation). The M5 receptor's involvement in modulating dopaminergic pathways suggests its potential as a pharmacogenetic target for addiction treatment (Anney2007Variation).

Additionally, the M5 receptor is involved in mood disorders. Increased cholinergic tone in the ventral tegmental area, mediated by M5 receptors, has been associated with depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors in animal models, highlighting its potential role in mood regulation (Nunes2020Examining).

## Interactions
The CHRM5 gene encodes the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function. A significant interaction is with the AGAP1 protein and the AP-3 adaptor complex. This interaction is specific to the M5 subtype and is essential for the endocytic recycling of the receptor in neurons, a process necessary for maintaining receptor density on the cell surface after sustained stimulation (Bendor2010AGAP1AP3dependent). The interaction between the M5 receptor and AGAP1 occurs at the i3 loop of the receptor, with a specific 18-amino-acid region being critical for this binding (Bendor2010AGAP1AP3dependent). 

AGAP1 also interacts with the AP-3 complex, which is involved in the trafficking of M5 receptors, particularly in their endocytic recycling. This interaction is neuron-specific and is inhibited by the knockdown of the AP-3b2 subunit, indicating its role in the recycling pathway (Bendor2010AGAP1AP3dependent). The disruption of the AGAP1/M5 interaction leads to decreased dopamine release, highlighting its importance in dopaminergic signaling (Bendor2010AGAP1AP3dependent). These interactions suggest a novel receptor-recycling pathway that could be significant for G-protein-coupled receptor homeostasis and may offer therapeutic targets for treating dopaminergic dysfunction (Bendor2010AGAP1AP3dependent).
