# USP17L15

## Overview
USP17L15 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 15, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thereby rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L15 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions when dysregulated. Understanding the precise mechanisms and interactions of USP17L15 is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
