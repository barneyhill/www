# PIK3R6

## Overview
PIK3R6 is a gene that encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 6, a crucial component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit within the PI3Kγ complex, which is integral to various intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in immune cell function. As a regulatory subunit, it plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of the catalytic subunit p110γ, thereby influencing processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and survival. The protein is characterized by the presence of SH2 domains and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions and regulatory functions. PIK3R6 is activated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in the downstream signaling of Gβγ subunits, essential for immune responses and cellular signaling (DiLuoffo2021PI3K; De2019Targeting; Polivka2014Molecular).

## Structure
PIK3R6 encodes a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), which plays a crucial role in cell signaling. The protein structure of PIK3R6 includes SH2 domains, which are responsible for binding phosphorylated tyrosines. These domains are essential for the protein's role in signal transduction pathways. Additionally, PIK3R6 contains a coiled-coil domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are vital for its regulatory functions within the PI3Kγ complex.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are critical for the dynamic regulation of the protein's activity and its involvement in various signaling pathways. The presence of these domains and potential modifications highlights the complexity of PIK3R6's structure and its importance in cellular processes.

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PIK3R6 are not provided, the known domains and modifications suggest a sophisticated architecture that supports its regulatory role in PI3Kγ signaling pathways. The structural features of PIK3R6 underscore its significance in mediating cellular responses to external stimuli.

## Function
PIK3R6 encodes a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), which plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, PIK3R6 is involved in various molecular processes, particularly in immune cell function. It regulates cell migration, proliferation, and survival, which are crucial for the proper functioning of leukocytes. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and influences processes such as chemotaxis and inflammation, which are essential for immune responses (DiLuoffo2021PI3K; Polivka2014Molecular).

PI3Kγ, with its regulatory subunit encoded by PIK3R6, is activated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in the downstream signaling of Gβγ subunits. This activation is critical for the localization of the catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane in response to stimuli, facilitating the transduction of signals that regulate immune cell activities (De2019Targeting; Li2016Phosphoinositide). The regulatory subunit p87, encoded by PIK3R6, is associated with the p110γ catalytic subunit, highlighting its role in stabilizing and modulating the activity of PI3Kγ, thereby influencing signal propagation and cellular responses (Polivka2014Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The PIK3R6 gene encodes a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a significant role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Alterations in the expression of PIK3R6 have been implicated in the development of type II diabetes (T2D). In a study using db/db mice, a model for obesity-induced diabetes, PIK3R6 expression was found to be upregulated in liver tissues. This upregulation is thought to disturb the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, contributing to insulin resistance and the progression of T2D (Zhang2017Genomescale).

While the clinical significance of PIK3R6 mutations in cancer is not well-documented, the gene is part of the PI3K pathway, which is frequently altered in various cancers. The PI3K pathway's dysregulation is associated with increased tumor proliferation and survival, suggesting that PIK3R6 could potentially play a role in oncogenesis, although specific mutations in PIK3R6 have not been extensively studied in this context (Cristiane2013The; Visentin2020&lt; p&gt; Lights). Further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical implications of PIK3R6 in both metabolic and oncological diseases.

## Interactions
PIK3R6, also known as the p84 regulatory subunit, is a component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) complex. It interacts with the catalytic subunit p110γ, encoded by the PIK3CG gene, to form a functional PI3Kγ complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of PI3Kγ activity, particularly in response to signals from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Rathinaswamy2022Molecular; Nürnberg2019Function).

The p84 subunit, encoded by PIK3R6, does not directly bind Gβγ subunits, unlike the p101 subunit, which has a distinct Gβγ binding interface. Instead, the p110γ-p84 complex requires Ras for membrane localization and activation by Gβγ subunits (Rathinaswamy2022Molecular). The p84-p110γ complex is less stable compared to the p101-p110γ complex and can dissociate upon certain conditions, such as immunoprecipitation with anti-p110γ antibodies or when free p101 is present, leading to subunit exchange (Nürnberg2019Function).

In mast cells, the p84 subunit is essential for PI3Kγ-dependent responses, highlighting its unique role in cellular signaling pathways. This specificity allows for targeted modulation of PI3Kγ activity, which could have therapeutic implications (Jin2020PI3Kγ).
