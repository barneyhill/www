# CLIC5

## Overview
Chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) is a gene that encodes a member of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family of proteins, which are known for their ability to exist in both soluble and membrane-associated forms. The CLIC5 protein is primarily involved in ion channel activity and plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as ion balance and cytoskeletal organization. It is particularly significant in the structural integrity of microvilli and hair cell stereocilia, where it interacts with various cytoskeletal proteins to maintain cellular architecture. CLIC5 is expressed in several tissues, including the kidney and inner ear, where it is essential for normal auditory function and glomerulus formation. Mutations in the CLIC5 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as progressive hearing loss and kidney disorders, underscoring its importance in human health (Gagnon2006The; Berryman2000Identification; Seco2014Progressive).

## Structure
The human chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) protein is part of the CLIC family, known for its ability to transition between soluble and membrane-associated forms. The primary structure of CLIC5 includes a sequence of 251 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 28,113 Da (Berryman2000Identification). The secondary structure is characterized by a combination of alpha-helices and beta-strands, with a conserved arrangement of 10 alpha-helices and four beta-strands (Singh2010Two).

The tertiary structure of CLIC5 reveals a globular conformation, as determined by X-ray crystallography, and an elongated form, as shown by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Ferofontov2020Conserved). The protein contains a thioredoxin (TRX) domain and an α domain, connected by a short inter-domain linker (Ferofontov2020Conserved). The TRX domain is flexible, while the α domain demonstrates rigidity (Ferofontov2020Conserved).

CLIC5 can form dimers in solution through disulfide bridge formation, specifically involving the C165 residue, although this dimerization is not necessary for membrane interaction (Ferofontov2020Conserved). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue, which enhances its membrane interaction (Ferofontov2020Conserved). CLIC5 exists in two isoforms, CLIC5A and CLIC5B, resulting from alternative splicing (Wegner2010CLIC5A).

## Function
The CLIC5 gene encodes chloride intracellular channel protein 5, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes. CLIC5 is involved in ion channel activity, contributing to the regulation of ion balance and cell volume within the cytoplasm (Ott2023A). It is associated with the actin cytoskeleton, particularly in placental microvilli, where it interacts with proteins such as ezrin, α-actinin, and gelsolin, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization and stability (Berryman2000Identification). 

In the vertebrate kidney, CLIC5A is crucial for the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton during glomerulus formation, activating the small GTPase Rac1, which regulates Ezrin activity (Ott2023A). CLIC5 is also expressed at high levels in hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear, where it is essential for normal auditory function. It helps form or stabilize connections between the plasma membrane and the filamentous actin core, potentially involving the linkage of actin filaments with the plasma membrane (Gagnon2006The). 

CLIC5's role in maintaining the structural integrity of microvilli and hair cell stereocilia underscores its importance in cellular signaling and structural integrity in healthy human cells (Gagnon2006The; Berryman2000Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLIC5 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting hearing and balance. A homozygous nonsense mutation, c.96T>A (p.Cys32Ter), in CLIC5 is associated with progressive hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in humans. This mutation leads to autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment (arNSHI), characterized by hearing loss that begins in early childhood and progresses to severe or profound levels by the second decade of life. Vestibular areflexia and mild renal dysfunction have also been observed in affected individuals (Seco2014Progressive).

In mice, a mutation known as jitterbug (jbg) in the Clic5 gene results in impaired hearing and vestibular dysfunction due to a 97 bp intragenic deletion that causes exon 5 skipping, leading to a translational frame shift and premature stop codon. This mutation results in the absence of CLIC5 protein, causing dysmorphic stereocilia and progressive hair cell degeneration (Gagnon2006The).

Alterations in CLIC5 expression are also implicated in kidney disorders. CLIC5 is crucial for maintaining podocyte integrity in the kidney's filtration barrier. Mice lacking CLIC5 exhibit significant structural changes in podocytes, leading to microalbuminuria and increased susceptibility to glomerular injury (Pierchala2010Proteomic; Wegner2010CLIC5A).

## Interactions
CLIC5 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for cellular functions. In hair cell stereocilia, CLIC5 is part of a molecular complex with radixin (RDX), taperin (TPRN), and myosin VI (MYO6), stabilizing membrane-actin filament linkages. This complex is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of stereocilia, and CLIC5 deficiency leads to mislocalization of these proteins, affecting hair cell maturation (Salles2013CLIC5).

In podocytes, CLIC5 associates with the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) complex and podocalyxin, acting as a linker between actin filaments and the plasma membrane. This interaction is vital for maintaining podocyte structure and function, and CLIC5 deficiency results in decreased expression of these proteins, leading to podocyte abnormalities (Pierchala2010Proteomic).

CLIC5 also interacts with actin, ezrin, α-actinin, gelsolin, and IQGAP1 in placental microvilli, suggesting its role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (Berryman2000Identification). These interactions highlight CLIC5's role as a structural adapter rather than an ion channel, crucial for maintaining cellular architecture.
