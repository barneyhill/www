# PKD1L1

## Overview
The PKD1L1 gene encodes the protein polycystin 1 like 1, a member of the transient receptor potential channel family, which plays a pivotal role in vertebrate embryonic development, particularly in establishing left-right asymmetry. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple domains such as immunoglobulin-like PKD domains, a receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, and several transmembrane segments, which facilitate its function in cellular adhesion and signal transduction (Vetrini2016Biallelic; Yuasa2002The). PKD1L1 interacts with PKD2 to form a mechanosensory complex within cilia, essential for detecting nodal flow and activating the Nodal signaling cascade, a critical process for proper organ positioning (Field2011Pkd1l1; Kamura2011Pkd1l1). Mutations in PKD1L1 are linked to congenital conditions affecting the lymphatic and laterality systems, underscoring its clinical significance in developmental biology (Vetrini2016Biallelic; Whitchurch2024PKD1L1).

## Structure
The PKD1L1 protein, also known as polycystin-1L1, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) PKD domains, a small receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, a GPS domain, an LH2/PLAT domain, and 11 transmembrane domains (Vetrini2016Biallelic; Yuasa2002The). The GPS domain is particularly significant as it serves as an autoproteolytic cleavage site and is involved in receptor activation and signaling (Vetrini2016Biallelic). The C-terminal region of PKD1L1 includes a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its interaction with polycystin-2, forming complexes that are involved in sensing nodal flow and activating the Nodal signaling cascade (Vetrini2016Biallelic; Yuasa2002The).

PKD1L1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in smaller transcripts, PKD1L1a and PKD1L1b, which have seven and six transmembrane domains, respectively (Yuasa2002The). These spliced variants may regulate the abundance of the full-length transcript. The protein is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart and testis, and plays a role in left-right asymmetry during development (Vetrini2016Biallelic). The structure of PKD1L1 is evolutionarily conserved, with its domains contributing to its function in cellular adhesion, signal transduction, and calcium transport (Vetrini2016Biallelic; Yuasa2002The).

## Function
The PKD1L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in establishing left-right (L-R) asymmetry during vertebrate embryonic development. This protein is involved in the formation of complexes with PKD2 within cilia, which are essential for sensing nodal flow, a critical process for the activation of the Nodal signaling cascade on the left side of the embryo (Field2011Pkd1l1; Vetrini2016Biallelic). The PKD1L1 protein contains several domains, including two immunoglobulin-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains, a receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, a GPS motif, and 11 transmembrane segments, which suggest its involvement in cell adhesion and signal transduction (Yuasa2002The).

In healthy human cells, PKD1L1 is expressed in the heart and testis, indicating its potential role in these tissues (Yuasa2002The). The protein's interaction with PKD2 is necessary for its localization to cilia, where it functions as a mechanosensory channel, detecting fluid flow and contributing to the proper positioning and function of internal organs (Field2011Pkd1l1; Kamura2011Pkd1l1). This interaction is vital for the molecular mechanisms that underpin L-R asymmetry, a process conserved across many vertebrate species (Field2011Pkd1l1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PKD1L1 gene are associated with several congenital conditions, primarily affecting the lymphatic and laterality systems. PKD1L1 mutations have been implicated in congenital chylothorax (CCT), a condition characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural cavity. This can lead to fetal hydrops and potentially result in intrauterine or early postnatal death. The gene's role in CCT is supported by findings of ultrarare compound heterozygous variants in affected families, with mutations such as p.Gly515Arg and p.Asn288Thrfs*3 showing significant pathogenic impacts (Whitchurch2024PKD1L1).

PKD1L1 is also linked to laterality defects, which involve anomalies in the left-right asymmetry of internal organs. These defects can manifest as conditions like situs inversus and heterotaxy, often accompanied by complex congenital heart defects. Bi-allelic mutations in PKD1L1, such as the c.5072G>C mutation, disrupt critical protein structures, leading to impaired signaling and laterality defects (Vetrini2016Biallelic). The gene's interaction with PKD2, another gene involved in left-right patterning, further underscores its role in these developmental processes (Vetrini2016Biallelic).

## Interactions
PKD1L1 is known to physically interact with PKD2, forming a complex that is crucial for establishing left-right asymmetry during embryonic development. This interaction occurs within cilia, where PKD1L1 and PKD2 co-localize and function together to detect nodal flow, a process essential for proper left-right patterning (Field2011Pkd1l1; Kamura2011Pkd1l1). The interaction between PKD1L1 and PKD2 is facilitated by the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of PKD1L1, which is important for forming these complexes within cilia (Vetrini2016Biallelic).

The PKD1L1-PKD2 complex is involved in mechanosensation, where PKD1L1 mediates calcium signaling in response to fluid flow. This signaling is crucial for the activation of the Nodal signaling cascade, which is restricted to the left side of the embryo to ensure proper asymmetry (Grimes2016Genetic). Mutations in PKD1L1, such as the Pkd1l1 rks mutation, disrupt this interaction and impair the protein's ability to restore flow-induced calcium signaling, highlighting the critical role of PKD1L1 in this pathway (Grimes2016Genetic). These interactions underscore the importance of PKD1L1 in the genetic pathway of left-right determination, acting upstream of PKD2 and other related proteins (Grimes2016Genetic).
