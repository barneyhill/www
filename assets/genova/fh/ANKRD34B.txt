# ANKRD34B

## Overview
ANKRD34B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 34B protein, a cytosolic phosphoprotein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization. The ANKRD34B protein is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of normal renal tubular cells, indicating its potential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Serth2022AgeRelated). The gene is notable for its association with age-related DNA methylation patterns, particularly in kidney tissues, which may have implications for cancer risk susceptibility and the prediction of chronological age (Serth2022AgeRelated). The methylation status of ANKRD34B has been linked to renal cancer susceptibility, suggesting its significance as an epigenetic marker in disease contexts (Serth2022AgeRelated).

## Structure


## Function
The ANKRD34B gene encodes a cytosolic phosphoprotein that is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions. Proteins with ankyrin repeat domains, such as ANKRD34B, are known to participate in cellular functions including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, ANKRD34B is expressed in the cytoplasm, with notable immunopositivity in normal renal tubular cells (Serth2022AgeRelated).

The gene has been associated with age-related DNA methylation patterns in normal kidney tissue, which are significant for understanding cancer risk susceptibility. Specifically, the methylation of ANKRD34B correlates strongly with age, suggesting its potential role in predicting chronological age in normal kidney tissues (Serth2022AgeRelated). This age-dependent methylation may contribute to renal cancer susceptibility, as some normal tissues in high-risk groups exhibit increased methylation levels that are not solely explained by age (Serth2022AgeRelated).

While the precise molecular activities of ANKRD34B in healthy human cells are not fully documented, its involvement in these cellular processes suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD34B has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and DNA methylation patterns. The gene is associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where increased mRNA expression has been observed, although RCCs often lack immunopositivity signals for the ANKRD34B protein (Serth2022AgeRelated). The study by Serth et al. suggests that ANKRD34B may serve as an epigenetic cancer risk susceptibility locus, particularly in the context of RCC, due to age-related methylation changes at specific CpG sites (Serth2022AgeRelated). 

In addition to its role in RCC, ANKRD34B has been linked to prostate cancer, with high mRNA expression levels reported in this type of carcinoma (Serth2022AgeRelated). The gene's methylation patterns have been studied for their potential to predict cancer risk, with significant differences in methylation observed between normal tissues and those with high renal cancer risk (Serth2022AgeRelated). 

ANKRD34B has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease, although the specific mechanisms and implications of this association remain under investigation (Serth2022AgeRelated). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ANKRD34B in various diseases, particularly through its epigenetic modifications.
