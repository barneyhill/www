# UBE2L6

## Overview
UBE2L6 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L6, also known as UbcH8, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination pathway, a critical cellular process for protein degradation and regulation. As a member of the E2 enzyme family, UbcH8 is characterized by its R/β E2 fold in the catalytic domain, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, thereby influencing protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and immune responses (Kar2012Human; Serniwka2009The). Additionally, UBE2L6 is involved in ISGylation, a ubiquitin-like modification process, where it acts as an E2 enzyme for ISG15 conjugation, impacting protein stability and interactions, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms (TecalcoCruz2023Protein; Orfali2020Inhibition). The enzyme's activity is modulated by type I interferons and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular responses to environmental stimuli (TecalcoCruz2023Protein). UBE2L6's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance in health and disease, including its roles in metabolic disorders, cancer, and viral infections.

## Structure
The UBE2L6 gene encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L6, also known as UbcH8, which is involved in the ubiquitination pathway. The protein is characterized by a classic R/β E2 fold in its catalytic domain, typical of class I E2 enzymes, which lack a C-terminal extension and do not require a ubiquitin enzyme variant for function (Serniwka2009The). The structure of UbcH8 has been studied using NMR spectroscopy, revealing that it forms a stable complex with ubiquitin through a disulfide bond, mimicking the short-lived thiolester linkage (Serniwka2009The). 

The UbcH8 protein can exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with dimerization occurring in solution and potentially influencing its interactions with E1 and E3 enzymes (Kahraman2023Characterizing). This dimerization is concentration-dependent and may be relevant under physiological conditions due to molecular crowding (Kahraman2023Characterizing). The unique interaction site of ubiquitin on UbcH8 involves specific hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which are distinct from other E2-ubiquitin complexes, suggesting a specialized role in the ubiquitination pathway (Serniwka2009The).

## Function
UBE2L6 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation within cells. This enzyme functions as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating immune responses (Kar2012Human). UBE2L6 is also involved in ISGylation, a post-translational modification similar to ubiquitination, where it acts as an E2 enzyme for the conjugation of ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, to target proteins (TecalcoCruz2023Protein). This modification can influence protein stability and interactions, playing a role in protein quality control and potentially in defense against viral pathogens (Orfali2020Inhibition).

In healthy human cells, UBE2L6 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in these molecular processes. The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including type I interferons, which can induce its expression (TecalcoCruz2023Protein). Through its roles in ubiquitination and ISGylation, UBE2L6 contributes to the regulation of protein turnover and cellular responses to environmental stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
UBE2L6 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein ubiquitination and ISGylation. In obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), UBE2L6 is associated with increased inflammation and insulin resistance. It promotes M1 macrophage polarization through ISGylation of STAT1, contributing to the pathological remodeling of white adipose tissue (WAT) and exacerbating insulin resistance in obesity-related conditions (Li2023Ube2L6). Adipose-specific knockout of UBE2L6 in mice has shown to reduce diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders (Wei2021Adiposespecific).

In melanoma, UBE2L6 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the abundance of EZH2, a protein involved in tumorigenicity and metastasis. Overexpression of UBE2L6 leads to decreased EZH2 levels, reduced tumor formation, and fewer metastases, suggesting its role in inhibiting melanoma progression (KuserAbali2023UHRF1UBE2L6UBR4mediated; Abali2021EZH2). UBE2L6 expression is negatively regulated by UHRF1-mediated promoter methylation, which is associated with poor survival outcomes in melanoma patients (Abali2021EZH2; KuserAbali2023UHRF1UBE2L6UBR4mediated).

In breast cancer, UBE2L6 is involved in cell motility and invasion through its interaction with ISG15, affecting the ubiquitin-proteasome system and signal transduction pathways (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin).

## Interactions
UBE2L6, also known as UbcH8, is a human E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in the ubiquitination pathway. UBE2L6 interacts with ubiquitin through a thiolester linkage, a common feature among E2 enzymes, and forms a unique complex with ubiquitin that differs from other E2-ubiquitin complexes (Serniwka2009The). This unique interaction site may contribute to the specificity of UBE2L6 in the ubiquitination pathway, allowing it to interact with specific E3 ligases such as Parkin and E6AP, which dictate the subset of target proteins for ubiquitination (Serniwka2009The).

The UbcH8-Ub complex structure allows for the E1 enzyme to associate and transfer ubiquitin to the active-site cysteine (C85) on UbcH8 during ubiquitination, without interfering with E2-E3 association (Serniwka2009The). UBE2L6 also interacts with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D protein of Senecavirus A (SVA), promoting viral replication by stabilizing the 3D protein through ubiquitination (Li2020E2). This interaction involves specific residues, such as cysteine at position 86 in UBE2L6, which are crucial for the ubiquitination activity (Li2020E2). UBE2L6 is also involved in ISGylation, interacting with ISG15 and playing a role in leukemic cell differentiation (Orfali2020Inhibition).
