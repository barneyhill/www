# VPS54

## Overview
VPS54 is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is integral to the retrograde transport of vesicles from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The VPS54 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a coiled-coil motif and a five-α-helix bundle, which are essential for its role in vesicular trafficking and protein retrieval (Quenneville2006Domains; PérezVictoria2010Structural). As a component of the GARP complex, VPS54 is involved in the sorting and transport of lysosomal enzymes and other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular homeostasis and organization (PérezVictoria2008Requirement). Mutations in VPS54, such as the L967Q mutation, have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders and male infertility, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Wilkinson2021Vps54; PérezVictoria2010Structural).

## Structure
The VPS54 protein is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which plays a crucial role in retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. Structurally, VPS54 contains several conserved domains, including an N-terminal region with a predicted coiled-coil motif, which is essential for the assembly and partial stability of the GARP complex (Quenneville2006Domains). The C-terminal region of VPS54 is characterized by a five-α-helix bundle, similar to the D domain found in other tethering complex subunits like Tip20p and Cog2p (PérezVictoria2010Structural). This region is crucial for the protein's function in vesicular transport and is involved in the retrieval of proteins from early endosomes (Quenneville2006Domains).

The wobbler mouse mutation, L967Q, affects the stability and folding of the VPS54 protein by substituting a hydrophobic leucine with a hydrophilic glutamine, leading to reduced levels of the GARP complex and contributing to neurodegeneration (PérezVictoria2010Structural). The N-terminal domain is sufficient for forming a GARP core complex, while the C-terminal domain is necessary for recruitment to early endosomes (Quenneville2006Domains).

## Function
The VPS54 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is essential for retrograde vesicle transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in healthy human cells. This process is vital for the proper sorting and transport of proteins, including lysosomal enzymes like cathepsin D, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis and lysosomal function (PérezVictoria2008Requirement).

VPS54, as part of the GARP complex, plays a significant role in the cycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) between the TGN and endosomes, ensuring that lysosomal enzymes are correctly sorted and delivered to lysosomes. The depletion of VPS54 leads to the mis-sorting of these enzymes, resulting in their secretion and causing lysosomal swelling due to the accumulation of undegraded materials (PérezVictoria2008Requirement).

The GARP complex, including VPS54, is also involved in the retrograde transport of other proteins, such as TGN46 and the B subunit of Shiga toxin, indicating its broader role in retrograde cargo delivery to the TGN (PérezVictoria2008Requirement). VPS54 is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of the GARP complex, which is necessary for proper vesicle trafficking and cellular organization (Karlsson2013Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS54 gene, specifically the L967Q missense mutation, are associated with neurodegenerative disorders and male infertility in the wobbler mouse model. This mutation leads to motor neuron degeneration, a condition that serves as a model for human motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Wilkinson2021Vps54; PérezVictoria2010Structural). The mutation destabilizes the Vps54 protein, reducing its solubility and stability, which in turn affects the assembly and function of the GARP complex, crucial for vesicular trafficking (PérezVictoria2010Structural).

In addition to neurological effects, the L967Q mutation causes globozoospermia, a condition characterized by round-headed spermatozoa lacking an acrosome, leading to male infertility. This is due to the disruption of vesicular trafficking necessary for acrosome formation, resulting in defective spermatogenesis (Paiardi2011Failure). The mutation also leads to metabolic abnormalities and stress reactions in testicular tissue, further contributing to infertility (Jockusch2013Pathoproteomics). These findings highlight the critical role of VPS54 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential link to neurodegenerative and reproductive disorders.

## Interactions
VPS54 is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which also includes VPS51, VPS52, and VPS53. This complex is essential for retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). VPS54 interacts with the other GARP subunits to form a stable 1:1:1:1 complex, crucial for its function in vesicle trafficking (Conibear2003Vps51p; Conibear2000Vps52p). The stability of VPS54 is dependent on the presence of the other subunits, as the absence of any one leads to the degradation of the others, indicating their interdependence (Conibear2000Vps52p).

VPS54 also interacts with SNARE proteins, which are involved in vesicle fusion processes. The GARP complex, including VPS54, acts as an effector of the Rab protein Ypt6p and binds the N-terminal region of the TGN t-SNARE Tlg1p, suggesting its role as a tethering factor for vesicle fusion at the TGN (Conibear2003Vps51p). The C-terminal region of VPS54, particularly the D domain, is crucial for its function, although it is not necessary for the assembly of the GARP complex (PérezVictoria2010Structural). The L967Q mutation in VPS54 affects its stability and is linked to the wobbler mouse phenotype, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (PérezVictoria2010Structural).
