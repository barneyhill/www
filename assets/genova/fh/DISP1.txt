# DISP1

## Overview
The DISP1 gene encodes the dispatched RND transporter family member 1 protein, which is integral to the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a critical regulator of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. As a member of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) transporter family, DISP1 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices and two extracellular domains, which are involved in the transport and release of Hedgehog ligands, such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh), from producing cells. This protein's unique structure, including a sterol-sensing domain, facilitates its role in cholesterol metabolism and transport, distinguishing it from other RND family members (Li2021Structural; Chen2020Structure). The DISP1 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including cleavage by the Furin protease, which is essential for its activation and function in ligand release (Li2021Structural; Stewart2018Cleavage). Mutations in the DISP1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders such as holoprosencephaly, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Dubourg2016Mutational; Mouden2016Complex).

## Structure
The human DISP1 protein is a member of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) transporter family and plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Structurally, DISP1 contains 12 transmembrane helices and two extracellular domains (ECDs) that are in an open conformation, which is distinct from its structural homologues PTCH1 and NPC1, whose ECDs are closed (Chen2020Structure). The transmembrane domains include a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) formed by TMs 2-6, which is involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport (Chen2020Structure).

DISP1 has a ~170-residue N-terminal intracellular domain and a ~300-residue C-terminal intracellular domain (Chen2020Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including cleavage by the proprotein convertase Furin, which is necessary for the release of the Hedgehog ligand (Li2021Structural; Chen2020Structure). This cleavage results in two non-covalently associated fragments, facilitating the open conformation of the ECDs and enhancing ligand binding (Li2021Structural).

DISP1 also contains several sterol-binding sites within its transmembrane domains, occupied by molecules like cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), suggesting a transport-like function (Chen2020Structure). The protein's structure is characterized by internal two-fold pseudosymmetry typical of RND transporters (Li2021Structural). There are three DISP isoforms in humans, with DISP1 being the most studied (Chen2020Structure).

## Function
The DISP1 gene encodes the Dispatched-1 (DISP1) protein, which plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. DISP1 is responsible for the secretion of palmitate- and cholesterol-modified HH ligands from producing cells, facilitating their release into the extracellular space (Li2021Structural; Chen2020Structure). This process is vital for the formation of a gradient of the HH morphogen in tissues, influencing cell differentiation and growth during embryogenesis (Chen2020Structure).

DISP1 is a membrane protein that belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family of transporters, which typically transport small molecules. However, DISP1 uniquely transports the macromolecular Sonic hedgehog (Shh) ligand. This involves a proteolytic cleavage by the Furin protease, which activates DISP1 by opening its extracellular domain, allowing Shh binding and release (Li2021Structural; Stewart2018Cleavage). The interaction between DISP1 and Shh involves a pincer-like grasp, essential for Shh release, and is facilitated by Scube proteins, which help transfer Shh from the membrane to target cells (Li2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DISP1 gene are associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a developmental disorder characterized by the incomplete separation of the forebrain. DISP1 mutations can lead to both severe and mild forms of HPE, often in conjunction with mutations in other genes such as SHH, suggesting a polygenic or digenic inheritance pattern (Mouden2016Complex; Dubourg2018Recent). In particular, compound heterozygous mutations in DISP1 have been identified in patients with lobar HPE, indicating that DISP1 plays a significant role in the condition's pathogenesis (Dubourg2016Mutational).

DISP1 is crucial for the proper functioning of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is essential for brain development. Mutations in DISP1 can impair SHH signaling, leading to developmental abnormalities such as facial midline defects and neural tube patterning issues (Tian2008Mouse). The gene's involvement in intracellular trafficking and SHH signaling underscores its importance in maintaining normal developmental processes (Mouden2016Complex). The presence of DISP1 mutations in patients with milder forms of HPE suggests that additional genetic or environmental factors may influence the severity of the condition (Dubourg2018Recent).

## Interactions
DISP1 (dispatched RND transporter family member 1) is involved in several key interactions within the Hedgehog signaling pathway. It interacts with the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand, facilitating its release from the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the solubilization and subsequent signaling of Shh. DISP1 binds to the N-terminal fragment of Shh (SHH-N), and this binding is similar to the interaction between SHH-N and PTCH1, another protein in the Hedgehog pathway (Li2021Structural; Chen2020Structure).

The interaction between DISP1 and Shh involves two main interfaces, which are critical for Shh release. These interactions are facilitated by proteolytic cleavage of DISP1, which induces conformational changes necessary for effective Shh binding and release (Li2021Structural; Stewart2018Cleavage). The cleavage is mediated by the enzyme Furin, which is essential for DISP1's activation and function (Stewart2018Cleavage).

DISP1 also interacts with the extracellular glycoprotein Scube2, which enhances Shh shedding. Scube2 may transiently recognize an intermediate DISP1-Shh complex, assisting in the release of Shh (Li2021Structural; Ehring2024Twoway). These interactions highlight DISP1's role in the complex network of protein-protein interactions necessary for Hedgehog signaling.
