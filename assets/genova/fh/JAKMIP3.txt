# JAKMIP3

## Overview
JAKMIP3 (Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly those related to the cytoskeleton and signal transduction. The protein encoded by JAKMIP3 interacts with microtubules, playing a vital role in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport. This interaction is essential for the stability and organization of microtubules, which are key components of the cytoskeleton. Additionally, JAKMIP3 is implicated in modulating signaling pathways, influencing cellular communication and function, with potential impacts on immune responses and neuronal activities. The gene has been associated with various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Čiuladaitė2015Clinical; Mostafaei2018Identification).

## Function
JAKMIP3 (Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes related to the cytoskeleton and signal transduction. It interacts with microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton, influencing their stability and organization. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of cells and facilitating intracellular transport, which is vital for the proper functioning of cellular processes.

JAKMIP3 is also implicated in modulating signaling pathways, which can have broad implications for cellular communication and function. These pathways are essential for various cellular responses, including those related to immune function and neuronal activity. By influencing these pathways, JAKMIP3 may affect how cells respond to external stimuli and maintain homeostasis.

In healthy human cells, JAKMIP3's role in stabilizing microtubules and modulating signaling pathways suggests it is integral to maintaining normal cellular architecture and function. Its involvement in intracellular transport and signal transduction highlights its potential impact on organismal outcomes, particularly in immune responses and neuronal functions, where precise cellular communication and transport are critical.

## Clinical Significance
JAKMIP3 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In a study of a patient with a ring chromosome 10, a deletion in the 10q26.3 region, which includes JAKMIP3, was associated with neurodevelopmental delay. The study suggests that haploinsufficiency of JAKMIP3 could significantly contribute to the neurodevelopmental issues observed in the patient, as JAKMIP3 is involved in recruiting synaptic components and regulating signal transduction in the central nervous system (Čiuladaitė2015Clinical).

JAKMIP3 has also been identified as a novel gene associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A study using machine learning algorithms found that JAKMIP3 was differentially expressed in COPD patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for COPD diagnosis and prognosis (Mostafaei2018Identification).

In esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC), JAKMIP3 was identified in the context of genetic rearrangements, specifically in the 10q26.3 region, where it is listed as a gene with inner breakpoints. This suggests that alterations in JAKMIP3 may be involved in the genomic instability observed in ESCC (Hao2012Characterization).

## Interactions
JAKMIP3 (Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 3) has been identified as a host protein that interacts with the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Specifically, JAKMIP3 interacts with both the 5'-300 and 3'-203 RNA regions of the virus, suggesting a role in the viral life cycle or host response to infection (Verma2021RNAprotein). This interaction was identified using the RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID) assay, which combines liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) to identify host proteins that bind to viral RNA (Verma2021RNAprotein).

In addition to its interactions with viral RNA, JAKMIP3 has been associated with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence its plasma concentration. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified SNPs rs12714144 on chromosome 2 and rs1010553 on chromosome 3 as being associated with JAKMIP3 levels, although these studies focus on genetic associations rather than direct physical interactions (Teumer2019Genomewide). Despite these findings, specific interactions of JAKMIP3 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these contexts are not detailed in the available literature.
