# HAL

## Overview
The HAL gene encodes the enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase, a crucial component in the catabolism of the amino acid histidine. This enzyme, categorized as a lyase, facilitates the conversion of L-histidine into urocanic acid, initiating the histidine degradation pathway. Histidine ammonia-lyase is a homotetrameric enzyme with a unique structural feature, the electrophilic prosthetic group 4-methylidene-imidazol-5-one (MIO), which is essential for its catalytic activity. The enzyme is predominantly active in the liver and skin, where it plays a significant role in nitrogen metabolism and maintaining amino acid balance. Mutations in the HAL gene can lead to histidinemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated histidine levels, although it is generally benign. Additionally, alterations in HAL expression have been implicated in various health conditions, including cancer and coronary heart disease (Yamaguchi2017Bidirectional; Langer1995The; Langer2001MethylideneImidazolone).

## Structure
Histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL) is a homotetrameric enzyme with D2 symmetry, consisting of 509 amino acid residues per polypeptide chain. Each subunit of HAL is composed of two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain is globular, featuring eight helices and four short beta strands. The C-terminal domain contains a core of five long, nearly parallel alpha helices surrounded by six additional helices, a topology similar to other tetrameric enzymes like fumarase and aspartase, despite the lack of sequence homology (Langer2001MethylideneImidazolone).

A significant structural feature of HAL is the presence of the electrophilic prosthetic group 4-methylidene-imidazol-5-one (MIO), which is crucial for its catalytic activity. This group is formed from serine 143, a residue critical for the enzyme's function, as its mutation to alanine results in a nearly inactive enzyme. The MIO group enhances the enzyme's electrophilic properties by preventing delocalization of nitrogen lone pairs into the unsaturated carbonyl system (Langer2001MethylideneImidazolone).

The active site of HAL includes key residues such as Arg-283, which interacts with the substrate carboxylate group, and Glu-414, which acts as an active-site base (Langer2001MethylideneImidazolone).

## Function
The human gene HAL encodes the enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of histidine. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of L-histidine into urocanic acid, marking the first step in histidine degradation (Langer1995The; Poppe2005Friedel–Crafts‐Type). The reaction involves the elimination of ammonia from histidine, a process that is distinct from the transamination reactions typical of other amino acids (Poppe2005Friedel–Crafts‐Type). 

Histidine ammonia-lyase is essential for maintaining normal histidine metabolism, and its activity is necessary for the proper degradation of histidine in the body (Poppe2005Friedel–Crafts‐Type). The enzyme's function is critical in the liver and skin, where it contributes to nitrogen metabolism and helps maintain amino acid balance (Langer2001MethylideneImidazolone). 

In humans, defects in the HAL enzyme can lead to histidinemia, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of histidine in the blood, which can have potentially severe consequences (Poppe2005Friedel–Crafts‐Type). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its interaction with substrates and inhibitors, and it is influenced by factors such as pH and the presence of metal ions (Givot1969Studies).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HAL gene can lead to histidinemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of histidine in the blood and urine. This condition is typically benign, with most individuals showing no significant health issues or developmental delays. Studies have shown that there is no correlation between plasma histidine levels and intellectual performance, and a low histidine diet does not provide any apparent benefit (Lam1996Histidinaemia:). 

Histidinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder, and while it can be associated with symptoms such as hyperactivity, speech impediments, and developmental delays, these are not consistently observed across all affected individuals (Luu2013Differential). The HAL gene is located on chromosome 12q22-q24.1, and it is suggested that multiple mutations may cause histidinemia in humans, similar to phenylketonuria (Lam1996Histidinaemia:).

Alterations in HAL expression have also been linked to cancer. The HAL gene is negatively regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly in liver cancer cells. Variations in HAL expression have been associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancers and coronary heart disease (Yamaguchi2017Bidirectional).
