# ABCB9

## Overview
ABCB9 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 9 (TAPL), a transmembrane protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein functions as a lysosomal transporter, facilitating the ATP-dependent translocation of peptides from the cytosol into the lysosomal lumen. Structurally, TAPL is characterized as a 'half' transporter, comprising a single nucleotide-binding domain and a transmembrane domain with ten potential helices, forming homodimers essential for its transport activity (Kamakura2008Functional; Zhang2000Characterization). TAPL is predominantly localized in lysosomes and interacts with lysosomal membrane proteins such as LAMP-1 and LAMP-2B, which are crucial for its stability (Szakacs2020An; Graab2019Lysosomal). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with notable abundance in the central nervous system and testis, and plays a significant role in cellular peptide transport, although it does not participate in antigen presentation like other ABC transporters (Szakacs2020An; Zhao2008Peptide).

## Structure
The ABCB9 protein, also known as TAPL, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. It is characterized as a 'half' transporter, containing a single nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) with ten potential transmembrane helices (Kamakura2008Functional; Zhang2000Characterization). The protein is composed of 766 amino acids, with the N-terminal region containing four transmembrane helices (TMD0) crucial for lysosomal targeting, and the core region containing six transmembrane helices and the ABC region responsible for ATP-dependent peptide transport (Graab2019Lysosomal; Kamakura2008Functional).

The secondary structure of TMD0 includes five α-helical segments, with four longer helices inserted in the membrane (Bock2018Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, although specific details are not fully elucidated. The quaternary structure of ABCB9 involves the formation of homodimers, which are essential for its function as a transporter (Graab2019Lysosomal; Kamakura2008Functional).

ABCB9 is known to interact with lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2B, and its lysosomal targeting is influenced by conserved charged residues within TMD0, which form salt bridges essential for its release from the endoplasmic reticulum (Graab2019Lysosomal).

## Function
ABCB9, also known as ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 9, is a lysosomal ABC transporter involved in peptide transport within cells. It functions as a homodimeric complex that translocates peptides from the cytosol into the lumen of lysosomes, driven by ATP hydrolysis (Zhao2008Peptide; Wolters2005Selective). ABCB9 has a broad peptide specificity, capable of transporting peptides ranging from 6 to 59 amino acids, with a preference for positively charged and large hydrophobic residues at the termini (Szakacs2020An; Zhao2008Peptide).

The protein is primarily localized in lysosomes and interacts with lysosomal associated membrane proteins (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2B), which helps stabilize it against proteolytic degradation (Szakacs2020An). ABCB9 is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the central nervous system and testis, and is particularly abundant in Sertoli cells and the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (Szakacs2020An).

Despite its similarity to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), ABCB9 does not restore MHC I surface presentation of antigenic peptides in TAP-deficient cells, indicating a distinct role in peptide transport rather than broader immune functions (Szakacs2020An; Zhao2008Peptide).

## Clinical Significance
ABCB9 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to drug resistance and pregnancy-related conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), alterations in the expression of ABCB9 are associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. The microRNA miR-31 negatively regulates ABCB9 expression, leading to increased drug resistance by inhibiting cisplatin-induced apoptosis. This suggests that targeting miR-31 or modulating ABCB9 expression could be potential therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance in NSCLC (Dong2014MicroRNA31).

In the context of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), mutations in ABCB9 have been identified through whole-exome sequencing. Specific mutations, such as Glu386Lys and Ile339Val, were classified as probably damaging and were absent in control samples, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of ICP. These mutations were found to have a significant difference in minor allele frequency between cases and controls, suggesting a genetic predisposition linked to ABCB9 (Liu2021Wholeexome).

Overall, ABCB9's involvement in drug resistance and pregnancy-related liver conditions highlights its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
The ABCB9 protein, also known as TAPL, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the lysosomal system. TAPL interacts with lysosome-associated membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2B, which are its most abundant interaction partners. These interactions are crucial for stabilizing TAPL by preventing its lysosomal degradation, although they do not affect its subcellular localization or peptide transport activity (Demirel2012The). The interaction interface with LAMP proteins is located in the four-transmembrane helices of TAPL's N-terminal domain (TMD0) (Demirel2012The).

TAPL also interacts with the Yip1-interacting factor homolog B (YIF1B), a protein involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking. This interaction is mediated by a salt bridge between Asp-17 and Arg-57 within TAPL's TMD0, which is essential for TAPL's release from the ER (Graab2019Lysosomal). Although YIF1B is not essential for TAPL's lysosomal targeting, its interaction with TAPL affects the protein's localization and trafficking (Graab2019Lysosomal).

TAPL's interactions extend to MHC class II subunits, although these interactions are transient and less abundant compared to those with LAMP proteins (Demirel2012The).
