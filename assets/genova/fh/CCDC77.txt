# CCDC77

## Overview
CCDC77 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 77, which is characterized by its coiled-coil structural motif. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including those related to ciliary function, suggesting its potential role as a ciliary protein (Pir2023CilioGenics:). The expression of CCDC77 is notably elevated in certain cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Zhang2021Expression). Additionally, genetic studies have identified variants of CCDC77 that may confer a protective effect against nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in specific populations (Leslie2017Association). The diverse roles of CCDC77 in health and disease underscore its significance as a subject of ongoing research.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC77 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations are not well-documented. In the context of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), low-frequency variants in CCDC77 were identified in a Latin American subgroup, suggesting a potential protective effect against NSCL/P, as these variants were generally found at higher frequencies in controls (Leslie2017Association).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCDC77 is one of several coiled-coil domain containing genes that show significantly higher mRNA expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression levels of CCDC77, along with other CCDC family members, are associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. The study suggests that these genes may serve as potential prognostic markers, with high expression linked to increased cell cycle progression and a higher tumor mutational burden, particularly involving TP53 mutations (Zhang2021Expression).

Additionally, CCDC77 has been identified as a candidate ciliary protein, with potential implications in ciliopathies, although specific clinical associations in this context are not detailed (Pir2023CilioGenics:).
