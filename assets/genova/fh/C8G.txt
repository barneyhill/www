# C8G

## Overview
The C8G gene encodes the complement C8 gamma chain, a protein that is part of the human complement system, specifically involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). This protein is a member of the lipocalin family, characterized by its beta-barrel structure that facilitates the binding of small hydrophobic molecules (Kim2020Gamma). While the C8G protein is not essential for the assembly and activity of the MAC, it plays a significant role in immune defense by forming part of the C8 complex, which contributes to pathogen lysis (Kim2020Gamma). Additionally, C8G has been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, where it modulates microglial activation and interacts with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) to exert neuroprotective effects (Kim2020Gamma). The gene's involvement in both immune response and neuroinflammation underscores its potential clinical significance, particularly as a biomarker and therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases (Kim2020Gamma).

## Structure
The C8G gene encodes the gamma chain of complement component 8, which is part of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the immune system. The C8G protein is a member of the lipocalin protein family, characterized by a core beta-barrel structure that forms a calyx with a distinct binding pocket for small molecules or ligands (Kim2020Gamma). This structure is composed of eight antiparallel beta-strands, forming a beta-barrel with a hydrophobic binding pocket, similar to other lipocalins like β-lactoglobulin and retinol-binding protein (Haefliger1991Structural).

The primary structure of C8G includes a specific sequence of amino acids, with Cys40 playing a crucial role in forming a disulfide bond with C8α, stabilizing the interaction between these subunits (Haefliger1991Structural). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its function as a ligand-binding protein. In terms of quaternary structure, C8G associates with the alpha and beta chains of C8 to form the complete C8 complex, although it is not essential for MAC assembly and activity (Kim2020Gamma). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability.

## Function
The C8G gene encodes the gamma chain of complement component 8, which is part of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the complement system. This protein is involved in immune defense by forming pores in the membranes of pathogens, leading to cell lysis. C8G is one of three subunits of the eighth complement component (C8), but unlike C8A and C8B, it is not essential for the assembly and activity of the MAC (Kim2020Gamma).

C8G is a member of the lipocalin protein family, which is known for binding small hydrophobic ligands. It has been shown to incorporate retinol and retinoic acid, suggesting a potential role as a retinol-transporting protein in plasma (Haefliger1991Structural). Despite its structural similarity to other complement proteins involved in pore formation, the removal of C8G does not affect complement-mediated lysis, indicating a possible complement-independent function (Haefliger1991Structural).

In the context of neuroinflammation, C8G acts as an inhibitor by modulating microglial activation and interacting with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) to antagonize pro-inflammatory actions in microglia (Kim2020Gamma). This function is particularly relevant in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, where C8G has been shown to reduce disease severity (Kim2020Gamma).

## Clinical Significance
The C8G gene, encoding the gamma subunit of complement component 8, plays a significant role in neuroinflammation and has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in C8G expression are associated with neuroinflammatory conditions, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, where it is upregulated in reactive astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques. This upregulation correlates with disease progression and is observed in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (Kim2020Gamma).

C8G acts as a neuroinflammation inhibitor by modulating microglial activation and interacting with the S1PR2 receptor to inhibit pro-inflammatory pathways. This interaction reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (Kim2020Gamma). In experimental models, C8G administration has been shown to alleviate neuroinflammation and improve memory impairment, highlighting its neuroprotective effects (Kim2020Gamma).

Beyond Alzheimer's disease, C8G mutations are associated with recurrent Neisseria infections due to its role in the complement system, which is crucial for immune defense (Mayilyan2012Complement).

## Interactions
The C8G protein, or complement C8 gamma chain, is a component of the human complement system and participates in several protein interactions. It is part of the C8 protein complex, which includes the C8α and C8β subunits. C8G forms a noncovalent, equimolar complex with the C8α subunit, indicating a specific binding site on C8α for C8G. This interaction is maintained even when C8α is associated with C8β, suggesting a distinct domain on C8α that binds C8G with high affinity (Brickner1985Functional; Haefliger1991Structural).

C8G is also involved in interactions with the membrane-bound C5b-8' and C5b-(8')9 complexes, indicating that its binding site on C8α remains accessible in these complexes (Brickner1985Functional). The C8G subunit is covalently linked to C8α via a disulfide bond, which is not essential for their interaction, as they can still associate after the bond is broken (Haefliger1991Structural).

In addition to its role in the complement system, C8G interacts with the S1PR2 protein in microglia, where it inhibits pro-inflammatory microglial activation by antagonizing S1PR2. This interaction has neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease models (Kim2020Gamma).
