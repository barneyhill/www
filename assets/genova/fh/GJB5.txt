# GJB5

## Overview
The GJB5 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 5, also known as connexin 31.1 (Cx31.1), which is a member of the connexin family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are integral to the formation of gap junction channels that facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Connexin 31.1 is predominantly expressed in the skin and plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and coordinated cellular responses. Mutations in the GJB5 gene have been associated with various skin disorders and sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting its importance in normal physiological processes and its potential involvement in pathological conditions such as cancer (Alexandrino2009Connexin; Broghammer2004Reduced; Scatolini2022GJB5).

## Structure
The GJB5 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 5, also known as connexin 31.1 (Cx31.1). This protein is a member of the connexin family, characterized by its four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Beyer2018Gap; Premzl2019Comparative). Connexins, including Cx31.1, form hexameric assemblies called connexons or hemichannels, which facilitate intercellular communication by creating gap junction channels (bond2012functional; Premzl2019Comparative).

The primary structure of connexins is highly conserved, particularly in the transmembrane domains and extracellular loops, which contain cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds essential for gap junction formation (bond2012functional). The intracellular loop and C-terminal domain are more variable and are sites for post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence the protein's function and interactions (bond2012functional).

In terms of quaternary structure, connexons can be homomeric or heteromeric, and the gap junction channels they form can be homotypic or heterotypic, allowing for diverse functional properties (bond2012functional). The GJB5 gene is part of the β-connexin group, specifically within the CXNA gene cluster (Premzl2019Comparative).

## Function
The GJB5 gene encodes connexin 31.1, a protein that forms part of the gap junction channels facilitating direct intercellular communication. These channels allow the passage of ions, metabolic intermediates, and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and enabling coordinated cellular responses (Broghammer2004Reduced). Connexin 31.1 is predominantly expressed in the skin, where it contributes to the formation of gap junction channels composed of six connexin subunits, known as connexons. These connexons align with those from adjacent cells to form complete channels, allowing passive transport of molecules up to 1 kDa in size (Broghammer2004Reduced).

In addition to its role in the skin, connexin 31.1 is involved in the auditory system, where mutations in the GJB5 gene have been linked to sensorineural hearing loss and skin disorders (Alexandrino2009Connexin). The proper function of connexin 31.1 is essential for maintaining normal cell-cell communication, and its decreased expression is often observed in tumors, suggesting its involvement in preventing carcinogenesis by maintaining effective intercellular communication (Broghammer2004Reduced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GJB5 gene, which encodes the gap junction protein beta 5 (connexin 31.1), have been implicated in various skin disorders and conditions affecting cell communication. In melanoma, GJB5 expression is significantly downregulated in metastatic lesions and BRAF-mutated melanomas compared to wild-type, correlating with poorer patient prognosis. This downregulation is associated with increased metastatic potential, and GJB5 expression is influenced by aberrant BRAF signaling. Treatment targeting BRAF can restore GJB5 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in melanoma (Scatolini2022GJB5).

In the context of genetic disorders, mutations in connexin genes, including GJB5, are linked to skin conditions such as erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV) and sensorineural hearing loss. These mutations disrupt gap junction communication, crucial for epidermal differentiation and skin function, leading to clinical heterogeneity in conditions associated with connexin mutations (Alexandrino2009Connexin). The downregulation of connexins, including GJB5, is associated with increased metastatic potential in melanoma, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining gap junction integrity and its impact on disease progression (Scatolini2022GJB5).
