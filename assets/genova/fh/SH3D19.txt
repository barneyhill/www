# SH3D19

## Overview
SH3D19 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain containing 19 protein, also known as EBP or EEN-binding protein. This protein is characterized by its multiple Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. SH3D19 is particularly involved in the regulation of oncogenic RAS signaling, acting as an inhibitor to prevent cellular transformation and the activation of RAS-mediated transcription factors (Nguyen2006Identification). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with notable presence in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and placenta. Its interactions with proteins such as EEN and ADAM12 are essential for its function in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ligand shedding signaling pathways (Nguyen2006Identification). The gene's involvement in chromosomal translocations and mutations has been linked to several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Nguyen2006Identification; Luo2024Clinical).

## Function
The SH3D19 gene encodes a protein known as EBP or EEN-binding protein, which plays a significant role in regulating oncogenic RAS signaling. This protein is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and placenta, and lower levels in the brain, thymus, spleen, and leukocytes (Nguyen2006Identification). SH3D19 contains central proline-rich Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs and multiple tandem SH3 domains at the carboxyl-terminus, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as EEN and ADAM12. These interactions are crucial for its function in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ligand shedding signaling pathways (Nguyen2006Identification).

In healthy cells, SH3D19 acts as an inhibitor of oncogenic RAS, preventing cellular transformation and the activation of RAS-mediated transcription factors. This inhibitory function is compromised when SH3D19 is localized to the nucleus, a process that can occur through interactions with proteins like EEN or MLL-EEN fusion proteins, which are associated with certain leukemias (Nguyen2006Identification). The protein's role in inhibiting RAS signaling is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing oncogenic transformations.

## Clinical Significance
The SH3D19 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations and mutations. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SH3D19 is a translocation partner with RUNX1, forming a fusion transcript that may contribute to leukemogenesis by altering the RAS-oncogenic pathway. This fusion protein can lead to the nuclear recruitment of SH3D19, potentially up-regulating RAS-controlled transcription factors and affecting the RAS/MAP kinase pathways, which are crucial in leukemia development (Nguyen2006Identification).

SH3D19 mutations have also been observed in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), where they are present in over 25% of cases. These mutations are associated with pathways involved in T-cell receptor signaling and NF-κB activation, which are significant in the pathogenesis of ATLL (Luo2024Clinical).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), SH3D19 has been identified as a gene of interest due to de novo mutations found in control groups, suggesting a potential role in neurological conditions (Du2020Nonrandom).

Additionally, SH3D19 is involved in a tandem duplication affecting its exons, identified in a study on inborn errors of immunity, although the specific clinical implications of this alteration remain unclear (Wan2022Copy).

## Interactions
The SH3D19 protein, also known as EBP or EEN-binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions primarily through its Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. These domains facilitate interactions with proline-rich motifs in other proteins, enabling SH3D19 to participate in multiprotein complexes. SH3D19 interacts with the EEN protein, which is involved in a t(11;19) chromosomal translocation that produces the MLL-EEN fusion protein. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domains of both proteins (Nguyen2006Identification).

SH3D19 also interacts with ADAM12, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 protein, playing a role in the signaling of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ligand shedding (Nguyen2006Identification). Additionally, SH3D19 acts as an adaptor protein in the EEN-SH3D19-SOS2 complex, where it interacts with SOS2, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor of RAS. This interaction inhibits the RAS-oncogenic activity of SOS2, thereby modulating RAS signaling pathways (Nguyen2006Identification).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SH3D19 forms a fusion protein with RUNX1, retaining the RHD (Runt Homology Domain) of RUNX1. This fusion protein potentially recruits native SH3D19 to the nucleus, altering RAS-controlled transcription factors and contributing to leukemogenesis (Nguyen2006Identification).
