# KIF13B

## Overview
KIF13B is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 13B, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-3 family. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport, facilitating the movement of various cellular components along microtubules. Kinesin family member 13B is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an N-terminal motor domain, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal CAP-Gly domain, each contributing to its function in cellular transport and signaling (Venkateswarlu2005Centaurinα1; Tong2010Phosphorylationindependent). The protein is involved in critical processes such as the trafficking of receptors like VEGFR2 and LRP1, which are essential for angiogenesis and cholesterol regulation, respectively (Kanai2014KIF13B; Yamada2014KIF13B). Additionally, KIF13B's interactions with other proteins, such as centaurin-α1 and Nephrocystin-4, underscore its role in maintaining cellular organization and function (Venkateswarlu2005Centaurinα1; Schou2017KIF13B). Alterations in KIF13B expression or function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including myelination disorders and cancer metastasis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Waters2021KIF13Bmediated; Noseda2016Kif13b).

## Structure
KIF13B is a kinesin motor protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of KIF13B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form various functional domains, including an N-terminal motor domain, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a long coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal CAP-Gly domain (Venkateswarlu2005Centaurinα1; Tong2010Phosphorylationindependent). The motor domain is responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, while the CAP-Gly domain is crucial for binding to tyrosinated microtubules (Fan2023Control).

The secondary structure of KIF13B includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, particularly within the FHA domain, which adopts an 11-stranded β-fold structure (Tong2010Phosphorylationindependent). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, allowing for specific interactions with other proteins, such as centaurin-α1, through the FHA domain (Tong2010Phosphorylationindependent).

KIF13B functions as a dimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two protein subunits associate, facilitated by the coiled-coil domain (Tong2010Phosphorylationindependent). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Par1b/MARK2, regulate its activity and interactions, particularly influencing axon formation (Yoshimura2010Par1bMARK2). The protein also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may lead to distinct functional roles within the cell (Fan2023Control).

## Function
KIF13B is a kinesin-3 family motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the trafficking and localization of various receptors and proteins, including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). KIF13B facilitates the anterograde transport of VEGFR2 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, which is essential for proper receptor activation and function in endothelial cells. This process is critical for angiogenesis and endothelial cell functions such as migration and capillary network formation (Yamada2014KIF13B).

KIF13B also enhances the endocytosis of LRP1 by recruiting it to caveolae, specialized lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cholesterol and factor VIII levels in the body, as well as for efficient uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (Kanai2014KIF13B). Additionally, KIF13B is involved in the transport of PIP3-containing vesicles, which is important for regulating neuronal cell polarity (Mills2019LDL). These functions highlight KIF13B's significant role in maintaining cellular organization and function through its involvement in various signaling pathways and transport processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the KIF13B gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of myelination, KIF13B plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and activity of Dlg1, a negative regulator of myelination. Loss of KIF13B in Schwann cells leads to increased Dlg1 stability, resulting in hypomyelination due to enhanced negative regulation of AKT signaling. This suggests that disruptions in KIF13B expression could contribute to conditions involving myelin deficits (Noseda2016Kif13b).

KIF13B is also significant in pathological angiogenesis and cancer metastasis. It is essential for the trafficking of VEGFR2 to the plasma membrane of endothelial cells, a process crucial for VEGF-A-induced vascular leakage and angiogenesis. Inhibiting KIF13B-mediated VEGFR2 trafficking can reduce tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that alterations in KIF13B expression may impact cancer progression and vascular functions (Waters2021KIF13Bmediated).

In ciliary function, KIF13B is involved in establishing a CAV1-enriched microdomain at the ciliary transition zone, which is important for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Although no direct disease-causing mutations in KIF13B have been identified, its role in ciliary function suggests potential implications in ciliopathies (Schou2017KIF13B).

## Interactions
KIF13B interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It directly interacts with VEGFR2, a receptor crucial for angiogenesis, facilitating its transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in endothelial cells. This interaction is essential for VEGFR2 activation and subsequent angiogenic processes (Yamada2014KIF13B).

KIF13B also interacts with the ciliary transition zone protein Nephrocystin-4 (NPHP4) through its C2 domain and DUF region. This interaction is important for the localization of KIF13B to the centrosome and the establishment of a CAV1-enriched microdomain at the ciliary transition zone, which is crucial for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Schou2017KIF13B).

Additionally, KIF13B interacts with hDLG1, acting as an adaptor linking LRP1 with KIF13B. This interaction is mediated by the I3 domain of hDLG1 and the MBS domain of KIF13B, playing a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis (Mills2019LDL).

KIF13B also binds to centaurin-α1, a PIP3-binding protein, suggesting a role in ARF6 signaling and intracellular transport (Venkateswarlu2005Centaurinα1; Kanamarlapudi2005Centaurinα1).
