# KCNH7

## Overview
The KCNH7 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 7, also known as HERG3 or Kv11.3, which is a member of the ether-a-go-go-related (ERG) family of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability by controlling the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane. The KCNH7 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane segments and a pore-forming region, which are essential for its function in maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating electrical activity in neurons. Kv11.3 channels are predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with mood and cognition, and are involved in processes such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. The gene's involvement in these physiological processes highlights its significance in normal neuronal function and its potential implications in various neurological and psychiatric disorders (Strauss2014A; Matsuoka2020Kv11).

## Structure
The KCNH7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the subfamily H. This protein is characterized by its structure, which includes six transmembrane segments labeled S1 through S6. The pore-forming region is located between the S5 and S6 segments, which is a common feature among voltage-gated potassium channels. This structural arrangement is crucial for the protein's role in regulating electrical excitability in cells.

The KCNH7 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and activity. These modifications are important for the regulation of the channel's properties and its interaction with other cellular components. Additionally, the existence of splice variants can lead to different isoforms of the KCNH7 protein. These isoforms may have distinct functional properties, potentially altering the channel's behavior and its physiological roles. The diversity in isoforms allows for a range of functional adaptations, which can be critical in different cellular contexts.

## Function
The KCNH7 gene encodes the HERG3/Kv11.3 protein, a member of the ether-a-go-go-related (ERG) family of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels are crucial for regulating neuronal excitability by controlling the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane, which is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating the electrical activity of neurons (Strauss2014A). Kv11.3 channels are expressed throughout the mammalian brain, particularly in limbic and cortical areas associated with mood and cognition, and play a significant role in promoting resonance and oscillation of subthreshold membrane potentials (Strauss2014A; Matsuoka2020Kv11).

In healthy human cells, the Kv11.3 channels contribute to the repolarization phase of the action potential, influencing neuronal firing and signal transmission. This activity is vital for processes such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (Strauss2014A). The channels exhibit fast inactivation and recovery from inactivation, allowing them to evoke greater conductance by hyperpolarization from depolarized potentials, which is important for the frequency responses of neurons (Matsuoka2020Kv11). The KCNH7 gene's function in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function and its potential implications in mood disorders (Strauss2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNH7 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. A specific missense variant, c.1181G>A (p.Arg394His), has been associated with bipolar spectrum disorder, particularly in Amish families. This variant affects the electrophysiological properties of HERG3/Kv11.3 potassium channels, potentially increasing neuronal excitability and contributing to the disorder's pathophysiology (Strauss2014A). The same variant has been linked to a range of psychiatric conditions, including schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and major depression, suggesting pleiotropic effects (Strauss2014A).

In schizophrenia, polymorphisms in KCNH7, such as rs77699177 and rs2241240, have been associated with individual responses to risperidone treatment, indicating that genetic variations in KCNH7 may influence treatment efficacy (Wang2019Association). Additionally, KCNH7 has been identified as a potential target for seizure-modulating drugs in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, although its precise role in drug-resistant epilepsy remains largely unknown (Kjær2023Differential). The gene has also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder, with rare loss-of-function variants in KCNH7 being associated with the condition (Griswold2015Targeted).
