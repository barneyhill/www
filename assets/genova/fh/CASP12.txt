# CASP12

## Overview
The CASP12 gene encodes the protein caspase-12, which is a member of the inflammatory caspase subfamily involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. In most human populations, CASP12 is expressed as a pseudogene due to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein. However, a functional variant of the gene is present in some individuals of African descent, where it encodes a full-length protein. Caspase-12 functions as a negative regulator of the inflammasome, influencing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and modulating immune responses to infections. It interacts with key proteins such as RIG-I and caspase-1, affecting antiviral and inflammatory pathways. The presence of a functional CASP12 allele has been associated with increased susceptibility to severe sepsis, highlighting its clinical significance in inflammatory and infectious diseases (Hermel2011A; Saleh2004Differential; Yeretssian2009Gender).

## Function
The CASP12 gene encodes caspase-12, a member of the inflammatory caspase subfamily, which is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. In humans, caspase-12 is primarily expressed as a truncated, non-functional protein due to a premature stop codon, but a full-length variant exists in some individuals of African descent (Yeretssian2009Gender). Caspase-12 plays a role in modulating the immune response by negatively regulating inflammasome signaling, which affects the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Hermel2011A). It acts as a negative regulator of interleukin-1 production by modulating the activation of caspase-1, thereby interfering with the production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides involved in mucosal immunity (Hermel2011A).

Caspase-12 is also involved in the immune response to viral infections, such as West Nile Virus, by regulating the RIG-I signaling pathway, which is crucial for detecting viral RNA and facilitating the type I interferon response (Wang2010Caspase12). In the context of bacterial infections, caspase-12 suppresses the inflammasome, reducing cytokine production and affecting bacterial clearance (Yeretssian2009Gender). The expression of caspase-12 is modulated by estrogen, with higher expression in males, suggesting a gender-based difference in susceptibility to infections (Yeretssian2009Gender).

## Clinical Significance
The CASP12 gene, which encodes caspase-12, is primarily non-functional in most human populations due to mutations that introduce a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein. This loss of function is associated with increased resistance to severe sepsis, suggesting a selective advantage for the inactive form of the gene (Xue2006Spread). However, in some individuals of African descent, a functional allele of CASP12 is present, which has been linked to increased susceptibility to severe sepsis and higher mortality rates (Saleh2004Differential). This functional variant acts as a dominant-negative regulator of inflammatory caspase activation, potentially increasing the risk of sepsis by reducing the inflammatory response (Saleh2004Differential).

The presence of the functional CASP12 allele is also associated with decreased levels of inflammatory markers like CRP and IL-6, particularly in boys, although it does not confer protection against metabolic disease parameters such as BMI, fasting blood glucose, and insulin resistance (Skeldon2016Caspase12). The gene's role in modulating inflammation and immune response highlights its clinical significance, particularly in understanding susceptibility to sepsis and other inflammatory conditions (Hermel2011A).

## Interactions
Caspase-12 (CASP12) is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune and stress responses. CASP12 physically interacts with the viral RNA receptor RIG-I, specifically binding to its two CARD domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. This interaction is important for regulating RIG-I signaling through TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination, essential for antiviral responses (Wang2010Caspase12).

CASP12 also interacts with caspase-1, acting as a dominant-negative regulator by inhibiting its activity. This interaction affects the maturation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, which is crucial for modulating inflammatory responses (Saleh2006Enhanced). The interaction between CASP12 and caspase-1 does not require the protease function of CASP12, as a catalytically inactive mutant can still inhibit caspase-1 (Saleh2006Enhanced).

In the context of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CASP12 is processed by calpain and caspase enzymes, contributing to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Calpain and caspase-3/7 are involved in the proteolytic processing of CASP12, generating specific cleavage products that play a role in the ER stress pathway (Martinez2010Calpain).
