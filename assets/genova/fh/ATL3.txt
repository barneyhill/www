# ATL3

## Overview
ATL3 is a gene that encodes the protein atlastin GTPase 3, which is a member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases. This protein is primarily involved in the homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining the structural organization of the ER network. Atlastin GTPase 3 is characterized by its GTPase domain, middle domain, and two transmembrane domains, which contribute to its unique 'W' topology essential for membrane fusion (BetancourtSolis2018The). The protein's function is crucial for various cellular processes, including calcium storage, lipid synthesis, and protein export, particularly in neurons where it helps maintain ER morphology (Kornak2014Sensory; Behrendt2021Diseasecausing). Mutations in ATL3 have been linked to hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), highlighting its significance in neuronal health and disease (Kornak2014Sensory; Behrendt2021Diseasecausing).

## Structure
The human atlastin GTPase 3 (ATL3) protein is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a large GTPase domain, a middle domain, and two tandem transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form intramembrane hairpin loops. These loops do not span the phospholipid bilayer but are crucial for membrane fusion, contributing to the protein's 'W' topology, which is essential for its function in shaping endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (BetancourtSolis2018The).

The catalytic core fragment of ATL3, comprising the G and middle domains (residues 21-442), has been crystallized, revealing a novel active site organization. This structure shows a weak dimer interface between G domains and a unique arrangement where an intramolecular arginine residue (R109) displaces the canonical Mg2+ ion, forming a salt bridge with aspartate residue D142. This configuration is distinct from other atlastin isoforms and is crucial for the protein's GTPase activity (O’Donnell2017Timing).

ATL3's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is necessary for its function in membrane fusion. The protein is monomeric in nucleotide-free and GDP-bound states but forms dimers when bound to non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs (O’Donnell2017Timing).

## Function
The human gene ATL3 encodes atlastin GTPase 3, a protein crucial for the structural organization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in healthy cells. ATL3 is involved in the homotypic fusion of ER membranes, a process that connects ER tubules into networks. This is facilitated by the dimerization of the GTPase domains upon GTP binding, followed by GTP hydrolysis, which causes a conformational change that pulls opposing membranes together (Kornak2014Sensory). ATL3 is particularly enriched in three-way junctions of the ER, suggesting its role in the composition of the polygonal reticulum network. The protein contains a reticulon-domain that aids in membrane bending and stabilization, which is essential for various cellular processes, including calcium storage, lipid and glycan synthesis, and the biosynthesis of secretory membrane proteins (Kornak2014Sensory).

In neurons, ATL3 is crucial for maintaining ER morphology, which is vital for neuronal health. The ER extends throughout the axon, forming a tubular network involved in functions such as calcium storage, lipid synthesis, and protein export. It also makes extensive contact with other organelles to regulate their functions (Behrendt2021Diseasecausing). ATL3 is also implicated in ER-phagy, a selective autophagy process targeting ER fragments, where it acts as a receptor for tubular ER-phagy (Behrendt2021Diseasecausing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATL3 gene are associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), a condition characterized by axonal degeneration of sensory neurons. Specific mutations, such as p.Tyr192Cys (Y192C) and p.Pro338Arg (P338R), have been identified as causative factors for HSAN. These mutations lead to a loss of pain perception and destruction of the pedal skeleton due to their impact on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane dynamics (Kornak2014Sensory; Behrendt2021Diseasecausing). The mutated ATL3 proteins retain GTPase activity but fail to facilitate membrane fusion, resulting in aberrant ER membrane tethering and reduced binding to GABARAP, which affects ER-phagy (Krols2018SensoryNeuropathyCausing; Behrendt2021Diseasecausing).

The Y192C mutation specifically disrupts ER morphology, delays ER export, reduces autophagy, and fragments the Golgi apparatus, contributing to axonal growth deficits and sensory neuron degeneration (Behrendt2019A). These mutations are described as having a dominant-negative effect, severely affecting ER structure and function, which is consistent with their pathogenic role in HSAN (Kornak2014Sensory). The clinical manifestations of these mutations include sensory disturbances, neuropathic pain, and recurrent ulcerations, often leading to severe complications such as bone destruction and amputation (Cintra2021Rare; Kornak2014Sensory).

## Interactions
ATL3 (atlastin GTPase 3) is known for its specific interactions with proteins from the GABARAP subfamily, which are part of the ATG8 family involved in autophagy. ATL3 binds directly to GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2 through two conserved GABARAP interaction motifs (GIMs) located in its N-terminal cytosolic domain. These interactions are crucial for ATL3's role as a receptor in ER-phagy, a selective autophagy process targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (Chen2019ATL3).

Mutations in ATL3, such as Y192C and P338R, disrupt its binding to GABARAP, impairing its function in ER-phagy and contributing to conditions like hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). These mutations affect the protein's ability to maintain the ER network, particularly in axonal regions, and lead to reduced axonal autophagy (Chen2019ATL3; Behrendt2021Diseasecausing).

The interaction between ATL3 and GABARAP is selective, as ATL3 does not bind to LC3 proteins, another subfamily within the ATG8 family. This selectivity is attributed to differences in conserved residues between GABARAP and LC3, with specific residues like Y25 in GABARAP being crucial for binding (Chen2019ATL3).
