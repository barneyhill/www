# SESN2

## Overview
SESN2 is a gene that encodes the protein sestrin 2, which is a stress-inducible protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of oxidative stress, autophagy, and energy metabolism. Sestrin 2 is categorized as an oxidoreductase due to its role in reducing oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its two main domains: the N-terminal domain, which contains an oxidoreductase region, and the C-terminal domain, which is involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. SESN2 plays a critical role in cellular stress responses by interacting with key signaling pathways, such as the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the Keap1/Nrf2 pathways, thereby influencing cell survival and adaptation to stress (Kim2021Sestrins; Chen2022The).

## Structure
The SESN2 protein is composed of 480 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa (Dalina2018Sestrins). Its structure is characterized by two main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by a helix-loop-helix linker (Lu2023Sestrin2:). The NTD, spanning residues 66-220, contains an oxidoreductase region with a conserved cysteine residue (Cys125) crucial for its antioxidant function (Lu2023Sestrin2:; Dalina2018Sestrins). This domain is structurally similar to the bacterial alkylhydroperoxide reductase AhpD, featuring a helix-turn-helix oxidoreductase motif (Kim2015Janusfaced).

The CTD, covering residues 339-480, includes a leucine-binding site and is involved in mTORC1 signaling regulation through interaction with the GATOR2 complex (Lu2023Sestrin2:; Dalina2018Sestrins). Key residues in the CTD, such as Asp406 and Asp407, are essential for its role in mTORC1 inhibition (Kim2015Janusfaced). SESN2 is a monomeric protein, as indicated by its crystal structure and size-exclusion chromatography analysis (Kim2015Janusfaced). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including sulfenylation of Cys125, which is part of its peroxidase activity (Kim2015Janusfaced).

## Function
SESN2 (sestrin 2) is a stress-inducible protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in several molecular processes, including the regulation of oxidative stress, autophagy, and energy metabolism. SESN2 reduces oxidative stress by promoting the activity of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, which enhances the cellular antioxidant defense system (Kim2021Sestrins). It also interacts with Keap1, facilitating its autophagic degradation and releasing Nrf2 for nuclear transcriptional activation (Kim2021Sestrins).

SESN2 is a key regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and metabolism. It inhibits mTORC1 activity by interacting with the GATOR2 complex, thereby modulating the interactions between GATOR1 and GATOR2 subcomplexes (Kim2015Sestrin2). This inhibition is important for promoting autophagy, a cellular process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis by degrading and recycling cellular components (Pan2021Sestrin2).

SESN2 also activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which helps conserve energy and regulate protein synthesis, especially under conditions of nutrient starvation (Chen2022The). This activity is crucial for cell survival and adaptation to stress, highlighting SESN2's role in maintaining metabolic balance and protecting cells from damage (Ding2016Sestrin2). SESN2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it exerts its effects on cellular metabolism and stress response pathways (Kim2021Sestrins).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in SESN2 expression and function have been implicated in various diseases. In glioma, SESN2 expression is significantly increased and is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in cases with IDH mutations and 1p/19q non-codeletion status. High SESN2 expression correlates with worse outcomes in older patients and those with high-grade gliomas, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in glioma (Xu2023SESN2).

In congenital heart defects (CHD), the SNP rs492554 within the SESN2 gene is associated with reduced CHD risk, particularly in high-altitude populations. This variant is linked to higher SESN2 expression and preferential binding to transcription factors, suggesting a regulatory role in SESN2 expression that may influence CHD susceptibility (Yang2021A).

SESN2 also plays a dual role in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a facilitator of cancer cell survival under certain conditions. In colon adenocarcinoma, decreased SESN2 levels promote tumor growth, while high expression inhibits growth by suppressing mTORC1 and ER stress (Pan2021Sestrin2).

SESN2's involvement in oxidative stress regulation and its interaction with pathways like NRF2 and AMPK/mTOR are crucial in diseases such as hypoxia-related conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (Pan2021Sestrin2).

## Interactions
SESN2 interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation. It is known to interact with the GATOR2 complex, which is involved in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling. This interaction prevents GATOR2 from inhibiting the GATOR1 complex, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 activation (Budanov2020Mitochondrial; Kim2015Sestrin2). SESN2 also interacts with p62, a ubiquitin-binding receptor, to facilitate mitophagy by promoting the phosphorylation of p62 at Ser403, which is necessary for autophagosome enclosure of mitochondria (Yang2021SESN2).

SESN2 is involved in the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway, enhancing Nrf2 transcriptional activity to upregulate antioxidant genes (Lu2023Sestrin2:). It also interacts with ULK1, a key autophagy regulator, to promote mitophagy and autophagy, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lu2023Sestrin2:). SESN2's interaction with TRAF6 and p62 is crucial for osteoclastogenesis, as it facilitates the formation of TRAF6-p62 complexes necessary for normal osteoclast differentiation (Oh2021Sestrin2). These interactions highlight SESN2's multifaceted role in cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation.
