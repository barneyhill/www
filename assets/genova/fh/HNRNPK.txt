# HNRNPK

## Overview
The HNRNPK gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Located on chromosome 9 in humans, hnRNP K is characterized by its ability to bind nucleic acids through its three K-homology (KH) domains, which are essential for recognizing RNA and single-stranded DNA. As a scaffold protein, hnRNP K interacts with numerous proteins and nucleic acids, integrating signaling pathways with nucleic acid-related processes. It is involved in critical cellular functions such as mRNA stability, splicing, and translation, and acts as a transcriptional co-activator, notably in p53-dependent pathways. Clinically, mutations in HNRNPK are linked to developmental disorders like Au-Kline syndrome and hematologic malignancies, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Braems2022HNRNPK; Gallardo2015hnRNP; Mahale2022HnRNPK).

## Structure
The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is a nucleic acid-binding protein encoded by the HNRNPK gene located on chromosome 9 in humans. It is characterized by its modular structure, which includes three K-homology (KH) domains that are crucial for RNA and single-stranded DNA recognition. These KH domains are approximately 65-70 amino acids long and are highly conserved across species. The KH domain structure includes a beta-sheet composed of three antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices, with two unstructured surface loops responsible for nucleic acid binding specificity (Weighardt1996The; Barboro2014Emerging).

HnRNP K also contains a nuclear-localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear shuttling domain (KNS), which facilitate its transport between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Positioned between the KH2 and KH3 domains is an unstructured region called the K-protein-interactive (KI) domain, which mediates interactions with other proteins (Poenisch2015Identification; Barboro2014Emerging).

The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including methylation, sumoylation, and phosphorylation, which regulate its interactions and functions. Methylation occurs on specific arginine residues, influencing intracellular distribution and interaction with other proteins (Barboro2014Emerging). HnRNP K exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, with isoforms 1 and 2 differing slightly at the C-terminus, and isoforms 3 and 4 lacking amino acids 111-134 (Barboro2014Emerging).

## Function
The HNRNPK gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, hnRNP K plays a critical role in RNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. It acts as a transcriptional co-activator, particularly in the activation of p53-dependent p21 expression, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression (Gallardo2015hnRNP). 

HnRNP K is also involved in maintaining RNA in a single-stranded form, preventing the formation of double-stranded RNA, which is important for the stability and localization of certain oncogenic transcripts like IER3 and IER3-AS1 (Mahale2022HnRNPK). This function is essential for regulating RNA-RNA interactions and maintaining normal cellular functions (Mahale2022HnRNPK).

In addition to its role in RNA metabolism, hnRNP K is implicated in DNA damage repair processes, helping to maintain genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA damage (Braems2022HNRNPK). The protein is primarily located in the nucleus but can shuttle to the cytoplasm, impacting various cellular responses and developmental processes (Geuens2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HNRNPK gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Au-Kline syndrome (AKS) is a developmental disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in HNRNPK. It is characterized by intellectual disability, distinct facial features, skeletal and connective tissue anomalies, craniosynostosis, congenital heart malformations, and renal anomalies (Au2018Phenotypic). A novel de novo missense variant in HNRNPK has been identified in a patient with AKS, which reduces RNA binding affinity and destabilizes the protein, suggesting a loss of function (Pan2022Case).

HNRNPK also plays a role in hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Deletions in the 9q21.32 locus, where HNRNPK is located, are recurrent in AML, indicating that HNRNPK acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of HNRNPK in AML patients leads to significant hematologic and malignant phenotypes, including aberrant expression of p21 and C/EBP, and activation of Stat3 (Gallardo2015hnRNP). HNRNPK's involvement in cancer is further supported by its role in regulating proliferation and differentiation programs, with its loss leading to deregulation of these pathways (Gallardo2015hnRNP).

## Interactions
HNRNPK interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms multiprotein complexes and interacts with scaffold proteins, such as the SH3 domain of the Grb2 adapter protein, which is crucial for signal transduction pathways (Mikula2006Landscape). HNRNPK also interacts with the chromatin remodeling factor Eed, part of the Polycomb Group complex, and DNA-methyltransferases, indicating its involvement in chromatin dynamics (Mikula2006Landscape).

HNRNPK is known to interact with the exonuclease XRN2, facilitating its recruitment to transcription sites, which is essential for transcription termination and RNA processing at the EGR1 gene (Mikula2013Heterogeneous). This interaction is RNA-independent, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction (Mikula2013Heterogeneous).

The protein also interacts with c-Src, a tyrosine kinase, through proline-rich motifs, which are necessary for c-Src activation. This interaction is distinct from the binding site, indicating separate domains for binding and activation (Adolph2007Deciphering). HNRNPK's interactions with these proteins highlight its role as a scaffold protein, integrating various signaling pathways with nucleic acid-related processes.
