# IFNG

## Overview
The IFNG gene encodes the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a critical component of the immune system with significant roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. IFN-γ is a type II interferon and functions as a homodimeric glycoprotein, primarily produced by T helper 1 (Th1) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. It is instrumental in activating macrophages and enhancing their pathogen-killing capabilities, as well as in promoting antigen presentation by upregulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The IFNG gene's product, IFN-γ, interacts with its receptor complex to initiate a signaling cascade involving Janus kinases (JAK1 and JAK2) and the transcription factor STAT1, which regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in immune responses (Kak2018Interferon-gamma; Tau1999Biologic). Dysregulation of IFNG or its signaling pathway is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Liu2022IFNγ; Jouanguy1997Partial).

## Structure
The IFNG gene encodes the human interferon gamma (hIFNγ) protein, a symmetrical homodimeric glycoprotein with a molecular size of approximately 38.8 kDa in its dimeric form. The precursor of native hIFNγ consists of 166 amino acids, including a 23-residue secretory signal peptide at the N-terminal, resulting in a mature protein with 143 amino acids (Razaghi2016Review). The protein's secondary structure is characterized by six α helices in each monomer. Four helices (A, B, C, and D) from one subunit and two from the other (E' and F') interact to form two distinct, symmetrical domains separated by a V-shaped cleft. A large random coil-structured surface loop connects the N-terminal helices A and B, which are crucial for the protein's unfolding pathway and thermodynamic stability, as well as for receptor-ligand interactions (Razaghi2016Review).

The quaternary structure involves the interaction of two monomers to form the functional dimeric protein. The protein has two glycosylation sites, which are important for its stability and protection from proteolytic degradation (Razaghi2016Review). The C-terminal is highly variable, and its truncation affects the protein's solubility and biological activity (Razaghi2016Review).

## Function
The IFNG gene encodes interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine crucial for both innate and adaptive immunity. IFN-γ is primarily produced by T helper 1 (Th1) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a pivotal role in the activation of macrophages, enhancing their ability to eliminate intracellular pathogens through mechanisms such as granuloma formation and the production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (Tau1999Biologic). IFN-γ also promotes the differentiation of Th1 cells, which are essential for eradicating intracellular pathogens (Hatton2006A).

In addition to its role in macrophage activation, IFN-γ enhances antigen presentation by upregulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, thereby improving the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to infected or malignant cells (Tau1999Biologic). It orchestrates the activation of the innate immune system and regulates the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses, which is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis (Tau1999Biologic).

IFN-γ signaling is mediated through its receptor complex, which involves the activation of JAK1 and JAK2 kinases, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1. This transcription factor then translocates to the nucleus to regulate the expression of over 200 genes, modulating diverse biological functions (Tau1999Biologic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the IFNG gene, which encodes interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), are associated with several diseases and conditions. Genetic mutations affecting the IFN-γ signaling pathway, particularly in the IFN-γ receptor components IFNγR1 and IFNγR2, can lead to increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. Complete deficiencies in these receptors result in severe and often fatal infections from mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium bovis (BCG strain) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (Newport1996A; Jouanguy1997Partial). Partial deficiencies, such as the I87T mutation in IFNgR1, allow some residual immune function but still predispose individuals to infections like tuberculosis and salmonella (Jouanguy1997Partial).

Alterations in IFN-γ expression levels are implicated in autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN-γ gene and its receptor are linked to increased SLE risk, with IFN-γ contributing to the disease's inflammatory responses and immune cell regulation (Liu2022IFNγ). Overactivity of IFN-γ can also lead to tissue damage and inflammation, contributing to autoimmune diseases and alterations in gut flora (Kak2018Interferon-gamma).

## Interactions
Interferon gamma (IFNG) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in immune responses through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. IFNG binds to its receptor, a heterodimeric complex composed of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, with a higher affinity for IFNGR1. This binding initiates a signaling cascade involving the activation of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2, which phosphorylate the transcription factor STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 forms homodimers that translocate to the nucleus to bind gamma activated sequences (GAS) in the promoter regions of IFN-γ-associated genes, facilitating their transcription (Bhat2018Comprehensive; Kak2018Interferon-gamma).

IFNG also interacts with proteins involved in autophagy and pathogen clearance, such as SQSTM1/p62, NDP52, optineurin, and LC3. These interactions are essential for recruiting autophagic machinery to bacterial phagosomes and directing pathogens to lysosomes for degradation (Kak2018Interferon-gamma). Additionally, IFNG regulates the expression of proteins involved in cation transport, such as NRAMP1 and P-type Cu2+, enhancing antimicrobial activity (Kak2018Interferon-gamma).

In the context of cellular metabolism, IFNG suppresses mTORC1 activity by inhibiting its localization to lysosomes, a process linked to the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and subsequent tryptophan depletion (Su2015Interferon-γ). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of IFNG in modulating immune responses and cellular processes.
