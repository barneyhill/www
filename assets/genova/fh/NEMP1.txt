# NEMP1

## Overview
NEMP1 (nuclear envelope integral membrane protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multipass transmembrane protein localized to the inner nuclear membrane of the nuclear envelope. The protein, also referred to as NEMP1, is integral to maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and mechanical stiffness, playing a crucial role in nuclear architecture and function. It is characterized by its interactions with various nuclear envelope components, including lamins and LEM domain proteins, which are essential for nuclear shape and chromatin organization (Tsatskis2020The; Hodzic2022The). NEMP1 is involved in key cellular processes such as cell division, differentiation, and response to mechanical stress, and its dysfunction is linked to clinical conditions affecting fertility and cancer therapy resistance (Liu2019NEMP1; Tsatskis2020The).

## Structure
NEMP1 (nuclear envelope integral membrane protein 1) is a multipass transmembrane protein localized to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) of the nuclear envelope. It is characterized by a signal peptide and five transmembrane domains, as predicted by a Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot (Mamada2009Involvement). NEMP1 contains two evolutionarily conserved regions, known as Region A and Region B, which are crucial for its interactions and functions (Shibano2015The). Region B, facing the nucleoplasm, is essential for binding to RanGTP, indicating a role in nuclear transport (Shibano2015The). 

NEMP1 interacts with various nuclear envelope components, including lamins and LEM domain proteins such as Emerin, MAN1, and LAP2, which are important for maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and mechanical stiffness (Tsatskis2020The; Hodzic2022The). The protein also oligomerizes with itself and interacts with other INM proteins (Shibano2015The). Phosphorylation of serine residues within Region B modulates its interaction with RanGTP, suggesting post-translational modifications play a role in its function (Shibano2015The). NEMP1's interaction with the chromatin protein BAF through a BAF-binding site in its C-terminal region is crucial for its activity in neural development (Mamada2009Involvement).

## Function
NEMP1 (nuclear envelope integral membrane protein 1) is a crucial component of the inner nuclear membrane in human cells, playing a significant role in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and mechanical stiffness. It interacts with LEM domain proteins, such as Emerin, to support the structural and functional properties of the nuclear envelope (Tsatskis2020The). This interaction is essential for maintaining nuclear shape and mechanical properties, as the loss of NEMP1 leads to nuclear shaping defects and reduced cell proliferation (Tsatskis2020The).

NEMP1 is involved in chromatin organization and nuclear mechanics, which are critical for cellular functions such as cell division and differentiation. It contributes to the mechanical stiffness of the nuclear envelope, which is vital for the proper functioning of cells under mechanical stress (Tsatskis2020The). The protein's role in nuclear envelope dynamics is also linked to its involvement in chromatin architecture, which is important for the differentiation and maturation of specific cell types, such as erythroid cells (Hodzic2022The).

Overall, NEMP1 is essential for maintaining nuclear structure and function, impacting cellular processes and organismal development through its role in nuclear envelope integrity and chromatin regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NEMP1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting fertility and reproductive lifespan. Human genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NEMP1 associated with early menopause, suggesting a role in diminished ovarian reserve and premature ovarian insufficiency (Tsatskis2020The). In model organisms, loss of NEMP1 homologs results in sterility or early loss of fertility due to nuclear shaping defects, highlighting its essential role in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity in the germ line (Tsatskis2020The).

In mice, deletion of the Nemp1 gene leads to a significant reduction in primordial follicles, indicating a reduced ovarian reserve and potential link to premature menopause in humans (Tsatskis2020The). NEMP1 is also implicated in tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of NEMP1 in MCF7 cells results in a loss of tamoxifen's inhibitory effect on cell growth, while its knockdown reduces resistance, suggesting that NEMP1 modulates tamoxifen resistance by regulating the expression of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) (Liu2019NEMP1). These findings indicate that NEMP1 plays a significant role in both reproductive health and cancer therapy resistance.

## Interactions
NEMP1, a nuclear envelope integral membrane protein, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins that influence nuclear architecture and function. It interacts with the chromatin protein BAF (barrier-to-autointegration factor) through a BAF-binding site in its C-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of eye marker genes during Xenopus neural development (Mamada2009Involvement; Shibano2015The). NEMP1 also binds to RanGTP, a small GTPase involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, through a unique motif in region B. This interaction is significant for nuclear transport and spindle formation (Shibano2015The).

NEMP1 forms complexes with itself and other inner nuclear membrane proteins, such as MAN1 and Emerin, through its transmembrane domains. It colocalizes with lamins at the nuclear envelope, which is essential for maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and mechanical stiffness (Tsatskis2020The; Shibano2015The). The interaction with Emerin is particularly important, as it supports nuclear envelope stiffness and structure (Tsatskis2020The). These interactions highlight NEMP1's role in nuclear envelope dynamics and its potential impact on cellular processes like gene expression regulation.
