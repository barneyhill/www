# S1PR3

## Overview
S1PR3, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3. This receptor is part of the larger family of GPCRs, characterized by their seven-transmembrane helical structure, and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes. S1PR3 is involved in critical cellular functions within the cardiovascular and immune systems, influencing processes such as angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and immune cell migration. The receptor's interaction with specific G proteins and other molecules facilitates its involvement in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Due to its significant role in these pathways, S1PR3 is a potential therapeutic target for conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders (Maeda2021Endogenous; Fan2022S1PR3; Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate).

## Structure
The S1PR3 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure, a hallmark of GPCRs (Maeda2021Endogenous; Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate). The receptor's structure includes an extracellular lid formed by the N-terminal helix and extracellular loops (ECL2 and ECL3), which create disulfide bonds that block ligand access from the extracellular region (Maeda2021Endogenous). The ligand-binding pocket of S1PR3 is unique, forming a long tunnel that allows ligand entry primarily from the membrane bilayer through a side gap between transmembrane domains 1 (TM1) and 7 (TM7) (Maeda2021Endogenous).

The active conformation of S1PR3 involves a dynamic rearrangement of four residues in the ligand-binding pocket, which is crucial for receptor activation and G protein coupling (Maeda2021Endogenous). Specific residues, such as Leu122, play a significant role in G protein-subtype bias, particularly in G q/11 signaling (Maeda2021Endogenous). The receptor's structure also includes a hydrophobic pocket formed by TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7, which accommodates the acyl chain of the ligand (Zhao2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for receptor activation and surface expression (Yuan2021Structures). The expression construct for S1PR3 used in structural studies includes residues 2 to 315, with specific modifications like the Asn15Gln mutation to remove glycosylation (Maeda2021Endogenous).

## Function
Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells, particularly within the cardiovascular and immune systems. In endothelial cells, S1PR3 is involved in angiogenesis by promoting the proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells and reducing apoptosis through the S1PR3/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate). It also regulates the endothelial barrier, protecting against vascular leakage at low concentrations but increasing permeability at higher concentrations via the S1PR3/RhoA/Rho kinase pathway (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate).

S1PR3 is crucial for the release of Weibel-Palade bodies from endothelial cells, which contain von Willebrand factor, a key protein in blood clotting. This process is mediated through Gq-dependent signaling, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels (van2014Sphingosine1Phosphate). In vascular smooth muscle cells, S1PR3 activation results in vasoconstriction by increasing intracellular calcium and activating Rho, while in endothelial cells, it promotes nitric oxide production, leading to vasodilation (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate).

In the immune system, S1PR3 is involved in the maturation and migration of dendritic cells and the recruitment of natural killer T cells and neutrophils, acting as a pro-inflammatory receptor (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate). It is also expressed in astrocytes, where it is upregulated in response to inflammation, playing a role in activating inflammatory genes (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S1PR3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma, S1PR3 expression is significantly up-regulated compared to normal lung tissues. This up-regulation is associated with clinical stages, invasions, metastasis, and genetic alterations, particularly in cases with oncogenic K-Ras mutations. These mutations stimulate S1PR3 expression through the TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling pathway, suggesting that S1PR3 could be a potential therapeutic target for K-Ras mutant-driven lung cancers, which are often resistant to conventional treatments (Zhao2016TGFβSMAD3).

In osteosarcoma, S1PR3 is also up-regulated and linked to poor survival rates. The S1P/S1PR3 axis promotes cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis, contributing to the aggressive nature of the disease. Targeting this axis with specific antagonists has shown potential in reducing tumor growth (Shen2019S1PS1PR3).

In breast cancer, S1PR3 is involved in the expansion of cancer stem cells through a ligand-independent Notch activation pathway. This signaling promotes tumorigenicity and is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting S1PR3 as a promising target for cancer treatment (Hirata2014Sphingosine1phosphate).

## Interactions
Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) is involved in various interactions with proteins that influence its signaling pathways. S1PR3 interacts with G proteins, specifically the G i/o, G q, and G 12/13 subunits, to activate downstream signaling pathways crucial for processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate). These interactions are essential for S1PR3's role in cardiovascular function, tissue fibrosis, cancer, immune response, and neurological function (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate).

S1PR3 also interacts with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 expression, which enhances angiogenesis (Li2021Sphingosine1phosphate). In the context of ischemic stroke, S1PR3 is involved in blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, where it regulates the expression of proteins such as AQP4 and MMP9, which are associated with BBB proteolysis after brain injury (Fan2022S1PR3). Inhibition of S1PR3 has been shown to reduce BBB permeability and cerebral edema, highlighting its role in maintaining BBB integrity (Fan2022S1PR3).

These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of S1PR3 in various physiological and pathological processes, making it a potential therapeutic target for several conditions.
