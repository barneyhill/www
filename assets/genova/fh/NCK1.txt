# NCK1

## Overview
NCK1 is a gene that encodes the NCK adaptor protein 1, a non-catalytic protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This adaptor protein is characterized by its structure, which includes three N-terminal SH3 domains and a single C-terminal SH2 domain, allowing it to mediate interactions with other proteins through binding to phosphotyrosine residues and proline-rich motifs (Takeuchi2010Autoinhibitory). NCK1 plays a pivotal role in processes such as T cell activation, adipogenesis, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and migration (Ngoenkam2014Nonoverlapping; Haider2018Nck1). It is involved in the regulation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway and interacts with various proteins to modulate cellular responses (Kebache2002Modulation). Clinically, alterations in NCK1 expression and mutations have been linked to cancer progression and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Alfaidi2020Selective; Yin2019Revisiting).

## Structure
The NCK1 protein is characterized by its multidomain architecture, comprising three N-terminal SH3 domains and a single C-terminal SH2 domain (Takeuchi2010Autoinhibitory). The SH3 domains of NCK1, specifically Nck1-1 and Nck1-2, exhibit a canonical SH3 fold with five β-strands arranged in two antiparallel β-sheets (Hake2008Specificity). The SH2 domain of NCK1 is involved in binding to phosphotyrosine residues, facilitating interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or cytosolic proteins (Frese2006The).

The Nck1-SH3.1 domain has been shown to form both monomeric and dimeric species through a domain swap, with the hinge at Lys36 providing flexibility (Richter2020Small). This domain swap is an intrinsic property, allowing the formation of dimers, although monomeric and dimeric species do not inter-convert at ambient temperature (Richter2020Small).

NCK1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity (Buvall2013Proteasomal). The protein also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may alter its functional interactions (Buvall2013Proteasomal). These structural features and modifications are crucial for NCK1's role in cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal reorganization.

## Function
NCK1 (NCK adaptor protein 1) is a crucial adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. It plays a significant role in T cell activation by regulating the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for the activation of Erk1/2 and MEK1/2 proteins, critical components for T cell function (Ngoenkam2014Nonoverlapping). NCK1 is also involved in the modulation of protein translation through its interaction with the β subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2β), enhancing both cap-dependent and -independent translation (Kebache2002Modulation).

In the context of adipogenesis, NCK1 is essential for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. It regulates this process by controlling the activation of PDGFRa, which influences collagen expression and fibrosis, thereby affecting adipocyte formation (Haider2018Nck1). NCK1 also plays a role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, influencing cell migration and cellular responses to external stimuli. It interacts with EphA receptors, such as EphA3, to mediate effects on cell migration and process retraction (Hu2009Regulation).

NCK1 is active in various cellular locations, including the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it influences processes like cell growth, differentiation, and migration (Li2014Nck1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NCK1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, NCK1 is suggested to have an oncogenic role, with specific mutations such as NCK1-D73H and NCK1-R42Q increasing cell viability and invasiveness in MCF7 cell lines. These mutations, when combined with TP53 mutations, are associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival in patients (Yin2019Revisiting). NCK1 expression is generally lower in tumor samples compared to normal samples, but it is upregulated in the basal-like subtype of breast cancer, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Yin2019Revisiting).

In astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer, NCK1 is significantly overexpressed in high-grade tumors compared to low-grade ones, correlating with poor survival outcomes. This suggests that NCK1 expression could serve as a prognostic marker for astrocytoma progression (Deshpande2018Expression).

NCK1 also plays a role in atherogenic inflammation and plaque formation. Its deletion in vascular cells reduces atherosclerosis, highlighting its involvement in endothelial activation and proinflammatory signaling pathways (Alfaidi2020Selective). These findings suggest that NCK1 is a critical player in various pathological conditions, particularly those involving cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
NCK1, an adaptor protein, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions primarily through its SH2 and SH3 domains. In T lymphocytes, NCK1 interacts with proteins such as Slp76, WASP, WIPF1, and CD3e, facilitating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Lettau2010The). It also binds to the actin-binding protein HIP55 and FYB/ADAP, which are involved in TCR signaling and integrin activation (Lettau2010The). NCK1's SH3 domains interact with nuclear proteins SFPQ and NONO, suggesting potential nuclear functions (Lettau2010The).

NCK1 is crucial in endothelial activation related to atherogenic inflammation, interacting specifically with IRAK-1, a mediator of NF-κB activation. This interaction is enhanced under disturbed flow conditions, highlighting NCK1's role in proinflammatory gene expression (Alfaidi2020Selective). In the context of protein translation, NCK1 interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 beta subunit (eIF2β), modulating translation processes (Kebache2002Modulation).

NCK1 also associates with the cytoplasmic capping enzyme (CE), binding to its proline-rich C-terminus, which is essential for the assembly of the cytoplasmic capping complex involved in mRNA cap homeostasis (Mukherjee2014The). These interactions underscore NCK1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and function.
