# CTDSPL2

## Overview
CTDSPL2 is a gene that encodes the protein C-terminal domain small phosphatase-like 2, which is categorized as a small C-terminal domain phosphatase. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in transcription regulation by dephosphorylating specific serine residues within the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This activity is essential for coordinating transcription with RNA processing and histone modification (Wani2016Human; Kang2016A). CTDSPL2 is also involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by stabilizing the Snail protein, thereby promoting cell migration and invasion (Zhao2018Cterminal). Additionally, CTDSPL2 interacts with various nuclear proteins, indicating its broader role in cellular processes such as RNA binding and transcription regulation (Kang2016A). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, and in the regulation of globin gene expression, suggesting potential therapeutic applications (Rong2024CTDSPL2; Ma2010CTD).

## Function
The CTDSPL2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a small C-terminal domain phosphatase, primarily active in the nucleus. It is involved in the regulation of transcription by dephosphorylating specific serine residues within the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for coordinating transcription with RNA processing and histone modification (Wani2016Human; Kang2016A). CTDSPL2 is associated with chromatin, particularly in transcriptionally silenced regions, and plays a role in the regulation of ε- and γ-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation (Wani2016Human; Ma2010CTD).

In addition to its role in transcription regulation, CTDSPL2 is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by interacting with and dephosphorylating the Snail protein. This interaction stabilizes Snail, preventing its degradation and promoting EMT, which is essential for cell migration and invasion (Zhao2018Cterminal). The protein's activity in these processes suggests its involvement in broader physiological mechanisms, including development and tissue repair (Zhao2018Cterminal). CTDSPL2's interactions with various nuclear proteins indicate its potential role in regulating cellular processes such as RNA binding and transcription regulation (Kang2016A).

## Clinical Significance
The CTDSPL2 gene is implicated in the progression of several cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In NSCLC, CTDSPL2 expression is significantly elevated in cancerous tissues and is associated with poor patient survival. It promotes cancer progression by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through the regulation of JAK1 expression. Knockdown of CTDSPL2 results in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced migratory and invasive abilities of NSCLC cells, suggesting its oncogenic role (Rong2024CTDSPL2).

CTDSPL2 also plays a role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. It stabilizes Snail, a key regulator of EMT, by preventing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting EMT and enhancing tumor cell migration and invasion (Zhao2018Cterminal).

Beyond cancer, CTDSPL2 is involved in the regulation of globin gene expression. Overexpression of CTDSPL2 in K562 cells and CD34+ cells derived from umbilical cord blood increases ε- and γ-globin gene expression, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for conditions like sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia by reactivating fetal hemoglobin production (Ma2010CTD).

## Interactions
CTDSPL2, also known as C-terminal domain small phosphatase-like 2, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with a range of nuclear proteins, including FUS/TLS, TARDBP, NF45, cdc2 p34, and NcoA3, as identified through immunoprecipitation studies. These interactions indicate CTDSPL2's involvement in DNA binding, transcription processes, and transcription factor activity (Kang2016A).

CTDSPL2 also interacts with JAK1, positively regulating its expression and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Rong2024CTDSPL2). This interaction is significant for tumor growth and metastasis, as CTDSPL2 knockdown reduces these processes (Rong2024CTDSPL2).

In the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), CTDSPL2, referred to as SCP4, interacts with and dephosphorylates the Snail protein. This dephosphorylation stabilizes Snail by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby promoting EMT (Zhao2018Cterminal). These interactions highlight CTDSPL2's role in regulating key cellular pathways and processes.
