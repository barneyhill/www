# DDX54

## Overview
DDX54 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 54, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. These proteins are characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) and are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and the regulation of gene expression. DEAD-box helicase 54 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response by modulating transcriptome dynamics and enhancing the splicing of pre-mRNAs, particularly under stress conditions such as ionizing radiation. It is also involved in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit, contributing to ribosome biogenesis. In addition to its cellular functions, DDX54 has been implicated in cancer, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (Yu2021DDX54; Milek2017DDX54; Cruz2023The).

## Function
DDX54, or DEAD-box helicase 54, is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DDX54 plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by regulating transcriptome dynamics. It is crucial for the splicing efficacy of its target pre-mRNAs, particularly those induced by ionizing radiation (IR). DDX54 binds to both exonic and intronic sequences of pre-mRNAs, enhancing the splicing reaction at weak 3' splice sites, which is vital for proper gene expression during stress conditions like DNA damage (Milek2017DDX54).

DDX54 is also involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the formation of the peptidyl transferase center during the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It facilitates the structural rearrangement and stabilization of RNA elements within the pre-60S ribosomal particle, which is essential for the proper assembly and function of the ribosome (Cruz2023The).

In the nucleus, DDX54 is distributed in nuclear speckles and interacts with estrogen receptors, suppressing their transcriptional activity. It acts as a gene-selective co-activator for the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and is involved in regulating mRNA stability by binding to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Zheng2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
DDX54 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DDX54 is overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating the p65 and AKT signaling pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis (Yu2021DDX54). High DDX54 expression is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC patients (Yu2021DDX54).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DDX54 is also overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. It is regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC00908, which negatively affects DDX54 expression. LINC00908 overexpression reduces DDX54 levels, inhibiting tumor growth and glycolysis, while knockdown of LINC00908 increases DDX54 expression, enhancing tumorigenic processes (Zhao2024LINC00908).

DDX54 plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by regulating transcriptome dynamics and splicing. It enhances pre-mRNA processing and prevents intron retention, which is crucial for cell survival following DNA damage. Elevated DDX54 expression is observed in multiple solid tumors, suggesting its potential as a tumor marker (Milek2017DDX54).

## Interactions
DDX54, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation. DDX54 interacts with spliceosomal components, particularly under conditions of DNA damage. It binds to introns in pre-mRNAs coding for proteins involved in splicing, chromosome reorganization, and the cell cycle, with a preference for introns near the 3' end of transcripts (Milek2017DDX54). Upon exposure to ionizing radiation, DDX54's binding shifts from exons to intronic regions near splice sites, indicating its role in splicing regulation. It interacts with nuclear non-coding RNAs, notably U2 snRNA, and spliceosomal proteins, including those in complexes B and C, and U2 snRNP (Milek2017DDX54).

DDX54 also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the formation of the peptidyl transferase center during 60S ribosome assembly. It interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) components and ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs), such as Nop2, Nog1, and Nsa2, facilitating the remodeling of rRNA structures (Cruz2023The). These interactions are crucial for the hierarchical assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Cruz2023The).
