# MORN4

## Overview
MORN4 is a gene that encodes the protein MORN repeat containing 4, which is characterized by the presence of multiple MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) repeats. These repeats function as protein binding modules, facilitating interactions with other proteins, notably the Myo3a tail. The MORN4 protein plays a critical role in cellular processes by localizing Myo3a at the tips of actin-based protrusions such as filopodia and stereocilia. The structural configuration of MORN4, including its U-shaped groove, is essential for its high-affinity binding to the Myo3a binding domain (MBD), a process stabilized by various molecular interactions. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning and localization of Myo3a, underscoring the importance of MORN4 in cellular dynamics and protein interaction networks (Li2019Structure).

## Structure
The MORN4 protein is characterized by the presence of multiple MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) repeats, which serve as protein binding modules. The primary structure of MORN4 includes four typical MORN repeats, each generally containing 23-26 amino acids forming a beta-hairpin structure, and two atypical repeats at the N- and C-terminal ends (Li2019Structure). These repeats form a single-layered beta sheet with a U-shaped groove, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as the Myo3a tail (Li2019Structure).

The tertiary structure of MORN4 reveals a U-shaped groove that interacts with an elongated alpha helix of Myo3a-MBD, stabilized by charge-charge interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions (Li2019Structure). This structure is similar to the architecture of SETD7 MORN repeats, indicating a conserved mechanism of protein interaction (Li2019Structure).

MORN4's quaternary structure involves its interaction with Myo3a, where it binds with high affinity to the Myo3a tail, specifically to a region known as the MORN4 binding domain (MBD) (Li2019Structure). This interaction is essential for the localization of Myo3a at the tips of actin-based protrusions such as filopodia (Li2019Structure).

## Interactions
MORN4 is known for its high-affinity interaction with the Myo3a tail, specifically binding to a region known as the MORN4 binding domain (MBD) with a dissociation constant of approximately 2.4 nM. This interaction is crucial for the localization of MORN4 at the tips of actin-based protrusions such as filopodia and stereocilia. The MORN4/Myo3a complex forms a stable monomeric structure, and the binding is highly specific, occurring between the IQ3 and Espin1 binding sites on Myo3a. Disruption of this interaction impairs the localization of Myo3a in cells, highlighting the importance of MORN4 in cellular processes (Li2019Structure).

The structural interaction between MORN4 and Myo3a-MBD involves a U-shaped groove in MORN4 that interacts with an elongated alpha helix of Myo3a-MBD. This interaction is stabilized by charge-charge interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. Mutations in either MORN4 or Myo3a-MBD that disrupt these interactions significantly decrease binding affinity, demonstrating the specificity and importance of these interactions for protein function (Li2019Structure).

MORN repeats, such as those in MORN4, are versatile protein-protein interaction modules, suggesting broader implications for understanding protein interactions in various biological contexts (Li2019Structure).
