# DSTYK

## Overview
The DSTYK gene encodes a dual serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase, which is integral to various cellular processes, including lysosome biogenesis and cellular homeostasis. This kinase is involved in the regulation of the mTORC1/TFEB pathway, influencing lysosome and vacuole formation, which are essential for maintaining cellular function and development (Sun2020Dstyk). DSTYK is expressed in multiple tissues such as the brain, heart, and kidneys, highlighting its role in embryonic development and organogenesis (Zhong2021Loss). The protein's interactions with key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital disorders (Zhang2020DSTYK; Zhong2021Loss).

## Function
The DSTYK gene encodes a dual serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in lysosome biogenesis and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, DSTYK is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-associated structures by promoting the proper aggregation and fusion of the late endosomal/lysosomal system. This function is crucial for maintaining normal vertebral development and preventing congenital scoliosis-like vertebral malformations (Sun2020Dstyk).

DSTYK operates through the mTORC1/TFEB pathway, where it regulates lysosome biogenesis and notochord vacuole formation. Under normal conditions, DSTYK influences the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor TFEB, facilitating its dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. This process activates genes involved in lysosome and vacuole biogenesis, essential for cellular homeostasis (Sun2020Dstyk).

DSTYK is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, muscles, kidneys, and lungs, and is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its activity in these locations underscores its role in embryonic development and organogenesis, impacting cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis (Zhong2021Loss). The gene's function appears to vary across species, with different phenotypic outcomes observed in zebrafish, mice, and humans (Sun2020Dstyk).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DSTYK gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DSTYK is implicated in metastasis and chemoresistance through its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). High DSTYK expression is linked to poor prognosis in CRC patients, as it promotes EMT and inhibits apoptosis, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy (Zhang2020DSTYK).

In lung adenocarcinoma, DSTYK acts as a tumor suppressor. Low expression of DSTYK is correlated with increased tumorigenesis and reduced patient survival. The gene interacts with β-catenin, modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (Zhong2021Loss).

DSTYK mutations are also linked to congenital scoliosis-like vertebral malformations in zebrafish, due to dysregulated mTORC1/TFEB signaling affecting notochord development. These mutations lead to defects in lysosome biogenesis, contributing to vertebral malformations (Sun2020Dstyk).

Additionally, DSTYK mutations are associated with autosomal-dominant congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and hereditary spastic paraplegia type 23 (SPG23). These mutations can cause urinary tract dysfunction, spastic paraparesis, and other developmental disorders (Vidic2021Exome).

## Interactions
DSTYK, a dual serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase, is involved in several key protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma, DSTYK interacts with β-catenin, a crucial component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of β-catenin by DSTYK, which inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This was demonstrated through various assays, including GST pull-down tests and immunoprecipitation assays, confirming the interaction with both exogenously and endogenously expressed DSTYK in lung adenocarcinoma cells (Zhong2021Loss).

DSTYK also plays a role in lysosome biogenesis through its interaction with the mTORC1/TFEB pathway. It influences the phosphorylation state of TFEB, a transcription factor involved in lysosome biogenesis. DSTYK knockdown leads to increased phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets, affecting TFEB nuclear translocation and lysosome formation (Sun2020Dstyk).

Additionally, DSTYK has been identified to interact with the Numb PTB domain, with a moderate affinity interaction indicated by a dissociation constant of 7.7 μM. This interaction suggests a potential regulatory role in protein kinase activity (Wei2018Interactome).
