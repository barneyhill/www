# PLXND1

## Overview
The PLXND1 gene encodes the protein plexin D1, a transmembrane receptor that is integral to semaphorin signaling pathways. Plexin D1 is involved in a variety of biological processes, including axonal guidance in the nervous system, where it interacts with semaphorins to influence neuronal development and synaptic specificity (Chauvet2007Gating). In the cardiovascular system, plexin D1 acts as an endothelial mechanosensor, playing a critical role in angiogenesis and the regulation of vascular function, particularly in response to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling (Zhang2021Insights). Additionally, plexin D1 is involved in cell migration and morphology through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, which modulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Zhang2021Insights). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Möbius syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Li2021Prognostic; TomasRoca2015De).

## Structure


## Function
Plexin D1 (PLXND1) is a receptor protein that plays a crucial role in semaphorin signaling, which is essential for various cellular and organismal processes. In the nervous system, PLXND1 interacts with semaphorin 3E (SEMA3E) to regulate axonal guidance, influencing synaptic specificity and formation in neurons. This interaction is modulated by Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1), which can switch the signaling from repulsion to attraction, thereby affecting axonal pathfinding and growth (Chauvet2007Gating).

In the cardiovascular system, PLXND1 functions as an endothelial mechanosensor, regulating vascular function and the distribution of atherosclerosis. It is involved in angiogenesis, where it is dynamically regulated by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling. PLXND1 expression is induced by VEGF in angiogenic blood vessels, and it participates in a feedback mechanism that modulates VEGF-mediated angiogenic fate determination (Kim2011Semaphorin; Zhang2021Insights).

PLXND1 also plays a role in cell migration, morphology, and synapse remodeling through its involvement in GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, which deactivates small GTPases like R-Ras, M-Ras, and Rap1, affecting integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Zhang2021Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PLXND1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Möbius syndrome, a rare neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis, de novo mutations in PLXND1 have been identified as potential causes. These mutations affect conserved regions of the protein, leading to defects in facial nerve function (TomasRoca2015De). Poland-Möbius syndrome, which combines features of Möbius and Poland's syndromes, has also been linked to a novel mutation in PLXND1, suggesting a genetic connection between these conditions (Glass2022PolandMöbius).

In cardiovascular diseases, PLXND1 plays a role in vascular development and is involved in conditions such as atherosclerosis. It affects endothelial cell junctions and inhibits macrophage migration, contributing to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis (Zhang2021Insights). PLXND1 mutations are also associated with congenital heart defects, including persistent truncus arteriosus, due to its role in endothelial cell function during heart development (Zhang2021Insights).

In cancer, elevated PLXND1 expression has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it may contribute to tumor progression and immune infiltration (Li2021Prognostic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLXND1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PLXND1 (plexin D1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in semaphorin signaling. It primarily interacts with semaphorins such as SEMA3E, which is its canonical ligand, as well as SEMA3A, SEMA3C, SEMA3D, SEMA4A, and SEMA6D (Zhang2021Insights). These interactions are significant in modulating cellular processes like cell adhesion and migration.

PLXND1 forms complexes with neuropilins, specifically NRP1 and NRP2, which act as coreceptors in semaphorin signaling (Zhang2021Insights). The interaction with GIPC1, a PDZ domain-containing protein, is also notable. GIPC1 binds to the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of PLXND1, influencing its signaling and surface expression (CarreteroOrtega2019GIPC; Burk2017Postendocytic). This interaction is crucial for the post-endocytic sorting and recycling of PLXND1, particularly in neuronal development (Burk2017Postendocytic).

PLXND1 also interacts with ORAI1, a component of store-operated calcium channels, affecting calcium signaling and autophagy in endocardial endothelial cells (Sun2022PLXND1mediated). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that PLXND1 engages in, influencing various biological processes and signaling pathways.
