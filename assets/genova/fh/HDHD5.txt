# HDHD5

## Overview
The HDHD5 gene encodes the protein known as haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain containing 5, which is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This protein family is characterized by its role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid monoesters, a critical function in various metabolic pathways. The HDHD5 protein is involved in dephosphorylation processes, which are essential for regulating numerous cellular activities, including signal transduction and energy metabolism. Although the specific biological functions and interactions of HDHD5 remain to be fully elucidated, its classification within the HAD superfamily suggests a potential role in metabolic regulation and cellular homeostasis. Further research is needed to clarify its precise functions and implications in human health and disease.
