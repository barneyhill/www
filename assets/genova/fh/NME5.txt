# NME5

## Overview
NME5 is a gene that encodes the protein NME/NM23 family member 5, which is part of the NME/NM23 family of proteins. This family is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. Unlike other members of the family, NME5 lacks nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity due to the absence of key residues necessary for this function. Instead, it exhibits 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity, which may play a role in protecting cells from oxidative damage. NME5 is primarily expressed in the testes, where it is associated with spermatogenesis and sperm motility, particularly through its involvement in the modulation of flagellar radial spoke complexes. Additionally, NME5 is present in somatic airway epithelial cells, suggesting a role in ciliary function. The protein's unique structure, including a COOH-terminal extension and a Dpy-30 domain, contributes to its specialized functions in cellular motility and potentially in DNA interactions (Munier1998A; Desvignes2009Nme; Perina2019Characterization).

## Structure
The NME5 protein, part of the NME/NM23 family, is characterized by its unique molecular structure. The primary structure of NME5 consists of 212 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 24,200 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.6, indicating it is an acidic protein (Munier1998A). The protein includes a unique COOH-terminal extension of 55 amino acids, distinguishing it from other nucleoside diphosphate kinases (Munier1998A).

NME5 contains an NDPk5 domain followed by a Dpy-30 domain, which is involved in processes such as flagellar assembly and histone methylation (Desvignes2009Nme; Perina2019Characterization). The Dpy-30 domain is crucial for the assembly of radial spokes in cilia, as evidenced by its role in primary ciliary dyskinesia (Cho2020A).

Despite possessing most conserved residues of NDP kinases, NME5 lacks kinase activity due to the absence of three crucial residues necessary for enzyme structure and activity (Desvignes2009Nme). However, it exhibits a pronounced 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity (Desvignes2009Nme). The protein's quaternary structure is less understood, but it is known to be associated with axoneme microtubules in sperm flagella (Ćetković2014Nme).

## Function
The NME5 gene, part of the NME/NM23 family, is primarily expressed in human testes, particularly in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and is associated with the flagella of spermatids and spermatozoa. This suggests a significant role in spermiogenesis and sperm motility (Desvignes2009Nme; Munier2003Nm23NDP). Unlike other members of the NME family, NME5 lacks nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity but exhibits pronounced 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity, which may contribute to its function in late spermiogenesis by aiding in the elimination of reactive oxygen species (Desvignes2009Nme).

NME5 is also involved in the modulation of flagellar radial spoke complexes, which are crucial for the structural organization and function of sperm cells, particularly in relation to motility (Perina2019Characterization; Munier2003Nm23NDP). In addition to its role in the testes, NME5 is present in somatic airway epithelial cells and is associated with microtubules, indicating a potential role in ciliary function (Anderegg2019NME5). The protein's involvement in these cellular processes suggests its importance in maintaining proper motility and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for fertility and respiratory health.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The NME5 protein, part of the NME/NM23 family, is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with nucleic acids and potential roles in multiprotein complexes. Although specific protein interactions involving NME5 are not detailed extensively, it is known to localize within axonemal microtubules of spermatid and spermatozoan flagella, suggesting a role in sperm motility (Perina2019Characterization). NME5 is also associated with the elimination of reactive oxygen species during spermatogenesis by increasing GPX-5 levels (Perina2019Characterization).

In terms of nucleic acid interactions, the Nme5-like protein from the red alga Chondrus crispus, a homolog of human NME5, can bind to various types of DNA, including single-stranded telomeric DNA, double-stranded DNA from the c-myc promoter, and single-stranded circular DNA from bacteriophage φX174. This suggests that the DNA-binding affinity of NME5-like proteins may not be sequence-specific, similar to human Nme2 (Perina2019Characterization). The potential nuclear activities and interactions of NME5 with DNA are areas for further research, as these interactions could influence cellular processes such as gene expression and signal transduction (Perina2019Characterization).
