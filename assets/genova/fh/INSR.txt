# INSR

## Overview
The INSR gene encodes the insulin receptor, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in insulin signaling and metabolic regulation. The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric protein composed of two extracellular alpha (α) subunits and two transmembrane beta (β) subunits, linked by disulfide bonds. Upon binding with insulin, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation, triggering a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate glucose uptake, metabolism, and cell growth (Hubbard2013The; Schulingkamp2000Insulin). The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, where it mediates insulin's effects on glucose and lipid metabolism (Cignarelli2019Insulin). The INSR gene produces two isoforms, IR-A and IR-B, through alternative splicing, each with distinct roles in cellular proliferation and metabolic functions (Cignarelli2019Insulin). Dysregulation of INSR function is implicated in insulin resistance and associated metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (Chen2019Insulin).

## Structure
The insulin receptor (INSR) is a transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure. It is composed of two alpha (α) and two beta (β) subunits, forming a heterotetrameric structure linked by disulfide bonds (Payankaulam2019Transcriptional; Schulingkamp2000Insulin). The α subunits are extracellular and contain a leucine-rich domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, while the β subunits span the membrane and include a tyrosine kinase domain (Hubbard2013The).

The primary structure of the INSR includes two isoforms, IR-A and IR-B, generated by alternative splicing of exon 11, resulting in proteins of 1370 and 1382 amino acids, respectively (Payankaulam2019Transcriptional). The secondary structure features α-helices and β-sheets, particularly in the tyrosine kinase domain, which has a canonical protein-kinase architecture (Hubbard2013The). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, especially in the cysteine-rich regions (Ward1995Insulin).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for receptor function and signal transduction (Schulingkamp2000Insulin). The receptor's quaternary structure is a preformed disulfide-linked dimer, which undergoes conformational changes upon insulin binding, facilitating trans-phosphorylation of the kinase domains (Hubbard2013The).

## Function
The INSR gene encodes the insulin receptor, a critical component in insulin signaling and metabolic regulation in human cells. This receptor is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and is expressed in all mammalian cells. Upon binding with insulin, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation, initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, which are essential for regulating glucose uptake, metabolism, and cell growth (Rahman2021Role; Chen2019Insulin).

In healthy human cells, the insulin receptor is primarily active in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, where it mediates insulin's effects on glucose uptake and metabolism. In adipose tissue, insulin signaling through INSR is crucial for glucose uptake and lipid metabolism, involving the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Cignarelli2019Insulin). The receptor's activity is regulated through endocytosis and recycling processes, which maintain its availability on the plasma membrane and modulate insulin sensitivity (Chen2019Insulin).

The balance between the receptor's isoforms, INSR-A and INSR-B, is also significant, with INSR-A involved in cell proliferation and INSR-B in metabolic functions (Cignarelli2019Insulin). Disruptions in INSR function can lead to insulin resistance, contributing to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (Chen2019Insulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INSR gene, which encodes the insulin receptor, are associated with several rare inherited syndromes characterized by severe insulin resistance. These include Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism), Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS), and type A insulin resistance syndrome. Donohue syndrome is marked by extreme insulin resistance, leading to hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose homeostasis, and growth retardation. Patients often exhibit dysmorphic features and typically die within the first year of life (Rojek2023Syndrome). Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome presents with constant hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and other complications, often resulting in death during the first or second decade of life (Rojek2023Syndrome; Rojas2024A). Type A insulin resistance syndrome usually manifests later in life with severe insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism (Koca2024Type).

Mutations in the INSR gene can lead to decreased insulin receptor function, as seen in various nonsense and missense mutations that impair receptor processing and transport to the cell surface (Kadowaki1990Five). These genetic alterations result in reduced insulin binding and signaling, contributing to the clinical manifestations of these syndromes (Kadowaki1990Five). Genetic testing is crucial for diagnosing these conditions and guiding management strategies (Rojas2024A).

## Interactions
The insulin receptor (INSR) engages in various protein-protein interactions essential for insulin signaling. Upon insulin binding, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation, creating docking sites for several downstream signaling proteins. These include insulin receptor substrates (IRS1 and IRS2), Shc, SH2B1, and SH2B2, which contain phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) or Src homology-2 (SH2) domains. The PTB domains of IRS proteins and Shc bind to the juxtamembrane autophosphorylation site pY972, while the SH2 domains of SH2B1-2 bind to the triply phosphorylated IRK activation loop (Hubbard2013The).

IRS1 and IRS2, once phosphorylated, activate downstream pathways such as PI3K/AKT and Ras-MAPK, which are crucial for glucose uptake and metabolism (Payankaulam2019Transcriptional). The KRLB region in IRS2 interacts with the kinase domain of INSR in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, inhibiting further phosphorylation of IRS2 (Hubbard2013The).

Negative regulators like Grb10 and Grb14 are recruited to INSR to attenuate signaling. Grb10/14 contains a carboxy-terminal SH2 domain that binds directly to the phosphorylated activation loop of INSR, acting as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor and directly inhibiting INSR's catalytic activity (Hubbard2013The). PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, dephosphorylates INSR, with specificity potentially dictated by twin phosphotyrosines in the activation loop (Hubbard2013The).
