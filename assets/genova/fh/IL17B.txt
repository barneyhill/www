# IL17B

## Overview
The IL17B gene encodes the protein interleukin 17B, a member of the IL-17 cytokine family, which plays a crucial role in immune response regulation and inflammation. Interleukin 17B is a cytokine that functions primarily by binding to the IL-17RB receptor, albeit with lower affinity compared to its family member IL-17E. This protein is secreted as a noncovalent dimer and is expressed in various tissues, including the pancreas, small intestine, stomach, chondrocytes, and neurons, with particularly high expression in chondrocytes and neurons. IL-17B is involved in promoting the production of proinflammatory cytokines and recruiting immune cells, such as neutrophils and B cells, thereby contributing to inflammatory responses and tissue homeostasis. It also plays a role in tissue regeneration and embryonic development. Clinically, IL-17B is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in several malignancies, as well as being implicated in inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Brevi2020Much; Meehan2022Interleukin17; Gu2013IL17).

## Structure


## Function
IL17B is a cytokine that plays a role in immune response regulation and is part of the IL-17 family. It is secreted as a noncovalent dimer and primarily binds to the IL-17RB receptor, although with lower affinity compared to IL-17E (Brevi2020Much; Gu2013IL17). IL17B is expressed in various tissues, including the pancreas, small intestine, stomach, chondrocytes, and neurons, with high expression levels in chondrocytes and neurons (Brevi2020Much; Gu2013IL17).

In healthy human cells, IL17B is involved in promoting the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β by monocytes, and it favors neutrophil recruitment (Brevi2020Much; Gu2013IL17). It also supports B cell chemotaxis through IL-17RB in an autocrine manner (Brevi2020Much). IL17B is implicated in tissue regeneration and embryonic development, indicating its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis (Brevi2020Much).

IL17B is also produced by epithelial cells in response to the abnormal expansion of pathobionts within the microbiota, where it functions to protect tissue and promote healing, particularly in the context of allergic asthma and chemically-induced colitis (Brevi2020Much).

## Clinical Significance
The IL17B gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In cancer, IL-17B is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic, lung, and breast cancers, where it promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation (Brevi2020Much). It enhances tumorigenicity through the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and HER2 amplification (Meehan2022Interleukin17). In breast cancer, IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling is critical for tumorigenesis, correlating with poor prognosis and resistance to apoptosis (Brevi2020Much). 

IL-17B expression is notably increased in colorectal cancer, particularly in tumor cells with moderate and poor differentiation, and is produced by neutrophils in the tumor stroma (AlSamadi2015Distinctive). Genetic variants of IL17B, mostly missense mutations, have been linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder, hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome, and keratoconus (Brevi2020Much). 

In inflammatory diseases, IL-17B contributes to inflammation and tissue destruction, playing a role in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, community-acquired pneumonia, and rheumatoid arthritis (Brevi2020Much). Its dysregulation can exacerbate these inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
IL-17B is known to interact with the IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), forming a specific interaction that is crucial for its biological functions. This interaction is significant in maintaining a balance between IL-17B and IL-17E, as both cytokines share the IL-17RB receptor, though IL-17B binds with lower affinity compared to IL-25 (IL-17E) (Brevi2020Much; Gu2013IL17). The binding of IL-17B to IL-17RB is involved in the activation of NF-kB signaling pathways, which leads to the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression, contributing to cancer cell survival and resistance to apoptosis in certain malignancies, such as breast cancer (Brevi2020Much).

IL-17B also stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in monocytic cells, such as the THP-1 cell line, indicating its role in inflammatory responses (Gu2013IL17). Additionally, IL-17B promotes the recruitment of neutrophils and B cells, the latter through the downregulation of RGS16, which affects chemokine receptor signaling (Brevi2020Much). These interactions highlight IL-17B's involvement in both inflammatory processes and cancer progression.
