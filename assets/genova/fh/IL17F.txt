# IL17F

## Overview
IL17F is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 17F, a member of the interleukin-17 family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. Interleukin 17F is primarily produced by T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and other immune cells, and it is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. The protein is characterized by a cystine knot fold and forms homodimers, as well as heterodimers with interleukin 17A, to exert its biological functions. Interleukin 17F interacts with specific receptors, such as IL-17RA and IL-17RC, to mediate its effects, which include promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing mucosal barrier functions. This cytokine is crucial for host defense mechanisms, particularly in epithelial and endothelial cells, and is implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Goepfert2017The; Mills2022IL17; Hymowitz2001IL17s).

## Structure
The IL17F protein is a member of the interleukin-17 cytokine family and is characterized by a cystine knot fold, a structural motif common among growth factors. This fold is defined by a specific arrangement of cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds, although IL17F lacks the third disulfide bridge typical of this motif, which is replaced by serine residues (Hymowitz2001IL17s; Zhang2011Structure). The primary structure of IL17F includes a signal peptide and a mature chain consisting of 163 amino acids (Hymowitz2001IL17s).

The secondary structure of IL17F features two pairs of antiparallel β-strands, with disulfide bridges connecting strands 2 and 4 (Hymowitz2001IL17s). The protein forms a homodimer, with a large cavity at the dimer interface that may serve as a binding site for other molecules (Hymowitz2001IL17s). IL17F can also form heterodimers with IL17A, although these are less active than the homodimers (Zhang2011Structure).

Post-translational modifications of IL17F include glycosylation, with approximately 3 kDa of carbohydrate per dimer (Hymowitz2001IL17s). The protein's structure and interactions with its receptor, IL-17RA, are crucial for its role in inflammatory responses (Ely2009Structural).

## Function
IL17F (interleukin 17F) is a cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses, primarily produced by T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, as well as other immune cells such as γδ T cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. It plays a significant role in inflammation by inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Goepfert2017The; Hymowitz2001IL17s). IL17F is active in epithelial and endothelial cells, where it contributes to host defense by promoting neutrophil recruitment and enhancing mucosal barrier function, which is crucial for protection against bacterial and fungal infections (Goepfert2017The; Mills2022IL17).

IL17F forms homodimers and can also form a heterodimer with IL17A, known as IL-17A/F, which signals through a receptor complex comprising IL-17RA and IL-17RC (Goepfert2017The). Although IL17F shares structural similarities with IL17A, it has distinct roles, particularly in regulating cartilage matrix turnover and contributing to skeletal tissue destruction in pathological conditions (Hymowitz2001IL17s). IL17F's activity is crucial for maintaining mucosal barriers and modulating immune responses, highlighting its importance in both protective immunity and inflammatory processes (Mills2022IL17).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL17F gene have been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly DSS colitis, is influenced by IL-17F, where it plays a pathogenic role. Mice lacking IL-17F show resistance to colitis, suggesting that IL-17F contributes to disease severity (Zhou2021Divergent). A naturally occurring human mutation in IL-17F, known as S65L, has been associated with increased susceptibility to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and exacerbated colitis, indicating a loss of function that affects intestinal inflammation (Zhou2021Divergent).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the IL-17F rs763780 SNP is significantly associated with increased disease risk. This polymorphism, along with others like rs2397084 and rs11465553, affects protein stability and contributes to RA pathogenesis by altering inflammatory responses (Ali2023Association; Nisar2020Impact). IL-17F is also involved in lung cancer, where gene amplification and mRNA upregulation are observed, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma. These alterations may influence cancer prognosis and survival (Liao2019Comprehensive).

Overall, IL-17F's role in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, with genetic variations affecting disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
IL-17F is a cytokine that forms homodimers and heterodimers, such as IL-17FF and IL-17AF, which interact with specific receptors to mediate immune responses. IL-17F primarily interacts with the IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptors. The binding of IL-17F to IL-17RA involves a unique 'side-on' orientation, engaging both fibronectin type III domains of the receptor. This interaction covers approximately 2200 Å² of surface area, with the IL-17RA D1 domain contributing significantly to the binding interface (Ely2009Structural). 

IL-17F can form a heterodimeric complex with IL-17A, known as IL-17A/F, which also interacts with the IL-17RA receptor. The IL-17A/F heterodimer binds to the 'F-face' of the heterodimer, despite IL-17RA having a higher affinity for IL-17A (Goepfert2017The). IL-17F's interaction with IL-17RC is characterized by fewer structural changes compared to IL-17RA, allowing the formation of a symmetrical 2:1 IL-17RC:IL-17FF complex (Waters2021Conformational).

IL-17F also plays a role in the ubiquitination of the IL-17 receptor, a process that is enhanced upon stimulation with IL-17F, implicating a physical interaction with the receptor and involvement of TRAF6 in the signaling pathway (Rong2007Interleukin17F).
