# PRSS16

## Overview
PRSS16 is a gene that encodes the protein thymus-specific serine protease (TSSP), which is a serine protease predominantly expressed in the thymus. TSSP plays a pivotal role in the immune system by participating in the positive selection of CD4+ T cells within the thymus, a process essential for the development of a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire. This protease is primarily located in the endosomal compartments of cortical thymic epithelial cells, where it contributes to the generation and editing of self-peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. The activity of TSSP is crucial for shaping the T cell receptor repertoire and ensuring central tolerance, thereby influencing both immune function and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases and cancer (Guerder2018Thymusspecific; Gommeaux2009Thymus‐specific; Fornari2011Transcription).

## Function
The PRSS16 gene encodes the thymus-specific serine protease (TSSP), which plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the thymus. TSSP is predominantly expressed in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) and is involved in the generation of self-peptides that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. This process is essential for the positive selection of CD4+ T cells, a critical step in T-cell development that ensures the survival and maturation of thymocytes with intermediate affinity for peptide-MHC complexes (Gommeaux2009Thymus‐specific; Fornari2011Transcription).

TSSP is located in the endosomal compartment of cTEC, where it contributes to the editing of the peptide repertoire presented by MHC class II molecules. This activity influences the selection of T cell receptors (TCRs) and shapes the CD4 T cell repertoire, impacting both positive and negative selection processes (Guerder2018Thymusspecific). The absence of TSSP can lead to impaired selection of certain CD4+ T cells, highlighting its role in antigen presentation and central tolerance (Gommeaux2009Thymus‐specific).

## Clinical Significance
The PRSS16 gene, encoding thymus-specific serine protease (TSSP), is implicated in several autoimmune diseases and cancer. Variations in PRSS16 expression levels in thymic cells have been linked to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In particular, polymorphisms in the PRSS16 gene may influence the selection of CD4+ T cells, affecting disease susceptibility (Guerder2018Thymusspecific).

In the context of cancer, TSSP deficiency has been associated with increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CAC) and other tumors. TSSP-deficient mice exhibit an altered T cell receptor repertoire and a protumoral cytokine profile, which contribute to increased tumorigenesis. This suggests that TSSP plays a crucial role in the antitumoral function of CD4+ T cells, and its absence can lead to immune cell defects that increase cancer susceptibility (Brisson2015The).

Additionally, PRSS16 has been studied in the context of schizophrenia, where it is regulated by miR-148b-3p. Alterations in PRSS16 expression, mediated by this microRNA, may have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia (Wu2020Schizophrenia‑associated).
