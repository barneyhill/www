# ACYP1

## Overview
The ACYP1 gene encodes acylphosphatase 1, a small cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of carboxyl phosphate bonds, particularly in β-aspartyl phosphate intermediates. This enzyme is characterized by its compact, globular α/β fold structure, typical of small RNA-binding proteins, and functions as a monomer without forming quaternary structures (PAOLI2000Acylphosphatase). Acylphosphatase 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including differentiation and apoptosis, and is widely distributed across animal tissues (Chiarugi1997Acylphosphatase). The gene produces two alternative splicing forms, with the common type (CT) form being enzymatically active, while the CTsv form, despite lacking enzymatic activity, can still induce apoptosis (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1). ACYP1's expression and activity have significant implications in cellular homeostasis and have been linked to various clinical outcomes, particularly in cancer prognosis and treatment (Zhou2022ACYP1).

## Structure
The ACYP1 gene encodes the common type isoform of acylphosphatase, a small cytosolic enzyme involved in hydrolyzing carboxyl phosphate bonds. The primary structure of ACYP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the gene, which spans approximately 10 Kbp and includes two exons of 84 bp and 123 bp (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1). The secondary structure of acylphosphatase is characterized by a five-stranded antiparallel twisted beta-sheet flanked by two antiparallel alpha-helices. The first alpha-helix is important for aggregation, while the second is crucial for protein folding (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1). The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape with an α/β fold, which is common among small RNA-binding proteins (PAOLI2000Acylphosphatase). ACYP1 functions as a monomer and does not typically form quaternary structures (PAOLI2000Acylphosphatase).

ACYP1 has two alternative splicing forms: the common type (CT) form and a novel form, CTsv, which includes an additional 79 bp exon. The CTsv form lacks acylphosphatase activity but can still induce apoptosis in HeLa cells (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1). The protein's function in vivo is not fully understood, but it is implicated in cell differentiation and apoptosis (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1).

## Function
The ACYP1 gene encodes the common type isoform of acylphosphatase, a small cytosolic enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of carboxyl phosphate bonds in various molecules, including β-aspartyl phosphate intermediates (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1). This enzyme is widely distributed in animal tissues and plays a role in cellular differentiation and apoptosis. During the differentiation of certain cell lines, such as K562 erythroid cells, the expression of acylphosphatase increases, suggesting its involvement in these processes (Chiarugi1997Acylphosphatase). 

Acylphosphatase is also implicated in the regulation of cellular calcium and sodium homeostasis by hydrolyzing aspartyl-phosphate intermediates of membrane pumps (PAOLI2000Acylphosphatase). The enzyme's activity affects ATP hydrolysis and calcium transport in red blood cell membranes, influencing the efficiency of membrane calcium pumps (Chiarugi1997Acylphosphatase). 

In addition to its role in differentiation, acylphosphatase has been shown to possess nucleoside triphosphatase and nucleoside diphosphatase activities, which may contribute to its involvement in apoptosis (PAOLI2000Acylphosphatase). The ACYP1 gene also produces two alternative splicing forms, CT and CTsv, both of which can induce apoptosis when expressed in HeLa cells, although the CTsv form lacks acylphosphatase activity (Degl’Innocenti2004ACYP1).

## Clinical Significance
ACYP1 (acylphosphatase 1) has been identified as a significant prognostic indicator in various cancers, with its expression levels correlating with patient outcomes. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), high ACYP1 expression is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, particularly in patients with specific clinical features such as microvascular invasion and hepatitis virus infection (Zhou2022ACYP1). The gene's overexpression in LIHC is linked to increased infiltration of immune cells like Th2 cells and Tregs, suggesting a role in modulating the immune microenvironment (Zhou2022ACYP1).

In gastric cancer, ACYP1 is overexpressed and included in a prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes, indicating its potential as a biomarker for metabolic treatment (Wen2020Identification). Conversely, in head and neck cancers, ACYP1 expression appears to have a protective role, suggesting its impact may vary across cancer types (Zhou2022ACYP1).

In stomach adenocarcinoma, ACYP1 is part of a 13-gene metabolic prognostic signature associated with clinical and immune features, highlighting its role in cancer metabolism and potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2021A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ACYP1 in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.
