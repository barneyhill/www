# CPLX1

## Overview
CPLX1 is a gene that encodes the protein complexin 1, which is integral to the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons. Complexin 1 is a presynaptic protein that interacts with the SNARE complex, a group of proteins essential for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, thereby facilitating neurotransmitter release. This protein functions as a regulatory clamp, inhibiting spontaneous vesicle fusion while promoting synchronous neurotransmitter release upon stimulation. The precise modulation of synaptic transmission by complexin 1 is crucial for maintaining synaptic plasticity and efficient neuronal communication. Variations in the CPLX1 gene can lead to dysregulation of these processes, contributing to neurological disorders such as epilepsy and intellectual disabilities (Snead2019Intrinsically; Redler2017Variants).

## Structure
Complexin 1 (CPLX1) is a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, playing a crucial role in the modulation of SNARE complexes. The primary structure of CPLX1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form a central alpha-helical domain, which is essential for its function in synaptic regulation (Xu2019Complexin). This alpha-helical domain is involved in binding to SNARE complexes, which are critical for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release (An2010Realtime).

The secondary structure of CPLX1 includes alpha-helices and possibly beta-sheets, contributing to its ability to stabilize SNARE complexes during exocytosis (Glynn2007Early). The tertiary structure of CPLX1 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is necessary for its interaction with other proteins in the synaptic vesicle fusion process (Xu2019Complexin).

CPLX1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and function in synaptic transmission (Xu2019Complexin). The protein's quaternary structure involves its interaction with other proteins, particularly within the SNARE complex, to regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis effectively (An2010Realtime). Splice variants of CPLX1 can lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its function in synaptic processes (Xu2019Complexin).

## Function
Complexin 1 (CPLX1) is a presynaptic protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a process essential for neurotransmitter release in neurons. In healthy human cells, CPLX1 modulates the SNARE complex, which is crucial for the synaptic vesicle fusion process and the neurotransmitter release cascade. It functions at presynaptic nerve terminals to inhibit spontaneous SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle exocytosis while enhancing stimulated neurotransmitter release, thereby maintaining proper synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Redler2017Variants).

CPLX1 is involved in the regulation of vesicle fusogenicity by interfering with the C-terminal stability of the SNARE complex. This regulatory function is critical for ensuring the precise timing and synchronization of neurotransmitter release, which is vital for synaptic plasticity and efficient neuronal communication (Snead2019Intrinsically; Lin2013Complexin). The protein is primarily active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it contributes to the modulation of synaptic transmission and the maintenance of synaptic plasticity (Glynn2005Profound). Variations in CPLX1 can lead to a loss of its inhibitory function, resulting in enhanced spontaneous neurotransmitter release, which may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disorders (Redler2017Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPLX1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including severe infantile myoclonic epilepsy, intellectual disability, and Dravet syndrome. In a study involving two families, homozygous nonsense variants in CPLX1 were identified in patients with autosomal-recessive severe infantile myoclonic epilepsy and intellectual disability. These variants were predicted to disrupt the protein's function, particularly its ability to bind to SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicles, which is crucial for its inhibitory role in synaptic transmission (Redler2017Variants). 

In another case, a Saudi patient with Dravet syndrome was found to have a homozygous mutation in CPLX1, which was associated with global developmental delay and seizures (Alowaysi2023Generation). 

Alterations in CPLX1 expression have also been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Reduced CPLX1 mRNA levels were observed in individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal sign of PD, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for the disease. The downregulation of CPLX1 in blood was associated with increased risk of PD, particularly in individuals with the PARK4 mutation (Lahut2017Blood). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CPLX1 in various neurological conditions, emphasizing its role in synaptic regulation and potential as a diagnostic marker.

## Interactions
Complexin 1 (CPLX1) is a key component of the SNARE protein network, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. CPLX1 binds with high affinity to the assembled neuronal SNARE complex, which includes syntaxin 1 (Stx1), SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2). This interaction occurs in an anti-parallel fashion, with CPLX1's central α helix engaging the groove between Stx1 and synaptobrevin 2, forming salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds (Meyer2024Characterization; Sivakumar2024Synergistic).

CPLX1 is involved in stabilizing the SNARE complex, acting as a 'fusion clamp' to prevent premature synaptic vesicle fusion and ensuring proper neurotransmitter release. It interacts with the SNARE complex to facilitate synchronous neurotransmitter release, a process that can be disrupted by specific mutations in CPLX1 (Sivakumar2024Synergistic; Chang2015Complexin).

In addition to neuronal SNARE proteins, CPLX1 can also bind to non-neuronal SNARE proteins such as Stx6, SNAP47, and Stx7, suggesting a broader role in membrane fusion processes beyond synaptic exocytosis (Meyer2024Characterization). These interactions highlight CPLX1's versatility in modulating various cellular processes related to vesicle-mediated transport.
