# GPANK1

## Overview
GPANK1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as G-patch domain and ankyrin repeats 1, which is characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain and ankyrin repeats. The G-patch domain is typically associated with RNA binding, suggesting a potential role in RNA-related processes, while the ankyrin repeats are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, indicating that the protein may participate in forming multiprotein complexes. This dual-domain structure implies that the GPANK1 protein may have multifunctional roles within the cell, potentially involving RNA processing and interaction with other proteins. The protein's interactions, particularly with RNA helicases such as DHX15, further suggest its involvement in modulating RNA processing activities. Additionally, GPANK1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including susceptibility to HIV-related Kaposi's Sarcoma and hypertension, highlighting its significance in both cancer and cardiovascular disease (Aissani2014SNP; Memet2024Insights; Ivanova2023SexSpecific).

## Structure
GPANK1 encodes a protein characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain and ankyrin repeats. The G-patch domain is known for its role in RNA binding, which suggests that the protein may interact with RNA molecules as part of its function. Ankyrin repeats are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, indicating that GPANK1 may be involved in forming complexes with other proteins. The combination of these domains suggests a multifunctional role in cellular processes.

The protein structure of GPANK1 may include specific domains and motifs that contribute to its function. It is likely to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity, stability, and interactions. These modifications are crucial for regulating the protein's function and its interactions within the cell.

Splice variant isoforms of GPANK1 could exist, potentially altering its functional properties. These isoforms may differ in their domain composition or post-translational modification patterns, leading to variations in their biological roles. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of complexity in the regulation and function of the GPANK1 protein, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular pathways.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The GPANK1 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to certain diseases, particularly in the context of HIV-related Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) and hypertension. Studies have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' UTR of the GPANK1 gene, specifically rs7029 A4G, which is associated with a 55% increased risk of developing KS in individuals co-infected with HIV-1 and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) (Aissani2014SNP). This genetic variation suggests that alterations in GPANK1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of KS, particularly under conditions of immunosuppression (Aissani2014SNP).

In addition to its role in KS, GPANK1 has been associated with hypertension (HTN). The gene exhibits expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects in target organs such as the heart and aorta, indicating its potential involvement in the genetic architecture of hypertension (Ivanova2023SexSpecific). Furthermore, GPANK1 is involved in splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects in arterial vessels and other organs, which may influence the development of hypertension (Ivanova2023SexSpecific). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both cancer and cardiovascular disease contexts.

## Interactions
GPANK1, also known as G-patch domain and ankyrin repeats 1, is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with RNA helicases. Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated a strong physical interaction between GPANK1 and the RNA helicase DHX15, with a 7.8-fold enrichment of DHX15 compared to the FLAG control, indicating a significant interaction network (Memet2024Insights). This interaction suggests that GPANK1 may play a role in modulating the activity of DHX15, a helicase involved in RNA processing.

In addition to its interaction with DHX15, GPANK1 has been identified as a novel interactor with the pVHL30 protein in human testis, although specific details about this interaction are not provided (Falconieri2021Characterization). The presence of ankyrin repeats in GPANK1 suggests its potential involvement in forming multiprotein complexes, facilitating various cellular processes through these interactions.

While GPANK1 is implicated in protein-protein interactions, there is no specific information available about its interactions with nucleic acids or its role in RNA binding, despite the presence of a G-patch domain known for such functions (Memet2024Insights).
