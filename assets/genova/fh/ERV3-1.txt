# ERV3-1

## Overview
ERV3-1 is a human gene that encodes the envelope protein known as endogenous retrovirus group 3 member 1. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in cell fusion and immune modulation, particularly within the placenta, where it plays a crucial role in development and function (Bustamante2018Endogenous). The expression of ERV3-1 is regulated by various factors, including steroid hormones and cytokines, and is notably up-regulated during embryogenesis, especially in trophoblast differentiation (Bustamante2018Endogenous). The protein's potential immunosuppressive properties may facilitate maternal-fetal tolerance, highlighting its significance in reproductive biology (Bustamante2018Endogenous). Additionally, ERV3-1 has been implicated in several diseases, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and obesity, through its altered expression and genetic variations (Clark2023rs67047829; Nakagawa2021Expression). Despite its recognized roles, the precise molecular mechanisms of ERV3-1 remain an active area of research, underscoring its importance in both health and disease contexts.

## Function
ERV3-1, an endogenous retrovirus gene, encodes an envelope protein that plays a role in cell fusion and immune modulation in healthy human cells. This protein is notably expressed in the placenta, indicating its involvement in placental development and function (Bustamante2018Endogenous). During embryogenesis, ERV3-1 is up-regulated, particularly during trophoblast differentiation, suggesting a role in developmental processes (Bustamante2018Endogenous). The protein may influence cell-cell interactions and immune responses, potentially acting as an immunosuppressive agent in the context of mother-fetus interaction (Bustamante2018Endogenous).

In addition to its developmental roles, ERV3-1 is regulated by steroid hormones and cytokines, which may affect its expression and function in various tissues (Bustamante2018Endogenous). The gene's expression is also modulated in response to cell cycle arrest and proliferation inhibition, as observed in certain cell types (Kewitz2013Expression). Although the precise molecular mechanisms and functions of ERV3-1 in healthy cells remain unclear, its involvement in immune regulation and developmental processes highlights its potential significance in human biology (Bustamante2018Endogenous).

## Clinical Significance
ERV3-1, an endogenous retrovirus gene, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), ERV3-1 expression is notably higher in the myeloid phenotype compared to the monocytic phenotype, suggesting a role in AML development (Nakagawa2021Expression). The gene's expression is also associated with cytogenetic risk factors in AML, although its precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear (Nakagawa2021Expression).

ERV3-1 is linked to obesity through the rs67047829 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which introduces a pretermination codon potentially affecting protein production. This SNP is associated with lower body mass index (BMI) in the Polish population, suggesting a protective effect against obesity (Clark2023rs67047829; Clark2023ERV31ZNF117:). The interaction between ERV3-1 and the ZNF117 gene, which is involved in adipogenesis, may contribute to this protective effect (Clark2023ERV31ZNF117:).

In neuroblastoma, ERV3-1 expression is upregulated under certain microenvironmental conditions, indicating a potential role in tumor pathogenesis (Wieland2021Overexpression). These findings highlight the complex involvement of ERV3-1 in various diseases, warranting further research into its clinical significance.
