# ZNF805

## Overview
ZNF805 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 805, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and development. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 805 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in gene expression regulation through its interaction with DNA and possibly other proteins. Understanding the role of ZNF805 and its encoded protein could provide insights into various biological processes and potential implications in human health and disease.
