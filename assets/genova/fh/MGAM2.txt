# MGAM2

## Overview
MGAM2 is a gene that encodes the putative protein maltase-glucoamylase 2, which is believed to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The protein is categorized as a glycoside hydrolase, a class of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates. While the precise biological function of maltase-glucoamylase 2 remains to be fully elucidated, it is thought to play a role in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars, which are essential for various metabolic processes. The gene has garnered interest due to its potential involvement in metabolic pathways and its emerging association with certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Kim2020Analysis; Li2017Genomewide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MGAM2 gene have been associated with various human cancers, particularly those related to carbohydrate metabolic pathways. Although MGAM2 has not been previously linked to colorectal cancer (CRC), novel mutations in this gene have been identified in studies focusing on CRC and gastric cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer pathogenesis through pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p53 (Kim2020Analysis). In muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), MGAM2 mutations have been significantly associated with response to cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, although they do not appear to impact overall survival significantly (AcedoTerrades2024Predicting).

In the context of glucose metabolism, MGAM2 has been linked to 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) levels, a marker of glucose metabolism. Genetic variability in MGAM2 can influence 1,5-AG concentrations, which are used as a marker for postprandial hyperglycemia and glucose variability (Li2017Genomewide). Additionally, in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, variations in MGAM2, along with other carbohydrate-active enzyme genes, have been associated with the efficacy of dietary interventions, such as a FODMAP-reducing diet (ZamfirTaranu2024Functional). These findings suggest that MGAM2 may play a role in both cancer and metabolic conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.
