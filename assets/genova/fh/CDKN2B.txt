# CDKN2B

## Overview
CDKN2B is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B, also known as p15^INK4b. This protein is a member of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. By preventing the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p15^INK4b effectively halts the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Leeper2013Loss; Gil2006Regulation). The gene's expression is intricately regulated by various transcription factors and is subject to post-translational modifications, which can influence its stability and function. Mutations and alterations in CDKN2B have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Leeper2013Loss; Jafri2015Germline).

## Structure
CDKN2B, also known as p15INK4b, is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting CDK4 and CDK6. The protein's structure is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are commonly involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to bind and inhibit its target cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby preventing the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase.

The ankyrin repeat domains in CDKN2B are integral to its function, providing a structural framework that facilitates the interaction with CDK4 and CDK6. This interaction is essential for the inhibitory activity of CDKN2B, as it blocks the kinase activity necessary for cell cycle progression. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the stability and function of CDKN2B, potentially altering its ability to regulate the cell cycle effectively.

CDKN2B also has splice variants, which may result in different isoforms of the protein with potentially distinct regulatory roles. These variants can affect the protein's interaction with other molecules and its overall function in cell cycle control. The presence of these splice variants highlights the complexity of CDKN2B's regulatory mechanisms.

## Function
CDKN2B, also known as p15^INK4b, is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), thereby halting cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase, which is vital for controlling cell proliferation and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Leeper2013Loss; Gil2006Regulation). In healthy human cells, CDKN2B functions as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive cell proliferation. It achieves this by acting as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression through the retinoblastoma pathway, specifically inhibiting the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase (Leeper2013Loss).

CDKN2B is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with its target kinases. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including the Myc/Miz-1 complex, which can repress its activity, and the Arnt/Miz-1 complex, which can stimulate its expression under normoxic conditions (Aesoy2014Regulation). The gene's role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation is independent of inflammatory pathways, distinguishing its function from other cardiovascular risk factors (Leeper2013Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDKN2B gene are implicated in several diseases. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, CDKN2B is associated with heritable cardiovascular risk, particularly in smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis and aneurysm formation. Reduced expression of CDKN2B leads to increased SMC proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to conditions like abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and nonatherosclerotic intracranial aneurysms (Leeper2013Loss).

In cancer, germline mutations in CDKN2B predispose individuals to renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These mutations affect the gene's ability to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases, leading to deregulated cell cycle control and increased cell proliferation (Jafri2015Germline). CDKN2B mutations are also linked to sporadic parathyroid adenomas, where they may confer a growth advantage to parathyroid cells (CostaGuda2013Germline).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), germline mutations in CDKN2B are associated with an increased risk, particularly in pediatric cases. These mutations can predispose individuals to B-cell precursor ALL and are often inherited (GonzálezGil2021The). CDKN2B is also involved in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma, with certain polymorphisms increasing the risk of this condition (Rathi2020Molecular).

## Interactions
The CDKN2B protein, also known as p15INK4b, interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. This interaction inhibits the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), thereby preventing cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase (Jafri2015Germline). CDKN2B binds to CDK4 and CDK6 through its concave face, preventing ATP from binding productively to these kinases, which inhibits their activation (Jafri2015Germline).

The N-terminal region of CDKN2B is crucial for its binding to CDK4 and CDK6. Key residues in this region form salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with CDK6, contributing to a stable interaction network. This interaction is stronger in CDKN2B compared to similar proteins like p16 (Xia2021Dominant).

CDKN2B expression is regulated by interactions with transcription factors such as MIZ-1. The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3A (EBNA3A) interacts with MIZ-1, leading to the repression of CDKN2B transcription. This interaction involves the recruitment of EBNA3A to the CDKN2B promoter, resulting in epigenetic modifications that downregulate CDKN2B expression (Bazot2014Epstein–Barr).

Under hypoxic conditions, the interaction between Arnt and Miz-1 influences CDKN2B expression. Arnt can enhance transcription from the CDKN2B promoter, but this effect is reduced under low oxygen levels (Aesoy2014Regulation).
