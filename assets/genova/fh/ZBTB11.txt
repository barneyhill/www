# ZBTB11

## Overview
ZBTB11 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 11 protein, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its BTB domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions, and multiple zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation (Keightley2017The). ZBTB11 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and development of neutrophils, by regulating the expression of genes essential for these pathways (Wilson2020Intellectual; Keightley2017The). It acts as a transcriptional activator, which is atypical for proteins in the ZBTB family, and is essential for the expression of mitochondrial proteins and the biogenesis of respiratory complexes (Wilson2020Intellectual). Clinically, mutations in ZBTB11 are linked to intellectual developmental disorders and have implications in cancer metastasis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Sumathipala2022ZBTB11; Xu2024Oncoprotein).

## Structure
The ZBTB11 protein is characterized by several structural motifs essential for its function. It contains a conserved BTB domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, and four C-terminal zinc finger double domains that overlap with 12 predicted Kruppel zinc fingers (Keightley2017The). Uniquely, ZBTB11 has an extended N-terminal domain that includes a critical C116S mutation. This domain features a conserved His and Cys motif, forming a potential N-terminal HX6H(X29)CX2C zinc finger motif, similar to those found in foamy virus integrase and two human genes, GIN1 and NYNRIN (Keightley2017The).

The HHCC (His, His, Cys, Cys) zinc finger domain in ZBTB11 is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor. This domain is involved in metal ion coordination, with the residue Cys116 being particularly important for TP53 repression (Keightley2017The). The HHCC motif is conserved across 422 vertebrate species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Keightley2017The). Structural modeling predicts a zinc finger structure where each conserved His/Cys residue, including Cys116, coordinates a metal ion, essential for the protein's activity (Keightley2017The). The integrity of this motif is vital for ZBTB11's function, as mutations in any of the four His/Cys residues disrupt its ability to rescue the mne phenotype in bioassays (Keightley2017The).

## Function
The ZBTB11 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function in human cells. It primarily functions as a transcriptional activator, which is atypical for ZBTB proteins that are generally known as transcriptional repressors. ZBTB11 is essential for the expression of a select group of housekeeping genes, particularly those encoding mitochondrial proteins. It facilitates the recruitment of NRF-2/GABP to its target sites, which is crucial for the activation of these genes, and this association is conserved across mammalian species (Wilson2020Intellectual).

ZBTB11 is involved in the biogenesis of respiratory complexes, particularly complex I, by promoting the expression of nuclear-encoded complex I subunits. This is essential for proper mitochondrial function, as complex I is a critical component of the electron transport chain (ETC) necessary for cellular respiration and energy production (Wilson2020Intellectual). The gene is also implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial translation, supporting the synthesis of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits (Wilson2020Intellectual).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial function, ZBTB11 is involved in the development of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, through its integrase-like HHCC zinc finger domain. It represses the TP53 gene, which is crucial for regulating cell cycle control and apoptosis, thereby influencing neutrophil development and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Keightley2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZBTB11 gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in ZBTB11 have been linked to intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 69 (MRT69), characterized by brain abnormalities such as microcephaly, global developmental delay, ataxia, and hypotonia. MRI findings in affected individuals often show cerebral cortex and cerebellar atrophy, ventricular dilatation, and loss of white matter (Sumathipala2022ZBTB11). These mutations lead to impaired mitochondrial functions and RNA processing, contributing to the neurological and biochemical phenotypes observed in MRT69 (Sumathipala2022ZBTB11).

ZBTB11 mutations also result in intellectual disability (ID) with features like ventriculomegaly and cerebellar atrophy. The gene is crucial for mitochondrial function, particularly in the biogenesis of respiratory complex I, and its dysfunction can lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration and cell death (Wilson2020Intellectual).

In cancer, ZBTB11 is implicated in lung cancer metastasis. It interacts with the oncoprotein SET to promote cell migration and invasion, primarily through the transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and repression of proline-rich Gla protein 2 (PRRG2), linking to Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activation (Xu2024Oncoprotein). Overexpression of ZBTB11 is associated with poor survival in metastatic lung tumors (Xu2024Oncoprotein).

## Interactions
ZBTB11 is a transcription factor that engages in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms complexes with itself, suggesting the ability to dimerize or oligomerize, which is facilitated by its BTB domain (SatouKobayashi2024Zbtb11). ZBTB11 interacts with the transcription factor Otx2, forming a complex that is crucial for the repression of posterior genes in the anterior neuroectoderm of Xenopus. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and involves the zinc finger domains of ZBTB11 (SatouKobayashi2024Zbtb11).

In the context of mitochondrial function, ZBTB11 cooperates with NRF-2/GABP to regulate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of NRF-2/GABP to target promoters, highlighting ZBTB11's role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis (Wilson2020Intellectual).

ZBTB11 also interacts with the oncoprotein SET in lung cancer cells, forming a complex that promotes metastasis by activating the transcription of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). This interaction is direct and involves specific charged regions of both proteins (Xu2024Oncoprotein).
