# TMEM33

## Overview
TMEM33 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 33, which is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is characterized by its three transmembrane helices and plays a significant role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and modulating ER stress responses. TMEM33 interacts with various proteins, including polycystin-2 and PERK, influencing calcium signaling and the unfolded protein response, respectively. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as angiogenesis and immune regulation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancers and kidney disorders (Arhatte2019TMEM33; Sakabe2015TMEM33:; Savage2019tmem33).

## Structure
TMEM33 is a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is characterized by three transmembrane helices located at positions 32-52, 101-121, and 156-176, which are crucial for its integration into the ER membrane (Sakabe2015TMEM33:). The protein has an N-terminal region that spans amino acids 1-31 and 122-155, which is located in the ER lumen, while the cytoplasmic regions are found at amino acids 53-100 and 177-247, ending with a C-terminus (Sakabe2015TMEM33:).

TMEM33 contains specific post-translational modification sites, including a phosphorylation site at threonine 65 and ubiquitination sites at lysines 148 and 221, which may play roles in its functional regulation (Sakabe2015TMEM33:). The protein's structure is further defined by its interaction with other ER-resident proteins, such as PERK, which is part of the unfolded protein response signaling pathway (Sakabe2015TMEM33:).

In terms of its quaternary structure, TMEM33 forms complexes with other proteins, such as the ion channel polycystin-2 (PC2), influencing calcium signaling and homeostasis within renal tubular epithelial cells (Arhatte2019TMEM33). These interactions highlight TMEM33's role in maintaining ER function and cellular homeostasis.

## Function
TMEM33 is a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. It interacts with polycystin-2 (PC2), an ER calcium channel, enhancing its activity across a range of cytosolic calcium concentrations. This interaction prevents channel inactivation at higher calcium levels, thereby modulating calcium-dependent gating of PC2 and influencing calcium signaling pathways (Arhatte2019TMEM33). TMEM33 also affects the calcium refilling of endolysosomes, which is linked to lysosomal enlargement and impaired autophagic flux during ER stress (Arhatte2019TMEM33).

In endothelial cells, TMEM33 is essential for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated calcium oscillations, which are critical for angiogenesis. It regulates endothelial cell migration, filopodia formation, and the activation of signaling pathways such as ERK and Notch, which are important for angiogenic processes (Savage2019tmem33). TMEM33's role in these cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, particularly in the context of calcium signaling and ER stress response (Arhatte2019TMEM33; Savage2019tmem33).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMEM33 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In cervical cancer, specifically cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), TMEM33 is significantly overexpressed compared to normal tissues. This high expression is associated with poor prognostic outcomes, including shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival. TMEM33 acts as an independent risk factor for overall survival in CESC patients, and its knockdown in cervical cancer cells reduces cell proliferation, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Chen2022High).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TMEM33 is identified as an oncogene that promotes cancer progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Its overexpression correlates with poor patient survival and increased tumor aggressiveness. Silencing TMEM33 in LUAD cells reduces proliferation and invasiveness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (YOU2024TMEM33).

TMEM33 also plays a role in kidney diseases. It regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis in renal tubular epithelial cells and is linked to acute kidney injury (AKI). Overexpression of TMEM33 sensitizes cells to apoptosis during endoplasmic reticulum stress, contributing to renal cell vulnerability under stress conditions (Arhatte2019TMEM33).

## Interactions
TMEM33 is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which plays a role in the negative regulation of interferon (IFN) production (Lu2021A). TMEM33 also acts as a decoy substrate for TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), reducing the phosphorylation of MITA and IRF3, which are crucial for IFN induction (Lu2021A). 

In the context of ER stress, TMEM33 interacts with the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), enhancing the expression of phosphorylated eIF2a and ATF4, which are part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway (Sakabe2015TMEM33:). TMEM33 is also associated with the IRE1a-XBP1 axis of the UPR, indicating its involvement in modulating ER stress responses (Sakabe2015TMEM33:). 

Additionally, TMEM33 interacts with polycystin-2 (PC2) in renal tubular epithelial cells, influencing intracellular calcium homeostasis and autophagic flux (Arhatte2019TMEM33). These interactions highlight TMEM33's role in various cellular processes, including immune regulation and stress response.
