# PPP1R21

## Overview
The PPP1R21 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 21, a regulatory component of the serine/threonine-specific phosphatase, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, endosomal sorting, and the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Rehman2018Biallelic; Hentschel2023A; GhaziNader2023Novel). PPP1R21 is expressed in multiple tissues, notably the brain, where it is involved in neurodevelopmental processes and cellular signaling pathways (Rehman2018Biallelic; GhaziNader2023Novel). Mutations in PPP1R21 are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in normal cellular and organismal function (Rehman2018Biallelic).

## Function
The PPP1R21 gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP1R21 is implicated in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, a critical posttranslational modification that governs numerous intracellular processes (GhaziNader2023Novel). PPP1R21 is involved in endosomal sorting and maturation, co-localizing with the early endosome marker EEA1, which suggests its role in endocytic pathways (Vaneynde2022The; Rehman2018Biallelic). This protein is also associated with the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and maintaining cellular proteostasis (Hentschel2023A).

PPP1R21 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it plays a role in neurodevelopmental processes (Rehman2018Biallelic). It is involved in glycogen metabolism, cell differentiation, and muscle contractility, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Hentschel2023A). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus impacts cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of cellular and organismal outcomes (GhaziNader2023Novel). Dysfunction in PPP1R21 can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in normal cellular function (Rehman2018Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R21 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features. These disorders are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A novel mutation, c.1317_1318delAG, has been identified in an Iranian family, leading to severe developmental delays, facial deformities, and brain abnormalities (GhaziNader2023Novel). Other mutations, such as homozygous null variants, have been linked to similar phenotypes, including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and ventricular dilatation (Suleiman2018PPP1R21).

The PPP1R21 gene is implicated in metabolic and storage disorders due to its role in endolysosomal function and autophagy pathways. Mutations can lead to impaired endocytic function, contributing to symptoms like hypotonia, neurodevelopmental delay, and brain anomalies (Rehman2018Biallelic). The gene's dysfunction is also associated with proteostasis dysregulation, where increased proteasomal activity and protein aggregation are observed in patient-derived fibroblasts, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative symptoms (Hentschel2023A). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its impact on neurodevelopmental health.

## Interactions
PPP1R21, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. The protein is known to interact with PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase, which plays a crucial role in dephosphorylation reactions within cells (Suleiman2018PPP1R21). PPP1R21 has been implicated in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with studies showing its involvement in proteasome function and protein homeostasis. This interaction is suggested by the increased proteasomal activity and protein aggregates observed in cells with PPP1R21 mutations (Hentschel2023A).

The STRING database analysis has predicted associations of PPP1R21 with several genes related to developmental delay and intellectual disability, such as CRYZL1, PCDHGA10, STON1, STRN, and PIBF1 (GhaziNader2023Novel). Although an interaction with PIBF1 was suggested, co-immunoprecipitation studies did not confirm this, indicating that PPP1R21 may not directly interact with PIBF1 (Rehman2018Biallelic). PPP1R21 is also localized to early endosomes, suggesting a role in endosomal sorting or maturation pathways, which may involve interactions with proteins associated with these cellular structures (Rehman2018Biallelic).
