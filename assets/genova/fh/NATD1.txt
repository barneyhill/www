# NATD1

## Overview
NATD1 is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetyltransferase domain containing 1, which is involved in the acetylation of proteins, a critical post-translational modification that influences protein function and gene expression. The protein belongs to the family of acetyltransferases, which play a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and protein stability. NATD1 has been studied for its potential involvement in cancer pathology, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, and its association with endurance athlete status, suggesting its diverse roles in both health and disease (Semenova2019Genetic; Anuntakarun2021Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The NATD1 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein acetylation and gene expression regulation. Altered expression of NATD1 has been observed in triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting its involvement in cancer pathology (Anuntakarun2021Identification). The study by Anuntakarun et al. highlights that mutations in NATD1, among other genes, may contribute to the pathology of Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD), a condition characterized by necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis. This suggests a potential link between cancer-related genes and KFD (Anuntakarun2021Identification).

In the context of athletic performance, NATD1 has been associated with endurance athlete status. Specific alleles of NATD1 have shown suggestive significance in determining endurance performance, indicating its role in physiological processes related to athletic capabilities (Semenova2019Genetic). However, the clinical significance of NATD1 mutations or expression alterations in this context remains less clear, as the focus is primarily on its association with athletic performance rather than direct clinical implications (Semenova2019Genetic). Overall, NATD1's involvement in various biological processes underscores its potential impact on disease and health conditions.
