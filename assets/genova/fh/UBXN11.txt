# UBXN11

## Overview
UBXN11 is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 11, a member of the UBX domain protein family. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes related to protein degradation and the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. UBX domain protein 11 interacts with the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP, playing a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by extracting and degrading misfolded proteins (Rezvani2016UBXD). Additionally, UBX domain protein 11 is involved in modulating immune signaling pathways, particularly by inhibiting the NFκB signaling pathway, which is significant in the context of viral replication and immune response regulation (Hu2017Multiple). The gene has also been linked to susceptibility to viral infections, such as A(H7N9) influenza, highlighting its potential role in immune response modulation (Zhao2020Novel).

## Function
UBXN11, also known as Socius or COA-1, is a member of the UBX domain protein family involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to protein degradation and the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It contains a UBX domain that facilitates its interaction with the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP protein, a crucial component in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is essential for the extraction and degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and quality control within the cell (Rezvani2016UBXD).

UBXN11 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of protein stability and turnover. It is implicated in modulating immune signaling pathways, particularly through its role in inhibiting the NFκB signaling pathway by stabilizing IκBα, which prevents NFκB activation. This function is significant in the context of viral replication and immune response regulation (Hu2017Multiple).

Additionally, UBXN11 has been associated with susceptibility to viral infections, such as A(H7N9) influenza, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses to viral pathogens (Zhao2020Novel). Despite these insights, the specific functions of UBXN11 in healthy human cells remain less well-studied.
