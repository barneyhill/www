# FGF23

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 23, a member of the endocrine fibroblast growth factor family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism, primarily acting on the kidneys to modulate phosphate excretion and vitamin D synthesis. FGF23 is secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone tissue and functions by interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) in the presence of the co-receptor αKlotho, forming a complex that is essential for its biological activity (Ho2021FGF23; Quarles2012Role). The protein's structure is characterized by a unique β-trefoil fold, which influences its interaction with receptors and its endocrine mode of action (Goetz2007Molecular). Mutations in the FGF23 gene are linked to various disorders, including autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets and familial tumoral calcinosis, highlighting its clinical significance in mineral metabolism and bone health (Kinoshita2018XLinked; BenetPagès2004An).

## Structure
The fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) protein exhibits a unique molecular structure compared to other fibroblast growth factors. It adopts an atypical β-trefoil fold, similar to FGF19, but lacks the β11 strand found in classical, paracrine-acting FGFs (Goetz2007Molecular). The core domain of FGF23, consisting of residues 32 to 169, includes a sucrose octasulfate (SOS) molecule and was crystallized to a resolution of 1.5 Å (Goetz2007Molecular). The β1-β2 loop and the segment between β10 and β12 are identified as heparin-binding regions, with the latter containing a unique g11 helix (Goetz2007Molecular). 

FGF23's tertiary structure is characterized by a distinct conformation influenced by the β9-β10 loop, which is shorter in FGF19 subfamily members, contributing to its poor heparin-binding affinity and endocrine mode of action (Goetz2007Molecular). The C-terminal tail is crucial for its interaction with Klotho, as the shorter form of FGF23, lacking this tail, fails to bind Klotho and cannot activate signaling pathways (Goetz2007Molecular). The protein circulates in two forms, with the full-length mature form being essential for its biological function (Goetz2007Molecular).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in the body. It is primarily secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bones and acts mainly on the kidneys. In the kidneys, FGF23 reduces phosphate reabsorption by downregulating sodium-dependent phosphate transporters, NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c, in the proximal tubules, leading to increased phosphate excretion (Rausch2022The; Richter2018FGF23). FGF23 also decreases the synthesis of active vitamin D by inhibiting the enzyme 1-α-hydroxylase and increasing the expression of 24-hydroxylase, which degrades active vitamin D into inactive metabolites (Quarles2012Role; Richter2018FGF23).

FGF23 signaling requires the co-receptor Klotho, which enhances its binding affinity to FGF receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1c, to mediate its effects (Ho2021FGF23; Quarles2012Role). This interaction is essential for the regulation of phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization. FGF23 also influences the parathyroid glands by inhibiting the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), contributing to its role in phosphate regulation (Rausch2022The; Richter2018FGF23). The hormone's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as O-glycosylation, which affect its processing and function (Fukumoto2007FGF23).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGF23 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) is caused by mutations in the FGF23 gene that lead to resistance to proteolytic cleavage, resulting in elevated serum intact FGF23 levels and hypophosphatemia (Kinoshita2018XLinked; White2000Autosomal). Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC) is another condition linked to FGF23 mutations, specifically a missense mutation (S71G) that causes hyperphosphatemia by retaining the FGF23 protein within the Golgi complex, preventing its normal secretion (BenetPagès2004An).

Elevated FGF23 levels are also observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where they contribute to altered mineral metabolism and are associated with increased mortality risk (Musgrove2020Regulation). In CKD, FGF23 levels rise early and serve as a prognostic marker, correlating with outcomes and graft loss post-transplantation (Rausch2022The). Additionally, FGF23 is linked to cardiovascular diseases, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, particularly in CKD patients (Bacchetta2020Physiology). Conditions like X-linked hypophosphatemia and tumor-induced osteomalacia are characterized by overexpression of FGF23, leading to phosphate wasting (Bacchetta2020Physiology).

## Interactions
FGF23 interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) in the presence of the co-receptor αKlotho (αKl), forming a ternary complex essential for its biological activity. This interaction primarily involves FGFR1c, where αKlotho enhances the binding affinity of FGF23 to the receptor. The C-terminal tail of FGF23 is crucial for binding to the FGFR1c-Klotho complex, and this interaction is necessary for the formation of the ternary complex (Smith2019αKlotho–FGF23; Goetz2009Isolated).

FGF23 has two Klotho interaction sites in its C-terminus, which are independently capable of supporting FGF23 agonism. Both sites are required for full in vivo bioactivity, as demonstrated by the inactivity of FGF23 when both sites are mutated (Agrawal2021Identification). The C-terminal peptides of FGF23 can act as competitive antagonists, blocking FGF23 activity by preventing the formation of the FGF23-FGFR-Klotho complex (Goetz2009Isolated; Agrawal2021Identification).

In the absence of αKlotho, FGF23 can still interact with FGFRs, particularly FGFR4, albeit with reduced affinity. This αKlotho-independent signaling can occur in various tissues, including the heart and kidneys, where it may contribute to maladaptive pathways (Smith2019αKlotho–FGF23).
