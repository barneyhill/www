# HMGXB4

## Overview
HMGXB4 is a gene that encodes the HMG-box containing protein 4, a member of the High Mobility Group (HMG)-box protein family. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and influence chromatin structure, thereby playing a pivotal role in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. HMG-box containing protein 4 is involved in various cellular processes, including differentiation and development, by modulating transcriptional activity. It is particularly significant in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, where it regulates lineage differentiation. The protein also participates in forming higher-order complexes that influence transposon activity, suggesting a regulatory role in genomic stability. Additionally, HMG-box containing protein 4 interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids, contributing to transcriptional regulation networks and chromatin modification processes (Salati2015Integrative; Wang2014Suicidal; Devaraj2020HMGXB4).

## Function
HMGXB4, also known as HMG2L1, is a non-histone chromosomal protein that belongs to the High Mobility Group (HMG)-box containing protein family. It plays a significant role in chromatin organization and gene regulation by binding to DNA through its HMG-box domain. This binding influences transcriptional activity, thereby modulating the expression of target genes involved in various cellular processes such as differentiation and development (Salati2015Integrative).

In the context of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), HMGXB4 has been shown to regulate lineage differentiation. Specifically, silencing HMGXB4 in these cells promotes megakaryocyte differentiation while inhibiting erythroid differentiation. This suggests that HMGXB4 is crucial in maintaining the balance between different hematopoietic lineages, particularly affecting the expansion of the megakaryocyte lineage (Salati2015Integrative).

HMGXB4 is also involved in forming higher-order protein complexes around the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase, indicating a role in the regulation or inhibition of transposon autointegration. This interaction suggests that HMGXB4 may influence the transposition process by participating in protein-protein interactions within these complexes (Wang2014Suicidal).

## Clinical Significance
HMGXB4 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In multiple myeloma (MM), HMGXB4 is identified as one of the top biological risk genes, suggesting its potential as a drug target for MM treatment (Satria2023Identification). In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), HMGXB4 is affected by aberrant splicing events associated with U2AF1 mutations, which are linked to distinct clinical phenotypes in MDS (Pellagatti2018Impact).

HMGXB4 has also been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a missense mutation (c.577C>G/p.Leu193Val) in HMGXB4 in a proband with ASD, highlighting its potential involvement in the disorder (Kim2020Whole). Although the specific clinical significance of HMGXB4 mutations in ASD is not fully detailed, its inclusion in genetic networks related to ASD suggests a possible role in the condition.

The gene's dysregulation may also be linked to cancer, as aberrant activation of HMGXB4 in differentiated cells can lead to undesirable transactivation of target gene expression, potentially contributing to oncogenic processes (Devaraj2023HMGXB4).

## Interactions
HMGXB4 is involved in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily through its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It acts as a physical bridge between BAP18 and SETD1A, linking histone H3K4 methyltransferase and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activities. This interaction is part of a multiprotein complex capable of depositing and reading active chromatin marks at H3K4 (Devaraj2023HMGXB4; Devaraj2020HMGXB4). 

HMGXB4 is regulated by SUMOylation, which affects its binding affinity to protein partners. Non-SUMOylated HMGXB4 recruits the SETD1A/NuRF complex and acts as a transcriptional activator, while SUMOylation signals its nucleolar partition (Devaraj2020HMGXB4). The protein is also part of a transcription regulatory network involving ERK2/MAPK1-ELK1, MED1, CTCF, and POU5F1, which are implicated in pluripotency and self-renewal (Devaraj2023HMGXB4).

HMGXB4 interacts with the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase, which follows HMGXB4 during subnuclear trafficking, piggybacking both SUMOylated and non-SUMOylated functions. This interaction suggests a role in the regulation of transposon activity (Devaraj2023HMGXB4; Devaraj2020HMGXB4).
