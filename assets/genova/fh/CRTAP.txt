# CRTAP

## Overview
CRTAP (cartilage associated protein) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a critical role in collagen biosynthesis. The CRTAP protein is a non-enzymatic component of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, which also includes prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and cyclophilin B (CYPB). This complex is essential for the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues, a modification crucial for collagen stability and function (Morello2006CRTAP; Ishikawa2009Biochemical). CRTAP is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and is involved in the recruitment of collagen substrates, ensuring proper collagen folding and stability (Li2024The). Mutations in the CRTAP gene are associated with recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its clinical significance in skeletal development and maintenance (Zhou2024Genetic; Morello2006CRTAP).

## Structure
The CRTAP protein is a component of the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, which includes P3H1 and Cyclophilin B (PPIB). CRTAP lacks the common dioxygenase domain found in prolyl 3-hydroxylases but is crucial for the stability and function of the complex (Morello2006CRTAP; Li2024The). The protein structure includes a signal peptide and a tetratricopeptide-like helical domain, which is similar to the amino-terminal half of Leprecan, a protein with collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity (Morello2006CRTAP). CRTAP contains a single tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, corresponding to the second TPR of human P3H1, and four CX3C motifs involved in redox reactions and disulfide bond isomerization (Marini2009Null).

In the quaternary structure, CRTAP forms a ternary complex with P3H1 and PPIB, exhibiting a 1:1:1 stoichiometry and a molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons (Li2024The). CRTAP and the N-terminal domain of P3H1 create an 'X'-shaped base, providing structural stability to the complex (Li2024The). CRTAP's TPR1-2 domain is the primary site for recruiting collagen peptides, highlighting its role in collagen substrate recruitment (Li2024The).

## Function
CRTAP (cartilage associated protein) is a crucial component of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, which includes prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and cyclophilin B (CypB). This complex is responsible for the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues in types I, II, and III collagens. This modification is essential for proper collagen folding and stability, as it contributes to the formation of (3S)-hydroxyproline, which is critical for the structural integrity of collagen fibrils (Morello2006CRTAP; Ishikawa2009Biochemical).

CRTAP functions as a stabilizing component within the complex, ensuring the correct assembly and activity of the collagen processing machinery. It plays a significant role in maintaining the structure of the PCP complex and recruiting collagen substrates, which is vital for efficient collagen biosynthesis and function (Li2024The). CRTAP also exhibits chaperone activity, assisting in protein refolding and inhibiting thermal aggregation, which delays fibril formation and ensures proper collagen folding (Ishikawa2009Biochemical).

In healthy human cells, CRTAP is active in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms a complex with P3H1 and CypB to mediate prolyl 3-hydroxylation. This activity is crucial for normal skeletal development and maintenance, as evidenced by the severe phenotypes observed in CRTAP-deficient models, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (Chang2009Prolyl; Morello2006CRTAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRTAP gene are linked to recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), specifically types II and VII. These mutations disrupt the prolyl 3-hydroxylation of collagen, a critical post-translational modification, leading to altered collagen fibrillogenesis and connective tissue disease (Morello2006CRTAP). OI type VII, associated with CRTAP mutations, is characterized by bone fragility, rhizomelia, and severe osteoporosis. It is caused by mutations that result in frameshifts and reduced CRTAP protein levels, often due to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA (Zhou2024Genetic; Morello2006CRTAP).

In humans, CRTAP mutations can lead to severe to lethal forms of OI, with symptoms such as multiple fractures, short limbs, and severe skeletal deformities. These mutations often result in a complete loss of CRTAP function, leading to a more severe phenotype, including neonatal fractures and severe osteoporosis (Marini2009Null; Homan2014Recessive). The absence of CRTAP affects collagen modification, intracellular trafficking, and extracellular fibril assembly, contributing to deficient bone formation and potentially other connective tissue disorders (Baldridge2010Generalized; Morello2006CRTAP).

## Interactions
CRTAP (cartilage associated protein) is a key component of a ternary complex involved in collagen biosynthesis, interacting with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and cyclophilin B (CYPB). This complex is essential for the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, a modification critical for collagen stability and function (Morello2006CRTAP; Ishikawa2009Biochemical). CRTAP forms a 1:1:1 complex with P3H1 and CYPB, with a molecular mass of approximately 155 kDa, and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (Wu2019Characterization; Morello2006CRTAP).

The interactions within this complex are mediated by specific domains and motifs. The N-terminal domains of P3H1 and CRTAP, which contain CXXC motifs, are crucial for their interdependent stabilization and complex formation (Wu2019Characterization). CRTAP and P3H1 are mutually stabilizing, as the absence of one leads to the degradation of the other, highlighting their interdependence (Chang2009Prolyl). The complex also involves interactions with PPIB, where CRTAP plays a significant role in recruiting substrates and maintaining the stability of the complex (Li2024The). These interactions are essential for the proper folding and assembly of collagen, and disruptions can lead to connective tissue disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta (Morello2006CRTAP).
