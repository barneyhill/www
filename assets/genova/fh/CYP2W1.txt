# CYP2W1

## Overview
CYP2W1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily W member 1, an integral membrane enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is characterized by its unique luminal orientation within the endoplasmic reticulum, which distinguishes it from other cytochrome P450 enzymes (Guo2016Membrane). While the physiological role of CYP2W1 in healthy adult tissues remains largely undefined, it is known to be involved in the metabolism of endogenous lipids, such as lysophospholipids and fatty acids, through hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions (Xiao2012Metabolomic). Notably, CYP2W1 is predominantly expressed during fetal development and is re-expressed in certain cancers, including colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with poor clinical outcomes (Choudhary2005Expression; Pan2016Cytochrome). The enzyme's ability to bioactivate procarcinogens and anticancer pro-drugs highlights its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Gomez2010Colorectal).

## Structure
The CYP2W1 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and consists of 490 amino acids, encoded by the CYP2W1 gene located on chromosome 7p22.3 (FeiLei2015Cytochrome; Pan2016Cytochrome). The primary structure of CYP2W1 shares 78% and 66% similarity with its mouse and rat counterparts, respectively (Pan2016Cytochrome). 

The secondary and tertiary structures of CYP2W1 are predicted to resemble the characteristic cytochrome P450 3D structure, which includes a heme-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity (P.B.2002The). This structure is supported by homology modeling using rabbit CYP2C5 and human CYP2D6 as templates, suggesting the presence of specific hydrophobic and aromatic residues at the active site (Pan2016Cytochrome). 

CYP2W1 is an integral membrane protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and exhibits an unusual luminal orientation, confirmed by N-glycosylation at Asn177 (FeiLei2015Cytochrome; Guo2016Membrane). This post-translational modification results in two immunoreactive bands of 52 and 54 kDa, indicating glycosylation, which is atypical for ER-resident cytochromes (FeiLei2015Cytochrome; Guo2016The). The glycosylation is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, although its exact role remains unclear (Guo2016The).

## Function
CYP2W1 is an orphan cytochrome P450 enzyme with an unclear physiological function in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed during fetal development, particularly in tissues such as the lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, but its expression is significantly reduced or absent in adult tissues (Choudhary2005Expression; FeiLei2015Cytochrome). Despite its limited expression in adults, CYP2W1 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous substances, including lysophospholipids and fatty acids, through hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions (Pan2016Cytochrome; Xiao2012Metabolomic).

The enzyme has been shown to catalyze the oxidation of lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine, and free fatty acids, suggesting a potential role in lipid metabolism (Xiao2012Metabolomic). CYP2W1's activity in metabolizing these substrates indicates its involvement in cellular lipid processing, although the specific biological outcomes of these processes in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated (Xiao2012Metabolomic). The enzyme's expression pattern and activity suggest it may have roles beyond xenobiotic metabolism, potentially contributing to developmental processes and physiological functions in various tissues (Choudhary2005Expression).

## Clinical Significance
CYP2W1 is primarily associated with colorectal cancer, where its expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High levels of CYP2W1 expression are linked to poorer clinical outcomes and reduced survival rates in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer (Gomez2010Colorectal; Pan2016Cytochrome). The enzyme is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it correlates with tumor size, histological differentiation, and tumor stage, serving as an independent predictor of overall survival (Pan2016Cytochrome).

CYP2W1's unique expression pattern and its ability to bioactivate procarcinogens and anticancer pro-drugs make it a potential target for cancer therapy. It can activate prodrugs into cytotoxic metabolites, which could be leveraged in targeted cancer treatments (Gomez2010Colorectal; Guo2016The). The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation, with demethylation leading to increased expression in colorectal cancer (Rodriguez-Antona2009Molecular).

Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2W1, such as the CYP2W1*2 allele, have been studied for their potential impact on cancer risk, although findings have been inconsistent (Pan2016Cytochrome; Guo2016The). The enzyme's expression and activity in cancer cells suggest its role as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (Edler2009The).

## Interactions
CYP2W1, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, exhibits unique interactions due to its atypical inverted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane topology. Unlike most cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2W1 does not interact with the canonical electron donor cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) because its orientation places the active site within the ER lumen, preventing access to cytosolic electron donors (Guo2016Membrane). This orientation also precludes interaction with cytochrome b5, another common electron donor for P450 enzymes (Guo2016Membrane).

The study by Guo et al. suggests that CYP2W1 may utilize an alternative electron transfer mechanism, possibly involving intraluminal NADPH, as its activity is not affected by the inhibition of cytochrome b5 reductase (Guo2016Membrane). Despite attempts to identify potential redox partners, such as cytochrome b5 and NCB5OR, no direct interactions were confirmed, indicating that CYP2W1 might rely on an unidentified luminal electron donor (Guo2016Membrane). The glycosylation of CYP2W1 at Asn177, which confirms its luminal orientation, is functionally significant, as mutations at this site reduce its catalytic activity (Guo2016Membrane).
