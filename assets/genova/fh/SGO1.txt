# SGO1

## Overview
SGO1 is a gene that encodes the protein shugoshin 1, which plays a pivotal role in chromosome cohesion during cell division. Shugoshin 1 is a regulatory protein that ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes by protecting cohesin complexes at the centromeres during mitosis and meiosis. This protection is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy. The protein functions by recruiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to the centromeres, where it dephosphorylates cohesin subunits, thereby preventing their premature cleavage. Shugoshin 1's interactions with other proteins, such as the Chromosomal Passenger Complex and the SET protein, further underscore its essential role in cell division. Mutations in the SGO1 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome and increased cancer risk due to systemic chromosome instability (Piché2019Molecular; Tang2004Human; Xu2009Structure).

## Structure
SGO1 (shugoshin 1) is a protein involved in chromosome cohesion during cell division. Its molecular structure includes several key domains and interactions that are crucial for its function. The primary structure of SGO1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the SGO1 gene. The secondary structure features a coiled-coil domain, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins (Xu2009Structure).

The tertiary structure of SGO1 involves the formation of a homodimeric parallel coiled coil, which is important for its binding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. This interaction is critical for protecting centromeric cohesin during cell division (Xu2009Structure). The coiled-coil domain of SGO1 interacts with both the B and C subunits of the PP2A holoenzyme, forming a complex that is necessary for its function in the spindle assembly checkpoint (Xu2009Structure).

SGO1 also contains a SET-binding domain located between amino acids 280-310, which is crucial for its interaction with the SET protein, although this domain is not essential for cohesin binding (Qu2019SET). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating SGO1's activity and localization during cell division (Xu2009Structure).

## Function
SGO1 (shugoshin 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining centromeric cohesion during mitosis and meiosis in human cells. It functions by protecting cohesin complexes at the centromeres, ensuring that sister chromatids remain attached until anaphase, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Tang2004Human; Xu2009Structure). SGO1 achieves this by recruiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to the centromeres, where PP2A dephosphorylates cohesin subunits, preventing their premature cleavage by separase (Xu2009Structure; Kitajima2006Shugoshin).

The localization of SGO1 to centromeres is dependent on the phosphorylation of histone H2A by the kinase Bub1, which is crucial for preventing chromosomal instability (Kawashima2010Phosphorylation). SGO1 also interacts with the Aurora kinase complex, particularly Aurora B, which is important for its centromeric localization and function in tension-generating kinetochore attachment (Kawashima2007Shugoshin). The absence or malfunction of SGO1 leads to chromosome missegregation and mitotic arrest, highlighting its essential role in cell division (Tang2004Human). Through these mechanisms, SGO1 is vital for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing aneuploidy in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SGO1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in maintaining chromosome stability. One notable condition linked to SGO1 mutations is Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, resulting from a homozygous mutation in SGO1, specifically the K23E mutation. This mutation leads to disruptions in cell-cycle regulation, cardiac conduction, and smooth muscle regulation, affecting the heart and gut rhythm (Piché2019Molecular).

SGO1 mutations also contribute to systemic chromosome instability, which has been implicated in the development of various cancers. In mouse models, SGO1 haploinsufficiency has been linked to increased risk of colon cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and potentially other cancers due to compromised genomic stability and altered immune responses (Rao2016Systemic; Yamada2016Systemic).

Additionally, SGO1 mutations have been associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology in mouse models, where chromosome instability leads to features of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid-beta accumulation and phosphorylated Tau in the brain (Rao2018Spontaneous).

## Interactions
SGO1 (shugoshin 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its role in chromosome cohesion and segregation during cell division. SGO1 interacts with the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC), particularly through its N-terminal tail and a hydrophobic region, which are crucial for CPC recruitment to centromeres. This interaction involves the Survivin BIR domain and is enhanced by Borealin and possibly INCENP, contributing to CPC localization and function at the centromere (Abad2021Molecular).

SGO1 also interacts with the PP2A phosphatase complex, specifically binding through its coiled-coil region. This interaction is vital for protecting cohesin at centromeres by preventing its premature dissociation, thus ensuring proper chromosome segregation (Xu2009Structure; Kitajima2006Shugoshin).

The SET protein can bind to SGO1, disrupting its interaction with cohesin. This binding is dose-dependent and occurs near the cohesin-binding motif of SGO1, playing a role in promoting chromosome segregation by inhibiting SGO1's cohesion protection function (Qu2019SET).

SGO1's interaction with Borealin, a CPC subunit, is essential for CPC recruitment to chromosomes and spindle assembly, although it is not required for spindle assembly checkpoint signaling (Bonner2020The).
