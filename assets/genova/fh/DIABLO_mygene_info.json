The encoded mitochondrial protein enters the cytosol when cells undergo apoptosis, and allows activation of caspases by binding to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Overexpression of the encoded protein sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis. A mutation in this gene is associated with young-adult onset of nonsyndromic deafness-64. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
