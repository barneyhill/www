# CYP11B1

## Overview
CYP11B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 1, also known as 11β-hydroxylase. This enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is characterized by its heme-thiolate structure and plays a crucial role in steroid biosynthesis. Specifically, CYP11B1 is involved in the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, a key glucocorticoid hormone, within the adrenal cortex. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining physiological processes such as stress response, immune function, and inflammation regulation. Mutations in the CYP11B1 gene can lead to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which manifests in various clinical symptoms including hypertension and abnormal sexual development (Bureik2002The; Schiffer2015The; Krone2009Genetics).

## Structure
The CYP11B1 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by a heme-thiolate structure crucial for its enzymatic activity. The primary structure of CYP11B1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which folds into a characteristic cytochrome P450 fold. This includes a series of 12 alpha-helices (A to L) and six beta-sheets, with a core structure formed by a four-helix bundle (D, E, I, L) and two additional alpha-helices (J, K) (Roumen2007Construction).

The secondary structure of CYP11B1 is defined by these helices and sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, creating a globular shape that houses the heme-binding domain, essential for its catalytic function (Belkina2001Modelling). The active site of CYP11B1 contains many hydrophobic amino acids, and the position of the heme is a key differentiator from its isoform CYP11B2 (Belkina2001Modelling).

CYP11B1 does not typically form quaternary structures, as it functions as a monomer. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The structural features of CYP11B1 are critical for its role in steroid biosynthesis, particularly in the synthesis of cortisol.

## Function
The CYP11B1 gene encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of glucocorticoids in humans. This enzyme is primarily localized in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, where it catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, the major human glucocorticoid (Bureik2002The; Schiffer2015The). Cortisol plays a significant role in regulating energy mobilization, the stress response, and the immune response (Bureik2002The).

CYP11B1 also catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, although its primary function is the production of cortisol rather than aldosterone synthesis (Bureik2002The; Erdmann1995Human). The enzyme operates as a pure 11β-hydroxylase, lacking 18-hydroxylase or 18-oxidase activity, which distinguishes it from its closely related counterpart, CYP11B2 (Bureik2002The).

The activity of CYP11B1 is regulated by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through a cAMP-regulated signaling pathway, ensuring appropriate glucocorticoid secretion in response to stress (Schiffer2015The). The enzyme's function is essential for maintaining the balance of corticosteroids, which are vital for various physiological processes, including stress response, immune function, and regulation of inflammation (Schiffer2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP11B1 gene are primarily associated with 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11-OHD), a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This condition is the second most common variant of CAH, accounting for approximately 5-8% of all cases (Polat2014Characterisation; Krone2009Genetics). 11-OHD results from impaired enzyme activity, leading to the accumulation of precursor steroids and increased adrenal androgen synthesis. This can cause prenatal virilization of female genitalia, rapid growth, and accelerated bone maturation in both sexes (Polat2014Characterisation; Krone2006Analyzing).

Patients with 11-OHD often experience hypertension due to elevated levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a weak mineralocorticoid (ElMaouche2017Congenital). The condition is divided into classic and non-classic forms. The classic form is characterized by severe symptoms such as genital ambiguity and hypertension, while the non-classic form presents milder symptoms like mild virilization and precocious pseudopuberty (Polat2014Characterisation; Menabò2013Congenital).

A notable mutation, p.R448H, is prevalent among Moroccan Jews due to a founder effect, leading to a higher incidence of 11-OHD in this population (White1991A). Novel mutations continue to be discovered, contributing to the genetic diversity of the condition (Krone2009Genetics).

## Interactions
CYP11B1 interacts primarily with adrenodoxin (Adx) and adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) to facilitate electron transfer necessary for its enzymatic activity in steroid biosynthesis. The formation of the CYP11B1/Adx complex is driven by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Key charged amino acids in CYP11B1, such as Arg366, Lys370, Arg453, and Lys357, interact with Asp72, Asp76, and Asp79 of Adx. Hydrophobic interactions also play a significant role, particularly around Asp80 of Adx (Yablokov2019A).

The interaction between CYP11B1 and Adx is crucial for its function, as it modulates electron transfer rates, which are essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. Truncated mutants of Adx, such as Adx 4-114 and Adx 4-108, have been shown to increase electron transport to CYP11B1, enhancing aldosterone formation (Bureik2002The). The CYP11B1/Adx complex is characterized by a lower association rate constant compared to other mitochondrial CYP/Adx complexes, possibly due to additional hydrophobic interactions (Yablokov2019A).

Phosphorylation of CYP11B1 and Adx can influence their interaction, potentially affecting steroidogenesis under conditions where Adx is limited (Schiffer2015The). The interaction is also modulated by substrate binding, which can alter the stability and affinity of the CYP11B1-Adx complex (Yablokov2021Substrateinduced).
