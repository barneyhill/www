# KMT5C

## Overview
KMT5C, also known as lysine methyltransferase 5C, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. The protein, KMT5C, is a lysine methyltransferase that specifically catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me3), a modification crucial for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase due to its role in transferring methyl groups to lysine residues on histones. KMT5C is essential for the organization of constitutive heterochromatin, particularly at pericentromeric regions, and plays a role in regulating gene expression by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids (Zhao2020KMT5c; Strickfaden2021KMT5C). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, where alterations in KMT5C are associated with tumorigenesis and resistance to targeted therapies (Pal2022Loss; Agredo2023Histone).

## Structure
The KMT5C protein contains several key domains that contribute to its function and localization. It includes an enzymatic SET domain responsible for catalyzing the production of H4K20me3, an RNA-binding domain (RBD), and a Chromocenter Retention Domain (CRD) that localizes to constitutive heterochromatin (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). The CRD is crucial for chromocenter localization and exhibits a bipartite structure with two conserved domains (CD1 and CD2) separated by a non-conserved linker region. These domains contain conserved motifs, such as a His-x4-Cys-x3-4-Cys motif and a L-x5-6-V-x1-L hydrophobic motif (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). 

The CRD's dynamic behavior is largely contained within this discrete region, and it shows efficient chromocenter localization across different species, indicating recognition of conserved pericentromeric heterochromatin features (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). The protein's phase separation properties are influenced by aromatic residues in the chromodomain region, particularly tryptophan, which supports stable binding and retention within heterochromatin (Strickfaden2019KMT5C). 

KMT5C's behavior is also influenced by short linear motifs (SLiMs) within the CRD, which play a dominant role in encoding its retentive behavior (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). The protein's ability to maintain a liquid-like state while limiting exit from chromocenters is a key feature of its structure (Strickfaden2019KMT5C).

## Function
KMT5C, also known as SUV420H2, is a lysine methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in chromatin dynamics by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me3). This modification is primarily associated with constitutive heterochromatin, particularly at pericentromeric regions, and is essential for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). KMT5C exhibits a unique liquid-like behavior within chromocenters, where it is retained with limited exchange with the nucleoplasm, contributing to the stability and compartmentalization of heterochromatin condensates (Strickfaden2021KMT5C).

KMT5C's activity is dependent on pre-existing histone modifications, such as H3K9me3, and the presence of HP1 chromobox proteins, which facilitate its recruitment to chromocenters (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). The enzyme's function is critical for the spatial control of H4K20me3 distribution, preventing its spread outside constitutive heterochromatin and ensuring the specificity of this epigenetic mark (Strickfaden2021KMT5C). In addition to its role in chromatin organization, KMT5C is involved in regulating adipocyte thermogenesis by modulating the expression of thermogenic genes, such as Ucp1, through the repression of Trp53 expression (Zhao2020KMT5c).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KMT5C gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the loss of KMT5C is associated with resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib. This resistance is mediated through the upregulation of the oncogene MET via the long noncoding RNA LINC01510. The loss of KMT5C leads to decreased levels of H4K20me3, a histone modification linked to transcriptional repression, resulting in increased MET expression and drug resistance (Pal2022Loss).

KMT5C also acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, including lung, colon, bladder, liver, breast, and osteosarcoma. Its downregulation is linked to increased tumorigenic potential, cell proliferation, and invasiveness. In breast cancer, for instance, KMT5C downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and invasiveness, potentially involving microRNAs such as miR-29a, which target KMT5C and promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition (Agredo2023Histone).

These findings underscore the potential of KMT5C as a biomarker for predicting resistance to targeted therapies and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the KMT5C-MET-LINC01510 axis in NSCLC (Pal2022Loss).

## Interactions
KMT5C, also known as lysine methyltransferase 5C, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. KMT5C is involved in the retention and liquid-like behavior within chromocenters, where it interacts with heterochromatin through its Chromocenter Retention Domain (CRD). This domain contains conserved sequence features that facilitate its localization and retention in heterochromatin, allowing KMT5C to maintain robust compartmentalization while exhibiting liquid-like mobility (Strickfaden2019KMT5C).

KMT5C also interacts with the transcription factor YBX1, which recruits it to the Trp53 promoter, thereby suppressing Trp53 expression. This interaction is crucial for regulating adipocyte thermogenesis and systemic energy expenditure (Zhao2020KMT5c). In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, KMT5C is regulated by circMYLK, which acts as a sponge for miR-29a, leading to the upregulation of KMT5C expression. This interaction promotes cancer progression by affecting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Gao2020&lt; p&gt; Circular).

These interactions highlight KMT5C's role in various cellular processes, including chromatin dynamics, gene expression regulation, and disease progression.
