# XCR1

## Overview
XCR1, or X-C motif chemokine receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the immune system's regulation and function. The XCR1 protein is predominantly expressed on a specialized subset of dendritic cells, including CD141+ (BDCA3+) dendritic cells in humans and their murine counterparts, CD8α+ dendritic cells. These cells are integral to the process of antigen cross-presentation, which is crucial for the activation of CD8+ T cells and the initiation of cytotoxic immune responses against intracellular pathogens and tumor cells (Bachem2010Superior; Crozat2010The). The receptor's interaction with its sole ligand, XCL1, facilitates the migration and activation of these dendritic cells, thereby enhancing immune surveillance and response (Dorner2009Selective; Yamazaki2010Conservation). Given its specialized role in immune regulation, XCR1 is a potential target for vaccine development and immunotherapy (Lei2012XCL1; Crozat2010The).

## Function
XCR1 (X-C motif chemokine receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in the immune system by mediating interactions between dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells. It is selectively expressed in a subset of dendritic cells, specifically CD141+ (BDCA3+) DCs in humans, which are homologous to CD8α+ DCs in mice. These cells are crucial for cross-presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells, a process essential for initiating cytotoxic immune responses against intracellular pathogens and tumor cells (Bachem2010Superior; Crozat2010The).

XCR1 facilitates the migration and activation of these dendritic cells in response to its ligand, XCL1, which is produced by activated NK and CD8+ T cells. This interaction is vital for optimizing the expansion and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells, enhancing immune surveillance and response (Dorner2009Selective; Yamazaki2010Conservation). The XCR1-XCL1 axis is also involved in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by supporting T cell survival and promoting a typical intestinal phenotype (Ohta2016Crucial).

The receptor's expression is restricted to specific DC subsets, highlighting its specialized role in immune regulation and its potential as a target for vaccine development and immunotherapy (Lei2012XCL1; Crozat2010The).

## Clinical Significance
The XCR1 gene has significant clinical implications in cancer and immune system regulation. Alterations in XCR1 expression are associated with various cancers, where its expression is generally lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is linked to poor survival outcomes, suggesting that XCR1 could serve as a prognostic marker in cancers such as skin cutaneous melanoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma (Cui2023Systematic). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, elevated XCR1 expression is observed, indicating a specific role in this cancer type (Cui2023Systematic).

XCR1 expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells, which are crucial for tumor immunity. This suggests that XCR1 may influence the tumor microenvironment and impact cancer prognosis (Cui2023Systematic). The interaction between XCR1 and its ligand XCL1 enhances the cross-presentation of dendritic cells to CD8+ T cells, promoting tumor immunity (Cui2023Systematic).

In the context of intestinal immune homeostasis, XCR1-expressing dendritic cells are essential for maintaining T cell populations. Deficiencies in XCR1 can lead to altered T cell phenotypes and increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation, such as colitis (Ohta2016Crucial).

## Interactions
XCR1, a G protein-coupled receptor, primarily interacts with the chemokine XCL1. This interaction is highly specific, as XCR1 is the only known receptor for XCL1, and XCL1 is the only ligand for XCR1. This monogamous relationship facilitates the chemoattraction of XCR1-expressing dendritic cells (DCs), particularly CD8+ DCs in mice and CD141+ DCs in humans, which are crucial for antigen cross-presentation and the activation of CD8+ T cells (Kroczek2018StructureFunction; Lei2012XCL1; Dorner2009Selective).

The binding of XCL1 to XCR1 triggers several cellular responses, including calcium mobilization and chemotaxis, which are essential for the migration and activation of these DCs (Le2021Efficient; Dorner2009Selective). This interaction enhances the survival and differentiation of CD8+ T cells into IFN-g-secreting effectors, optimizing immune responses against pathogens and tumors (Dorner2009Selective).

XCR1 is also involved in the cross-presentation of antigens, a process that is critical for the initiation of cytotoxic immune responses. This function is particularly important in the context of vaccine development, where targeting XCR1 can enhance the delivery of antigens to DCs, thereby boosting CD8+ T cell responses (Kroczek2018StructureFunction; Le2021Efficient).
