# RAB10

## Overview
RAB10 is a gene that encodes a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, specifically the RAB10 protein. This protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, and is involved in regulating intracellular membrane trafficking. RAB10 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the dynamics and morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and lysosomal homeostasis. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its interactions with other proteins and its localization within the cell. RAB10's interactions with proteins like Myosin Va, RILPL2, and MARCKS are essential for its functions in processes such as ciliogenesis, axon development, and ER dynamics. Clinically, alterations in the RAB10 gene have been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer, highlighting its significance in both neurodegenerative and oncological contexts (English2012Rab10; Zhuo2023RAB10; Ridge2017Linkage; Barnekow2009Chapter).

## Structure
RAB10 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, characterized by a core fold consisting of six beta-sheets and five alpha-helices. This structure includes nucleotide and phosphate/Mg2+ binding regions, which are crucial for its function as a molecular switch cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states (Barnekow2009Chapter). The protein undergoes conformational changes in the switch I and switch II regions upon GTP binding and hydrolysis, which are essential for its activity (Barnekow2009Chapter).

RAB10 contains a hypervariable carboxyterminal domain that influences its targeting to specific cellular compartments. This domain ends with a prenylation site, facilitating membrane attachment (Barnekow2009Chapter). The protein also features a GTP-binding domain, which is a common characteristic of Rab GTPases (Li2015Rab).

Post-translational modifications of RAB10 include phosphorylation, particularly at the T73 site within the conserved switch II region, which affects its interactions with other proteins (Homma2020Rab). RAB10 is also subject to ubiquitination, which plays a role in its recruitment to specific cellular structures (Homma2020Rab). The presence of splice variant isoforms may alter its function or localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
RAB10 is a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, primarily regulating intracellular membrane trafficking. In healthy human cells, RAB10 plays a crucial role in the dynamics and morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It localizes to the ER, including the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER cisternae and tubules, and is essential for maintaining the balance between cisternal and tubular ER structures. RAB10 influences ER tubule dynamics and fusion events, with its depletion leading to fewer successful fusion events (English2012Rab10).

RAB10 is also involved in the insulin-stimulated translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes, which is vital for glucose uptake. It participates in basement membrane secretion and the transport of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), important for innate immune responses (Wang2017RAB10).

In macrophages, RAB10 is implicated in lysosomal homeostasis and stress response, particularly in the release of lysosomal contents during overload and in the repair of damaged lysosomes. It also affects macropinosome recycling, switching its effector from EHBP1L1 to RILPL2, which may enhance chemotactic signaling (Xu2021The). RAB10's function is tightly regulated by its GTP-binding state, which is crucial for its localization and activity in these processes (Liu2020LRRK2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAB10 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and breast cancer. In the context of AD, a rare variant in the RAB10 gene, rs142787485, has been associated with a reduced risk of developing the disease. This variant is thought to confer resilience to AD, particularly in individuals who are cognitively normal despite carrying the APOE ε4 allele, a known risk factor for AD. The knockdown of RAB10 in neuroblastoma cells has been shown to decrease levels of Aβ42, a peptide associated with AD pathology, suggesting that RAB10 may influence amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Aβ production (Tavana2018RAB10:; Ridge2017Linkage).

In breast cancer, RAB10 is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. Its elevated expression is linked to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. Knockdown of RAB10 in breast cancer cell lines results in reduced cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness, indicating its potential role as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment (Zhuo2023RAB10). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RAB10 in both neurodegenerative and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
RAB10, a member of the RAS oncogene family, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular membrane trafficking. It interacts with Myosin Va (MyoVa) and RILPL2, forming a complex that is significant during ciliogenesis blockade. This interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of RAB10 by LRRK2, particularly in the presence of the pathogenic LRRK2 mutation R1441G, which relocalizes MyoVa and RILPL2 to perinuclear structures containing phosphorylated RAB10 (Yanatori2020LRRK2phosphorylated).

RAB10 also interacts with MARCKS, a protein involved in the membrane targeting of Rab10-positive post-Golgi vesicles, which is essential for axon development. This interaction is mediated by the MARCKS effector domain and is crucial for the docking and fusion of Rab10 vesicles (Xu2014MARCKS).

In the context of neuronal polarization, RAB10 interacts with MYO5B, a motor protein that regulates the biogenesis of post-Golgi Rab10 carriers. This interaction is necessary for the polarized distribution of Rab10 vesicles, which is essential for axon development (Liu2013Myosin).

RAB10 also forms complexes with proteins involved in ER dynamics, such as CEPT1 and PIS, suggesting a role in ER tubule extension and fusion (English2012Rab10).
