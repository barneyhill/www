# SCARF2

## Overview
SCARF2, or scavenger receptor class F member 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular processes such as endocytosis and cell adhesion. The protein functions as a scavenger receptor, playing a pivotal role in binding and internalizing various ligands, including modified lipoproteins, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and immune responses. SCARF2 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the uptake and clearance of potentially harmful substances and supports cell-to-cell communication and structural integrity. Mutations in the SCARF2 gene are linked to Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and joint abnormalities (AlQattan2018Inclusion; Bedeschi2010Unmasking). The study of SCARF2, including its role in both human and canine models, provides valuable insights into its molecular functions and associated pathologies (Hytönen2016Molecular).

## Function
SCARF2, or scavenger receptor class F member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including endocytosis and cell adhesion. This protein functions as a scavenger receptor, which is essential for binding and internalizing various ligands, such as modified lipoproteins. SCARF2 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating immune responses. By participating in endocytosis, SCARF2 helps in the uptake and clearance of potentially harmful substances, contributing to the cell's ability to manage its internal environment effectively. Its role in cell adhesion is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and facilitating communication between cells. Through these functions, SCARF2 supports the organism's overall health by ensuring efficient cellular operations and robust immune defense mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCARF2 gene are associated with Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome (VDEGS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and joint abnormalities. Clinical features of VDEGS include blepharophimosis, arachnodactyly, joint contractures, and skeletal deformities (AlQattan2018Inclusion; Bedeschi2010Unmasking). The syndrome is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in SCARF2, with homozygous mutations identified in patients from consanguineous families (Hildebrandt2021Further; Bedeschi2010Unmasking).

In some cases, VDEGS is linked to a 22q11.2 microdeletion, which can unmask a recessive mutation in SCARF2, leading to the absence of a functional gene (Bedeschi2010Unmasking). This deletion is also associated with other conditions, such as velo-cardio-facial/Di George syndrome, due to its location in the same chromosomal region (AlQattan2018Inclusion).

In addition to human cases, a canine model has been developed, where a 2-bp deletion in the SCARF2 gene causes a skeletal syndrome in Wire Fox Terriers, mirroring the human condition. This model provides insights into the molecular pathology of VDEGS and serves as a resource for understanding SCARF2 functions (Hytönen2016Molecular).
