# C1GALT1

## Overview
C1GALT1, or core 1 synthase glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of O-glycans, specifically catalyzing the formation of the core 1 structure, a fundamental component of mucin-type O-glycans. The C1GALT1 protein is essential for various physiological processes, including protein processing, secretion, and cellular signaling, by facilitating the addition of galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues. It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is involved in critical biological functions such as angiogenesis and immune response. Dysregulation of C1GALT1 expression or function is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and IgA nephropathy, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Sun2021C1GALT1; Dong2021A; Li2007Variants).

## Structure
C1GALT1, also known as T-synthase, is a type II transmembrane protein involved in the biosynthesis of O-glycans. The protein is composed of 363 amino acids and is encoded by the c1galt1 gene located on chromosome 7q21.3, consisting of three exons (Wan2021Expression). The primary structure of C1GALT1 includes a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large luminal domain, which contains the catalytic site responsible for its glycosyltransferase activity (Xia2022Update).

C1GALT1 typically forms an 84/86 kDa disulfide-bonded homodimer, although its active form is believed to be a 42/43 kDa monomeric protein (Wan2021Expression). The protein requires the molecular chaperone COSMC for proper folding and dimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Without COSMC, improperly folded C1GALT1 is degraded (Sun2021C1GALT1). Once properly folded, C1GALT1 is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it competes with other glycosyltransferases to catalyze the formation of the Core-1 carbohydrate structure (Tian2024Unraveling).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for the function of C1GALT1, impacting its stability and activity (Xia2022Update). The precise molecular structure, including specific secondary and tertiary structures, remains less well-defined in the available literature.

## Function
C1GALT1, or core 1 synthase glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-β-galactosyltransferase 1, is a crucial enzyme involved in the O-glycosylation of proteins, a significant post-translational modification process. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of β1,3-bonded galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), forming the core 1 structure of mucin-type O-glycans. These structures are essential precursors for many cell surface mucin O-glycans and secreted glycoproteins, playing a vital role in protein processing, secretion, stability, and ligand binding (Sun2021C1GALT1).

C1GALT1 is active in the Golgi apparatus and is essential for various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, platelet production, and kidney development. It is involved in the formation of the follicular basal layer and the follicular environment, which are critical for maintaining the normal structure of follicles (Sun2021C1GALT1). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its chaperone, Cosmc, which assists in its folding and maturation (Sun2021C1GALT1).

In healthy human cells, C1GALT1-mediated O-glycosylation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the colonic mucus layer, preventing bacterial penetration and inflammation (Sun2021C1GALT1). The expression of normal O-glycans is associated with health and homeostasis, underscoring the enzyme's importance in normal cellular functions (Sun2021C1GALT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the C1GALT1 gene are implicated in several diseases. In cancer, C1GALT1 can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context. For instance, high expression of C1GALT1 in liver cancer is linked to advanced tumors and poor prognosis, while in pancreatic cancer, its loss leads to increased tumor aggressiveness and metastasis (Sun2021C1GALT1; Chugh2018Disruption). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the knockout of C1GALT1 results in increased proliferation, migration, and tumorigenicity, with altered glycosylation patterns contributing to tumor aggressiveness (Chugh2018Disruption).

C1GALT1 is also associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a kidney disorder characterized by abnormal glycosylation of IgA1. Genetic variations in C1GALT1 are linked to IgAN susceptibility, with decreased expression correlating with increased levels of galactose-deficient IgA1, a risk factor for the disease (Sun2021C1GALT1; Li2007Variants).

In Tn syndrome, a rare blood disorder, C1GALT1 dysfunction leads to the exposure of Tn antigens on blood cells, potentially causing hemolysis and other hematological issues (Sun2021C1GALT1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of C1GALT1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
C1GALT1, a glycosyltransferase enzyme, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence cancer progression. In gastric cancer, C1GALT1 modifies the O-glycosylation of integrin α5, which is crucial for activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Dong2021A). This interaction highlights the role of C1GALT1 in regulating integrin-mediated signaling pathways.

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), C1GALT1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing its phosphorylation and EGF-binding affinity through O-glycosylation. This modification is essential for cell survival and invasiveness, and the interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Lin2018C1GALT1).

C1GALT1 also interacts with MUC1, a glycoprotein involved in cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, this interaction affects immune evasion and metastasis, as C1GALT1 influences the glycosylation of MUC1, impacting its function (Tian2024Unraveling). In bladder cancer, C1GALT1 modifies glycoproteins like MUC16, affecting cell proliferation and migration (Tan2022Dysregulation).

These interactions underscore the role of C1GALT1 in modulating protein functions through glycosylation, impacting various signaling pathways and cellular behaviors in cancer.
