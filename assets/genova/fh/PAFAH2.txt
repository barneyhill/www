# PAFAH2

## Overview
The PAFAH2 gene encodes the enzyme platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase type II (PAF-AH II), which is a member of the phospholipase A2 family. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze and inactivate platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid mediator, by removing the acetyl group at the sn-2 position. PAF-AH II plays a significant role in regulating PAF levels and mitigating its effects, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress (Dong2021Platelet; Hattori1996cDNA). The enzyme is distinguished by its classic lipase α/β hydrolase fold and contains a catalytic triad essential for its function. It is active in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of cells, with its activity modulated by oxidative stress and ATP (Dong2021Platelet; Kono2019Plateletactivating). The PAFAH2 gene has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2023Better; Elshatory2003Early).

## Structure
The PAFAH2 gene encodes the enzyme intracellular platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase type II (PAF-AH II), which is a 40-kDa monomeric protein consisting of 392 amino acids (Dong2021Platelet; Kono2019Plateletactivating). The primary structure includes a GXSXG motif, which is characteristic of lipases and esterases, and is essential for its enzymatic activity (Kono2019Plateletactivating). The enzyme's catalytic triad is composed of Ser236, Asp259, and His314, which are crucial for its function (Dong2021Platelet; Kono2019Plateletactivating).

PAF-AH II features a classic lipase α/β hydrolase fold, a common structural motif in enzymes of this class (Kono2019Plateletactivating). It also contains an N-terminal myristoylation signal, which facilitates its distribution between the cytosol and membrane fractions (Dong2021Platelet; Kono2019Plateletactivating). This post-translational modification is important for the enzyme's membrane association and function.

The enzyme exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with its oligomeric state influenced by oxidative stress and the presence of the N-myristoyl group (Dong2021Platelet). The myristoyl group is also implicated in the enzyme's reversible association with membranes and may affect its oligomeric state and trafficking (Karasawa2015Overview).

## Function
PAFAH2 encodes the enzyme platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase II (PAF-AH II), which is a member of the phospholipase A2 family. This enzyme plays a crucial role in hydrolyzing and inactivating platelet-activating factor (PAF) by removing the acetyl group at the sn-2 position, thus regulating PAF levels and mitigating its pro-inflammatory effects (Dong2021Platelet; Hattori1996cDNA). PAF-AH II is involved in the degradation of oxidized phospholipids, which are produced during oxidative stress and can contribute to various diseases (Dong2021Platelet). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining redox balance and preventing cell damage by selectively releasing oxidized sn-2 fatty acyl chains from membrane phospholipids, providing an antioxidant function (Dong2021Platelet).

In healthy human cells, PAF-AH II is active in both the cytosol and membrane fractions, translocating to the membrane in response to oxidative stress to degrade oxidized phospholipids (Dong2021Platelet). This translocation is associated with changes in its oligomeric state, where it exists as a dimer in the cytoplasm under unstressed conditions and dissociates into monomers to bind to membranes under oxidative stress (Dong2021Platelet). The enzyme's activity is modulated by ATP and involves a catalytic triad consisting of Ser236, Asp259, and His314 (Dong2021Platelet).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAFAH2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), reduced mRNA expression of PAFAH2 is associated with increased cell migration, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression. The gene is part of a six metabolism-related gene signature used to predict clinical outcomes in ccRCC, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2023Better).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, PAFAH2 is highly up-regulated in Cln1-knockout mouse brains, possibly as a compensatory response to lipid substrate accumulation. This up-regulation may be linked to oxidative stress, a factor in Batten disease pathophysiology (Elshatory2003Early).

PAFAH2 also plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced damage. In PAFAH2(-/-) mice, there is increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, suggesting that the gene is crucial for detoxifying oxidized phospholipids and protecting against liver injury (Nomura2016Lipases). These findings highlight the importance of PAFAH2 in managing oxidative stress and its potential impact on related conditions.
