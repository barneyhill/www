# TSACC

## Overview
The TSACC gene encodes the TSSK6 activating cochaperone, a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of testis-specific serine/threonine kinase 6 (TSSK6) activity. This protein is involved in the post-translational modification processes that are essential for spermatogenesis, particularly in the maturation of spermatozoa. As a cochaperone, it assists in the proper folding and function of TSSK6, thereby influencing fertility and reproductive success. The TSACC gene and its protein product are of significant interest in the study of male infertility and reproductive biology, as mutations or dysregulation in this gene may lead to impaired sperm function and reduced fertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
