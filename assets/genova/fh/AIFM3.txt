# AIFM3

## Overview
AIFM3, or apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 3, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in critical cellular processes, including apoptosis and energy metabolism. The protein, categorized as an oxidoreductase, plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function by participating in oxidative respiration and electron transport (Novo2020The). AIFM3 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with significant activity in the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and survival (Lozic2021CRKL). Its involvement in apoptosis is linked to its capacity to modulate mitochondrial membrane potential, which is crucial for cell survival during development (Lozic2021CRKL). Additionally, AIFM3 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, where its altered expression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic; Zheng2019Clinical).

## Structure


## Function
AIFM3, also known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 3, is a gene encoding a protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular homeostasis. The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria and is involved in oxidoreductase activities, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Novo2020The). AIFM3 contains a flavin-dependent oxidoreductase domain, suggesting its involvement in oxidative respiration and electron transport processes (Novo2020The).

In healthy human cells, AIFM3 is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues and is particularly active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to energy metabolism and cell survival (Lozic2021CRKL). During human kidney development, AIFM3 is expressed mainly in the tubules and plays a role in energy production, aligning with the developmental changes in the kidney, such as increased solute and water reabsorption (Lozic2021CRKL). The protein's expression patterns suggest its involvement in maintaining glomerulotubular balance and supporting nephrogenesis and tubular maturation (Lozic2021CRKL).

AIFM3's role in apoptosis is linked to its ability to reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, which is essential for promoting cell survival and energy production during critical developmental periods (Lozic2021CRKL).

## Clinical Significance
AIFM3 (apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria associated 3) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, AIFM3 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage, correlating with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients. AIFM3's interaction with the tumor suppressor PTPN12 suggests a role in caspase-dependent apoptosis, potentially impacting breast cancer prognosis (Zheng2019Clinical).

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), AIFM3 is also overexpressed, particularly in cases with lymph node metastasis. This overexpression is linked to increased cell motility, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer metastasis. Silencing AIFM3 in CCA cell lines reduces these metastatic properties, indicating its role in tumor progression. High AIFM3 expression in CCA is associated with shorter survival times, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic).

Additionally, AIFM3 has been identified as having a copy number gain in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), suggesting a potential role in this cancer type, although the clinical significance of this alteration requires further investigation (Araujo2021Comprehensive).

## Interactions
AIFM3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to apoptosis and metastasis. In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells, AIFM3 has been shown to interact with formin-like protein 3 (FMNL3). This interaction is characterized by a stable binding affinity, as indicated by a Vina score of -8.2 kcal/mol, suggesting a strong interaction between the two proteins (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic). The interaction between AIFM3 and FMNL3 is implicated in cell migration and metastasis, highlighting AIFM3's role in cancer progression (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic).

AIFM3 is also associated with magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP), indicating its involvement in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic). The study of AIFM3 in CCA cells revealed that its silencing leads to reduced cell invasion and migration, further supporting its role in metastasis (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic).

Bioinformatic analysis has identified several proteins related to AIFM3, including PIK3CA, AKT2, SNAIL1, NFKB1, MMP2, and MMP7, which are involved in migration and metastatic pathways. AIFM3 is directly associated with FMNL3 and indirectly with these other proteins, suggesting a complex network of interactions that facilitate its role in cell motility and invasion (CHUAON2021Bioinformatic).
