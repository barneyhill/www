# MRPL52

## Overview
MRPL52 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L52, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Cheong2020Expression; Li2020Quantitative). As a structural constituent of the mitoribosome, MRPL52 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism across various tissues and developmental stages (Cheong2020Expression). Alterations in the expression of MRPL52 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research (Elsadany2021Transcriptional; Bao2022Potential).

## Structure
MRPL52 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit, and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The primary structure of MRPL52 consists of its unique amino acid sequence, which determines its specific function within the ribosome. The secondary structure of MRPL52 includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and interaction with other ribosomal proteins. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of MRPL52, allowing it to fit precisely within the ribosomal complex. In terms of quaternary structure, MRPL52 assembles with other ribosomal proteins to form the functional 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.

Post-translational modifications of MRPL52 may influence its function and localization within the mitochondria, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context. Splice variants of MRPL52 could potentially alter its structure and function, but specific isoforms are not mentioned. Understanding the structural aspects of MRPL52 is essential for comprehending its role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and its impact on cellular energy production.

## Function
MRPL52 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit, and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It facilitates the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells (Li2020Quantitative). This protein is involved in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is necessary for mitochondrial translation and energy metabolism (Cheong2020Expression). 

In healthy human cells, MRPL52 contributes to the synthesis of key protein components in the electron transport chain (ETC) complex, impacting energy metabolism and cellular respiration (Li2020Quantitative). The mitochondrial ribosome, including MRPL52, is responsible for translating mRNAs encoded in mitochondrial DNA, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Cheong2020Expression). 

The expression of MRPL52 and other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins is consistent across various tissues and developmental stages, indicating their essential roles in mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Cheong2020Expression). Changes in the expression of MRPL52 can affect mitochondrial ribosome function, thereby influencing the synthesis of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and energy metabolism (Li2020Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL52 has been implicated in various cancer-related processes. It is part of a gene fusion with LINC00152-USF1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis through altered gene expression (Bao2022Potential). In colorectal cancer, MRPL52 is included in a 19-gene signature that has shown better predictive value for survival outcomes compared to traditional methods, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Bao2022Potential). MRPL52 is also associated with breast cancer metastasis, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Bao2022Potential).

In neurodegenerative disorders, MRPL52 expression is altered, as seen in Friedreich's ataxia, where it is upregulated in adults. This suggests a potential link between MRPL52 expression changes and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative conditions (Elsadany2021Transcriptional). In Rett syndrome, MRPL52 is upregulated, which may be related to increased mitochondrial activity observed in patients, although the exact role of MRPL52 in this context remains unclear (Pecorelli2013Genes).

Overall, while MRPL52 is not directly linked to specific diseases caused by its mutations, its altered expression and interactions are associated with cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
