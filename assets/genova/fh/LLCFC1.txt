# LLCFC1

## Overview
LLCFC1 is a gene that encodes the protein LLLL and CFNLAS motif containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of specific motifs that suggest its role in cellular signaling pathways, although its precise function remains to be fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a signaling molecule due to its involvement in intracellular communication and regulation. Research has indicated that LLCFC1 may play a role in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular growth and differentiation processes (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of LLCFC1 is crucial for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease.
