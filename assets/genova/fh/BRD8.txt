# BRD8

## Overview
BRD8 (bromodomain containing 8) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The protein, also named BRD8, is characterized by the presence of a bromodomain, which allows it to recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, facilitating the recruitment of transcriptional machinery. As a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, BRD8 plays a crucial role in the acetylation of histone H4 and H2A, promoting chromatin remodeling and transcription activation. It is active in the nucleus and participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and chromatin organization. BRD8 is implicated in several biological processes, including hormone receptor signaling and the regulation of the innate immune response, and has been associated with various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations (Browne2021The; Yamada2009BRD8; Fujisawa2017Functions).

## Function
BRD8 (bromodomain containing 8) is a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation in human cells. It functions as an accessory subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, which is responsible for the acetylation of histone H4 and H2A N-terminal tails, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcription activation (Yamada2009BRD8; Fujisawa2017Functions). BRD8 is active in the nucleus, where it recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histone tails through its bromodomain, aiding in the recruitment of transcriptional machinery (Browne2021The).

In human lung epithelial cells, BRD8 plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, acting as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. It influences the expression of genes involved in the innate immune response and cell cycle regulation (Browne2021The). BRD8 is also associated with the CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), suggesting a role in chromatin organization and gene regulation through chromatin proximity (Browne2021The).

BRD8 interacts with nuclear hormone receptors, such as thyroid hormone receptors, acting as a coactivator in hormone-mediated transcription pathways (Yamada2009BRD8). This interaction highlights its involvement in hormone receptor signaling pathways and chromatin remodeling processes.

## Clinical Significance
BRD8 has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BRD8 is overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels, correlating with advanced cancer stages and higher tumor grades. High BRD8 expression is associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), suggesting its role as an oncogenic factor in HCC. It is also considered an independent prognostic marker for poor outcomes in these patients (Chen2020BRD489). 

In ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC), BRD8 exhibits a DNA mutation rate of 2.1%. Patients with these mutations tend to have a favorable prognosis compared to those without, indicating a complex role in OSC progression (Zhang2022Identification). 

BRD8 is also involved in colorectal cancer, where its expression is linked to tumor progression towards advanced stages, potentially contributing to a growth advantage in these cancers (Czerwinska2023Bromodomain). 

These findings suggest that BRD8's role in cancer is multifaceted, involving both its expression levels and genetic alterations, which can influence tumor behavior and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
BRD8 is a bromodomain-containing protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, where it interacts with proteins such as MORFL1/2, MRGBP, and EP400, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Devoucoux2021MRG; Remillard2021Chemoproteomics). BRD8 is also involved in the p400 chromatin remodeling complex, where it is crucial for the incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z at PPARγ target genes, facilitating adipogenesis (Couture2012The).

BRD8 interacts with the Tip60 acetyltransferase complex, which is essential for the acetylation of histones and the recruitment of the p400 complex to PPARγ target gene promoters (Couture2012The). It also forms part of a smaller complex with MRGBP and MRG15/X, independent of the larger NuA4/TIP60 complex, suggesting a role in mRNA processing or transcription elongation (Devoucoux2021MRG).

In human lung epithelial cells, BRD8 interacts with transcription factors such as FOXA1 and immune response-related factors like NFKBIZ and EGR2, influencing gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Browne2021The). It is associated with CTCF, a chromatin organizer, indicating its role in chromatin proximity and transcriptional regulation (Browne2021The).
