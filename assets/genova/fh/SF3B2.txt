# SF3B2

## Overview
SF3B2 is a gene that encodes the protein splicing factor 3b subunit 2, a critical component of the spliceosome complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is part of the SF3B complex, which is integral to the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and plays a pivotal role in the recognition and excision of introns from pre-mRNA, a process essential for the generation of mature mRNA in eukaryotic cells. The SF3B2 protein is characterized by its proline-rich C-terminal domain and its interactions with other subunits such as SF3B1 and SF3B4, forming a stable complex crucial for spliceosome assembly and function (Cretu2024Molecular; Yazhini2022Sequence). Additionally, SF3B2 is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, influencing gene expression regulation and cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique; Kitamura2022Dual). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including methylation by protein arginine methyltransferase 9 (PRMT9), which affects alternative splicing (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). SF3B2's role in transcription regulation and RNA stability underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and craniofacial microsomia (Kitamura2022Dual; Timberlake2021Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
SF3B2, also known as splicing factor 3b subunit 2, is a component of the SF3B complex, which is part of the U2 snRNP involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is characterized by a proline-rich C-terminal domain, which interacts with the N-terminal RRM domain of the SF3B4 subunit, forming a stable complex. This interaction has been captured in a crystal structure, highlighting the importance of these domains in the assembly of the SF3B complex (Cretu2024Molecular).

SF3B2 is involved in significant protein-protein interactions within the SF3B complex, particularly with SF3B1, where they share the largest interface region involving over 100 residues. This interface is the most conserved among the protein-protein interfaces in the SF3B complex (Yazhini2022Sequence). The protein also shows high sequence conservation for its interactions with pre-mRNA and U2 snRNA, with conservation scores of 0.62 and 0.55, respectively (Yazhini2022Sequence).

The molecular structure of SF3B2 is challenging to determine due to its disordered nature, although it is part of the 17S U2 snRNP complex, which has been structurally elucidated (Kitamura2022Dual). SF3B2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and it can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
SF3B2, also known as splicing factor 3b subunit 2, is a crucial component of the spliceosome complex, which is responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This process involves the recognition and removal of introns from pre-mRNA, facilitating the production of mature mRNA. SF3B2 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in gene expression regulation and influences cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique).

SF3B2 interacts with G-quadruplex (G4)-forming nucleic acids, which can modulate its function in gene expression regulation. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of innate immune gene expression, where SF3B2 has been shown to suppress the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through a splicing-independent mechanism (Matsumoto2021G‐quadruplex‐forming).

Additionally, SF3B2 is a substrate for protein arginine methyltransferase 9 (PRMT9), which specifically methylates SF3B2 at the Arg-508 site. This methylation is linked to the regulation of alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, highlighting SF3B2's role in RNA splicing processes (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique). The interaction between SF3B2 and PRMT9 is crucial for maintaining proper splicing activity and cellular function (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SF3B2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly craniofacial microsomia (CFM) and various cancers. In CFM, haploinsufficient variants in SF3B2 are a significant genetic cause, explaining approximately 3% of sporadic and 25% of familial cases. These mutations lead to craniofacial abnormalities such as mandibular hypoplasia, microtia, and facial tags, along with skeletal and cardiac anomalies. The condition is linked to impaired neural crest development due to spliceosome mutations (Timberlake2021Haploinsufficiency).

In the context of cancer, high expression of SF3B2 is associated with tumor progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers like prostate cancer. SF3B2 influences gene expression by interacting with chromatin and RNA, promoting tumor growth through increased cell proliferation and altered gene expression profiles. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with increased expression of genes related to mitochondrial electron transport and transcription regulation (Kitamura2022Dual). SF3B2's role in transcription regulation and RNA stability suggests its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Kitamura2022Dual).

## Interactions
SF3B2, a component of the SF3b complex, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription regulation. Within the SF3b complex, SF3B2 interacts significantly with SF3B1, sharing the largest interface region involving over 100 residues, indicating a strong and conserved interaction essential for the complex's function (Yazhini2022Sequence). SF3B2 also interacts with SF3B3 and SF3B4, forming an assembly capable of binding pre-mRNA independently of other SF3b components (Yazhini2022Sequence).

SF3B2 is known to bind to chromatin and RNA, influencing gene expression by modulating transcription and RNA stability. It interacts with chromatin architectural factors such as SMC1A and CTCF, promoting their binding to chromatin and affecting transcriptional activity (Kitamura2022Dual). SF3B2's interaction with RNA is characterized by its binding to 3'UTR and exons, as identified through PAR-CLIP analyses (Kitamura2022Dual).

Additionally, SF3B2 is a substrate for human protein arginine methyltransferase 9 (PRMT9), which specifically methylates SF3B2, forming monomethylarginine and symmetric dimethylarginine products. This methylation is linked to the regulation of alternative splicing (Hadjikyriacou2015Unique).
