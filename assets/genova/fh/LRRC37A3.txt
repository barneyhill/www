# LRRC37A3

## Overview
The LRRC37A3 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 37 member A3 protein, which is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by its extensive extracellular domain and multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). These LRRs are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for various cellular processes (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein is notable for its high level of intrinsic disorder, a feature that allows it to participate in diverse interactions with multiple binding partners, potentially influencing a wide range of biological functions (Van2020Intrinsic). The structural attributes of LRRC37A3, including its disordered regions, suggest it may be involved in complex regulatory networks and could be subject to post-translational modifications, further diversifying its functional capabilities (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

## Structure
The LRRC37A3 protein is a type I transmembrane protein encoded by the LRRC37A3 gene. It consists of 1,634 amino acid residues and features a signal peptide at residues 1-35, a long extracellular domain spanning residues 36-1,581, a transmembrane helix from residues 1,582-1,602, and a short cytoplasmic domain at residues 1,603-1,634 (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein contains 12 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are located at specific positions within the sequence (Van2020Intrinsic). These LRRs typically follow the consensus sequence LxxLxLxxNxL, although some variations exist (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary).

LRRC37A3 is predicted to have high levels of intrinsic disorder, with a PPIDR of 70.2 ± 8.1% and an average disorder score (ADS) of 0.640 ± 0.068, suggesting it may engage in multiple interactions with various binding partners (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein's extracellular domain contains two long, mostly disordered regions, which are characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) (Van2020Intrinsic). The presence of these disordered regions indicates potential sites for post-translational modifications and diverse functional interactions (Van2020Intrinsic).
