# DEPDC1B

## Overview
DEPDC1B is a gene located on chromosome 5q12.1 that encodes the DEP domain containing 1B protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction pathways. The protein is characterized by the presence of two conserved domains: the DEP domain, which facilitates membrane localization and interaction with G protein-coupled receptors, and the RhoGAP domain, which is involved in Rho GTPase signaling. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a crucial role in regulating cell migration, cytoskeletal dynamics, and actin polymerization by interacting with RAC1, a member of the Rho GTPase family. DEPDC1B is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Su2014A; Fan2022Identification; Wu2015Identification).

## Structure
The DEPDC1B protein is encoded by the DEPDC1B gene located on chromosome 5q12.1 and consists of 529 amino acids, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 61 kDa (Su2014A; Wang2021DEPDC1B). The protein contains two conserved domains: the DEP domain and the RhoGAP domain. The DEP domain, approximately 90 amino acids in length, is a globular structure involved in membrane localization and interaction with G protein-coupled receptors and membrane phospholipids, which are essential for Wnt signaling (Chen2020Knockdown; Su2014A; Wang2021DEPDC1B). The RhoGAP domain is involved in Rho GTPase signaling, regulating cellular processes such as motility, growth, and cytoskeletal reorganization (Bai2017High; Su2014A).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DEPDC1B are not provided, the protein's functional domains suggest a role in signal transduction pathways. The DEP domain's structure is similar to a three-helix bundle with a β-hairpin arm, as seen in related proteins (Liao2016Identification). There is no detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for DEPDC1B in the provided context.

## Function
DEPDC1B encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling, which is crucial for cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and interacts with RAC1, a member of the Rho GTPase family, to suppress its activation. This interaction affects actin polymerization, a process essential for cell movement and structure (Wu2015Identification).

Despite lacking a critical arginine residue typically necessary for GAP activity, DEPDC1B can bind to both GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RAC1, suggesting an alternative mechanism for modulating RAC1 activity. This modulation is important for actin bundling and cell signaling, as DEPDC1B disrupts TRIOGEFD1-induced actin polymerization specific to RAC1 activation (Wu2015Identification).

DEPDC1B is also a transcriptional target of the transcription factor Pitx2, which can inhibit its expression. This regulation suggests that DEPDC1B's activity is tightly controlled during development and other cellular processes (Wu2015Identification). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
DEPDC1B has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), DEPDC1B is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous tissues. Its expression correlates with clinical characteristics such as cancer stage and tumor grade, and it serves as a strong diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, with high expression linked to poor patient prognosis (Fan2022Identification).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high DEPDC1B expression is associated with shorter survival times. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cell migration and invasion through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Yang2014DEPDC1B).

In malignant melanoma, DEPDC1B is highly expressed, and its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth and survival (Xu2019DEPDC1B).

In prostate cancer, high DEPDC1B expression is linked to advanced clinical stages and shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Bai2017High).

DEPDC1B is also overexpressed in oral cancer, where it enhances cell migration and invasion through the Rac1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression (Su2014A).

## Interactions
DEPDC1B interacts with a variety of proteins, playing roles in different cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with both nuclear and transmembrane proteins. Using yeast-hybrid screening, DEPDC1B was found to interact with proteins such as U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2af2), enhancer of rudimentary homolog (Erh), synaptic adhesion-like molecule (Salm), Zc3h13, sacsin molecular chaperone (Sacs), Gnai3, tubulin folding cofactor B (Tbcb), and RNA binding motif protein 39 (Rbm39). These interactions were confirmed for U2af2, Erh, and Salm through GST pull-down assays, indicating DEPDC1B's ability to bind both nuclear and transmembrane proteins (Wu2015Identification).

DEPDC1B also interacts with the Rho GTPase Rac1. It binds to both GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Rac1, but not to nucleotide-free Rac1, suggesting a regulatory role in Rac1 activation (Wu2015Identification). In oral cancer cells, DEPDC1B acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1, increasing GTP loading and promoting cell migration and invasion (Su2014A). In colorectal cancer, DEPDC1B interacts with NUP37, affecting cell proliferation and migration (Xiong2023DEPDC1B). In bladder cancer, DEPDC1B interacts with SHC1, influencing cancer cell proliferation and migration (Lai2020DEPDC1B).
