# POLR2J

## Overview
The POLR2J gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, specifically known as RNA polymerase II subunit J, which plays a critical role in the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells. This protein is a component of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is essential for the synthesis of mRNA precursors and various small RNAs. The POLR2J gene is notable for producing several splice variant isoforms, such as hRPB11a, hRPB11bα, and hRPB11bβ, each with distinct roles in transcription regulation. These isoforms contribute to the structural and functional diversity of the RNA polymerase II complex, influencing its interaction with transcription factors and other proteins involved in gene expression (Proshkin2019The; Muste2023Deregulations). The POLR2J protein is integral to the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, facilitating the transcription process by forming part of the enzyme's active center (Zheng2024POLR2J).

## Structure
The POLR2J gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is involved in the transcription of messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by POLR2J is part of a complex that includes multiple subunits, contributing to the quaternary structure of RNA polymerase II. This complex is essential for the transcription process, as it forms the active center of the enzyme (Muste2023Deregulations).

The POLR2J gene family includes several splice variant isoforms, such as hRPB11a, hRPB11bα, and hRPB11bβ, which differ in their amino acid sequences. These isoforms result from alternative splicing events and have distinct roles in transcription regulation. For instance, hRPB11bα interacts specifically with transcription factor ATF4, highlighting its unique functional properties compared to other isoforms (Proshkin2019The).

The primary structure of these isoforms includes specific amino acid sequences that determine their interaction capabilities and functional roles. The secondary and tertiary structures, while not detailed in the context, are likely to include common protein folds such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical in RNA polymerase subunits. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these isoforms into the larger RNA polymerase II complex, where they interact with other subunits to facilitate transcription (Durrin2002The; Muste2023Deregulations).

## Function
POLR2J encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells. This subunit, also known as RPB11, is integral to the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is responsible for synthesizing mRNA precursors and various small RNAs (Zheng2024POLR2J). POLR2J is involved in the formation of the pre-initiation complex, a critical step that opens promoter DNA to initiate transcription (Zheng2024POLR2J).

In healthy human cells, POLR2J is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the transcription machinery by interacting with other subunits and transcription factors to regulate gene expression (Forget2010The). The subunit is part of a larger network that includes interactions with proteins such as RPAP4/GPN1, which are essential for the nuclear import and biogenesis of RNA polymerase II (Forget2010The). These interactions are crucial for the proper localization and function of the polymerase complex, ensuring efficient transcription and subsequent cellular processes like growth and differentiation. The activity of POLR2J in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and response to environmental signals.

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2J gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung tumors, POLR2J expression is increased two-fold compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells, with higher expression observed in a subset of tumor samples (Muste2023Deregulations). In colorectal cancer, its expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and is upregulated in liver metastatic tumors. Similarly, in rectal cancers, POLR2J overexpression is associated with higher risk and poorer survival outcomes, as evidenced by its overexpression in rectal tumor organoids (Muste2023Deregulations). In glioblastoma, POLR2J upregulation is linked to poor prognosis, enhanced cell proliferation, and increased metastatic capability. Knockdown of POLR2J in glioblastoma cells results in reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and decreased migrative and invasive abilities, suggesting its role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased metastatic potential (Muste2023Deregulations).

Additionally, POLR2J expression has been associated with survival in grade 2 ovarian cancers, testicular germ cell tumor prognosis, and breast cancer susceptibility in a Belgian population (Muste2023Deregulations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of POLR2J in cancer prognosis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
POLR2J, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcription. In glioblastoma (GBM), POLR2J interacts with the transcription factor STAT3, enhancing the metastatic potential of GBM cells. This interaction promotes cell proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GBM (Zheng2024POLR2J).

POLR2J also encodes isoforms of the hRPB11 subunit, which interact with several proteins. The isoform hRPB11bα specifically interacts with the transcription factor ATF4, a member of the ATF/CREB family. This interaction is more intense with hRPB11bα than with the major isoform hRPB11a, indicating a selective binding preference. The interaction is crucial for transcription activation and is mediated through the C-terminal b-Zip domain of ATF4 (Proshkin2019The).

Additionally, POLR2J interacts with the common subunit of RNA polymerases I-III, hRPB6 (POLR2F), and the exon-exon junction complex component Y14 (RBM8A). These interactions suggest a role in coordinating transcription and RNA interference processes (Shematorova2013Novel). POLR2J is also involved in the degradation of RNA polymerase II subunits, as it interacts with ARMC5, which controls the degradation of these subunits (Luo2024ARMC5).
