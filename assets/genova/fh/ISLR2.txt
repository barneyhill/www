# ISLR2

## Overview
The ISLR2 gene encodes the immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat 2 protein, a type I transmembrane protein that is integral to neural development. This protein is categorized within the leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin (LIG) family and is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, where it plays a pivotal role in axon guidance and the organization of the cytoskeleton in developing neurons (Alazami2018A). Structurally, the ISLR2 protein comprises five tandem leucine-rich repeats, an immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, which collectively facilitate its involvement in cell-cell communication and signaling pathways (Abudureyimu2018Essential). The protein's interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases and its role in Rho-kinase-mediated pathways underscore its significance in brain development and function, highlighting its potential impact on neural connectivity and cytoarchitecture (Abudureyimu2018Essential).

## Function
The ISLR2 gene, also known as Linx, encodes a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin (LIG) family. This protein is primarily expressed in neural tissues and plays a critical role in the development of the peripheral nervous system and forebrain connectivity. In healthy human cells, ISLR2 is expressed in neurons and testes, where it is involved in axon guidance and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton of developing neurons (Alazami2018A). The protein's structure includes five tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, which facilitate its role in cell-cell communication and axon guidance (Abudureyimu2018Essential).

ISLR2 interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as TrkA and Ret, modulating their signaling cascades, although the precise binding selectivity and modes of interaction are not fully understood (Abudureyimu2018Essential). It is involved in Rho-kinase-mediated regulation of brain cytoarchitecture, influencing neurite extension and actin cytoskeletal organization (Abudureyimu2018Essential). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, influencing cell-cell interactions and communication, which are essential for proper brain development and function (Abudureyimu2018Essential).

## Interactions
The ISLR2 protein, encoded by the ISLR2 gene, is involved in several specific protein-protein interactions. In zebrafish, ISLR2 directly interacts with Vasorin paralogs, Vasna and Vasnb, through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of Vasorin. This interaction is crucial for retinal axon routing at the optic chiasm, as demonstrated by the inability of a truncated LRR domain in the islr2 sa82 allele to bind Vasorin, rendering it functionally null (Panza2015The).

ISLR2 also interacts with leptin, a cytokine involved in energy homeostasis. Leptin binds to the extracellular domain (ECD) of ISLR2, specifically to the LRR1-7 region, but not to the immunoglobulin-like domains. This interaction is concentration-dependent and has been confirmed in both human and mouse models (Wojtowicz2020A).

Additionally, ISLR2 interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases such as Ret and TrkA, and with Rho-kinase, influencing actin cytoskeletal organization and neurite extension. These interactions suggest a role for ISLR2 in neural development and axonal projections (Abudureyimu2018Essential).
