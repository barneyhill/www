# CHD6

## Overview
CHD6, or chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 6, is a gene that encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of proteins, which are integral to chromatin remodeling processes. The CHD6 protein is characterized by its chromodomains, helicase/ATPase domain, and DNA-binding motifs, which collectively facilitate its role in modifying chromatin structure and regulating transcription. As a chromatin remodeler, CHD6 is involved in critical cellular processes such as the oxidative DNA damage response and autophagy regulation, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Alfonso2011CHD6; Moore2019The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, including transcription factors and viral proteins, underscore its multifaceted role in gene expression regulation and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis, such as cancer and genetic disorders (Fertey2010Interaction; Zhang2022The).

## Structure
CHD6 is a member of the CHD family of chromatin remodelers, characterized by the presence of chromodomains, a helicase/ATPase domain, and DNA-binding motifs. The primary structure of CHD6 includes tandem N-terminal chromodomains, which interact with methylated histone tails, playing a crucial role in chromatin structure dynamics and transcription regulation (Alfonso2011CHD6; Hall2007CHD). The protein also contains a central SNF2-like ATPase domain, essential for its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity (Hall2007CHD; Lutz2006CHD6).

The tertiary structure of CHD6 involves the folding of these domains into a functional configuration, allowing it to interact with nucleosomes and other protein complexes. CHD6 forms a high molecular weight complex, estimated at 2-3 MDa, indicating a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits or interactions with other proteins (Lutz2006CHD6). The protein also includes SANT and TCH motifs, which are involved in DNA binding and chromatin remodeling (Kargapolova2020Overarching; Lutz2006CHD6).

CHD6 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions. The presence of splice variant isoforms could result in different functional forms of the protein, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The CHD6 gene encodes a chromatin remodeler that plays a crucial role in the oxidative DNA damage response and autophagy regulation in healthy human cells. CHD6 is involved in managing oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant responses, which are essential for cell growth and survival under stress conditions. It stabilizes during oxidative stress and relocates to DNA damage sites, facilitated by a conserved N-terminal poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent recruitment motif (Moore2019The). CHD6 interacts with Nrf2, a key regulator of antioxidant transcriptional events, and its deletion results in suppressed expression of Nrf2 target genes, leading to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage (Moore2019The).

CHD6 also plays a significant role in regulating autophagy by binding to autophagy-relevant genes across various cell types, including iPSCs, NCCs, and CMs, primarily at gene promoters. It is associated with processes like autophagy, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage response (Kargapolova2020Overarching). CHD6's involvement in chromatin remodeling affects the accessibility of linker histone DNA, contributing to chromatin compaction and accessibility regulation (Moore2019The). These functions are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing premature aging-like phenotypes (Kargapolova2020Overarching).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CHD6 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CHD6 is overexpressed and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis by regulating mitochondrial dynamics through the TMEM65 gene. High levels of CHD6 are associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis, particularly to the liver. The CHD6-TMEM65 axis is crucial for cancer progression, and targeting this pathway has shown potential in reducing tumor growth in CRC models (Zhang2022The).

CHD6 is also linked to Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (HSS), a rare congenital disorder. A specific de novo missense mutation in CHD6, resulting in an isoleucine to methionine substitution, affects its ability to recruit co-factors necessary for autophagy and DNA damage response. This mutation leads to impaired autophagy, increased DNA damage, and cellular aging phenotypes, contributing to the development of HSS (Kargapolova2020Overarching).

Overall, CHD6's role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation is critical, and its dysfunction can lead to significant pathological outcomes, including cancer and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
CHD6, a chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. CHD6 interacts with the papillomavirus E8∧E2C protein, specifically binding to its C-terminal domain. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional repression of the HPV E6/E7 oncogene promoter, a process important in the context of cervical cancer development. The interaction is conserved across different high-risk HPV types, such as HPV16, HPV18, and HPV31 (Fertey2010Interaction).

CHD6 also interacts with the PA subunit of the influenza virus polymerase, associating with the entire viral polymerase complex and colocalizing with viral ribonucleoproteins in infected cells. This interaction suggests a role for CHD6 as a negative modulator of influenza virus replication, as it relocates to inactive chromatin upon infection (Alfonso2011CHD6).

In the context of DNA damage response, CHD6 is recruited to damage sites through its N-terminal PAR-dependent binding region and is retained via its double chromodomain and SANT domain. This recruitment is essential for controlling PAR induction following oxidative stress-induced DNA damage (Moore2019The).
