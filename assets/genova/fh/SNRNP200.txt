# SNRNP200

## Overview
The SNRNP200 gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U5 subunit 200, a critical component of the spliceosome, which is a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. This protein functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, playing a pivotal role in the unwinding of the U4/U6 snRNA duplex during spliceosome activation, a necessary step for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome (Agafonov2016Molecular; Wood2021The). The SNRNP200 protein is characterized by its helicase activity, facilitated by its N-terminal and C-terminal helicase modules, and is involved in maintaining RNA splicing fidelity and preventing the use of cryptic splice sites (Wood2021The). Beyond its splicing function, SNRNP200 is implicated in antiviral responses, interacting with TBK1 to promote IRF3 activation and the production of type I interferons (Tremblay2016Spliceosome). Mutations in the SNRNP200 gene are linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its clinical significance in retinal degenerative diseases (Benaglio2011Next; Zhang2021SNRNP200).

## Structure
The SNRNP200 protein, a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, has a resolved structure covering amino acids 395 to 2129. It features duplicated N-terminal and C-terminal cassettes, each containing a RecA1-RecA2 DEAD-box helicase domain and a Sec63 homology domain. These domains are crucial for its helicase activity and splicing function, with the N-terminal cassette being catalytically active (Tremblay2016Spliceosome). The Sec63-1 homology region's 3D structure resembles isolated C-terminal Sec63 units found in yeast and human enzymes (Tremblay2016Spliceosome).

A notable structural feature is the ratchet-helix within the HB domain, where serine 1087 is located. This domain forms the top of a central tunnel, with the RecA domains forming the bottom, acting as a strand separation device for RNA (Tremblay2016Spliceosome). Mutations in this region, such as S1087L, are linked to decreased RNA binding and reduced ATPase and helicase activities, impacting conditions like retinitis pigmentosa 33 (RP33) (Tremblay2016Spliceosome).

The protein is also involved in antiviral responses, where it interacts with TBK1 and relocalizes upon viral infection to promote IRF3 phosphorylation, enhancing the antiviral response (Tremblay2016Spliceosome).

## Function
The SNRNP200 gene encodes a 200 kDa protein that is a critical component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is part of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, facilitating the unwinding of the U4/U6 snRNA duplex during spliceosome activation, a crucial step for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome (Agafonov2016Molecular; Wood2021The). The SNRNP200 protein contains two helicase modules: an active N-terminal helicase module responsible for unwinding snRNA and a C-terminal helicase module that acts as an intramolecular regulator (Wood2021The).

In healthy human cells, SNRNP200 is essential for maintaining RNA splicing fidelity, ensuring accurate 5' splice site recognition, and preventing the use of cryptic splice sites (Wood2021The). It also plays a role in the second catalytic step of splicing, promoting conformational changes in RNA-RNA interactions within the spliceosome (Lauber1996The). Beyond its role in splicing, SNRNP200 is involved in the antiviral response, particularly in the IRF3-mediated pathway, where it interacts with TBK1 to promote the activation of IRF3 and the production of type I interferons (Tremblay2016Spliceosome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNRNP200 gene are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a hereditary retinal degenerative disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and tunnel vision, and potentially resulting in total blindness (Benaglio2011Next; Zhang2021SNRNP200). Variants such as p.Ser1087Leu, p.Arg1090Leu, p.R681C, p.R681H, and p.Y689C have been identified in patients with adRP, affecting the helicase activity of the SNRNP200 protein, which is crucial for the unwinding of the U4/U6 snRNA duplex during spliceosome activation (Benaglio2011Next; Wood2021The). These mutations can lead to mis-regulation of spliceosome activity and RNA splicing, contributing to the pathogenesis of retinitis pigmentosa (Wood2021The).

In a study involving a Chinese family, a novel heterozygous mutation, c.C6088T, was identified, which cosegregated with the disease phenotype. This mutation was shown to have a dominant-negative effect in zebrafish models, causing systemic deformities and retinal damage (Zhang2021SNRNP200). The genetic heterogeneity of RP and the distinct mutation profile of SNRNP200 in different populations underscore the complexity of this condition (Zhang2013Contribution).

## Interactions
SNRNP200, a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, is involved in various interactions crucial for its function in the spliceosome and antiviral responses. It interacts with the kinase TBK1 through its Sec63-1 domain, which is essential for binding viral RNA and promoting IRF3 activation, a key step in the antiviral response (Tremblay2016Spliceosome). This interaction facilitates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, leading to the activation of the IFN-β promoter and the production of interferon-stimulated genes (Tremblay2016Spliceosome).

SNRNP200 also interacts with intrinsically disordered proteins such as TSSC4, FBP21, and C9ORF78. These proteins bind to the C-terminal Sec63 module of SNRNP200 in a mutually exclusive manner, with TSSC4 acting as a helicase inhibitor and playing a role in U5 snRNP assembly (Bergfort2022The). TSSC4 has a higher affinity for SNRNP200 than FBP21 or C9ORF78, suggesting its critical role in regulating the timing of interactions during snRNP assembly and splicing (Bergfort2022The).

Additionally, SNRNP200 is involved in the assembly of the U5 snRNP complex, interacting with proteins such as PRPF8 and EFTUD2. These interactions are crucial for the maturation and function of the spliceosome (Malinová2017Assembly).
