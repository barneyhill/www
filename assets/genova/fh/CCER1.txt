# CCER1

## Overview
CCER1, or coiled-coil glutamate-rich protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the histone-to-protamine transition essential for chromatin condensation in sperm development. The protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form nuclear condensates. These structural features are crucial for its function in chromatin organization and remodeling during sperm maturation. Mutations in the CCER1 gene have been associated with male infertility, specifically non-obstructive azoospermia, and have also been implicated in posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy (PACD), highlighting its clinical significance (Qin2023Phaseseparated; Cervantes2018Confirmation).

## Structure
The CCER1 protein, encoded by the human gene CCER1, is characterized by a significant presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are crucial for its function in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Qin2023Phaseseparated). The protein is rich in glutamic acids and contains two coiled-coil domains in its human form, which facilitate dimer and polymer formation, contributing to its quaternary structure (Qin2023Phaseseparated). These coiled-coil domains are essential for the protein's ability to form droplet-like structures in the nucleus, a key aspect of its biological function (Qin2023Phaseseparated).

The IDRs in CCER1 are enriched with polar and charged amino acids such as glycine, serine, glutamine, proline, glutamic acid, lysine, and arginine, which are important for the assembly of liquid condensates (Qin2023Phaseseparated). The C-terminal region of the protein, particularly IDR5, is enriched with glutamine and plays a significant role in the protein's phase separation properties (Qin2023Phaseseparated). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in chromatin condensation during spermatogenesis, and mutations affecting its structure can lead to male infertility (Qin2023Phaseseparated).

## Function
The CCER1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the histone-to-protamine transition during spermatogenesis, a process essential for male fertility. This transition involves replacing histones with protamines to compact chromatin in sperm nuclei, facilitating proper sperm development and function (Qin2023Phaseseparated). CCER1 is a germline-specific, intrinsically disordered protein that forms liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates in the nucleus, which are vital for chromatin condensation and organization (Qin2023Phaseseparated). These condensates are formed through interactions involving the protein's coiled-coil and glutamate-rich domains, which are typical of proteins involved in phase separation (Qin2023Phaseseparated).

In healthy cells, CCER1 facilitates the transcription of transition proteins and protamines and mediates multiple histone epigenetic modifications, such as acetylation and ubiquitination, which are critical for chromatin remodeling (Qin2023Phaseseparated). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus of spermatids, where it self-assembles into granule-like structures visible during specific stages of spermatid development (Qin2023Phaseseparated). Mutations in CCER1 that disrupt its phase separation ability are linked to non-obstructive azoospermia, underscoring its importance in male fertility (Qin2023Phaseseparated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCER1 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly in the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen. Studies have identified loss-of-function variants in CCER1 in patients with NOA, which are absent in fertile individuals, suggesting a pathogenic role for these mutations in human spermatogenesis (Qin2023Phaseseparated). These mutations include frameshift and stop-gain mutations that lead to premature termination of CCER1 translation, disrupting its function in chromatin condensation and the histone-to-protamine transition during spermatogenesis (Qin2023Phaseseparated).

In addition to its role in male fertility, CCER1 has been implicated in posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy (PACD), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. A study identified a heterozygous deletion involving CCER1 and other genes in a family with PACD, suggesting a potential link between CCER1 and this corneal condition (Cervantes2018Confirmation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCER1 mutations and their potential impact on reproductive health and ocular diseases.

## Interactions
The CCER1 protein, or coiled-coil glutamate-rich protein 1, is involved in various interactions crucial for its function in spermatogenesis. CCER1 forms phase-separated condensates in the nucleus of spermatids, which are essential for chromatin organization and the histone-to-protamine transition. This transition is vital for chromatin condensation during sperm development (Qin2023Phaseseparated). The protein's ability to self-assemble into higher-order structures is facilitated by its coiled-coil domain and intrinsically disordered regions, which drive liquid-liquid phase separation (Qin2023Phaseseparated).

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that CCER1 can interact with itself, indicating its capacity for self-assembly (Qin2023Phaseseparated). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in chromatin remodeling, as CCER1 coordinates the transcription of transition proteins and protamines, which are necessary for proper chromatin compaction (Qin2023Phaseseparated). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, the study suggests that CCER1's phase-separated condensates interact with chromatin to control its organization and gene expression (Qin2023Phaseseparated).
