# EIF5A

## Overview
The EIF5A gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), a highly conserved protein that plays a pivotal role in the process of translation elongation and termination in eukaryotic cells. eIF5A is unique among translation factors due to its post-translational modification known as hypusination, which is essential for its function in facilitating the synthesis of proteins, particularly those with polyproline motifs (Tauc2021The; Wu2020Recent). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, cytoskeleton organization, and cell shape maintenance, and is implicated in several clinical conditions, such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (BarbaAliaga2022Role; Park2021Posttranslational). The EIF5A gene and its protein product are thus critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have significant implications in health and disease.

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is a small, highly conserved protein composed of 157 amino acids, with a unique post-translational modification known as hypusination. This modification involves the conversion of a specific lysine residue (Lys50) into hypusine, a process essential for the protein's function (Tauc2021The; Wu2020Recent). The primary structure of eIF5A includes two isoforms, eIF5A1 and eIF5A2, with eIF5A1 having two variants: isoform B with 154 amino acids and isoform A with an additional 30 amino acids at the N-terminal end, which may target the protein to mitochondria (Tauc2021The; Wu2020Recent).

Structurally, eIF5A consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain contains six β-strands and a one-turn 3_10-helix, with the hypusine modification site located in a loop between β3 and β4. The C-terminal domain comprises a three-turn α-helix and five β-strands (Wu2020Recent). The hypusine modification is crucial for eIF5A's ability to bind ribosomes and facilitate translation elongation, particularly for proteins with polyproline motifs (Tauc2021The). eIF5A typically functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure (Ning2020Eukaryotic).

## Function
EIF5A, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, plays a crucial role in translation elongation and termination in human cells. It is essential for the synthesis of proteins, particularly those containing polyproline motifs, by preventing ribosome stalling and facilitating peptide bond formation (Gutierrez2013eIF5A; Schuller2017eIF5A). EIF5A is unique due to its post-translational modification through hypusination, which is critical for its function. This modification enhances its ability to bind ribosomes and resolve ribosome stalling, especially in the translation of N-terminal or long internal polyproline motifs (Tauc2021The).

In addition to its role in translation, EIF5A is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, cytoskeleton organization, and cell shape maintenance (BarbaAliaga2022Role). It also plays a role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a process that eliminates defective transcripts and regulates the abundance of certain normal mRNAs (Hoque2017Regulation). EIF5A is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy cellular function (Zhang2019Polyamines; Hoque2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EIF5A gene are linked to several diseases. In cancer, EIF5A is implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. Overexpression of EIF5A2, a variant of EIF5A, is associated with poor prognosis and increased invasiveness in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Wu2020Recent; Ning2020Eukaryotic). In pancreatic cancer, EIF5A2 promotes cell growth and is regulated by the Shh-Gli1 signaling pathway (Wu2020Recent). 

In neurodevelopmental disorders, rare de novo heterozygous variants in EIF5A are linked to Faundes-Banka syndrome, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and craniofacial dysmorphism (Park2021Posttranslational). Biallelic variants in DHPS and DOHH, which are involved in the hypusination of EIF5A, are also associated with similar neurodevelopmental disorders (Park2021Posttranslational).

In diabetes, EIF5A is involved in pancreatic beta cell function and glucose homeostasis. Its inhibition can protect against beta cell mass loss and improve glucose tolerance in diabetic models (Tauc2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EIF5A in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
EIF5A interacts with various components of the translational machinery, playing a crucial role in translation elongation. It binds to the 80S ribosome complex in a hypusine-dependent manner, which is essential for its function in translation. This interaction is sensitive to RNase and EDTA treatments, indicating the necessity of RNA and ribosomal subunit joining for the interaction (Jao2005Tandem). EIF5A also interacts with translation elongation factors such as eEF2, although these interactions are competitive rather than direct, suggesting a mutually exclusive binding pattern on the ribosome (Rossi2016Evidence).

EIF5A is involved in the translation of specific proteins, including those with polyproline motifs, by alleviating ribosomal stalling. It binds near the E site of the ribosome, facilitating the peptidyl transferase activity necessary for the synthesis of proteins with challenging sequences like polyproline (Gutierrez2013eIF5A). EIF5A also interacts with other cellular proteins, such as CRM1, exportin 4, and nucleoporins, although these interactions do not require hypusine (Jao2005Tandem). These interactions highlight EIF5A's role in translation and its potential involvement in other cellular processes.
