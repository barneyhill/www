# MTARC2

## Overview
MTARC2, or mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. The MTARC2 protein is involved in the reduction of N-hydroxylated compounds, contributing to detoxification processes and the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics within the mitochondrial matrix. This protein is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production, interacting with the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex to support mitochondrial translation and aminoacylation processes (Bhonsle2023Identification). MTARC2's activity is crucial for cellular integrity, particularly under stress conditions, and its dysregulation has been linked to various metabolic and neurological disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma and bipolar disorder (Levchenko2023Genomic; Vella2023Kinomewide; Chen2022Functional).

## Function
MTARC2 (mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 2) is a protein involved in the reduction of N-hydroxylated compounds within mitochondria, playing a crucial role in detoxification processes and the metabolism of certain drugs and xenobiotics. This protein is active in the mitochondrial matrix, contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy production. It interacts with the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, which is involved in mitochondrial translation and aminoacylation processes, indicating its role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Bhonsle2023Identification).

Altered function of MTARC2 has been implicated in various metabolic disorders due to its impact on mitochondrial processes. Although its specific role in liver dysregulation and metabolic diseases is not fully established, mitochondrial dysfunction, which MTARC2 may influence, is a known factor in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Bhonsle2023Identification). Additionally, MTARC2 expression is significantly dysregulated in bipolar disorder cases, suggesting its involvement in neurological conditions, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Levchenko2023Genomic; Chen2022Functional). The protein's activity in detoxification and stress response pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity under various physiological conditions (Vella2023Kinomewide).

## Clinical Significance
MTARC2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MTARC2 is considered a protective gene, with higher expression levels associated with better survival outcomes. It is part of a prognostic gene signature for HCC, where lower expression correlates with reduced overall survival rates (Qiu2022Transcriptomic). MTARC2 expression levels are negatively correlated with HCC tumor size, progression, and risk of metastasis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in HCC patients (Clement2023The).

In metabolic diseases, MTARC2 is involved in mitochondrial processes, and its dysfunction may contribute to hepatic metabolic dysfunction. Although its specific role in liver dysregulation is not well-established, altered MTARC2 function could impact mitochondrial translation and aminoacylation processes, potentially leading to metabolic disorders (Bhonsle2023Identification).

MTARC2 is also associated with bipolar disorder (BD), where it is significantly dysregulated in BD brains. This dysregulation suggests a potential involvement in BD through regulatory mechanisms, although specific mutations or expression alterations directly linked to MTARC2 in BD are not detailed (Levchenko2023Genomic).
