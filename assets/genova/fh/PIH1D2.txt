# PIH1D2

## Overview
PIH1D2 is a human gene that encodes the protein PIH1 domain containing 2, which is involved in the assembly and stabilization of multiprotein complexes. The PIH1D2 protein is a component of the R2SP complex, which is similar to the R2TP complex and is associated with HSP70 chaperones, indicating its role in protein folding and stabilization (Maurizy2018The). This protein enhances the binding efficiency of SPAG1 to RUVBL1/2, suggesting its importance in chaperone activity and quaternary protein folding (Maurizy2018The). Additionally, PIH1D2 is implicated in the formation of alternative R2TP-like complexes, such as the hypothetical R2SD complex, further underscoring its role in the dynamic assembly of protein complexes (Rodríguez2020RPAP3).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PIH1D2 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as a component of the R2SP complex, which includes SPAG1 and RUVBL1/2. This complex is similar to the R2TP complex and is associated with HSP70 chaperones, indicating a role in protein folding and stabilization (Maurizy2018The). PIH1D2 enhances the binding of SPAG1 to RUVBL1/2, increasing the binding efficiency nearly threefold, which is comparable to the full-length RPAP3 (Maurizy2018The).

The R2SP complex, which includes PIH1D2, is suggested to have chaperone activity, enhancing the expression of certain partners like PPFIA2 (liprin-α2), ZBTB1, TCP11, PATL1, and PIK3CB, particularly at testis temperature. PIH1D2 facilitates the association of liprin-α2 with its partners, such as liprin-β2, CASK, RIMS1, and PTPRS, indicating a role in quaternary protein folding (Maurizy2018The).

PIH1D2 is also involved in the formation of alternative R2TP-like complexes, such as R2SD, which includes SPAG1, DNAAF2, and RUVBL1/2, although this complex remains hypothetical (Rodríguez2020RPAP3; Maurizy2018The). These interactions suggest that PIH1D2 plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of multiprotein complexes.
