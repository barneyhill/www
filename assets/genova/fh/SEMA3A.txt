# SEMA3A

## Overview
SEMA3A is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3A, a member of the semaphorin family, which is known for its role in axonal guidance and neural development. Semaphorin 3A is a secreted glycoprotein that functions primarily as a chemorepellent, guiding nerve fibers to their appropriate targets by interacting with receptors such as neuropilin-1 and plexins (Goshima2016Regulation; Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). Beyond the nervous system, semaphorin 3A is involved in various physiological processes, including bone and cartilage formation, vasculogenesis, and immune system regulation (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins; Kiseleva2022Semaphorin). Structurally, semaphorin 3A is characterized by a sema domain and forms dimers that are crucial for its biological activity (Lu2021Architecture; Siebold2013Structural). Clinically, mutations in the SEMA3A gene are associated with conditions such as Kallmann syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Hanchate2012SEMA3A; Zhang2020A).

## Structure
SEMA3A, a member of the semaphorin family, is characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SEMA3A includes a signal peptide and a sema domain, which is a signature feature of semaphorins (Siebold2013Structural). The sema domain exhibits a seven-bladed β-propeller fold, a common structural motif among semaphorins, and is accompanied by a PSI (plexin-semaphorin-integrin) domain, which is a cysteine-knot structure based on three conserved disulfide bridges (Nogi2010Structural; Siebold2013Structural). The tertiary structure of SEMA3A involves the PSI domain tightly abutting the sema domain, forming a rigid interface (Siebold2013Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEMA3A typically forms dimers, facilitated by interactions involving the PSI and Ig-like domains. The Ig-like domains tilt toward each other, potentially aiding in homodimerization through the A-B-E-D β-sheet (Lu2021Architecture). The C-terminal tail of SEMA3A contains a cysteine (Cys723) that forms an interchain disulfide bond, further stabilizing the dimer (Lu2021Architecture). Post-translational modifications of SEMA3A include glycosylation, which is common in semaphorins (Nogi2010Structural). The protein also undergoes furin cleavage, which is crucial for its interaction with neuropilin (Lu2021Architecture).

## Function
SEMA3A (semaphorin 3A) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in axonal guidance, influencing the growth and direction of nerve fibers during neural development. It functions primarily as a chemorepellent, preventing axons from entering certain regions and aiding in the formation of neural connections by guiding axons to their correct targets (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). SEMA3A interacts with its receptors, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and plexins, to exert its effects on the cytoskeleton, affecting cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and patterning (Goshima2016Regulation; Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, SEMA3A is involved in various physiological processes in non-neuronal tissues. It contributes to bone formation, cartilage formation, and vasculogenesis, influencing cell death, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). SEMA3A also plays a role in the immune system, where it regulates T cell activity and influences the migration and adhesion of immune cells (Kiseleva2022Semaphorin). Its activity is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and regenerative processes in adults, highlighting its multifaceted role in healthy human cells (Kiseleva2022Semaphorin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEMA3A gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In cancer, SEMA3A expression is linked to poor prognosis in various types, including sarcoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Increased SEMA3A expression is associated with a survival disadvantage and is correlated with tumor-promoting immune infiltrates, suggesting a role in tumor progression and the tumor microenvironment (Müller2007Association; Zhang2020A). In pancreatic cancer, SEMA3A is upregulated and associated with negative clinicopathological characteristics, such as shorter patient survival and less differentiated tumors, potentially promoting tumor invasiveness and motility (Müller2007Association).

SEMA3A mutations are also implicated in Kallmann syndrome (KS), a genetic disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Loss-of-function mutations in SEMA3A affect the secretion or signaling activity of the protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of KS by impairing the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons during development (Hanchate2012SEMA3A). These mutations may interact with other genetic factors, supporting a digenic or oligogenic mode of inheritance (Hanchate2012SEMA3A). In isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), SEMA3A variants result in a loss of function, affecting neuronal migration and development (Dai2020Functional).

## Interactions
SEMA3A interacts with several proteins to form receptor complexes that mediate its signaling functions. It primarily binds to Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and PlexinA receptors, such as PlexinA4, to form a tripartite complex. This complex is crucial for SEMA3A's role in axonal guidance and neuronal development. The Sema3A/PlexinA4/Nrp1 complex is characterized by a 2:2:2 stoichiometry, where SEMA3A forms a dimer that interacts with two PlexinA4 molecules, facilitated by Nrp1. The a1 domain of Nrp1 plays a critical role by wedging between SEMA3A and PlexinA4, stabilizing the complex (Lu2021Architecture).

L1cam is another important component of the SEMA3A receptor complex. It is involved in signal transduction and can convert SEMA3A-induced neurite repulsion into attraction under certain conditions. The absence of L1cam results in a lack of response to SEMA3A in mouse cortical and DRG neurites (Sharma2012Receptor).

Robo1 is suggested as a potential co-receptor, forming a complex with Nrp1, although it does not directly bind SEMA3A. The chemorepulsive effects of SEMA3A are diminished in Robo1 knockout models, indicating its role in modulating Nrp1 and Plxna1 expression (Sharma2012Receptor).
