# SULT1A2

## Overview
SULT1A2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 1A member 2, which belongs to the sulfotransferase family of enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for the sulfonation of a wide range of substrates, including hormones, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds, thereby enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion from the body (Coughtrie2016Function; Strott2002Sulfonation). Although SULT1A2 shares substrate specificity with the closely related SULT1A1, it is generally less efficient and is considered a pseudogene in humans due to a splicing defect that limits its expression in most tissues (Chao2021Expression; Dooley2000Expression). Despite this, SULT1A2 has been observed to be highly expressed in certain cancerous tissues, such as bladder cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumor biology and as a prognostic marker (Chao2021Expression; Dooley2000Expression).

## Function
The SULT1A2 gene encodes a member of the sulfotransferase family, which is involved in the sulfonation of various substrates, including hormones, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. This process enhances the solubility and excretion of these compounds, playing a crucial role in detoxification and maintaining hormonal balance. SULT1A2 is closely related to SULT1A1, sharing similar substrate specificity, although it is less efficient (Coughtrie2016Function; Strott2002Sulfonation).

Despite its potential activity, the physiological relevance of SULT1A2 in humans is uncertain due to its lack of expression in most human tissues. It is considered a pseudogene because of a splicing defect that may prevent the translation of a functional protein (Chao2021Expression; Dooley2000Expression). When expressed as a recombinant enzyme, SULT1A2 is significantly less active than SULT1A1 on phenolic substrates (Dooley2000Expression).

In the context of bladder cancer, SULT1A2 has been found to be highly expressed in cancerous tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumor biology. However, its exact function in healthy human cells remains unclear, as there is no substantial evidence of its expression or activity in normal tissues (Chao2021Expression; Dooley2000Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The SULT1A2 gene has been implicated in bladder cancer (BC), where its expression levels are associated with disease prognosis. High expression of SULT1A2 is linked to better prognosis and long-term survival in BC patients, particularly in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (Chao2021Expression). This suggests that SULT1A2 may act as a protective factor by downregulating pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, such as the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways (Chao2021Expression). Despite previous views of SULT1A2 as a pseudogene with no role in carcinogenesis, significant expression changes in BC tissues have been observed, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chao2021Expression).

In colorectal cancer, SULT1A2 has been studied for its role in the metabolism of xenobiotics, although its involvement in this cancer type is less clear. A study found no significant association between SULT1A2 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk, suggesting that its role may be limited or context-dependent (Moreno2004Polymorphisms). These findings highlight the complex role of SULT1A2 in cancer biology and its potential clinical significance.
