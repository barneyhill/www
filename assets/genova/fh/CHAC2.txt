# CHAC2

## Overview
The CHAC2 gene encodes the protein ChaC glutathione specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 2, which is a member of the γ-glutamylcyclotransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the degradation of glutathione, a critical antioxidant that maintains cellular redox balance and protects against oxidative stress (Kaur2017ChaC2; Nguyen2019Structural). Structurally, the CHAC2 protein is characterized by a mixed α/β topology and forms dimers, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Nguyen2019Structural). Functionally, CHAC2 plays a significant role in glutathione homeostasis and is crucial for the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (Wang2017CHAC2). Clinically, CHAC2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chand2022Cancer; Liu2017CHAC2).

## Structure
The CHAC2 protein, encoded by the CHAC2 gene, exhibits a mixed α/β topology with nine β-strands (β1-β9), three α-helices (α1-α3), and two 3_10-helices (η1 and η2) (Nguyen2019Structural). The central structure is formed by five β-strands creating an antiparallel β-sheet, characteristic of the GGCT fold, which includes a conserved catalytic cavity with a key 6 YGS 8 motif (Nguyen2019Structural). The protein's tertiary structure features a unique flexible loop2 that protrudes from the core domain, facilitating dimerization with an adjacent CHAC2 molecule in an open conformation (Nguyen2019Structural). This dimerization involves a large buried area and numerous hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, particularly involving conserved residues like Ser8, Arg40, Glu74, Tyr109, and Tyr144 (Nguyen2019Structural).

The quaternary structure of CHAC2 is characterized by its ability to form dimers, as confirmed by crystallographic analysis and size-exclusion chromatography (Nguyen2019Structural). The protein's active site contains conserved residues such as Glu74 and Glu83, which are crucial for its catalytic function and dimerization (Nguyen2019Structural). These structural features align CHAC2 with other GGCT family proteins, indicating a high degree of structural conservation (Nguyen2019Structural).

## Function
The CHAC2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a γ-glutamylcyclotransferase, primarily involved in the degradation of glutathione (GSH) in the cytosol of mammalian cells. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining glutathione homeostasis, which is vital for cellular redox balance and protection against oxidative stress (Kaur2017ChaC2; Nguyen2019Structural). CHAC2 specifically degrades glutathione into 5-oxoproline and cysteinyl-glycine, contributing to the basal turnover of cytosolic glutathione and acting as a housekeeping enzyme in GSH metabolism (Kaur2017ChaC2; Nguyen2019Structural).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), CHAC2 is essential for self-renewal and maintaining GSH levels. It is highly expressed in undifferentiated hESCs and its downregulation leads to decreased GSH levels, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and impaired self-renewal capacity (Wang2017CHAC2). CHAC2 also appears to regulate GSH metabolism by inhibiting CHAC1-mediated GSH degradation, thus playing a regulatory role in maintaining cellular redox balance and pluripotency (Wang2017CHAC2). The protein's activity is modulated by specific residues, such as Glu74 and Glu83, which are crucial for its function in GSH metabolism (Nguyen2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The CHAC2 gene has significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly breast, gastric, and colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, CHAC2 expression is notably higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with elevated levels associated with aggressive subtypes such as HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer. High CHAC2 expression correlates with poor prognosis, lower overall survival, and is linked to clinicopathological parameters like stage and node metastasis (Nguyen2019Structural; Chand2022Cancer). 

In contrast, CHAC2 is frequently downregulated in gastric and colorectal cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with lower survival rates, and its expression inhibits tumor cell growth, proliferation, and migration by inducing apoptosis and autophagy through the unfolded protein response (Liu2017CHAC2). The gene's role in these cancers suggests its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target, with high expression linked to better survival outcomes in gastric and colorectal cancers (Liu2017CHAC2).

CHAC2 also influences immune cell infiltration in breast cancer, showing positive correlations with activated B cells and T cells, which may impact tumor progression and patient prognosis (Chand2022Cancer).
