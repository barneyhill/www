# CACNB1

## Overview
The CACNB1 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 1 (CaVβ1), a critical component of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). These channels are essential for the regulation of calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization, playing a pivotal role in various physiological processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. The CaVβ1 protein, categorized as an auxiliary subunit, modulates the function and expression of the pore-forming CaVα1 subunit, thereby influencing the activity of VGCCs (Erdogmus2022Cavβ1). Beyond its traditional role in excitable cells, CaVβ1 also exhibits non-canonical functions, such as regulating T cell expansion and apoptosis, independent of VGCC-mediated calcium signaling (Erdogmus2022Cavβ1). The gene's ability to undergo alternative splicing results in various isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles, further underscoring its importance in both muscle and immune cell regulation (Andrade2019Genetic).

## Structure
The CACNB1 gene encodes the CaVβ1 subunit, a component of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). The CaVβ1 protein is involved in modulating the function and expression of the pore-forming CaVα1 subunit on the plasma membrane. It contains several conserved domains, including an inactive guanylate kinase (GK) domain and an src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Andrade2019Genetic). The GK domain interacts with the α1-interacting domain (AID) in the I-II loop of the CaVα1 subunit, enhancing the expression of α1 subunits and modulating calcium currents (Erdogmus2022Cavβ1).

The CaVβ1 subunit can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions. Some splice variants of CaVβ1 are membrane-attached via a palmitoylation site, which can influence their localization and function (Andrade2019Genetic). The protein's structure allows it to play roles beyond its traditional function in VGCCs, such as regulating T cell expansion and apoptosis independently of VGCC-mediated calcium influx (Erdogmus2022Cavβ1). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of the CACNB1 protein are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CACNB1 gene encodes the beta-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), which are integral to calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization. This subunit plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of these channels, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. In excitable cells, such as those in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, the beta-1 subunit enhances the expression and function of the pore-forming alpha-1 subunit of VGCCs, facilitating the proper flow of calcium ions across the cell membrane (Erdogmus2022Cavβ1).

In T cells, however, the function of CACNB1 appears to diverge from its traditional role in VGCCs. Despite the presence of mRNAs for several VGCC alpha-1 subunits, T cells lack functional VGCCs due to incomplete transcripts that do not produce full-length channels. Consequently, the beta-1 subunit's role in T cells is independent of VGCC-mediated calcium signaling. Instead, it is involved in regulating T cell expansion and apoptosis, highlighting a non-canonical function in immune cell regulation (Erdogmus2022Cavβ1). This suggests that CACNB1 may have distinct roles in different cell types, contributing to both muscle function and immune responses.

## Interactions
The CACNB1 gene encodes the β1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which plays a significant role in modulating channel activity through various protein interactions. The β1a subunit is crucial for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle by facilitating interactions between dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is essential for the surface expression of DHPRs and the formation of tetrads necessary for efficient excitation-contraction coupling (Campiglio2015The; Buraei2010The).

The β1 subunit also interacts with the α1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels at the α-interaction domain (AID), forming a stable complex that is crucial for channel function. This interaction is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry and involves the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of the β1 subunit (Campiglio2015The; Buraei2010The).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, a novel variant of the β1b subunit (p.R296C) has been identified, which affects its interaction with L- and N-type calcium channels, leading to altered channel properties. This variant is associated with autism spectrum disorder and highlights the importance of β1 subunit interactions in neuronal function (Despang2022Inhibitory).
