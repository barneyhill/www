# PGF

## Overview
The PGF gene encodes the placental growth factor (PlGF), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, which plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. PlGF is a dimeric glycoprotein characterized by a cystine-knot motif and is primarily expressed in placental trophoblasts. It exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 being the most studied. These isoforms differ in their binding properties, with PlGF-2 containing a heparin-binding domain. PlGF interacts with the VEGFR-1 receptor, influencing the availability and activity of other angiogenic factors, and is involved in the activation of monocytes, contributing to inflammatory responses. The gene's expression is modulated by hypoxic conditions, although its regulation is complex. Clinically, alterations in PGF expression are associated with conditions such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, as well as playing a role in tumor angiogenesis and other pathological angiogenic processes (Li2017Dlx3; Carmeliet2001Synergism; De2012The).

## Structure
Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and is involved in angiogenesis. PlGF is a dimeric glycoprotein, typically forming homodimers. The protein is characterized by a cystine-knot motif formed by intra-chain disulfide bonds, which is a common feature in the VEGF family (De2012The). PlGF is subject to glycosylation, with two putative N-glycosylation sites contributing to its higher apparent molecular weight compared to VEGF (Park1994Placenta).

PlGF exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 being the most studied. PlGF-1 is a non-heparin binding diffusible isoform, while PlGF-2 contains a heparin-binding domain (De2012The). The isoforms are generated following the cleavage of an 18-amino acid signal sequence, resulting in mature monomers of 131 and 152 amino acids for PlGF-1 and PlGF-2, respectively (Park1994Placenta). PlGF-2 has a 21-amino acid insertion enriched in basic amino acids compared to PlGF-1, which affects its binding properties (Park1994Placenta). PlGF binds with high affinity to the Flt-1 receptor but not to the KDR receptor, indicating specific receptor interactions (Park1994Placenta).

## Function
Placental growth factor (PGF) is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, primarily involved in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. In healthy human cells, PGF plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the placental vascular network, which is essential for nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and fetus during pregnancy (Chiu2018New). PGF is predominantly expressed in placental trophoblasts and is involved in both branching and non-branching angiogenesis in the terminal villi of the placenta, contributing to a balanced and functional villous vascular bed (Chiu2018New).

PGF functions by binding to the VEGFR-1 receptor with high affinity, which can displace VEGF-A, making it available to bind to VEGFR-2 and indirectly activating it (De2012The). This interaction suggests that PGF modulates angiogenesis by influencing the availability and activity of other angiogenic factors. PGF is also involved in the activation of monocytes, leading to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which may play a role in inflammatory responses (Selvaraj2003Mechanism). The expression of PGF is modulated by hypoxic conditions, although its promoter region lacks a hypoxia responsive element, indicating a complex regulation mechanism (De2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the placental growth factor (PGF) gene are associated with several pathological conditions. In pregnancy, dysregulation of PGF expression is linked to preeclampsia, a condition characterized by maternal hypertension and proteinuria. This is due to an imbalance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, including reduced PGF levels and increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease (Li2017Dlx3). Low PGF levels are also associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which can lead to significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (Li2017Dlx3).

In the context of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a novel 18-base-pair deletion in the PGF promoter region has been identified, which increases the risk of developing this condition. This deletion alters transcription factor binding sites, leading to increased PGF transcription activity, which is implicated in choroidal angiogenesis (Ma2019Identification).

PGF also plays a role in tumor angiogenesis. In Pgf-/- mice, impaired tumor angiogenesis is observed, suggesting that PGF is crucial for tumor growth and vascularization (Carmeliet2001Synergism). The gene's involvement in pathological angiogenesis extends to conditions like ischemic retinopathy and myocardial infarcts, where its expression is upregulated (Carmeliet2001Synergism).

## Interactions
Placental growth factor (PGF) primarily interacts with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), also known as Flt-1. PGF binds with high affinity to VEGFR-1, which is a key interaction in its role in angiogenesis. This binding involves the Ig-like domain 2 of VEGFR-1, with domain 3 also playing a significant role (De2012The). PGF can indirectly activate VEGFR-2 by displacing VEGF-A from VEGFR-1, allowing VEGF-A to bind VEGFR-2, or through heterodimer formation with VEGF-A, which can induce VEGFR-1/VEGFR-2 dimerization (De2012The).

PGF also interacts with neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 coreceptors via their b1b2 domain, which further modulates its effects on endothelial cells (De2012The). In pathological conditions, PGF enhances the angiogenic response to VEGF by forming VEGF/PGF heterodimers and activating VEGFR-1, which acts as both a decoy and a signaling receptor (Carmeliet2001Synergism). These interactions highlight PGF's role in modulating the VEGF response, particularly in pathological angiogenesis (Carmeliet2001Synergism).
