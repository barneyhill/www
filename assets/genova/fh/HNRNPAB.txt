# HNRNPAB

## Overview
The HNRNPAB gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (hnRNP A/B), a member of the hnRNP family known for its RNA-binding properties. This protein plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism, including transcription regulation, alternative splicing, and mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Thibault2021hnRNP). Structurally, hnRNP A/B is characterized by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich low-complexity domain (LCD), which facilitate its interaction with RNA and involvement in cellular stress responses (Thibault2021hnRNP). Although it lacks enzymatic activity, hnRNP A/B functions as a molecular intermediary, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and implicated in various disease processes when dysregulated (Thibault2021hnRNP). The protein's expression levels have been associated with cancer prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zhou2019High; Wang2023HnRNPAB).

## Structure
The HNRNPAB gene encodes a protein that is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities. The protein structure includes two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal glycine-rich low-complexity domain (LCD) (Thibault2021hnRNP). The RRMs are crucial for binding specific RNA sequences, with RRM1 and RRM2 interacting in a fixed antiparallel orientation, allowing the protein to bind two antiparallel RNA strands or a single-stranded RNA with a long connecting loop (Wu2018Molecular). 

The glycine-rich LCD includes an RGG motif, an M9 nuclear localization sequence, and an intrinsically disordered prion-like domain (PrLD) (Thibault2021hnRNP). This domain is involved in forming fibrils under cellular stress, which are more prone to formation when mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases are present (Thibault2021hnRNP). 

HNRNPAB can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein does not exhibit enzymatic activities but acts as a molecular intermediary in RNA metabolism (Thibault2021hnRNP).

## Function
The HNRNPAB gene encodes a protein that is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing within the cell. In healthy human cells, hnRNP A/B proteins, including those encoded by HNRNPAB, are primarily localized in the nucleus and are involved in the regulation of transcription initiation, alternative splicing, and the translocation of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Thibault2021hnRNP). These proteins act as molecular intermediaries, promoting, protecting, and trafficking RNAs in response to cellular needs, although they do not exhibit enzymatic activities like nuclease or polymerase activities (Thibault2021hnRNP).

HnRNP A/B proteins are integral to the spliceosome E complex and play a crucial role in splicing regulation by binding to splicing enhancer sequences to exclude certain introns and alternative exons from mature mRNA (Thibault2021hnRNP). They are also involved in mRNA stability and translation regulation, particularly under stress conditions, and modulate cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation (Thibault2021hnRNP). These functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and are implicated in a wide range of disease processes when dysregulated (Thibault2021hnRNP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HNRNPAB gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often serves as a prognostic marker. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high hnRNP AB expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to factors such as tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC patients (Zhou2019High). In breast cancer, HNRNPAB is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous ones, correlating with more aggressive disease and poorer survival rates. Its expression is higher in younger patients and those with positive nodal and HER2 status, while negatively correlated with estrogen and progesterone receptor status (Cao2020Mining). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, hnRNPAB is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. Knockdown studies in NSCLC cell lines show that reducing hnRNPAB expression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Wang2023HnRNPAB). These findings highlight HNRNPAB's potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
