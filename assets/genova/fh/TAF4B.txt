# TAF4B

## Overview
TAF4B is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 4b, which is a subunit of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This protein plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of reproductive biology. TAF4B is categorized as a transcription factor and is notably enriched in gonadal tissues, where it is essential for the regulation of oocyte-specific genes and the progression of meiosis. It is involved in the expression of key meiotic and oogenesis regulators, thereby influencing primordial follicle formation and ovarian aging (Grive2016TAF4b). Beyond its role in fertility, TAF4B interacts with various proteins to regulate processes such as cancer cell migration and spermatogenesis, highlighting its diverse biological functions (Gustafson2020ZFP628; Kalogeropoulou2010TAF4b). Mutations in the TAF4B gene have been linked to reproductive health issues, including idiopathic azoospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia, as well as implications in cancer progression (Zhang2021Circular; Xi2020Analysis; Ayhan2014Truncating).

## Function
TAF4B is a gonad-enriched subunit of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, TAF4B plays a critical role in the regulation of oocyte-specific genes necessary for meiosis. It is particularly important for the progression of prophase I in meiosis and the expression of key meiotic and oogenesis regulators, such as Stra8, Dazl, Figla, and Nobox (Grive2016TAF4b). TAF4B directly occupies the promoters of these genes, facilitating their expression and the activation of downstream genes like Sycp1/2/3 and Msy2, which are vital for successful prophase I progression and the establishment of a healthy primordial follicle reserve (Grive2016TAF4b).

In human fetal ovaries, TAF4B expression is highly correlated with critical meiotic regulators such as SYCP3, YBX2, and DAZL, indicating its role in maintaining genomic integrity during the long arrest phase of oocytes in diplotene (Grive2016TAF4b). TAF4B is also associated with genes involved in primordial follicle formation, such as TEX14, DDX4, and FMR1, highlighting its importance in early oocyte development and ovarian aging (Grive2016TAF4b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAF4B gene have been linked to several reproductive health issues, particularly affecting male fertility. In humans, a homozygous truncating mutation, p.R611X, in the TAF4B gene has been associated with idiopathic azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen, leading to male infertility (Cannarella2019New; Ayhan2014Truncating). This mutation results in a truncated protein that lacks essential domains for DNA binding and interaction with TAF12, crucial for gene expression regulation (Ayhan2014Truncating).

In a study involving Han Chinese patients, the c.11G>T (p.G4V) mutation in TAF4B was found exclusively in individuals with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), suggesting its significant role in spermatogenesis and potential contribution to NOA in this population (Xi2020Analysis). TAF4B is also implicated in female fertility, as knockout models in mice show infertility due to impaired folliculogenesis, indicating potential implications for human female infertility (Ayhan2014Truncating).

Additionally, TAF4B has been studied in the context of cancer. The circular RNA derived from TAF4B, circTAF4B, is overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-1298-5p, thereby regulating TGFA expression (Zhang2021Circular).

## Interactions
TAF4B is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. In the context of cancer cell migration, TAF4B interacts with members of the AP-1 family, particularly c-Jun, to regulate the expression of integrin α6. This interaction is crucial for the formation of AP-1 complexes at the integrin α6 promoter, where TAF4B acts as a coactivator, enhancing promoter selectivity and influencing cancer cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes (Kalogeropoulou2010TAF4b).

TAF4B also interacts with ZFP628, a transcription factor involved in mouse spermiogenesis. This interaction is mediated through specific domains within both proteins, as identified by yeast two-hybrid screens and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The TAF4B-ZFP628 interaction is essential for regulating stage-specific transcription during spermatid development, with disruptions leading to male infertility due to impaired spermiogenesis (Gustafson2020ZFP628).

Additionally, TAF4B is involved in chromatin regulation during cellular quiescence of developing prospermatogonia. It binds to promoters and transcription start sites, influencing the expression of genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle and DNA damage response (Gura2023Transcription). These interactions highlight TAF4B's role in diverse biological processes, from cancer progression to fertility.
