# C1orf122

## Overview
C1orf122 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 122. This protein is currently not well characterized, and its specific biological functions remain largely unknown. However, it is hypothesized to play a role in cellular processes due to its expression in various tissues. The protein encoded by C1orf122 does not belong to any well-defined category such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have a unique or specialized function within the cell. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of C1orf122 in human biology and its potential implications in health and disease.
