# NDE1

## Overview
NDE1 (nudE neurodevelopment protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in cellular and neurodevelopmental processes. The NDE1 protein is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein essential for microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. It is characterized by a conserved N-terminal coiled-coil domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins such as Lis1 and the dynein intermediate chain, crucial for the stabilization of the dynein complex (Garrott2022Nde1; Zhao2023Nde1). NDE1 is integral to mitotic spindle organization, neuronal migration, and cortical development, and it influences the size and organization of the Golgi apparatus (Monda2018Nde1; Bradshaw2013NDE1). Clinically, mutations in the NDE1 gene are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly with lissencephaly and microhydranencephaly, as well as psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (Hennah2007Families; Bradshaw2016NDE1). The gene's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its significance in both normal development and disease states.

## Structure
NDE1 (nudE neurodevelopment protein 1) is characterized by a molecular structure that includes distinct domains and regions contributing to its function. The protein contains a highly conserved N-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its interactions with Lis1 and the dynein intermediate chain (DIC) (Zhao2023Nde1). This domain facilitates the formation of homodimers and potentially heterodimers with Ndel1, another protein with a similar structure (Garrott2022Nde1). The C-terminus of NDE1 is predicted to have a short coiled-coil domain flanked by intrinsically disordered regions, which may negatively regulate Lis1 binding (Zhao2023Nde1).

NDE1 can form complexes with Lis1 in 1:1 or 2:1 stoichiometry, indicating its role in stabilizing the dynein complex (Zhao2023Nde1). The protein's interaction with the 26S proteasome is isoform-specific, with the Nde1_SSSC isoform interacting with the proteasome, while the Nde1_KMLL isoform does not (Monda2018Nde1). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate NDE1's function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The presence of splice variant isoforms contributes to the functional diversity of NDE1 (Monda2018Nde1).

## Function
The NDE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein essential for microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. NDE1 interacts directly with dynein and the dynein adaptor LIS1, facilitating dynein's function in spindle pole focusing and Golgi organization, although it is not involved in centrosome placement (Monda2018Nde1). This interaction is vital for mitotic spindle organization, centrosome placement, and Golgi apparatus organization, as evidenced by cellular defects observed in NDE1 knockout studies (Monda2018Nde1).

NDE1 is also involved in neurodevelopment, influencing processes such as neuronal migration and cortical development. It is crucial for dynein localization to the kinetochore, necessary for mitotic progression, and affects the size of the Golgi apparatus (Bradshaw2013NDE1). In the context of osteoclastogenesis, NDE1 regulates the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of osteoclast lineage cells by modulating key signaling pathways, including M-CSF and RANKL, and transcription factors like NFATc1 (Das2021The). NDE1's interaction with the 26S proteasome, particularly the 19S regulatory particle, suggests a unique role in proteasome function, potentially contributing to human neurodevelopment (Monda2018Nde1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDE1 gene are associated with several severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Biallelic mutations in NDE1 can lead to microcephaly with lissencephaly, characterized by a significantly reduced brain size and smooth brain surface due to the loss of a dynein-binding domain (Bradshaw2016NDE1). These mutations often result in frameshift mutations in the C-terminal region of the gene. Another condition linked to NDE1 mutations is microhydranencephaly, which involves a more severe reduction in brain size and structure (Bradshaw2013NDE1).

NDE1 is also implicated in psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Genetic studies have shown that NDE1 interacts with the DISC1 gene, and this interaction is associated with schizophrenia, especially in females (Hennah2007Families). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the NDE1 locus have been linked to schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, with some SNPs showing sex-dependent effects (Sinha2020SNP). Alterations in NDE1 expression and its interactions with other proteins, such as LIS1 and RELN, may contribute to the cognitive and neurological deficits observed in these conditions (Bradshaw2016NDE1). The NDE1 locus is also associated with developmental delay, congenital anomalies, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders due to its susceptibility to copy number variations (Bradshaw2016NDE1).

## Interactions
NDE1 (nudE neurodevelopment protein 1) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that influence cellular and neurodevelopmental processes. NDE1 interacts directly with the dynein motor protein complex and the dynein adaptor Lis1, playing a crucial role in dynein regulation and function. This interaction is essential for processes such as spindle pole focusing and Golgi organization, although it is not necessary for centrosome placement (Monda2018Nde1).

NDE1 also competes with the p150 Glued subunit of dynactin for binding to the dynein intermediate chain (DIC), affecting the formation of dynein-dynactin-activator (DDR) complexes. This competition can inhibit the assembly of these complexes, although NDE1 does not affect the motility of preassembled complexes on microtubules (Zhao2023Nde1).

In addition to its role in dynein regulation, NDE1 interacts with the 26S proteasome, specifically associating with the 19S regulatory particle. This interaction is isoform-specific and is not required for the core cellular roles of dynein (Monda2018Nde1).

NDE1 also forms complexes with DISC1, a protein associated with schizophrenia, and can self-associate to form multimeric complexes (Bradshaw2009NDE1). These interactions highlight NDE1's multifaceted role in cellular and neurodevelopmental processes.
