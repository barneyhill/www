# CA11

## Overview
The CA11 gene encodes carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI (CA-RP XI), a member of the α-carbonic anhydrase family, which is distinct due to its lack of catalytic activity. This acatalytic nature arises from the absence of zinc-binding histidine residues, which are essential for the enzymatic function seen in other carbonic anhydrases (Supuran2015Acatalytic; FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA). Despite its inactivity, CA-RP XI is evolutionarily conserved and predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and putamen, suggesting a significant, albeit not fully understood, role in brain function (Aspatwar2013An; Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). The protein is implicated in intracellular signaling and protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing neuronal signaling and pH regulation (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). Additionally, CA11 has been associated with the regulation of glioma growth, acting as a neurexin ligand and influencing tumor cell proliferation through the Akt signaling pathway (Tao2019CA10).

## Structure
The CA11 gene encodes the carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI (CA-RP XI), which is a 328-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 36.2 kDa (FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA; Aspatwar2013An). The primary structure of CA-RP XI includes a hydrophobic N-terminal extension of 23 amino acids, which suggests the presence of a signal sequence, although it lacks a cleavage-site motif for mitochondrial targeting peptides (FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA). The protein is characterized by the absence of three zinc-binding histidine residues, which are crucial for the catalytic activity of carbonic anhydrases, rendering CA-RP XI acatalytic (Supuran2015Acatalytic; FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA).

The tertiary structure of CA-RP XI is similar to other carbonic anhydrases, but it lacks the zinc ion in the active site, which is replaced by other amino acids (Supuran2015Acatalytic). The protein contains several potential phosphorylation sites, indicating possible roles in intracellular signal transduction (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). Despite its lack of catalytic activity, CA-RP XI is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting an important, yet unidentified, function (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and putamen, indicating a potential role in the central nervous system (FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA; Aspatwar2013An).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 11 (CA11) is a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, but unlike other members, it is catalytically inactive due to the absence of essential zinc-binding histidine residues (FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA; Aspatwar2013An). Despite its lack of enzymatic activity, CA11 is highly conserved across species, indicating an important cellular function (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, with strong expression in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and putamen, suggesting a role in brain function (FujikawaAdachi1999cDNA; Aspatwar2013An).

CA11 is thought to play a regulatory or structural role in cells, potentially involved in protein-protein interactions or signaling pathways (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). The presence of potential phosphorylation sites in CA11 suggests interactions with protein kinases, which could influence DNA-protein interactions and intracellular signal transduction (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily). Its expression pattern in the brain and potential involvement in neuronal signaling and pH regulation highlight its significance in the central nervous system, although the exact molecular processes remain to be fully elucidated (Aspatwar2013An).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CA11, also known as carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI, is primarily expressed in the brain and is part of the α-carbonic anhydrase gene family. Despite being catalytically inactive, CA11 is suggested to have important cellular functions, potentially through interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. The protein contains several motifs and phosphorylation sites that may facilitate these interactions. A potential class II SH3 ligand motif within CA11 could enable protein-protein interactions, while the presence of several phosphorylation sites suggests possible interactions with protein kinases. These interactions might influence DNA-protein interactions, potentially regulating binding through phosphorylation (Lovejoy1998Evolutionarily).

CA11 is also implicated in the regulation of glioma growth. It functions as a neurexin ligand, similar to neuroligin-3, and is secreted by depolarized neurons. This interaction is thought to inhibit glioma cell proliferation via the Akt signaling pathway. The study found that CA11 expression is reduced in clinical glioma samples and is negatively associated with high histological grade, suggesting its role in modulating tumor growth and aggressiveness (Tao2019CA10). However, specific details on the physical interactions of CA11 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain less characterized.
