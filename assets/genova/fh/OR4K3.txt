# OR4K3

## Overview
The OR4K3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 3, which is part of the extensive family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in olfactory perception. These receptors are primarily located in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity, where they play a critical role in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Alhazmi2024Copy; Hinkley2012A). The OR4K3 protein, like other olfactory receptors, is integral to the molecular mechanisms underlying odor detection, although specific ligands for OR4K3 remain unidentified (Hinkley2012A). Genetic variations in OR4K3 can contribute to individual differences in olfactory capabilities (Masseroli2015Detection). While the gene is located in a chromosomal region associated with certain developmental and neurological issues, its direct clinical significance is not well-documented, necessitating further research to understand its potential implications in human health (Alhazmi2024Copy).

## Function
The OR4K3 gene is part of the olfactory receptor family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors located primarily in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Upon binding to specific odorants, OR4K3 initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell, contributing to the sense of olfaction in humans (Alhazmi2024Copy). The olfactory receptors, including OR4K3, are involved in the molecular process of odor detection, which is essential for the organismal outcome of olfactory perception. This process involves the binding of odorant molecules to the receptors, triggering a cascade of cellular events that ultimately lead to the transmission of signals to the brain, where they are interpreted as distinct smells (Hinkley2012A). The function of OR4K3 in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its role in olfaction, although specific ligands for many olfactory receptors, including OR4K3, remain unidentified (Hinkley2012A). The genetic variation in olfactory receptors, such as OR4K3, can lead to differences in olfactory capabilities among individuals (Masseroli2015Detection).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR4K3 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions resulting from its mutations. However, it is located in a chromosomal region, 14q11.1-q11.2, that has been associated with various developmental and neurological issues in autistic children. This region has been linked to seizures, motor and cognitive delays, speech impairment, and autistic traits, although the direct impact of OR4K3 mutations within this context remains unclear (Alhazmi2024Copy).

In studies involving Mauritian cynomolgus macaques, OR4K3 was identified as one of the genes with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding amino acid polymorphisms associated with minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs). However, the clinical significance of these findings in relation to OR4K3 is not specified (Weinfurter2020Identifying; Weinfurter2020Identification).

Overall, while OR4K3 is mentioned in various genetic studies, its specific clinical implications remain largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in human health and disease.
