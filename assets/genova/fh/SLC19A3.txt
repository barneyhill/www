# SLC19A3

## Overview
The SLC19A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 19 member 3, a critical thiamine transporter in humans. This protein is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by a twelve-pass transmembrane structure, which facilitates the uptake of thiamine (vitamin B1) across cellular membranes. Thiamine is an essential coenzyme in metabolic pathways crucial for energy production and cellular metabolism. The SLC19A3 protein, also known as human thiamine transporter 2 (hTHTR-2), plays a vital role in maintaining thiamine homeostasis, particularly in the brain and other tissues with high metabolic demands. Mutations in the SLC19A3 gene are linked to several neurometabolic disorders, including biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease and Wernicke's-like encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Aburezq2023Biotinthiamine; Gabriel2024Structural; Schänzer2014Stress‐Induced).

## Structure
The SLC19A3 protein, a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), is a crucial transporter for thiamine (vitamin B1) uptake in humans. It is characterized by a twelve-pass transmembrane structure, forming two six-helix bundle domains, known as the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Gabriel2024Structurala; Gabriel2024Structural). These domains are connected by a flexible intracellular loop, which, along with parts of the N- and C-termini, exhibits structural disorder (Gabriel2024Structurala).

The protein adopts a canonical MFS fold, which is essential for its function in thiamine transport. The thiamine binding site is located near the extracellular side of the transporter, where specific residues such as Tyr113, Trp59, and Phe56 play critical roles in thiamine recognition through π-π stacking interactions (Gabriel2024Structurala; Gabriel2024Structural). The transport cycle involves a rocker-switch mechanism, facilitating conformational changes that allow thiamine to move across the membrane (Gabriel2024Structurala; Gabriel2024Structural).

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation at Asn45, while Asn166 remains glycosylation-free (Gabriel2024Structural). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by specific mutations, which can significantly affect thiamine binding affinity and are linked to neurometabolic disorders (Gabriel2024Structurala; Gabriel2024Structural).

## Function
The SLC19A3 gene encodes a thiamine transporter protein known as human thiamine transporter 2 (hTHTR-2), which is crucial for the uptake of thiamine (vitamin B1) across the plasma membrane of human cells. Thiamine is an essential coenzyme involved in central metabolic pathways, such as the citric acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, which are vital for energy production and cellular metabolism (Nabokina2004Characterization; Gabriel2024Structural). 

In healthy human cells, SLC19A3 facilitates the transport of thiamine, particularly across the intestinal wall and the blood-brain barrier, ensuring adequate thiamine levels for normal neurological function and cellular energy metabolism (Gabriel2024Structural; Schänzer2014Stress‐Induced). The transporter operates through a rocker-switch motion, allowing thiamine to move across the plasma membrane, and is thought to function as a uniporter driven by membrane potential and thiamine concentration gradients (Gabriel2024Structural).

SLC19A3 is also involved in responding to metabolic stress, with its expression being upregulated in response to conditions such as hypoxia and acidosis, which enhances thiamine uptake to adapt to stress conditions (Schänzer2014Stress‐Induced). This adaptive mechanism is crucial for maintaining cellular function and survival under stress.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC19A3 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) and Wernicke's-like encephalopathy. BTBGD is characterized by episodes of confusion, dystonia, seizures, and other neurological symptoms, which can lead to coma and death if untreated. These symptoms are linked to basal ganglia abnormalities visible in MRI scans, and the disease can be triggered by stressors such as febrile illness or catabolic states (Aburezq2023Biotinthiamine; Schänzer2014Stress‐Induced). 

Mutations in SLC19A3 can also result in Leigh-like syndrome in infants, which presents with severe neurological symptoms shortly after birth, including feeding difficulties, lethargy, and seizures (Marcé‐Grau2019Genetic; Alfadhel2017Early). In adults, SLC19A3 mutations can cause Wernicke's-like encephalopathy, characterized by symptoms such as status epilepticus and ataxia, which respond dramatically to thiamine treatment (Alfadhel2017Early).

The gene's mutations lead to reduced or absent thiamine transport activity, affecting neuronal cell survival and function. This impairment is particularly evident during stress periods, as mutant transporters are less responsive to stress-induced upregulation (Schänzer2014Stress‐Induced).

## Interactions
The SLC19A3 protein, a thiamine transporter, participates in various interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms complexes with nanobodies, which are small antibody fragments, to facilitate structural studies. These nanobodies, such as Nb3.3, Nb3.4, and Nb3.7, have been shown to bind to SLC19A3 with affinities in the range of 100-300 nM, aiding in the stabilization and structural analysis of the transporter (Gabriel2024Structural).

SLC19A3 also interacts with several drugs, which can inhibit its function. These interactions include binding with inhibitors like fedratinib, amprolium, and hydroxychloroquine, which can block thiamine uptake by occupying the substrate binding site. The binding involves intercalation of aromatic rings and electrostatic compatibility, which are critical for the inhibitory effects (Gabriel2024Structural).

Additionally, SLC19A3 is involved in the transport of thiamine across cell membranes, a process that may be influenced by the proton gradient across the membrane. Specific acidic residues, such as Glu32 and Glu110, play key roles in this transport mechanism, highlighting the importance of these interactions in the protein's function (Qu2024Substrate).
