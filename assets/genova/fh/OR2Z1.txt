# OR2Z1

## Overview
The OR2Z1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily Z member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the sense of smell (Corda2022GProtein). The OR2Z1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in the conversion of chemical signals from odorants into neuronal signals, facilitating the perception of various odors (Wang2018Methylation). Beyond its primary olfactory function, OR2Z1 is also expressed in other tissues, where it may influence processes such as cellular proliferation and migration, indicating its potential involvement in broader physiological roles (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The gene's expression and function have been linked to dietary preferences and certain health conditions, including cancer and reproductive health, highlighting its significance in both sensory and non-sensory biological processes (Mulim2024Genetic; Corda2022GProtein).

## Function
The OR2Z1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Corda2022GProtein). The OR2Z1 receptor is involved in olfactory transduction, a process that converts chemical signals from odorants into neuronal signals, allowing the organism to perceive different smells (Wang2018Methylation).

In the context of cell biology, OR2Z1 is involved in the olfactory processes related to dietary preferences, as evidenced by its association with juniper consumption in goats, suggesting a potential role in dietary selection based on olfactory cues (Mulim2024Genetic). The receptor's activity is not limited to the nasal epithelium; it is also expressed in other tissues, where it may play roles in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and cytokine production, potentially affecting epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). These functions highlight the diverse roles of OR2Z1 beyond olfaction, contributing to various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The OR2Z1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), OR2Z1 is part of the olfactory transduction pathway, which has been significantly correlated with the occurrence of this cancer type. The study by Wang et al. highlights the potential role of these pathways in inflammation, immune response, and tumor development, suggesting that changes in OR2Z1 expression may contribute to cancer pathogenesis (Wang2018Methylation).

In the realm of reproductive health, OR2Z1 has been identified as a G-protein coupled receptor in human sperm, with potential roles in sperm physiology and male infertility. The study by Corda et al. suggests that OR2Z1, among other GPCRs, may be involved in critical processes such as sperm motility and fertilization, although its specific clinical significance in these contexts remains to be fully elucidated (Corda2022GProtein).

While OR2Z1 is mentioned in the context of central nervous system cancer cell lines, specific clinical implications of its mutations or expression changes in these or other diseases are not well-documented (Matthiesen2020Extracellular).
