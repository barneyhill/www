# PRF1

## Overview
The PRF1 gene encodes perforin 1, a critical protein involved in the immune system's ability to target and eliminate infected or malignant cells. Perforin 1 is categorized as a pore-forming protein, playing a pivotal role in the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). It functions by forming transmembrane pores in target cell membranes, facilitating the entry of granzymes that induce apoptosis in the target cells (Voskoboinik2015Perforin; Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated). The protein's activity is tightly regulated to prevent damage to host tissues, with its function being dependent on calcium ions and post-translational modifications (Voskoboinik2015Perforin). Mutations in the PRF1 gene can lead to severe immune disorders, such as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), highlighting its clinical significance (Brennan2010Perforin).

## Structure
Perforin 1 (PRF1) is a protein encoded by the PRF1 gene, crucial for immune cell function. The molecular structure of perforin includes a membrane attack complex and perforin (MACPF) domain, which is essential for its pore-forming ability. This domain is homologous to those found in bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) and is responsible for the protein's ability to oligomerize and form pores in target cell membranes (Voskoboinik2015Perforin).

The primary structure of perforin consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain. The secondary structure includes transmembrane helical regions (TMH1 and TMH2), which unwind and insert into the membrane to form a large β-barrel structure during pore formation (Voskoboinik2015Perforin). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which includes an amphipathic α-helix that inserts into lipid bilayers, similar to complement components (Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated).

Perforin also contains a C-terminal C2 domain, crucial for calcium-dependent membrane binding, which is a key step in its cytotoxic activity (Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for its activation and function (Voskoboinik2015Perforin). Mutations in the PRF1 gene can lead to dysfunctions associated with diseases like familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) (Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated).

## Function
The PRF1 gene encodes perforin, a protein crucial for the immune function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Perforin plays a vital role in the granule exocytosis pathway, which is essential for immune surveillance and homeostasis. It facilitates the destruction of infected or cancerous cells by forming transmembrane pores in the target cell membranes, allowing granzymes to enter and induce apoptosis (Voskoboinik2015Perforin; Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated).

Perforin is stored in secretory vesicles within cytotoxic lymphocytes and is released upon recognition of target cells. The protein binds to the target cell membrane in a calcium-dependent manner, oligomerizing to form a pore structure that enables the entry of granzymes into the cell (Voskoboinik2015Perforin; Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated). This process is critical for the immune system's ability to eliminate infected or transformed cells, maintaining immune balance and preventing lymphoproliferative disorders (Voskoboinik2006Perforinmediated).

In healthy human cells, perforin's activity is tightly regulated to prevent damage to the host cells. It is stored in an inactive form in acidic secretory granules and becomes active upon secretion at the neutral pH of the immunological synapse (Voskoboinik2015Perforin). This regulation ensures that perforin's potent cytotoxic effects are directed only towards target cells, preventing excessive inflammation and immune pathology (Voskoboinik2015Perforin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRF1 gene, which encodes the protein perforin, are associated with several severe diseases, primarily familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), a life-threatening immune disorder. FHL type 2 (FHL2) is directly linked to PRF1 mutations, accounting for 15-60% of cases, depending on the population studied (Brennan2010Perforin; Stadt2005Mutation). These mutations lead to perforin deficiency, resulting in impaired cytotoxic lymphocyte function and severe immune dysregulation (Brennan2010Perforin).

The A91V polymorphism in PRF1 is the most common variant in Caucasians and is associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, B and T-cell lymphomas, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Brennan2010Perforin). PRF1 mutations are also linked to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes and multiple sclerosis, with a higher frequency of A91V mutations observed in patients (Sieni2014Familial).

In addition to FHL, PRF1 mutations are implicated in various hematological malignancies, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (El2011Molecular). The mutations can lead to a range of clinical presentations, from early-onset severe disease to atypical late presentations, depending on the specific genetic alterations and their impact on perforin function (Stadermann2024Late; Gupta2010Primary).

## Interactions
Perforin 1 (PRF1) is a critical component of the immune system, primarily involved in the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It interacts with several proteins to execute its function. One of the key interactions is with granzymes, particularly granzyme B, which are serine proteases that enter target cells through the pores formed by perforin to induce apoptosis (Voskoboinik2015Perforin). This interaction is essential for the immune response against virus-infected and cancerous cells.

Perforin is also associated with serglycin, a proteoglycan that helps in the storage and release of granzymes within cytotoxic granules. The interaction with serglycin is crucial for maintaining the stability and proper delivery of granzymes to the immunological synapse (Brennan2018Perforin).

The activity of perforin is regulated by calcium ions, which bind to its C2 domain. This binding is necessary for the conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with lipid membranes, allowing pore formation (Spicer2017Perforin—A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that ensure perforin's precise function in immune surveillance and cytotoxicity.
