# MARCKSL1

## Overview
MARCKSL1 (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate Like 1) is a gene that encodes the MARCKS like 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. The MARCKS like 1 protein is a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein that plays a critical role in actin filament stabilization and dynamics, influencing cell shape and motility. It is a substrate for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates the protein, thereby modulating its interaction with actin and affecting cellular processes such as migration and signal transduction. MARCKSL1 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and is essential for neural development, including neural tube closure and neuronal migration. Additionally, it is involved in vascular development by modulating endothelial cell responses to mechanical forces. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as VEGFR-2 and TLR2, further underscore its significance in angiogenesis and immune signaling pathways (Kondrychyn2020Marcksl1; Björkblom2012cJun; El2018MARCKS).

## Function
MARCKSL1 (MARCKS like 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. In healthy human cells, MARCKSL1 is involved in stabilizing F-actin upon phosphorylation, which enhances filopodium dynamics and regulates cell migration (El2018MARCKS). It acts as a substrate for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates MARCKSL1 at specific sites, influencing actin stability and cell motility. This phosphorylation can either inhibit or promote cell migration depending on the specific sites involved (Björkblom2012cJun).

MARCKSL1 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it is essential for processes such as neural tube closure and neuronal migration. It regulates actin remodeling, which is critical for maintaining actin homeostasis and facilitating neural development (Björkblom2012cJun). In endothelial cells, MARCKSL1 modulates the mechanoresponse to hemodynamic forces, affecting blood vessel shape and size by promoting the formation of linear actin bundles and influencing cortical integrity (Kondrychyn2020Marcksl1).

Overall, MARCKSL1 is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it influences cell shape, motility, and signal transduction, playing a significant role in both neural and vascular development (Chen2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and phosphorylation of the MARCKSL1 gene have significant implications in various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer cells, MARCKSL1 expression is deregulated in several types, including breast, lung, muscle-derived cancers, and uterine cancer. Its expression is notably upregulated in prostate carcinomas, where it shows distinct localization patterns in tumor tissues compared to noncancerous regions, particularly in Gleason grade 3 and 4 tumors (Björkblom2012cJun). The phosphorylation of MARCKSL1 by JNK is crucial for its role in stabilizing actin and regulating cell migration. In prostate cancer cells, MARCKSL1 phosphorylation acts as an inhibitory factor for cell migration, with knockdown increasing migration rates (Björkblom2012cJun).

In lung adenocarcinoma, the long non-coding RNA MARCKSL1-2 is involved in reversing docetaxel resistance by modulating the HDAC1/miR-200b axis. MARCKSL1-2 expression is significantly reduced in docetaxel-resistant cells, and its overexpression decreases resistance, suggesting its potential as a target for improving chemotherapy outcomes (Jiang2022MARCKSL1–2).

MARCKSL1 is also being investigated as a diagnostic marker for metastatic colorectal cancer. Elevated levels of extracellular vesicle-derived MARCKSL1 in plasma are associated with metastatic colorectal cancer, indicating its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection of metastasis (Rong2023Circulating).

## Interactions
MARCKSL1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It exhibits a strong interaction with VEGFR-2, a receptor involved in angiogenesis. This interaction inhibits VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, which is crucial for endothelial cell migration and proliferation. The interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses, demonstrating that MARCKSL1 directly binds to VEGFR-2 in HEK293T cells (KIM2015MARCKSL1). 

MARCKSL1 is also phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which affects actin stability and bundling. This phosphorylation promotes F-actin bundling, influencing cell migration by stabilizing actin filaments (Björkblom2012cJun). 

In addition, MARCKSL1 interacts with actin filaments, particularly F-actin, and this interaction is enhanced when MARCKSL1 is phosphorylated, leading to increased actin bundling and reduced actin turnover (Björkblom2012cJun). 

MARCKSL1 has been identified as a potential interacting partner of TLR2, validated through immunoblot and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, suggesting its involvement in the TLR2 signaling pathway (Kamal2019Crosslinking).
