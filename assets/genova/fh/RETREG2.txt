# RETREG2

## Overview
RETREG2 is a gene that encodes the protein reticulophagy regulator family member 2, also known as FAM134A, which plays a critical role in the process of reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for degradation. This protein is characterized by its reticulon homology domain (RHD), which is essential for inducing membrane curvature and facilitating the selective degradation of ER components. RETREG2 is primarily expressed in the brain and testes, with its function being particularly significant in maintaining ER homeostasis and function during neurogenesis. The protein's involvement in ER-phagy is crucial for cellular health, as it aids in the removal of damaged or excess ER, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis. Additionally, RETREG2 has been implicated in glioma susceptibility, highlighting its potential clinical significance in brain tumor development (Robinson2020Transcriptomewide; Hoyer2024Combinatorial).

## Structure
The RETREG2 gene, also known as FAM134B, encodes a protein involved in reticulophagy, specifically the selective degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein consists of 497 amino acids and is characterized by several key structural domains. It contains a reticulon homology domain (RHD), which spans residues 83-235 and is crucial for its function in membrane curvature induction and protein sorting. The RHD includes two wedge-shaped transmembrane helical hairpins and two amphipathic helices, which are essential for membrane shaping and remodeling (Bhaskara2019Curvature).

The RHD is flanked by disordered N-terminal (1-80) and C-terminal (260-497) fragments, with the latter containing a conserved LC3-interaction region (LIR) domain. This LIR domain facilitates interactions with LC3/GABARAP family members, playing a significant role in ER-phagy (Zhu2021Roles; Bhaskara2019Curvature). The protein's structure also includes three serine residues (S149, S151, and S153) on a flexible cytoplasmic linker, which are subject to phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that regulates its oligomerization and function in ER fragmentation (Zhu2021Roles).

The RHD's unique topology, including its wedge-shaped inclusion in the membrane, drives curvature and clustering in membranes, which is vital for its role in ER-phagy (Bhaskara2019Curvature).

## Function
RETREG2, also known as FAM134A, is a protein-coding gene involved in the process of reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining ER homeostasis and function, particularly during neurogenesis. RETREG2 is part of the FAM134 family, which includes other members like RETREG1 and RETREG3. These proteins cluster through their reticulon homology domains (RHDs) into highly curved nanoscale membrane domains, recruiting the autophagy machinery to nucleate phagophore formation. This activity is essential for the selective clearance of ER proteins, thereby remodeling the ER during neurogenesis (Hoyer2024Combinatorial).

In healthy human cells, RETREG2 is primarily expressed in the brain and testes, although it exhibits low tissue specificity. Its role in the brain is particularly significant, as it is involved in the selective autophagic turnover of ER components, which is vital for cellular health and function (Robinson2020Transcriptomewide). The protein's activity in the ER membrane facilitates the removal of damaged or excess ER, contributing to the regulation of ER turnover and quality control, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hoyer2024Combinatorial).

## Clinical Significance
RETREG2, also known as FAM134A, has been implicated in glioma susceptibility. A transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization study identified RETREG2 as a novel gene associated with glioma risk, suggesting that increased expression of this gene may contribute to the development of gliomas, a type of brain tumor (Robinson2020Transcriptomewide). The study highlighted the importance of tissue specificity, noting that the expression of RETREG2 in brain tissues could influence glioma risk, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Robinson2020Transcriptomewide).

Despite its potential role in glioma, RETREG2 is not located on a known glioma risk locus, indicating its novel contribution to glioma susceptibility (Robinson2020Transcriptomewide). The gene's expression is primarily found in the brain and testes, and its functions are largely unknown, which underscores the need for further research to elucidate its role in glioma and other diseases (Robinson2020Transcriptomewide).

In the context of gene expression profiling, RETREG2 is listed among genes with normal expression levels in the RET cluster, indicating no significant expression changes in certain conditions (Rao2023Gene). However, its potential link to glioma risk suggests that alterations in its expression could have clinical significance.
