# PDIA6

## Overview
Protein Disulfide Isomerase Family A Member 6 (PDIA6) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, crucial for protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein encoded by PDIA6, also known as protein disulfide isomerase A6, is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family and is characterized by its oxidoreductase activity, facilitated by two redox-active thioredoxin-like domains (Lee2024Ca2+driven; Sha2012Channel). PDIA6 plays a significant role in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) by modulating the activity of key UPR sensors such as inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive stress responses (Eletto2014Protein). The protein's interactions extend to other cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and immune cell development, highlighting its importance in various physiological and pathological contexts (Luo2022Protein; Choi2020Essential). Mutations in the PDIA6 gene have been associated with several diseases, including diabetes, immunodeficiencies, and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Powell2021Protein; Choi2020Essential; Chhabra2021A).

## Structure
PDIA6 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, characterized by its involvement in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein consists of 439 amino acids and includes a 19 amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is hydrophobic in nature, and an ER retention signal, KDEL, at the C-terminus (Sha2012Channel). PDIA6 contains two redox-active thioredoxin-like domains, each with a CGHC active site motif, which are crucial for its oxidoreductase activity (Lee2024Ca2+driven; Sha2012Channel). These domains facilitate the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, essential for protein folding.

The protein also has a C-terminal redox-inactive thioredoxin-like domain, which is thought to be involved in substrate binding (Sha2012Channel). PDIA6 can form a homodimer through a unique Val-Leu adhesive motif located in the a0 domain (Lee2024Ca2+driven). This dimerization is important for its function and is influenced by calcium ion binding, which induces phase separation and affects its structural conformation (Lee2024Ca2+driven). PDIA6 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and stability.

## Function
Protein Disulfide Isomerase A6 (PDIA6) is an enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis by regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR). PDIA6 modulates the activity of UPR sensors, particularly inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), by forming disulfide-dependent associations with these proteins. This interaction is essential for controlling the duration and intensity of UPR signaling, preventing excessive stress responses that could lead to cell death (Eletto2014Protein).

PDIA6 specifically attenuates the signaling activity of IRE1 by binding to a cysteine residue in its lumenal domain, which limits IRE1's RNase activity responsible for degrading selected mRNAs during the UPR. This regulation is crucial for maintaining a steady-state pool of insulin mRNA, necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (Eletto2015PDIA6). PDIA6's role in modulating IRE1 and PERK activities is vital for cellular homeostasis, as its absence leads to exaggerated UPR signaling and increased sensitivity to ER stress-induced apoptosis (Eletto2014Protein). PDIA6 is also involved in immune cell development, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal health (Choi2020Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDIA6 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A mutation in PDIA6, specifically a valine to alanine substitution at position 32 (V32A), has been associated with growth retardation, diabetes, and severe lymphoid and myeloid hypoplasia in mice, suggesting a potential role in syndromic immunodeficiency diseases in humans (Choi2020Essential). Another study identified a biallelic loss of function variant in PDIA6 linked to asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) and neonatal-onset diabetes, highlighting its role in skeletal ciliopathy and immune abnormalities (Al‐Fadhli2021Biallelic).

In the context of diabetes, a point mutation in PDIA6, resulting in a phenylalanine to serine change (F175S), leads to a loss of pancreatic β-cell identity and overt diabetes, indicating its critical role in maintaining β-cell function (Chhabra2021A). PDIA6 is also implicated in cancer, where it is frequently upregulated and contributes to cancer cell survival and chemotherapy resistance, particularly in lung cancer (Tufo2014The; Powell2021Protein). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PDIA6 in various pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders, immunodeficiencies, and cancer.

## Interactions
Protein Disulfide Isomerase A6 (PDIA6) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. PDIA6 interacts directly with the unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), specifically binding to the oxidized Cys148 residue in the lumenal domain of IRE1. This interaction is essential for modulating the duration of IRE1 signaling, as PDIA6 helps reduce disulfide-linked dimers of IRE1, promoting its deactivation (Eletto2014Protein). PDIA6 also interacts with another UPR sensor, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), influencing its signaling activity (Eletto2014Protein).

In addition to its role in the UPR, PDIA6 interacts with spastin, a protein involved in microtubule dynamics and nerve repair. This interaction is crucial for spastin's activity in severing microtubules, as PDIA6 knockdown inhibits this function (Luo2022Protein). PDIA6 also associates with misfolded proinsulin, particularly the Akita mutant, suggesting a role in the quality control of proinsulin biosynthesis and management of endoplasmic reticulum stress (Gorasia2016A). These interactions highlight PDIA6's involvement in various cellular stress responses and protein quality control mechanisms.
