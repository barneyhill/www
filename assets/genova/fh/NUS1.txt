# NUS1

## Overview
The NUS1 gene encodes the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR), a protein that plays a pivotal role in several cellular processes, including lipid biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis. NgBR is a subunit of the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase complex, where it functions as a structural component, facilitating the synthesis of long-chain polyprenols essential for the N-linked glycosylation pathway (Edani2020Structural; BarEl2020Structural). Although NgBR lacks catalytic activity, it stabilizes the enzyme complex and participates in substrate binding through its unique structural features (BarEl2020Structural). Beyond its enzymatic role, NgBR interacts with the lysosomal protein Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2), aiding in cholesterol transport and maintaining cellular cholesterol balance (Yu2021Lysosomal). Additionally, NgBR serves as a receptor for Nogo-B, influencing endothelial cell behavior, which underscores its importance in vascular biology (Yu2021Lysosomal). Variants in the NUS1 gene have been linked to several disorders, including congenital glycosylation disorders and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiang2020Lowfrequency; Guo2018Coding).

## Structure
The NUS1 gene encodes the Nogo-B receptor, a protein involved in dolichol biosynthesis. The protein is a subunit of the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase complex, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of long-chain polyprenols. The NUS1 protein, also known as NgBR in humans, is part of a heterodimeric complex with DHDDS, where it stabilizes the complex and participates in the enzyme's active site through its C-terminal -RXG-motif (Edani2020Structural). This motif is essential for the enzyme's function, as it aids in the organization of the active site and enhances the complex's catalytic activity (BarEl2020Structural).

Structurally, the NUS1 protein contains a pseudo cis-prenyltransferase homology domain, which consists of six α-helices and five β-strands, differing from the typical seven α-helices and six β-strands found in other cis-prenyltransferases (BarEl2020Structural). Despite its structural similarity to DHDDS, NUS1 lacks key catalytic residues, which precludes its catalytic activity but allows it to facilitate intersubunit communication within the complex (BarEl2020Structural). The protein's C-terminus is involved in forming the heterodimeric interface with DHDDS, contributing to the overall stability and function of the complex (BarEl2020Structural).

## Function
The NUS1 gene encodes the Nogo B receptor (NgBR), a multifunctional protein that plays several critical roles in healthy human cells. NgBR forms a heterodimeric complex with the DHDDS gene product, which is essential for the biosynthesis of polyprenol and dolichol lipids. Dolichol serves as a lipid carrier for precursors in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a crucial process for proper protein folding and function (Yu2021Lysosomal; BarEl2020Structural). NgBR also stabilizes the lysosomal protein Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2), which is necessary for the efflux of cholesterol from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Yu2021Lysosomal).

In addition to its role in lipid biosynthesis and cholesterol transport, NgBR acts as a receptor for Nogo B, a ligand involved in the chemotaxis and adhesion of endothelial cells, particularly in the vasculature (Yu2021Lysosomal). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular and systemic health, with implications for disorders related to glycosylation and cholesterol metabolism (Yu2021Lysosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NUS1 gene are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. Pathogenic variants of NUS1 have been linked to mental retardation-55 with seizures (MRD55), a rare genetic condition characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, language delay, and multiple types of epileptic seizures (Zhang2021Case). These variants often result in truncated proteins, suggesting a mechanism of haploinsufficiency (Zhang2021Case). 

NUS1 mutations are also implicated in lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, which contributes to movement disorders such as ataxia and tremors. This is due to the gene's role in cholesterol transport and homeostasis, with deficiencies leading to impaired lysosomal function and increased cholesterol accumulation in neuronal cells (Yu2021Lysosomal). 

Additionally, NUS1 variants have been associated with Parkinson's disease, with certain low-frequency and rare coding variants linked to an increased risk of the disease and its early onset (Jiang2020Lowfrequency). The gene's involvement in glycosylation processes and lipid homeostasis underlies its significance in these diverse clinical phenotypes (Yu2021Lysosomal).

## Interactions
The NUS1 gene encodes the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR), which is involved in several critical protein interactions. NgBR forms a heterodimeric complex with the DHDDS gene product, essential for the biosynthesis of polyprenol and dolichol lipids, which are crucial for the N-linked glycosylation pathway (Yu2021Lysosomal; Grabińska2017A). This interaction is vital for the function of the cis-prenyltransferase (cis-PTase) enzyme, with NgBR serving as a structural component involved in catalysis and substrate binding (Grabińska2017A).

NgBR also interacts with the lysosomal protein Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2), stabilizing it and modulating cholesterol transport from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (Yu2021Lysosomal). This interaction is significant for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis within cells.

In addition to these interactions, NgBR acts as a receptor for Nogo-B, a ligand that influences the chemotaxis and adhesion of endothelial cells (Yu2021Lysosomal). These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of NgBR in cellular processes, including lipid biosynthesis, glycosylation, and cholesterol metabolism. Variants in NUS1 that affect these interactions have been linked to various disorders, including congenital disorders of glycosylation and potentially Parkinson's disease (Guo2018Coding).
