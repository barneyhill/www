# TEX28

## Overview
TEX28 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 28, which is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a role in spermatogenesis. The protein is part of the TEX gene family, which is characterized by its testis-specific expression and evolutionary conservation, underscoring its importance in male reproductive biology. Although the precise biological functions of the TEX28 protein are not fully elucidated, it is known to participate in a network of protein interactions related to spermatogenesis. Despite its involvement in these interactions, TEX28 is not a central component of the primary protein network associated with this process, suggesting a more peripheral or specialized role (Petit2015Combining; Bellil2021Human). Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of TEX28 in male fertility and its potential clinical significance.

## Interactions
TEX28 is a gene that encodes a protein primarily expressed in the testis, and it is involved in spermatogenesis. The protein interactions of TEX28 have been studied to understand its role in reproductive functions. In a study by Petit et al., TEX28 was identified as one of the smallest isolated connected components in a protein interaction network related to spermatogenesis. It was found to bind up to six interactors, although it is not linked to the principal component of the network, suggesting that while TEX28 has some interactions, it is not part of the main network of proteins associated with spermatogenesis (Petit2015Combining).

The TEX gene family, to which TEX28 belongs, is known for its testis-specific expression and evolutionary conservation across species, indicating a significant role in male fertility. However, specific details about the protein interactions of TEX28, such as the identities of its interactors or the nature of these interactions, are not extensively documented in the available literature (Bellil2021Human). The study of TEX28 and its interactions remains an area of interest for understanding its potential impact on spermatogenesis and male fertility.
