# OR10V1

## Overview
OR10V1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily V member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it is involved in the initial steps of olfactory signal transduction, which ultimately leads to the perception of smell. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10V1 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including pain pathways and potential roles in skin cell signaling and wound healing. Its expression in non-nasal tissues suggests a broader biological significance, which is still under investigation (Lee2019Genomewide; Ahn2016Network; Chen2016Expression).

## Function
OR10V1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR10V1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Lee2019Genomewide).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR10V1 has been implicated in various physiological processes. It is suggested to be involved in pain pathways, particularly in the context of post-radiotherapy pain in breast cancer patients. This involvement is potentially mediated through the activation of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, which are known to play roles in sensory perception and inflammation (Lee2019Genomewide). Additionally, OR10V1 has been associated with differential expression in conditions such as PTSD, indicating a broader role in biological mechanisms beyond olfaction (Chen2016Expression).

The expression of OR10V1 in non-nasal tissues, such as skin, suggests potential roles in skin cell signaling and wound healing processes, although these functions are not fully understood (Ahn2016Network).
