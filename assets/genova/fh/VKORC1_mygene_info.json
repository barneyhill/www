Vitamin K is a required co-factor for carboxylation of glutamic acid residues by vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase in blood-clotting enzymes. Allelic variation in this gene is associated with vitamin k-dependent clotting factors combined deficiency of 2, and increased resistance or sensitivity to warfarin, an inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 1 and X. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
