# WT1

## Overview
The WT1 gene encodes the WT1 transcription factor, a zinc finger protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during development and in adult tissues. This transcription factor is characterized by its four Cys2His2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to DNA and RNA, thereby influencing transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes (Stoll2007Structure). WT1 is crucial for the development of the kidneys and gonads, as well as for hematopoiesis and the central nervous system (Wilm2016The). The gene's expression and function are tightly regulated, with alternative splicing generating isoforms that have distinct roles in cellular processes (Bardeesy1998Overlapping). Mutations in WT1 are linked to several genetic disorders, including Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, and Wilms' tumor, highlighting its clinical significance (Niaudet2006WT1; Little1997A).

## Structure
The WT1 transcription factor is characterized by its four Cys2His2 zinc finger motifs located in the C-terminal region, which are essential for its DNA-binding capability. These zinc fingers adopt a canonical ββα fold, stabilized by zinc coordination, and are involved in sequence-specific interactions with DNA. The second, third, and fourth zinc fingers insert deeply into the major groove of the DNA, making base-specific contacts, while the first zinc finger primarily interacts with the DNA backbone and a flipped-out cytidine base, enhancing binding affinity without contributing to specificity (Stoll2007Structure).

WT1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, notably the -KTS and +KTS variants. The -KTS isoform binds DNA sequence-specifically, while the +KTS isoform is involved in RNA binding and post-transcriptional regulation (Stoll2007Structure; Bardeesy1998Overlapping). The zinc finger domains also contain nuclear localization signals and can interact with other proteins, such as the par-4 transcriptional repressor and p53, influencing transcriptional regulation (Bardeesy1998Overlapping).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation of specific serines, can inhibit DNA binding by causing steric clashes and electrostatic repulsions, affecting the protein's function (Stoll2007Structure).

## Function
The WT1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It is essential for kidney development, particularly in the formation and maintenance of podocytes, which are crucial for the kidney's filtration function. WT1 regulates the expression of nephrin and podocalyxin, vital for the morphology of the slit diaphragm and foot processes of the glomerular filtration membrane (Wilm2016The). In the developing kidney, WT1 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme, which differentiates to form the nephron's epithelium (Roberts2005Transcriptional).

WT1 is also involved in gonadal development, influencing the expression of key genes like SRY and SF1, which are involved in sex determination and gonadal differentiation. It is necessary for the integrity and survival of Sertoli and germ cells in the testes and is expressed in stromal and granulosa cells in female gonads, suggesting its involvement in folliculogenesis (Wilm2016The).

In addition to its roles in kidney and gonadal development, WT1 is involved in hematopoiesis, influencing the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Wilm2016The). It also plays a role in the development of the central nervous system, with specific isoforms required for the formation of olfactory epithelium and retinal ganglia (Roberts2005Transcriptional). WT1's diverse roles in cellular processes underscore its importance in maintaining normal organ homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WT1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is characterized by nephropathy, male pseudohermaphroditism, and a predisposition to Wilms' tumor, with more than 90% of patients having constitutional intragenic WT1 mutations. These mutations are often missense mutations in exons 8 or 9, affecting the zinc finger regions crucial for DNA binding (Baird1992Constitutional; Niaudet2006WT1; Little1997A). Frasier syndrome, another condition linked to WT1 mutations, presents with normal female external genitalia, streak gonads, an XY karyotype, and progressive nephropathy, often leading to end-stage renal disease. It is associated with intronic mutations that result in the loss of the +KTS isoforms (Niaudet2006WT1).

WT1 mutations are also implicated in Wilms' tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, with about 6-10% of sporadic cases showing these mutations. In WAGR syndrome, large deletions encompassing the WT1 gene lead to Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary malformations, and mental retardation (Little1997A; Algar2002A). Additionally, WT1 is involved in hematopoiesis and is expressed in various leukemias, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis (Ariyaratana2007The; Algar2002A).

## Interactions
The WT1 transcription factor is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. WT1 interacts with splice factors such as U2AF65, WTAP, and RBM4, which are involved in RNA processing and alternative splicing (Morrison2008The). The +KTS isoform of WT1 specifically interacts with RBM4, affecting alternative splicing (Morrison2008The).

WT1 also binds directly to heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U (hnRNP-U), modulating its transcriptional activation capabilities (Spraggon2006hnRNPU). The protein interacts with ZNF224, enhancing WT1-mediated transcriptional activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) promoter (Florio2010Biochemical). ZNF224 and its alternative splicing product ZNF255 have distinct roles, with ZNF224 acting as a transcriptional co-activator and ZNF255 potentially involved in post-transcriptional regulation (Florio2010Biochemical).

WT1's zinc fingers allow it to bind both DNA and RNA, with the +KTS isoforms primarily binding RNA and localizing in nuclear speckles, while the -KTS isoforms have stronger DNA binding and are involved in transcriptional regulation (Ullmark2018DNA). These interactions highlight WT1's multifunctional role in cellular processes.
