# CUEDC2

## Overview
CUEDC2 (CUE domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. The CUEDC2 protein is characterized by the presence of a CUE domain, which is known for its role in ubiquitin-binding and protein-protein interactions. This protein functions as a regulatory molecule, influencing pathways such as the NF-κB signaling pathway and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during mitosis. CUEDC2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain, heart, and testis, underscoring its importance in diverse physiological processes (Hu2019Expression; Man2011CUEDC2:). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in cancer biology, where CUEDC2 can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the cellular context (Li2017CUEDC2; Han2022CUEDC2).

## Function
CUEDC2 (CUE domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in several cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. In healthy human cells, CUEDC2 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by promoting the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint and facilitating the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is crucial for the metaphase-anaphase transition during mitosis (Man2011CUEDC2:). It is phosphorylated by Cdk1, which is essential for its interaction with Cdc20, leading to the dissociation of Mad2 from the APC/C-Cdc20 complex and subsequent cell cycle progression (Man2011CUEDC2:).

CUEDC2 also acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway, inhibiting prolonged activation by inactivating IKKs through the recruitment of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the IKK/CUEDC2 complex. This regulation is important for controlling inflammatory responses (Man2011CUEDC2:). Additionally, CUEDC2 is involved in the regulation of hormone receptor expression, such as estrogen receptor α and progesterone receptor, affecting cellular responsiveness to hormonal signals (Man2011CUEDC2:). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain, heart, and testis, indicating its importance in various physiological processes (Hu2019Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in CUEDC2 expression have significant clinical implications across various cancers. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), CUEDC2 expression is notably lower compared to normal brain tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to poor prognosis and shorter survival times in GBM patients. Overexpression of CUEDC2 in glioma cells inhibits these tumorigenic properties by suppressing the JAK1-STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Li2017CUEDC2).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CUEDC2 expression is linked to poorer disease-free survival. High CUEDC2 levels promote TNBC cell proliferation and invasion by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, indicating its role as a tumor promoter in this context. Targeting the interaction between CUEDC2 and β-catenin has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy (Han2022CUEDC2).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CUEDC2 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing SOCS1 and inhibiting the JAK1-STAT3 pathway. Low CUEDC2 expression correlates with increased SOCS1 degradation, enhanced pathway activation, and poorer survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Wu2018CUEDC2).

## Interactions
CUEDC2 (CUE domain containing 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with the progesterone receptor B (PRB), where it negatively regulates PRB expression by promoting its degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo, and is independent of progesterone presence (Zhang2007CUE). CUEDC2 also interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), affecting its stability (Zhang2007CUE).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CUEDC2 interacts with the SOCS1 protein through its CUE domain and the SH2 domain of SOCS1. This interaction plays a role in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SOCS1, impacting the JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathway (Wu2018CUEDC2).

CUEDC2 also binds to SOCS3, another member of the suppressors of cytokine signaling family, enhancing SOCS3 stability and its interaction with Elongin C, which is crucial for inhibiting the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway (Zhang2012CUEDC2).

Additionally, CUEDC2 interacts with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), negatively regulating its chaperone activity. This interaction is mediated by the CUE domain of CUEDC2 and the PBD and CT domains of HSP70 (Gong2014CUEDC2).
