# PHF19

## Overview
PHF19 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 19, a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The PHF19 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a Tudor domain and plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, which facilitate its interaction with specific histone marks, such as H3K36me3 and H3tK27me3. These interactions are essential for the recruitment and modulation of PRC2's enzymatic activities, influencing processes like stem cell pluripotency and differentiation (Dong2020Structural; Ghamlouch2021Insights). PHF19 exists in two isoforms, PHF19S and PHF19L, which differ in their domain composition and subcellular localization, further diversifying its functional roles (Ghamlouch2021Insights). The gene's involvement in various signaling pathways and its dysregulation in cancers such as multiple myeloma and glioblastoma underscore its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Walker2023Identifying; Deng2018PHF19).

## Structure
PHF19 (PHD finger protein 19) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and plays a role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. The PHF19 protein contains several distinct domains, including an amino-terminal Tudor domain, two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, an extended homologous (EH/WH) domain, and a C-terminal RC/CL domain (Ghamlouch2021Insights). The Tudor domain is particularly significant for its ability to bind specific histone marks, such as H3K36me3 and H3tK27me3, through a conserved aromatic cage and hydrophobic interactions (Dong2020Structural; Qin2013Tudor).

PHF19 exists in two isoforms, PHF19S and PHF19L, resulting from alternative splicing. The short isoform, PHF19S, lacks one of the PHD domains and the EH/WH domain but includes a specific C-terminal region. PHF19L is exclusively nuclear, while PHF19S is found in both the cytosol and nucleus (Ghamlouch2021Insights). The protein's structure allows it to interact with other proteins and histone marks, facilitating the recruitment and modulation of PRC2's enzymatic activities (Dong2020Structural).

The Tudor domain of PHF19 adopts a classic fold with a five-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel, which is crucial for its binding specificity and affinity to histone peptides (Dong2020Structural). This structural configuration enables PHF19 to play a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing.

## Function
PHF19 (PHD finger protein 19) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is involved in the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), leading to transcriptional repression. PHF19 is active in the nucleus and is essential for maintaining stem cell pluripotency and differentiation (Ghamlouch2021Insights).

In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), PHF19 regulates the balance between quiescence and differentiation. It recruits the PRC2 complex to genomic targets crucial for hematopoiesis and blood-lineage differentiation (Ghamlouch2021Insights). PHF19 expression is higher in stem/progenitor cells and decreases during differentiation, except in monocytes. This pattern suggests its role in maintaining stem cell identity and promoting differentiation (Ghamlouch2021Insights).

PHF19 also influences the AKT signaling pathway, which is important for cell cycle progression and proliferation. In normal physiology, PHF19 expression is modulated during the activation and differentiation of mature blood cells, such as B-cells and T-cells (Ghamlouch2021Insights). Its expression is highest in proliferating centroblasts and pre-plasmablasts, indicating a role in late-stage B-cell development (Ghamlouch2021Insights).

## Clinical Significance
PHF19 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In multiple myeloma (MM), PHF19 is overexpressed, particularly in high-risk subtypes, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of relapse. Its overexpression is linked to aggressive disease behavior, including increased cell proliferation and drug resistance, and is correlated with high-risk genetic factors such as IGH translocation groups and TP53 mutations (Walker2023Identifying; Ghamlouch2021Insights). PHF19's interaction with the PI3K/AKT pathway and its effect on EZH2 phosphorylation contribute to MM cell survival and therapeutic resistance (Ghamlouch2021Insights).

In glioblastoma, PHF19 is associated with tumor progression, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through a β-catenin-dependent mechanism. High PHF19 expression correlates with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients (Deng2018PHF19). In hepatocellular carcinoma, PHF19 promotes tumor growth and is regulated by miR-195-5p, a tumor suppressor microRNA. Alterations in PHF19 expression contribute to aggressive tumor behavior, including increased migration and invasion (XU2015MicroRNA1955p). These findings highlight PHF19 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
PHF19, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing through its interactions with histone modifications and other proteins. PHF19 contains Tudor domains that selectively bind to histone marks such as H3K36me3 and H3tK27me3. These interactions are crucial for the recruitment and regulatory mechanisms of PRC2, which includes core components like EZH2, SUZ12, and EED (Qin2013Tudor; Dong2020Structural).

The Tudor domain of PHF19 preferentially recognizes the testis-specific histone mark H3tK27me3 over the canonical H3K27me3, which is important for the recruitment and activity of PRC2 in processes like embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency (Dong2020Structural). PHF19's interaction with H3tK27me3 involves a conserved aromatic cage, a salt-bridge, and a hydrophobic surface, allowing it to engage the same binding surface as H3K36me3 but in opposite orientations (Dong2020Structural).

PHF19 does not co-localize with H3K36me3 in cells but is associated with H3K27me3, suggesting a complex regulatory role in chromatin dynamics (Dong2020Structural). These interactions highlight PHF19's role in targeting PRC2 to specific histone marks, which is essential for chromatin modification and gene regulation (Qin2013Tudor).
