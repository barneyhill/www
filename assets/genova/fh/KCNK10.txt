# KCNK10

## Overview
KCNK10 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 10, commonly referred to as TREK-2. This protein is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is characterized by its role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. TREK-2 is a transmembrane protein that forms functional channels through dimerization, exhibiting a pseudo-tetrameric structure. It is sensitive to various physiological stimuli, including mechanical stretch, pH changes, and fatty acids, which influence its gating mechanisms. The TREK-2 channel is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it contributes to processes such as mechano- and thermoperception, metabolic regulation, and apoptosis. Additionally, it plays a role in adipocyte differentiation and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its altered expression levels (Lesage2000Human; Beltrán20132Aminoethoxydiphenyl; Dong2015K2P; Nishizuka2014KCNK10).

## Structure
The KCNK10 gene encodes the TREK-2 protein, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The TREK-2 protein is composed of 538 amino acids and features a structure typical of K2P subunits, including four membrane-spanning segments (M1 to M4) and two pore domains (P1 and P2) (Lesage2000Human). The protein also has an extended loop between the M1 and P1 segments. The genomic organization of TREK-2 includes six introns and seven exons, with specific exons encoding different parts of the protein: exon 1 for the amino terminus, exon 2 for the M1 domain, exon 4 for M2, exon 5 for M3, and exon 6 for M4. The third exon encodes part of the M1P1 interdomain, and the seventh exon encodes the large carboxyl terminus (Lesage2000Human).

TREK-2 channels form dimers to create functional channels, exhibiting a pseudo-tetrameric architecture around the selectivity filter (Dong2015K2P). The channel's activation involves conversion between different conformational states via movement of the pore-lining helices (Dong2015K2P). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence the activity of TREK-2 (Lesage2000Human). The protein is sensitive to various stimuli, including mechanical stretch, fatty acids, and pH changes, which affect its gating mechanisms (Dong2015K2P).

## Function
The KCNK10 gene encodes the TREK-2 channel, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in excitable cells. These channels are responsible for 'leak' potassium conductance, which is essential for stabilizing the negative resting membrane potential and counterbalancing depolarization (Beltrán20132Aminoethoxydiphenyl; Nishizuka2014KCNK10). 

TREK-2 channels are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where they contribute to processes such as mechano- and thermoperception, metabolic regulation, and apoptosis (Beltrán20132Aminoethoxydiphenyl). They are mechanically gated and can be activated by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), which significantly increases their activity, particularly in the KCNK10 channel, suggesting a role in modulating physiological processes (Beltrán20132Aminoethoxydiphenyl).

In addition to their role in the nervous system, KCNK10 channels are involved in adipocyte differentiation. They regulate mitotic clonal expansion during the early stages of adipogenesis by influencing the expression of key transcription factors and the insulin signaling pathway (Sato2010RNA; Nishizuka2014KCNK10). This highlights their broader role in cellular proliferation and differentiation processes.

## Clinical Significance
KCNK10, also known as TREK-2, is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, KCNK10 is significantly underexpressed in colorectal and kidney cancers, ranking among the top 1% of underexpressed genes in these types, and is also notably decreased in glioblastoma (Williams2013Altered). Conversely, KCNK10 is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia, although the limited number of studies prevents a comprehensive meta-analysis (Williams2013Altered). In breast cancer, KCNK10 is upregulated, and its expression is part of a prognostic signature that can predict breast cancer outcomes (Zou2022Integrative).

In neurological contexts, KCNK10 expression is regulated by miRNA-187-3p, with downregulation of this miRNA leading to increased KCNK10 expression in a rat model of epilepsy. This upregulation may have protective effects by influencing astrocytic potassium and glutamate homeostasis (Haenisch2016miRNA1873pMediated). Additionally, KCNK10, along with other KCNK channels, plays a role in neuronal migration during cortical development. Knockdown of KCNK10 impairs the migration of neurons in the developing mouse cerebral cortex, suggesting its importance in proper neuronal positioning (Bando2012Dysfunction). These findings highlight the diverse roles of KCNK10 in both cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
KCNK10, also known as TREK-2, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate its activity. TREK-2 is regulated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including Gs, Gi, and Gq. Activation of the Gq-coupled mGluR1 receptor by glutamate inhibits TREK-2 activity, although this inhibition is not mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) or calcium ions (Ca2+) (Lesage2000Human). TREK-2 activity is also modulated by co-expression with G-protein subunits; for instance, co-expression with Gαs-coupled receptor 5HT4 decreases channel activity upon activation by 5-hydroxytryptamine, while co-expression with Gαi-coupled mGluR2 increases activity upon glutamate stimulation (Kamuene2021The).

TREK-2 interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which affects its basal activity and sensitivity to ATP. Specific amino acids in the proximal C-terminal region, such as Lys 330, play a critical role in these interactions, influencing the channel's response to pH and ATP (Woo2017Identification). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of TREK-2, involving both direct protein interactions and modulation by signaling molecules.
