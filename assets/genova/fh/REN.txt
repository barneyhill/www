# REN

## Overview
The REN gene encodes the enzyme renin, a critical aspartic protease involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system. Renin is responsible for the specific cleavage of angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted into the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Structurally, renin is characterized by a monomeric form with a bilobed tertiary structure and a catalytic dyad essential for its enzymatic function (Yan2019Structural). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with specific receptors, such as the renin/prorenin receptor, which enhance its catalytic efficiency and participate in intracellular signaling pathways (Nguyen2004Reninproreninreceptor; Nguyen2002Pivotal). Mutations in the REN gene are linked to various renal and systemic disorders, including autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) and early-onset hyperuricemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Živná2020An; Beck2011Autosomal).

## Structure
Renin, encoded by the REN gene, is an aspartic protease enzyme involved in the regulation of blood pressure. Its primary structure consists of a single polypeptide chain. The secondary structure of renin includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of renin forms a bilobed shape with a deep active site cleft, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Yan2019Structural). This active site is formed by two domains, each containing an aspartic acid residue (Asp38 and Asp226), which together create a catalytic dyad essential for hydrolyzing peptide bonds (Yan2019Structural).

Renin's quaternary structure is typically monomeric, meaning it functions as a single unit without forming complexes with other protein molecules. The enzyme contains a prosegment that is cleaved to activate the enzyme, a common feature in proteases to regulate their activity. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in renin and can influence its activity and stability (Yan2019Structural). These structural features are critical for renin's role in the renin-angiotensin system, where it specifically cleaves angiotensinogen to release angiotensin I, a precursor to the active hormone angiotensin II (Yan2019Structural).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the REN gene, which encodes the enzyme renin, are associated with several renal and systemic conditions. Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a notable condition linked to REN mutations, specifically ADTKD-REN. This disease is characterized by progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), bland urinary sediment, and can lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) between the ages of 30 and 80. Mutations in different regions of the REN gene, such as the signal peptide, prosegment, and mature renin peptide, result in distinct clinical subtypes of ADTKD-REN, each with varying severity and progression rates (Živná2020An).

Heterozygous mutations in the REN gene can also cause early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and CKD. A specific mutation, c.28T>C (p.W10R), has been identified in a family with these symptoms, demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance across four generations (Beck2011Autosomal). Other mutations, such as p.R33W, have been associated with low-renin hypertension and CKD in certain populations (Živná2020An).

The REN gene mutations can lead to intracellular accumulation of abnormal protein, apoptosis of renin-producing cells, and nephron loss, contributing to the clinical manifestations of these diseases (Clissold2017Discovery).

## Interactions
Renin (REN) interacts with angiotensinogen (AGT) to form a complex that is crucial for the production of angiotensin I. The crystal structure of the AGT-renin complex reveals that the N-terminal tail of AGT docks into the substrate-binding pocket of renin, involving both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This interaction is species-specific, with human renin unable to efficiently process AGT from mice and rats due to differences in key interacting residues (Yan2019Structural).

Renin also interacts with specific receptors, including the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor and a renin/prorenin receptor. The M6P receptor binds renin and prorenin with high affinity, leading to their internalization and degradation without generating angiotensin (Danser2005Renin). The renin/prorenin receptor, identified as N14F, enhances the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and activates MAP kinases ERK1/2. This receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and kidney, and is involved in intracellular signaling pathways (Nguyen2004Reninproreninreceptor; Nguyen2002Pivotal). Binding of renin to this receptor increases catalytic efficiency and triggers phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues, indicating a role in cellular signaling (Nguyen2002Pivotal).
