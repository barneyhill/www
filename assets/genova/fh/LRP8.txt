# LRP8

## Overview
LRP8, also known as the LDL receptor-related protein 8 or ApoER2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein belonging to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. This protein plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and cellular signaling. LRP8 is particularly significant in the Reelin signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuronal migration and synaptic function, thereby influencing cognitive processes such as learning and memory. The protein's structure is characterized by multiple domains, including LDLR Class A repeats and epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, which facilitate its interaction with ligands like Apolipoprotein E and Reelin. LRP8 is also involved in pathological conditions, with its dysregulation linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders (Lagrange2020Angiotensin; Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated; Passarella2022LowDensity).

## Structure
LRP8, also known as ApoER2, is a single-pass transmembrane protein and a member of the LDL receptor family. Its molecular structure includes an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) composed of multiple modules: seven LDLR Class A (LA) repeat domains, three epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats with an embedded β-propeller domain, and an O-linked glycosylation domain (Argiriadi2023The). The protein also features a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail, which includes a 59 amino acid insert (Riddell1999Identification).

LRP8 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in at least nine splice variants at the mRNA level. These variants can lack certain binding repeats, such as LRP8Δ4-6, which lacks repeats 4-6 but retains the cytoplasmic insert (Argiriadi2023The; Riddell1999Identification). The protein's structure is further characterized by the presence of cysteine-rich repeats and EGF-like domains, which are common features in the LDL receptor family (Argiriadi2023The).

Post-translational modifications of LRP8 include glycosylation, which is typical for proteins in this family and influences their function in cellular signaling and lipid metabolism (Argiriadi2023The). The structural design of LRP8 allows it to act as a receptor for several ligands, including Apolipoprotein E and Reelin, with specific binding epitopes identified for these interactions (Argiriadi2023The).

## Function
LRP8, also known as LDL receptor-related protein 8 or ApoER2, is a crucial component of the Reelin signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In healthy human cells, LRP8 is involved in synapse-to-nucleus communication, a process essential for the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with learning and memory. This is achieved through the proteolytic processing of LRP8 by gamma-secretase, which releases an intracellular domain (ICD) that translocates to the nucleus. The LRP8-ICD acts as an intermediary, influencing transcriptional regulation by interacting with specific neuronal enhancers and transcription factors such as CREB and MEF2 (Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated).

LRP8 is also implicated in long-range chromatin interactions that facilitate gene expression regulation, which is critical for neuroplasticity and cognitive functions (Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated). The Reelin-LRP8 pathway is particularly important in hippocampal-dependent associative learning, where it supports epigenomic events necessary for memory formation (Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated). Additionally, LRP8 interacts with NMDA receptors, contributing to excitatory glutamatergic transmission, which is vital for synaptic activity and cognitive processes (Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRP8 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, LRP8 acts as a positive regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is associated with tumor proliferation. Overexpression of LRP8 has been observed in various cancers, including breast, gastric, prostate, lung, and melanoma, where it promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In triple-negative breast cancer, LRP8 depletion inhibits cancer stem cells and cell proliferation, while in non-small cell lung cancer, increased LRP8 expression facilitates tumor growth (Passarella2022LowDensity).

In the context of neurodegeneration, LRP8 is involved in Alzheimer's disease through its interaction with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), influencing amyloid-beta production. LRP8's role in neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity is mediated by its interaction with Reelin, and its dysfunction is linked to cognitive impairments and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Xiao2020Further; Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated; Passarella2022LowDensity).

LRP8 is also associated with cardiovascular diseases, including premature coronary disease and myocardial infarction. Its deficiency in mice leads to aortic dissection, suggesting a protective role against vascular diseases (Lagrange2020Angiotensin).

## Interactions
LRP8, also known as ApoER2, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in both cancer and neurodegenerative processes. In the context of cancer, LRP8 interacts with STAT3, leading to the activation of STAT3 and subsequent induction of PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma cells. This interaction is crucial for immune evasion in cancer cells (Zheng2020LRP8). LRP8 also interacts with Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), influencing cholesterol metabolism and cancer cell behavior (Passarella2022LowDensity).

In neurodegenerative contexts, LRP8 interacts with Reelin, a ligand that regulates synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of Dab1 and activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, which are important for neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity (Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated). LRP8 also forms complexes with NMDA receptors at excitatory synapses, influencing synaptic signaling and memory formation (Telese2015LRP8-Reelin-Regulated). Additionally, LRP8 interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP), affecting amyloid-beta production, which is relevant in Alzheimer's disease (Passarella2022LowDensity). These interactions highlight LRP8's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and disease mechanisms.
