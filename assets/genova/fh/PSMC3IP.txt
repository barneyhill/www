# PSMC3IP

## Overview
PSMC3IP is a gene that encodes the PSMC3 interacting protein, a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. The protein functions as a coactivator for hormone-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear receptors such as estrogen, thyroid hormone, androgen, and progesterone receptors. It is particularly significant in estrogen-driven pathways, which are vital for normal ovarian function and development. PSMC3IP is also crucial in homologous recombination and DNA repair, interacting with proteins like DMC1 and RAD51 to maintain genomic stability during meiosis. The protein is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues such as the testis and ovary, as well as in the spleen and thymus, and contains structural domains that facilitate its interactions with nuclear receptors and other proteins. Mutations in the PSMC3IP gene have been linked to reproductive disorders, including primary ovarian insufficiency and non-obstructive azoospermia, underscoring its essential role in reproductive health (Zangen2011XX; Zelceski2022MND1; AlAgha2017Primary).

## Structure


## Function
PSMC3IP, also known as TBPIP or HOP2, is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in coactivating hormone-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, thyroid hormone receptor β1, androgen receptor, and progesterone receptor. It is particularly important in the transcriptional activity of estrogen-driven pathways, which are essential for normal ovarian function and development (Zangen2011XX).

The protein is highly expressed in the testis and ovary, as well as in the spleen and thymus, and contains leucine zipper and coiled-coil domains that facilitate its interaction with nuclear receptors. The C-terminal region of PSMC3IP, which includes an acidic domain, is essential for its function in coactivating ligand-dependent transcription (Zangen2011XX).

PSMC3IP is also involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair processes, interacting with proteins such as DMC1 and RAD51. It plays a role in the repair of double-strand breaks during meiosis, which is critical for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, PSMC3IP is active in the nucleus, where it supports the transcriptional response to hormones and facilitates DNA repair (Zelceski2022MND1; AlAgha2017Primary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSMC3IP gene are associated with several reproductive disorders. A homozygous stop gain mutation in PSMC3IP has been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in a consanguineous Yemeni family. This mutation results in a truncated protein that cannot interact with DMC1 and RAD51, essential for homologous recombination during meiosis, leading to infertility in both males and females (Cioppi2021Genetics; AlAgha2017Primary). In females, this mutation causes primary amenorrhea and POI, while in males, it results in azoospermia due to a block at the primary spermatocyte stage (AlAgha2017Primary).

Another mutation, p.Glu201del, affects the PSMC3IP gene's role as an estrogen receptor coactivator, leading to XX hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis. This mutation disrupts estrogen-driven transcription, crucial for ovarian development, resulting in reduced ovarian size and lack of follicles in females (Zangen2011XX).

PSMC3IP mutations are also implicated in disorders of sex development (DSD) and ovarian dysgenesis, highlighting the gene's critical role in reproductive health (Jiao2020Molecular). These findings underscore the gene's importance in maintaining fertility and normal sexual development.

## Interactions
PSMC3IP, also known as TBPIP, is a nuclear protein that interacts with various hormone receptors, including estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, the thyroid hormone receptor β1, the androgen receptor, and the progesterone receptor. It acts as a coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by these nuclear receptors (Zangen2011XX). PSMC3IP also interacts with key apoptotic proteins, such as caspase 8, which is central to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and BCAR3, influencing proliferation and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast).

In the context of DNA repair, PSMC3IP forms a heterodimer with MND1, which is crucial for RAD51-mediated D-loop formation, a key step in homologous recombination. This interaction is essential for the DNA damage response in mitotic cells (Zelceski2022MND1). The MND1-PSMC3IP complex stabilizes the presynaptic filament and facilitates DNA strand exchange during meiotic recombination (Zelceski2022MND1).

PSMC3IP is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis in breast cancer cells, where its overexpression leads to decreased caspase-8 activity, while its silencing increases caspase-8 activity, suggesting its role in modulating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast).
