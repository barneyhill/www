# TMCC1

## Overview
TMCC1, or transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The TMCC1 protein is characterized by its structural motifs, including coiled-coil (CC) and transmembrane (TM) domains, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular processes. As a transmembrane protein, TMCC1 is integral to maintaining ER homeostasis, participating in the ER stress response, and regulating autophagy, which are critical for cellular survival and function. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Jo2023Circular; Hoyer2018A).

## Structure
TMCC1 is an ER membrane protein characterized by the presence of coiled-coil (CC) domains and transmembrane (TM) domains. The protein contains three conserved CC domains and two TM domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Hoyer2018A). The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of TMCC1 includes predicted CC domains, with a short CC domain (amino acids 215-320) resembling the Cdc42 binding domain of cip4, suggesting a role in recruiting ER tubules to sites of actin nucleation. The longer CC domain is similar to a rigid CC found in fibrinogen, potentially functioning as a spacer to prevent membrane fusion or to establish a signaling platform (Hoyer2018A).

TMCC1 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers with other TMCC family members, indicating a quaternary structure involving protein complexes (Hoyer2018A). The protein is involved in stabilizing ER membrane contact sites with endosome buds, which are labeled with the actin regulatory complex WASH (Hoyer2018A). TMCC1's structure allows it to localize to dynamic domains on ER tubules, concentrating in discrete patches along peripheral ER tubules (Hoyer2018A).

## Function
TMCC1 (transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 1) is a protein primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining ER homeostasis. It is involved in the ER stress response and autophagy, processes essential for cellular survival and function. TMCC1 contributes to the regulation of protein folding and degradation, which are vital for the proper functioning of the ER and the overall health of the cell (Jo2023Circular).

In healthy human cells, TMCC1 is implicated in the recruitment of the ER, influencing cellular processes such as protein synthesis and quality control. This protein's activity in the ER membrane is essential for managing cellular stress and ensuring the correct folding of proteins, which prevents the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can lead to cellular dysfunction (Jo2023Circular).

TMCC1's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. By participating in the ER stress response and autophagy, TMCC1 helps protect cells from stress-induced damage, thereby supporting organismal health and resilience against various stressors (Jo2023Circular).

## Clinical Significance
TMCC1 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMCC1 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cell migration through the Wnt signaling pathway, contributing to the aggressive behavior of HCC. Knockdown of TMCC1 in liver cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell migration and decrease the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Song2023Construction).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMCC1 is involved in glutamate metabolism in the brain. The circular RNA derived from TMCC1, circTmcc1, plays a role in astrocytic glutamate metabolism and spatial memory. Its inhibition affects the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle, synaptic plasticity, and memory function, potentially linking it to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Jo2023Circular).

A missense variant in TMCC1 (p.Ser41Ala) has been identified in families with a predisposition to non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC), although the specific role of this variant in disease development remains unclear (Wang2019Identification).
