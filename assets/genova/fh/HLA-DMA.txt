# HLA-DMA

## Overview
HLA-DMA is a gene that encodes the DM alpha chain, a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are integral to the immune system's antigen presentation pathway. The protein product of HLA-DMA, in conjunction with the DM beta chain encoded by HLA-DMB, forms the HLA-DM heterodimer. This heterodimer functions as a non-classical MHC class II molecule, acting as both an enzyme and a chaperone to facilitate the exchange of peptides in the antigen presentation process. Specifically, HLA-DM catalyzes the removal of the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) from the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules, allowing for the binding of antigenic peptides. This process is crucial for the presentation of exogenous antigens to CD4+ T cells, thereby playing a vital role in adaptive immunity (Denzin1994Assembly; Álvaro‐Benito2020Revisiting). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by various transactivators and can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which have been associated with autoimmune diseases and other immune-related conditions (Kern1995The; ÁlvaroBenito2015HLADMA).

## Structure
The HLA-DMA gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, playing a crucial role in the immune system's antigen presentation process. The HLA-DMA protein is encoded by five exons, with only the first two bases of exon 5 being translated. It features a short open reading frame downstream of the start codon, which translates into a leader sequence with a hydrophobic core (Radley1994Genomic).

The primary structure of the HLA-DMA protein includes a sequence of amino acids that form the alpha chain of the heterodimer with HLA-DMB. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of MHC class II molecules, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these chains into a three-dimensional shape, and the quaternary structure refers to the assembly of the heterodimer with HLA-DMB (Radley1994Genomic).

The HLA-DMA protein has a deletion of one codon, suggested to be a threonine, in the membrane-proximal domain. This deletion occurs in a loop between beta-sheets 3 and 4, as indicated by immunoglobulin folding superimposition (Radley1994Genomic). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function.

## Function
HLA-DMA is a gene that encodes the DM alpha chain, which forms a heterodimer with the DM beta chain encoded by HLA-DMB. This heterodimer, known as HLA-DM, plays a crucial role in the antigen processing and presentation pathway of the immune system. In healthy human cells, HLA-DM is involved in the intracellular transport and maturation of MHC class II molecules. It facilitates the removal of the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) from the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules, allowing for the binding of antigenic peptides. This process occurs in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, specifically in MHC class II compartments (MIICs), which are characterized by a low pH environment (Denzin1994Assembly).

HLA-DM is not expressed on the cell surface but functions intracellularly to ensure that MHC class II molecules acquire the correct peptides for presentation to CD4+ T cells. This activity is essential for the proper immune response, as it enables the presentation of exogenously derived antigenic peptides to T cells, thereby facilitating adaptive immunity (Denzin1994Assembly). The expression of HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB is regulated by transactivators such as CIITA and RFX5, which are crucial for both constitutive and inducible expression of these genes (Kern1995The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the HLA-DMA gene have been implicated in various autoimmune diseases. The DMA*0103 allele, characterized by G155A and R184H substitutions, exhibits impaired peptide exchange functionality, particularly under acidic conditions. This impairment may contribute to differences in autoimmune susceptibilities among individuals carrying this allele (ÁlvaroBenito2015HLADMA). The DMA*0103 variant also shows decreased activity for peptide release, leading to increased half-life times of peptide-MHCII complexes, which are relevant in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes (ÁlvaroBenito2015HLADMA).

In the context of psoriasis, the HLA-DMA gene has been associated with the disease in a Korean population. The DMA n 0102 allele was significantly increased in psoriasis patients, particularly in those with early-onset psoriasis (type I), suggesting a potential role in disease susceptibility (Pyo2003Association). These findings indicate that specific HLA-DMA alleles may serve as genetic markers for psoriasis, independent of other known genetic factors (Pyo2003Association).

Overall, alterations in HLA-DMA expression or mutations can impact immune responses, potentially contributing to autoimmune diseases or affecting susceptibility to conditions like psoriasis.

## Interactions
HLA-DMA is involved in several critical interactions within the immune system, primarily through its role as a peptide exchange catalyst in the context of MHC class II molecules. It forms a heterodimer with HLA-DMB, facilitating the loading of antigenic peptides onto MHC class II molecules, which is essential for antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells (ÁlvaroBenito2015HLADMA). HLA-DMA interacts transiently with MHC class II molecules, particularly HLA-DR, to catalyze the exchange of peptides. This interaction is crucial for maintaining MHCII molecules in a peptide-receptive state, classifying HLA-DM as both an enzyme and a chaperone (Álvaro‐Benito2020Revisiting).

The interaction between HLA-DM and MHCII is influenced by specific polymorphisms in the HLA-DMA gene, such as the G155A and R184H mutations, which affect the stability and catalytic efficiency of the HLA-DM heterodimer (ÁlvaroBenito2015HLADMA). HLA-DM's activity is modulated by HLA-DO, another nonclassical MHCII molecule, which acts as a competitive inhibitor by binding tightly to HLA-DM and blocking its activity in removing CLIP from MHCII molecules (Álvaro‐Benito2020Revisiting). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the immune response and are influenced by the structural dynamics of the involved proteins (AlvaroBenito2016Human).
