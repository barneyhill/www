# RNFT2

## Overview
RNFT2 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein, transmembrane 2, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it plays a pivotal role in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes. Specifically, the RNFT2-encoded protein targets the interleukin-3 receptor alpha (IL-3Rα) for ubiquitination, influencing IL-3 signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tong2020The). As a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, it interacts with several ubiquitin E2 enzymes, facilitating the degradation of IL-3Rα and modulating immune responses (Tong2020The). The protein's activity is crucial in inflammatory signaling pathways and is implicated in various clinical conditions, including bladder cancer and inflammatory lung diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Lv2022N6methyladenosinerelated; Tong2020The).

## Function
The RNFT2 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging proteins for degradation. This protein specifically targets the IL-3 receptor alpha (IL-3Rα) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which is essential for regulating IL-3 signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tong2020The). RNFT2 acts as a negative regulator of IL-3 signaling by controlling the stability of IL-3Rα, thereby modulating IL-3-dependent cellular responses (Tong2020The).

In healthy human cells, RNFT2 is involved in modulating inflammatory signaling pathways. It influences the abundance of signaling molecules such as TRAF6 in response to IL-3 stimulation, impacting cytokine secretion and immune responses (Tong2020The). The protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a role in protein quality control and cellular stress responses, contributing to organismal health (Tong2020The). By regulating the degradation of IL-3Rα, RNFT2 helps maintain the balance of immune responses, which is crucial for preventing excessive inflammation and ensuring proper immune function (Tong2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the RNFT2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly bladder cancer and inflammatory lung conditions. In bladder cancer, RNFT2 is identified as an oncogene, with its expression significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in patients. A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3088107, located in the 3'-UTR region of the RNFT2 gene, affects its expression and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. The C allele of this SNP is linked to higher RNFT2 expression and worse patient survival, suggesting its role in promoting bladder cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration (Lv2022N6methyladenosinerelated).

In the context of lung inflammation and injury, RNFT2 functions as an E3 ligase that regulates the stability of the IL-3 receptor alpha (IL-3Rα) subunit through ubiquitination. This regulation is crucial in modulating inflammatory responses. Overexpression of RNFT2 has been shown to reduce lung inflammation and injury, while its knockdown exacerbates these conditions. The RNFT2/IL-3Rα axis is particularly relevant in conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), where alterations in RNFT2 expression may influence the severity of lung inflammation (Tong2020The).

## Interactions
RNFT2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of the IL-3 receptor alpha (IL-3Rα) protein. It interacts with several ubiquitin E2 enzymes, including the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1-3 protein, confirming its role as an E3 ligase. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination of IL-3Rα, targeting it for proteasomal degradation (Tong2020The). RNFT2 specifically binds to IL-3Rα, as demonstrated by its inability to degrade a mutant IL-3Rα (K357R) that is resistant to degradation, indicating a specific interaction between RNFT2 and IL-3Rα (Tong2020The).

RNFT2 also interacts with the E2 enzyme UBE2D, which is involved in regulating the ubiquitination and stability of IL-3Rα protein. This interaction plays a role in suppressing cytokine release induced by IL-3 and LPS cotreatment, suggesting RNFT2's function as an inflammatory suppressor (Tong2020The). The RNFT2/IL-3Rα axis is crucial in regulating IL-3 signaling and innate immunity, particularly in the context of lung inflammation and injury (Tong2020The).
