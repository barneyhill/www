# CENPS

## Overview
CENPS, or centromere protein S, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein product, centromere protein S, is a component of the CENP-T-W-S-X complex, which is essential for centromere function and kinetochore formation. This complex is structurally homologous to histone tetramers, indicating a histone-like fold that contributes to its role in chromatin assembly (Takeuchi2013The). CENP-S, in conjunction with CENP-X, forms a heterodimer that is crucial for the stability and function of the kinetochore, as well as for DNA damage repair processes, particularly in association with the FANCM complex (Dornblut2014A). The CENP-S/X complex is involved in the dynamic assembly of centromeric chromatin during the cell cycle, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Dornblut2014A).

## Structure
CENP-S, a component of the CENP-S/X complex, is involved in centromere function and kinetochore assembly. The protein forms a heterodimer with CENP-X, contributing to the quaternary structure of the CENP-T-W-S-X complex, which is essential for centromere function and kinetochore formation (Dornblut2014A; Takeuchi2013The). This complex is structurally homologous to the histone tetramer within the nucleosome, indicating a histone-like fold in its tertiary structure (Takeuchi2013The).

CENP-S is part of a nucleoprotein particle that includes CENP-T and CENP-W, forming a tetrameric complex that assembles at the centromere during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Dornblut2014A). The CENP-S/X complex is involved in DNA damage repair, associating with the FANCM complex, and shows distinct binding mechanisms at centromeres and DNA damage sites (Dornblut2014A).

The CENP-T-W-S-X complex binds preferentially to 100 bp of linker DNA, suggesting specific DNA-binding properties, although CENP-S and CENP-X are not directly responsible for the DNA-binding activity (Takeuchi2013The). The complex induces positive supercoils into DNA, a feature distinct from canonical histones, which typically induce negative supercoils (Takeuchi2013The).

## Function
CENP-S, a component of the CENP-S/X complex, plays a crucial role in kinetochore assembly and DNA damage repair in human cells. This protein is active at the centromere during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, where it contributes to the assembly of centromeric chromatin, essential for proper kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Dornblut2014A). CENP-S is involved in DNA damage repair, particularly in association with the FANCM complex, and is recruited to sites of DNA damage following UV-induced damage. This recruitment suggests distinct mechanisms of action at DNA damage sites compared to its role at centromeres (Dornblut2014A).

The CENP-S/X complex, which includes CENP-T and CENP-W, forms a unique histone fold particle that participates in kinetochore assembly and DNA repair. This complex assembles through a dynamic exchange mechanism during the cell cycle, with CENP-S showing stable binding at the kinetochore and a slower exchange rate compared to CENP-X (Dornblut2014A). CENP-S is closely associated with histone H3 nucleosomes, indicating its role in a specific nucleoprotein particle involved in chromatin assembly at the kinetochore (Dornblut2014A).

## Interactions
CENPS, or centromere protein S, is a component of the CENP-T/W/S/X complex, which plays a crucial role in kinetochore assembly and function. CENPS forms a stable complex with CENPX, and together they co-purify and form tetrameric structures with CENPT and CENPW, indicating stable complex formation (Dornblut2014A). This complex is involved in stabilizing kinetochore structure and interacts preferentially with histone H3 nucleosomes, but not with CENPA (Dornblut2014A).

CENPS shows strong interactions with CENPT and weaker interactions with CENPR, as confirmed by two-hybrid assays and FRET methods (Dornblut2014A). FRET analysis also confirmed the interaction of CENPS with the C-terminal domain of CENPT at centromeres (Dornblut2014A). The CENP-T/W/S/X complex, including CENPS, is suggested to be positioned near the DNA exit of the H3 nucleosome or between two H3 nucleosomes, facilitating kinetochore assembly (Dornblut2014A).

In the nucleoplasm, CENPS and CENPX form a hetero-dimer but do not participate in the same interactions as other CCAN proteins like CENPC, CENPN, and CENPT/W (Hoischen2018CENPCHIKMTWNL). This indicates that CENPS/X is not part of the same soluble complex as other CCAN proteins in the nucleoplasm (Hoischen2018CENPCHIKMTWNL).
