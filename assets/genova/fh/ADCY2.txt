# ADCY2

## Overview
ADCY2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenylate cyclase 2, a membrane-bound protein involved in the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a pivotal second messenger in cellular signaling pathways. As a member of the adenylyl cyclase family, adenylate cyclase 2 is characterized by its transmembrane structure, which includes two transmembrane regions and two cytoplasmic domains that form the catalytic site essential for its enzymatic activity (Ludwig2002CHARACTERIZATION; Dessauer2017International). This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, where it plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation by mediating intracellular signaling cascades (Ludwig2002CHARACTERIZATION; Devasani2022Expression). Unlike some other adenylyl cyclases, adenylate cyclase 2 is not regulated by calcium/calmodulin, which highlights its unique regulatory mechanisms (Sen2024A). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neuropsychiatric disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Yang2022Identification; Aghabozorg2020Investigation).

## Structure
The ADCY2 protein is a membrane-bound enzyme characterized by a common structure shared with other adenylyl cyclase isoforms. It consists of a cytoplasmic NH2-terminus, two transmembrane regions (M1 and M2), and two cytoplasmic regions (C1 and C2). The C1 and C2 domains are further divided into catalytic (C1a, C2a) and regulatory (C1b, C2b) subdomains, with C1a and C2a forming the catalytic site essential for its enzymatic function (Ludwig2002CHARACTERIZATION; Dessauer2017International). These domains are structurally homologous across different AC isoforms and share similarities with other nucleotidyl cyclases (Dessauer2017International).

The ADCY2 gene is composed of 25 exons spread over approximately 429.7 kb of DNA, and its expression is highest in the brain, skeletal muscle, and testis (Ludwig2002CHARACTERIZATION). ADCY2 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific splice variants for ADCY2 are not detailed in the available context (Ludwig2002CHARACTERIZATION). The protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in converting ATP to cyclic AMP, a central intracellular signaling mediator.

## Function
ADCY2 encodes the enzyme adenylyl cyclase 2, which plays a critical role in converting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and pyrophosphate. This conversion is essential for intracellular signaling, as cAMP acts as a central mediator in various biological processes (Sen2024A). ADCY2 is part of a family of enzymes activated by G proteins, specifically Gαs and Gβγ, and is involved in integrating signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Devasani2022Expression). Unlike some other adenylyl cyclases, ADCY2 is insensitive to calcium/calmodulin, which distinguishes its regulatory mechanisms (Sen2024A).

In healthy human cells, ADCY2 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, particularly in the brain, where it is expressed in regions such as the hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. It is found in astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Devasani2022Expression). The enzyme's activity is crucial for generating cAMP, which influences processes like cell growth, differentiation, and neurotransmission, contributing to the regulation of synaptic balance and behavior (Sen2024A; Devasani2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADCY2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In bladder cancer, ADCY2 is identified as a hub gene in the hypomethylation-upregulated genes module, with high mRNA expression associated with worse prognosis, particularly in female patients. The gene's expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression correlates with specific immune cell clusters, suggesting a role in the tumor immune microenvironment (Yang2022Identification).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, ADCY2 is linked to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The rs2290910 polymorphism in ADCY2 is associated with increased risk of bipolar disorder and suicide tendencies, with the T allele linked to suicide attempts and the C allele to suicide ideation. This polymorphism also affects response to lithium carbonate therapy, a common treatment for bipolar disorder (Aghabozorg2020Investigation). Additionally, the rs58502974 polymorphism in ADCY2 is associated with schizophrenia, with the AA genotype increasing susceptibility to the disorder (Abolghasemi2020MMP9).

ADCY2 is also implicated in congenital heart disease, where mutations in the gene contribute to calcium-signaling defects, leading to cardiac malformations (Izarzugaza2020Systems).
