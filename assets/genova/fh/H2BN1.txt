# H2BN1

## Overview
H2BN1 is a gene that encodes the H2B.N variant histone 1 protein, which is a member of the histone family. Histones are essential nuclear proteins that play a critical role in the organization and regulation of chromatin structure, thereby influencing gene expression and DNA replication processes. The H2B.N variant is distinguished from canonical histones by its unique sequence and functional properties, which may contribute to specialized chromatin dynamics and regulatory mechanisms. As a variant histone, H2B.N is involved in the modulation of chromatin accessibility and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Understanding the specific roles and interactions of H2B.N is crucial for elucidating its contributions to cellular function and its potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
