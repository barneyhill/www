# RFC3

## Overview
Replication factor C subunit 3 (RFC3) is a gene that encodes a protein component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. The RFC3 protein is part of a heteropentameric complex that includes RFC1, RFC2, RFC4, and RFC5, and is categorized as an AAA+ ATPase due to its ATP-binding and hydrolysis capabilities (Johnson2006The; Yao2012The). This complex functions as a clamp loader, facilitating the loading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a critical step for ensuring the processivity of DNA polymerases during replication (Chen2018Subunit). RFC3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA polymerase switching, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint control. Its structural integrity, particularly the C-terminal regions, is crucial for the formation and function of the RFC complex (Chen2018Subunit). Alterations in RFC3 expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression and prognosis (Shen2014Overexpression; Wu2022Integrative).

## Structure
RFC3 is a subunit of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. The RFC3 protein is part of a heteropentameric complex composed of five subunits: RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, and RFC5. Each subunit, including RFC3, contains domains characteristic of AAA+ ATPases, which are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis (Johnson2006The; Yao2012The). The RFC3 protein has a molecular weight of approximately 38 kDa and consists of 340 amino acids (Cullmann1995Characterization).

Structurally, RFC3 contains two ATPase domains, which are part of the larger AAA+ domain, and a C-terminal domain that contributes to the formation of a collar structure in the RFC complex (Yao2012The). The ATPase domains are arranged in a right-handed spiral, aligning with the pitch of double-stranded DNA, facilitating its interaction with DNA during the clamp loading process (Johnson2006The). The RFC3 subunit, like other RFC subunits, contains conserved polar and positively charged residues that interact with DNA (Johnson2006The).

In the quaternary structure, RFC3 interacts with other RFC subunits to form a circular complex that can accommodate double-stranded DNA, playing a role in loading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA (Schrecker2022Multistep).

## Function
RFC3 (Replication Factor C subunit 3) is a crucial component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which plays an essential role in DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. The RFC complex functions as a clamp loader, facilitating the loading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA. This process is vital for the high-speed synthesis of DNA, as it ensures the processivity of DNA polymerases during replication (Chen2018Subunit). In humans, RFC3, along with other subunits, forms a stable core complex that is involved in unloading PCNA, although it requires additional subunits to load PCNA onto DNA (Chen2018Subunit).

RFC3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA polymerase switching, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint control. These functions are critical for accurate DNA replication and the prevention of genomic instability, which can lead to various cellular dysfunctions and diseases (Chen2018Subunit). The C-terminal regions of RFC3 and other RFC subunits are essential for the formation of the RFC complex and for mediating interactions between subunits, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for its function (Chen2018Subunit).

## Clinical Significance
RFC3 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels, which are often associated with poor prognosis. In sarcoma, RFC3 is highly expressed and linked to poor overall survival, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Wu2022Integrative). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, RFC3 overexpression correlates with advanced tumor stages and decreased patient survival, making it an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes (Shen2014Overexpression). In colorectal cancer, RFC3 promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis by interacting with KIF14, and its depletion leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor progression (Yu2024RFC3). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RFC3 is overexpressed, and its silencing results in reduced cell proliferation and viability, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (YAO2015shRNAmediated). These findings across different cancer types highlight RFC3's role in tumorigenesis and its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression and prognosis. The studies emphasize the clinical significance of RFC3 expression alterations rather than specific gene mutations.

## Interactions
RFC3 (replication factor C subunit 3) is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. It is a component of the RFC complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair. This complex functions as a clamp loader that facilitates the loading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a crucial step for processive DNA synthesis. RFC3 interacts with other RFC subunits (RFC1, RFC2, RFC4, RFC5) to form this hetero-pentameric complex, which is part of the AAA+ ATPase family. The ATPase activity of the RFC complex is vital for its function in DNA replication, with RFC3 playing a central role in initiating RFC activation and stabilizing PCNA in an open conformation (Sakato2012A).

In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), RFC3 has been shown to physically interact with KIF14, a kinesin family member. This interaction is significant for the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of CRC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical binding between RFC3 and KIF14, and the depletion of RFC3 leads to reduced expression of KIF14, indicating a regulatory relationship between these proteins (Yu2024RFC3).
