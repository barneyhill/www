# RFC1

## Overview
The RFC1 gene encodes the replication factor C subunit 1, a crucial component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and repair processes in eukaryotic cells. The RFC1 protein is categorized as a clamp loader, facilitating the loading and unloading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a process essential for the function of replicative DNA polymerases. Structurally, RFC1 is characterized by domains such as the BRCT domain and the AAA+ module, which are integral to its function in DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis, respectively (Zheng2022CryoEM; Bunz1993cDNAs). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodegenerative disorders, including cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), linked to specific mutations and repeat expansions within RFC1 (Cortese2020Cerebellar; Benkirane2022RFC1). These genetic variations highlight the gene's critical role in maintaining genomic stability and its potential impact on human health.

## Structure
The RFC1 protein, a component of the replication factor C complex, is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It includes a large subunit with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa, consisting of 1148 amino acids (Bunz1993cDNAs). The protein contains several domains, including a BRCT domain, an AAA+ module, and a C-terminal region. The BRCT domain is involved in DNA binding and is homologous to DNA ligases, although it lacks ligase activity (Yao2012The). The AAA+ module is crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis, which is essential for the protein's function in DNA replication and repair (Zheng2022CryoEM).

The RFC1 subunit forms part of a pentameric complex with other RFC subunits, contributing to its quaternary structure. This complex is involved in loading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a process facilitated by ATP-dependent conformational changes (Zheng2022CryoEM). The protein's structure includes a series of α-helices and β-sheets, with specific residues forming hydrogen bonds with DNA (Zheng2022CryoEM). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate RFC1's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. RFC1 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Bunz1993cDNAs).

## Function
The RFC1 gene encodes a subunit of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. RFC1 functions as a clamp loader, facilitating the loading and unloading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto and from DNA. This process is ATP-dependent and involves conformational changes in the RFC complex that allow it to bind tightly with PCNA, open the ring, and subsequently close it upon ATP hydrolysis, releasing PCNA to encircle the DNA duplex (Shiomi2017Control).

The RFC1-RFC complex plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity by ensuring the correct orientation and processivity of DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis. It binds to a specific side of PCNA, facilitating its switch to DNA polymerase, which is essential for DNA elongation (Shiomi2017Control). The RFC1 subunit contains a BRCT motif, which may be involved in protein interactions, and is part of a hetero-pentameric structure with other RFC subunits (Shiomi2017Control).

RFC1 is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in various DNA repair processes, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair, highlighting its importance in maintaining genome stability (Shiomi2017Control).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and repeat expansions in the RFC1 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). CANVAS is primarily linked to biallelic AAGGG repeat expansions in the RFC1 gene, which are found in a significant proportion of patients with the full clinical presentation of the syndrome (Cortese2020Cerebellar; Gisatulin2020Clinical). These expansions are also a common cause of late-onset ataxia, with studies indicating their presence in a notable percentage of sporadic late-onset ataxia cases (Cortese2019Biallelic).

The pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 can form G-quadruplexes, secondary DNA structures that may regulate transcription, potentially impacting gene expression and contributing to disease pathology (Dominik2023Normal). Clinical features associated with these expansions include sensory neuropathy, cerebellar dysfunction, and vestibular failure, often progressing from sensory neuron involvement to more extensive neurological impairments (Cortese2020Cerebellar).

In addition to repeat expansions, other mutations such as nonsense and frameshift mutations in RFC1 have been identified in patients with CANVAS, further implicating the gene in the disease's pathophysiology (Benkirane2022RFC1). These genetic alterations underscore the clinical significance of RFC1 in neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
RFC1, a subunit of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair by interacting with both proteins and nucleic acids. It is primarily involved in loading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a process essential for the function of replicative DNA polymerases. RFC1 interacts with other RFC subunits (RFC2-5) to form the RFC complex, which undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding to DNA. This interaction facilitates the opening of a gate between the AAA+ module and the A' domain of RFC1, allowing the loading of PCNA onto DNA gaps (Zheng2022CryoEM).

The RFC complex recognizes both 3′- and 5′-DNA ends, with the RFC1 BRCT domain playing a key role in stabilizing the binding of 5′-DNA, which is otherwise flexible. Specific residues in RFC1 form hydrogen bonds with the DNA's phosphate backbone, highlighting its role in stabilizing DNA interactions (Zheng2022CryoEM). In Arabidopsis, RFC1 is involved in meiotic recombination, acting downstream of RAD51 and facilitating the dissociation of RAD51 and DMC1 foci, which are crucial for crossover formation (Wang2012The). These interactions underscore RFC1's importance in maintaining genomic stability through its role in DNA repair and replication processes.
