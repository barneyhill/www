# ZBTB12

## Overview
ZBTB12 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 12, a transcriptional regulator involved in maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). This protein plays a critical role in preventing dedifferentiation by repressing the expression of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and associated long non-coding RNAs, which are essential for maintaining pluripotency (Han2023ZBTB12). ZBTB12 functions within the nucleus, interacting with the SIN3A/HDAC co-repressor complex to regulate transcriptionally active loci, thereby facilitating the transition from a pluripotent state to lineage-specific differentiation (Han2023ZBTB12). The protein's regulatory functions are evolutionarily conserved, with specific adaptations in primates to control LTR7/HERVH elements (Han2023ZBTB12).

## Function
The ZBTB12 gene encodes a zinc finger protein with a BTB domain, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). It acts as a molecular barrier to dedifferentiation, preventing hPSCs from reverting to a naïve-like pluripotent state, which is essential for their differentiation into the three germ layers (Han2023ZBTB12). ZBTB12 achieves this by repressing the expression of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, particularly LTR7/HERVH, and associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as LINC-ROR, which are involved in maintaining pluripotency (Han2023ZBTB12).

The protein is active in the nucleus of hPSCs, where it interacts with the SIN3A/HDAC co-repressor complex to regulate transcriptionally active loci (Han2023ZBTB12). ZBTB12's suppression of HERVH expression is crucial for the successful exit from a pluripotent state and the activation of lineage-specific differentiation pathways (Han2023ZBTB12). This regulatory function is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates and has been specifically adapted in primates to control LTR7/HERVH elements (Han2023ZBTB12).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZBTB12 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In gastric cancer, ZBTB12 is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is associated with increased malignancy. The gene's overexpression in CAFs enhances the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, suggesting its role as an oncogene. Astragaloside IV, a compound with antitumor properties, has been shown to downregulate ZBTB12, thereby reducing the malignancy of gastric cancer cells, indicating a potential therapeutic target (Liu2023Astragaloside).

In cardiovascular disease, ZBTB12 hypomethylation is linked to an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). This hypomethylation is associated with shorter coagulation times and higher white blood cell counts, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The gene's methylation status influences blood cell parameters related to coagulation and inflammation, suggesting its role in modulating these processes (Noro2019ZBTB12).

ZBTB12 also acts as a molecular barrier to dedifferentiation in human pluripotent stem cells. Its dysregulation can lead to impaired differentiation, which may contribute to pathological conditions where cellular identity is compromised, such as cancer (Han2023ZBTB12).

## Interactions
ZBTB12 is a transcriptional regulator that primarily interacts with non-coding regions of the genome, particularly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. It binds to these regions to regulate the expression of human endogenous retrovirus H (HERVH) elements, which are crucial for maintaining the pluripotent state in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Han2023ZBTB12). ZBTB12's binding sites are enriched with motifs for core pluripotency factors such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, indicating its involvement in the core pluripotency transcriptional network. This suggests that ZBTB12 may interact with these factors to modulate the expression of LTR7/HERVH elements (Han2023ZBTB12).

ZBTB12 functions as a repressor of LTR expression, and its knockdown leads to increased expression of LTR and ERV1 subfamily members, particularly the LTR7/HERVH subfamily (Han2023ZBTB12). Although the specific physical interactions between ZBTB12 and other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role as a transcriptional regulator implies that it may form part of multiprotein complexes or engage in transient interactions to exert its regulatory functions (Han2023ZBTB12).
