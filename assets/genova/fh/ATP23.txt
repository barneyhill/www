# ATP23

## Overview
ATP23 is a gene that encodes the ATP23 metallopeptidase and ATP synthase assembly factor homolog, a protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a metallopeptidase due to its characteristic metal-binding motif, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. ATP23 is involved in the processing and assembly of subunit 6 of mitochondrial ATPase, a component of the ATP synthase complex, which is crucial for ATP production in cells (Zeng2007The; Yang2022T1121G). The protein is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and interacts with other mitochondrial proteins to facilitate the assembly of the ATP synthase complex (Osman2007Prohibitins). Its function is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism, impacting cellular and organismal energy homeostasis (Zeng2007The).

## Structure
The ATP23 protein is a conserved mitochondrial intermembrane space protein found in various organisms, including humans. It contains ten or eleven cysteine residues at conserved positions, which are involved in forming disulfide bonds crucial for the protein's structure and function (Weckbecker2012Atp23). These disulfide bonds are introduced by Mia40, a chaperone-like protein that facilitates the folding and oxidation of ATP23, converting it into a folded, protease-resistant conformation (Weckbecker2012Atp23).

ATP23 also features a consensus metal-binding motif, HEliH, formed by residues 167-171, characteristic of metallopeptidases, suggesting potential peptidase activity (Osman2007Prohibitins). This motif is highly conserved across eukaryotic organisms, indicating its functional importance. The protein's primary structure includes a sequence of 227 amino acids, with predicted regions likely forming alpha-helices as part of its secondary structure (Weckbecker2012Atp23).

The tertiary structure of ATP23 is stabilized by disulfide bonds, while its quaternary structure involves interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as Atp6 and Atp9, facilitating the assembly of the ATP synthase complex (Osman2007Prohibitins). The protein is not an integral membrane protein, as it lacks a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (Weckbecker2012Atp23).

## Function
The ATP23 gene encodes a metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in the processing and assembly of subunit 6 of mitochondrial ATPase, which is part of the ATP synthase complex. This protein is involved in the maturation of the Atp6 precursor, a necessary step for the proper assembly of the ATP synthase complex, which is essential for ATP production in cells (Zeng2007The; Yang2022T1121G). ATP23 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its C-terminus facing the intermembrane space, and is conserved among eukaryotic organisms, including humans (Zeng2007The).

The protein contains a metalloprotease motif (HEXXH), which is responsible for processing the Atp6 precursor, while specific residues are involved in assisting the assembly of ATP synthase (Yang2022T1121G). ATP23 also interacts with the mitochondrial disulphide relay system, involving Mia40 and Erv1, which is essential for its biogenesis and proper folding (Weckbecker2012Atp23). This interaction ensures the structural integrity of ATP23, which is crucial for its function in the mitochondria. The presence of ATP23 is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Zeng2007The).

## Interactions
ATP23 interacts with several proteins within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the F1FO-ATP synthase complex. It acts as a processing peptidase and chaperone, specifically interacting with the mitochondrial-encoded Atp6 protein. ATP23 facilitates the maturation of Atp6 by cleaving its N-terminal amino acids and assists in its assembly into the membrane-embedded FO-particle, a process that is independent of its proteolytic activity (Osman2007Prohibitins).

ATP23 also interacts with Atp10, another chaperone that operates on the matrix side of the inner membrane, to promote the assembly of Atp6 into the FO-particle. This interaction is essential for cell growth in prohibitin-deficient cells, indicating a synthetic lethal interaction between ATP23 and ATP10 (Osman2007Prohibitins).

Additionally, ATP23 is a substrate of the mitochondrial disulphide relay system, interacting with Mia40, a protein that assists in its import and folding within the mitochondria. Mia40 introduces disulfide bonds into ATP23, converting it into a folded, protease-resistant conformation, and stabilizes it in a soluble, folding-competent state (Weckbecker2012Atp23).
