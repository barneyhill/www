# OLFML2A

## Overview
OLFML2A is a gene that encodes the protein olfactomedin-like 2A, a member of the olfactomedin family of glycoproteins. This protein is primarily characterized by its olfactomedin-like domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions within the extracellular matrix, playing a crucial role in cellular adhesion and signaling (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike; GarzaRodríguez2019Olfactomedinlike). The OLFML2A protein is expressed in various tissues, with a notable presence in ocular tissues such as the retina, cornea, and lens, suggesting its involvement in ocular physiology and potentially in the development of the visual system (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). Additionally, OLFML2A is implicated in modulating immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis, highlighting its significance in fundamental biological processes (Li2019Olfactomedin). The evolutionary conservation of this gene across species underscores its functional importance (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike).

## Structure
OLFML2A is a protein encoded by the OLFML2A gene in humans, belonging to the olfactomedin family of glycoproteins. The protein is characterized by an olfactomedin-like domain located at the C-terminal region, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is typically found in the extracellular matrix (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike; GarzaRodríguez2019Olfactomedinlike). The primary structure of OLFML2A includes a signal sequence at the N-terminal, two tandem CXCXCX9C motifs, a putative coiled-coil region, and a serine/threonine-rich region (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). 

The protein also contains two or three potential N-glycosylation sites, indicating that it may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). In mice, the OLFML2A cDNA encodes a protein with 681 amino acids, while in humans, the coding sequence is 1947 base pairs long, translating to a protein of 648 amino acids (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). The protein is expressed predominantly in the photoreceptor layer of the retina, suggesting a role in ocular physiology (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). The evolutionary analysis suggests that OLFML2A is under purifying selection, indicating its functional importance (GarzaRodríguez2019Olfactomedinlike).

## Function
OLFML2A, a member of the olfactomedin-like protein family, is involved in various cellular processes, primarily within the extracellular space. This protein is known for its roles in cell adhesion, signaling, and interactions with the extracellular matrix, contributing to tissue homeostasis and repair (Li2019Olfactomedin). In humans, OLFML2A exhibits a broad expression profile, suggesting its involvement in multiple tissue developments and organismal growth (Li2019Olfactomedin).

The protein is expressed in ocular tissues, including the retina, cornea, and lens, indicating a potential role in eye physiology (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). Although the specific function of OLFML2A in healthy human cells remains unclear, its expression patterns suggest it may play a role in maintaining ocular health and possibly in the development of the visual system (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike).

OLFML2A is also implicated in modulating immune responses, which may influence cell differentiation and development. Its activity in the extracellular space suggests it contributes to the structural integrity and signaling processes necessary for maintaining cellular and tissue functions (Li2019Olfactomedin). The evolutionary conservation of OLFML2A across species further supports its significance in fundamental biological processes (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OLFML2A gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI), a missense variation in OLFML2A was identified, which may play a role in the condition's pathogenesis due to its involvement in brain structure development (AVŞAR2020Genomewide). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), overexpression of OLFML2A is associated with poor prognosis and may indicate a higher risk of extramedullary infiltration (EMI) (Lv2018Circular; Singh2021Circular). The gene's expression is also increased in pterygium, suggesting a role in the disease's development through m6A modifications (Jiang2021Comprehensive).

In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), OLFML2A is up-regulated, although the clinical significance of this change is not well established (Fendri2013Microarray). The gene's expression patterns vary across species, with high expression in the ovary in rats, indicating potential differences in function and disease association between humans and other species (Li2019Olfactomedin). Despite these associations, the specific biological functions and clinical implications of OLFML2A mutations remain largely unexplored.
