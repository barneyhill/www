# DECR2

## Overview
DECR2, or 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2, is a gene that encodes a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. This enzyme is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, which is characterized by a conserved Rossmann-fold structure essential for cofactor binding and specificity (Bhatia2015Towards). DECR2 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within peroxisomes, such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Spiegel2022A). The enzyme's activity is NADPH-dependent, and it catalyzes the reduction of 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA esters, which is a vital step in the β-oxidation pathway (Mah2022Peroxisomal). DECR2's function is significant for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and energy balance, and its dysregulation has been implicated in diseases such as prostate cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

## Structure
DECR2 (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2) is a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. It is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, which is characterized by a conserved Rossmann-fold structure. This structure consists of a central, twisted parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, crucial for cofactor binding and specificity (Bhatia2015Towards). DECR2 is an NADPH-dependent enzyme, analogous to mitochondrial DECR1, and plays a role in the degradation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

The enzyme's primary function is related to the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid within peroxisomes (Spiegel2022A). DECR2's activity involves the reduction of 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA esters, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (Spiegel2022A). While specific details on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not provided, DECR2's involvement in lipid metabolism and its structural characteristics suggest potential phosphorylation and alternative splicing, common in SDR family members. The enzyme's structure and function make it a significant player in cellular lipid homeostasis and a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases like prostate cancer (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

## Function
DECR2 (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2) is a peroxisomal β-oxidation enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids. It is involved in the oxidation of (poly)unsaturated fatty acids, particularly very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are shortened in peroxisomes before being transported to mitochondria for complete degradation and energy production (Mah2022Peroxisomal). DECR2 is a NADPH-dependent auxiliary enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to trans-3-enoyl-CoA, a crucial step in the β-oxidation pathway (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

In healthy human cells, DECR2 is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy balance. It influences the cellular lipidome by regulating the abundance and composition of lipids, including glycerophospholipids, which are vital for cell growth and proliferation (Mah2022Peroxisomal). DECR2's activity affects membrane lipid composition, impacting membrane fluidity and cellular functions (Mah2022Peroxisomal). The enzyme's role in lipid metabolism is crucial for normal cellular processes, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its specific fatty acid substrates and broader biological roles (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
The DECR2 gene is clinically significant in the context of prostate cancer, particularly in advanced stages such as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). DECR2 is a peroxisomal β-oxidation enzyme that is upregulated in CRPC, contributing to treatment resistance and cancer progression. Its overexpression is associated with poorer overall survival in patients with metastatic CRPC and is linked to resistance against androgen receptor pathway inhibitors like enzalutamide and apalutamide (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

Knockdown of DECR2 in prostate cancer cell lines results in suppressed cell viability, induced cell death, and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase, highlighting its role in promoting tumor growth and survival. This knockdown also leads to changes in lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of neutral lipids and alterations in fatty acid profiles, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Mah2022Peroxisomal).

Targeting DECR2 and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (perFAO) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming treatment resistance in CRPC. Inhibition of DECR2 or perFAO increases sensitivity to enzalutamide in resistant prostate cancer cell lines, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Mah2022Peroxisomal).
