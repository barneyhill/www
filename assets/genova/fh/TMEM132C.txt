# TMEM132C

## Overview
TMEM132C is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 132C, a member of the TMEM132 family, which is characterized by type I transmembrane proteins. These proteins are distinguished by their single transmembrane domain and are involved in cellular adhesion processes, linking the extracellular environment to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. The protein encoded by TMEM132C features an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus, with three tandem immunoglobulin domains and a cohesin domain that facilitate protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. These structural features contribute to the protein's role in maintaining cellular integrity and communication. TMEM132C has been studied for its potential involvement in various diseases, including cancer and pulmonary conditions, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease prognosis and progression (Son2015FamilyBased; SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:; Hu2019Genomewide).

## Structure
TMEM132C is a member of the TMEM132 family, which consists of type I transmembrane proteins characterized by a single transmembrane domain. The protein has an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus. TMEM132C, like other members of its family, contains three tandem immunoglobulin domains and a cohesin domain, which are involved in protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. These domains are mainly extracellular and adopt a beta-sandwich fold composed of nine strands organized in three sheets, contributing to the immunoglobulin-like core (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

The TMEM132 family, including TMEM132C, is noted for its role in cellular adhesion, linking the extracellular environment with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. This connection is facilitated by the conserved domains and motifs that are evolutionarily conserved, contributing to the protein's structural stability (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific details for TMEM132C are not provided in the available context. Information on splice variant isoforms of TMEM132C is also limited (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM132C has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and potential mutations. In the context of cancer, TMEM132C has been identified as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The gene's expression levels were found to be significantly associated with the disease, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Zhang2020ABCC9). In gastric cancer, TMEM132C is part of a gene signature that predicts survival outcomes, indicating its involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease (Hu2019Genomewide).

In pulmonary function, TMEM132C has been associated with genetic determinants of pulmonary function traits in Asian populations. Although specific diseases were not directly linked to TMEM132C, its genetic variants showed significant associations with pulmonary function phenotypes, such as FEV1, which is related to airway obstruction in conditions like asthma and COPD (Son2015FamilyBased).

Overall, TMEM132C's role in these conditions highlights its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and its involvement in the underlying mechanisms of disease progression.
