# ZNF684

## Overview
ZNF684 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 684, a member of the KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to nucleic acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA export and mitochondrial function. Zinc finger protein 684 is involved in the mRNA export process by interacting with key export factors such as Nxf1 and Alyref, and it exhibits a binding preference for G-rich sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNA. The protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, aligning with its function in mRNA export, and it also associates with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, suggesting a role in mitochondrial translation. Overexpression studies indicate that zinc finger protein 684 may inhibit the nuclear export of specific mRNA transcripts, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes (Nitoiu2021KRAB).

## Function
ZNF684, a KRAB Zinc Finger protein, plays a significant role in mRNA export regulation in healthy human cells. It interacts with key mRNA export factors such as Nxf1 and Alyref, suggesting its function as an adaptor in the mRNA export process (Nitoiu2021KRAB). ZNF684 binds directly to RNA, showing a preference for the 3' UTRs of protein-coding genes, particularly those with G-rich sequences. This binding pattern is similar to known mRNA export factors, indicating a potential role in mRNA export (Nitoiu2021KRAB).

The protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which aligns with its involvement in mRNA export. Overexpression of ZNF684 has been shown to increase the nuclear abundance of certain mRNA transcripts, such as SMAD3, VEGFA, DDX3X, and AKT1, suggesting an inhibitory role in their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Nitoiu2021KRAB). ZNF684 is also implicated in mitochondrial biology, as it interacts with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and localizes to the mitochondria, potentially influencing mitochondrial gene translation (Nitoiu2021KRAB). These functions highlight ZNF684's role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes through its involvement in mRNA export and mitochondrial function.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF684, a KRAB Zinc Finger protein, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA export regulation. It physically interacts with mRNA nuclear export factors such as Nxf1 and Alyref, as well as PABPC1, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Nitoiu2021KRAB). These interactions suggest that ZNF684 functions as an adaptor in the mRNA export pathway, influencing the export of specific mRNAs (Nitoiu2021KRAB).

ZNF684 also binds directly to RNA, with a preference for G-rich sequences in the 3' UTRs of protein-coding genes. This RNA-binding profile is similar to that of known mRNA export factors, indicating a functional link between ZNF684 and these factors in regulating mRNA export (Nitoiu2021KRAB). The protein's interactions extend to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial translation (Nitoiu2021KRAB).

Overexpression of ZNF684 has been shown to inhibit the nuclear export of specific mRNA transcripts, such as SMAD3, VEGFA, DDX3X, and AKT1, by increasing their nuclear abundance, indicating an inhibitory role in mRNA export (Nitoiu2021KRAB).
