# EMC9

## Overview
EMC9 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 9, a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein is integral to the biogenesis and proper folding of transmembrane proteins, playing a significant role in cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. As a part of the EMC, EMC9 forms a stable heterodimer with EMC2, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of the complex by facilitating the insertion of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the lipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum. The EMC9 protein is characterized by a small beta-barrel structure flanked by alpha-helices, which aids in its interaction with other EMC components and substrate proteins. Mutations in the EMC9 gene have been linked to various developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological functions (O’Donnell2020The; MillerVedam2020Structural; Marquez2023Expanding).

## Structure
The EMC9 protein is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a crucial role in the insertion and folding of membrane proteins. EMC9 shares a high degree of homology with its paralog EMC8, with approximately 44% sequence identity in mammals (O’Donnell2020The; MillerVedam2020Structural). Structurally, EMC9 forms a stable heterodimeric complex with EMC2, characterized by a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (O’Donnell2020The). The EMC2.EMC9 complex features a cytosolic vestibule that is moderately hydrophobic, facilitating the interaction with substrate transmembrane domains (TMDs) (O’Donnell2020The).

EMC9 has a small beta-barrel structure flanked by alpha-helices, contributing to its tertiary structure (O’Donnell2020The). The protein is involved in forming a cytoplasmic cap with EMC8, which cradles an N-terminal peptide of EMC4, indicating its role in the quaternary structure of the EMC (MillerVedam2020Structural). The specific post-translational modifications of EMC9 are not detailed in the available context, but its structural homology with proteins known for peptide hydrolase folds suggests potential functional roles (MillerVedam2020Structural).

## Function
EMC9 is a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a critical role in the biogenesis of membrane proteins. EMC9, along with EMC8, forms part of the cytosolic domain of the EMC, which contains a hydrophobic vestibule crucial for binding transmembrane domains (TMDs) of substrate proteins (O’Donnell2020The). The EMC complex facilitates the energy-independent insertion of TMDs into the lipid bilayer of the ER, particularly for proteins with short lumenal domains (O’Donnell2020The).

In healthy human cells, EMC9 is involved in forming a stable heterodimer with EMC2, which is essential for engaging substrate TMDs and preventing their aggregation (O’Donnell2020The). This interaction is vital for the proper insertion and folding of transmembrane proteins, impacting cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (O’Donnell2020The; Hegde2022The). The EMC2.EMC9 complex is positioned to link the cytosolic environment to the membrane-embedded subunits of the EMC, facilitating the insertion of TMDs (O’Donnell2020The).

The EMC, including EMC9, is crucial for the stability and function of various transmembrane proteins, which are involved in signaling, transport, and other cellular activities (Hegde2022The). EMC9's role in the EMC complex is essential for maintaining ER homeostasis and preventing diseases associated with misfolded membrane proteins (Shurtleff2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EMC9 gene have been associated with a range of developmental disorders and congenital anomalies. Variants in EMC9 are linked to phenotypes such as congenital heart disease, neurodevelopmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphology, umbilical and inguinal hernias, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities. Craniofacial dysmorphology is the most frequently observed phenotype in patients with EMC9 mutations (Marquez2023Expanding). The gene plays a crucial role in neural crest cell development, which is essential for craniofacial structure formation. Disruption of EMC9 function can impair neural crest cell specification and migration, leading to craniofacial cartilage abnormalities (Marquez2023Expanding).

In Drosophila, mutations in the EMC9 homolog result in phenotypes similar to those seen with other EMC subunit mutations, affecting the biosynthesis of multi-pass membrane proteins like rhodopsin. This suggests that EMC9 is vital for the proper folding and stabilization of these proteins (Satoh2015dPobEMC). The disruption of EMC9 and its associated pathways can lead to significant developmental and physiological defects, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein processing.

## Interactions
EMC9 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which is involved in the insertion and folding of transmembrane proteins. In humans, EMC9 is a paralog of EMC8, and both are part of the cytosolic domain of the EMC complex. This domain provides a platform for protein-protein interactions, with EMC9 contributing to the structural organization of the complex (MillerVedam2020Structural). EMC9, along with EMC8, forms a cytoplasmic cap that cradles an N-terminal peptide of EMC4, which traverses over EMC2 and EMC3, indicating its role in the structural integrity of the EMC complex (MillerVedam2020Structural).

EMC9 is suggested to interact with EMC2, as it covers the cytosol-facing side of human EMC2, indicating a potential interaction between these subunits (Hegde2022The). The structural homology between EMC8 and EMC9, with approximately 45% amino acid sequence identity, suggests that EMC9 may have similar structural features and potentially similar interactions as EMC8 (MillerVedam2020Structural). However, specific interactions of EMC9 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature, and its precise role within the EMC complex remains to be fully elucidated.
