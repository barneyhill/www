# IL2

## Overview
Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin-2, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. As a cytokine, interleukin-2 is primarily involved in the regulation of T cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, making it essential for immune response modulation. The IL2 gene is expressed predominantly in activated CD4+ T cells, and the protein it encodes interacts with a specific receptor complex composed of IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and the common gamma chain (γc). This interaction is crucial for initiating signaling pathways that are vital for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which help maintain immune tolerance and prevent autoimmunity (Malek2008The; Ross2018Signaling). The IL-2 protein is characterized by a four-helix bundle structure, which facilitates its binding to the receptor complex and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling cascades, including the JAK-STAT and mTOR pathways (Ross2018Signaling; Rickert2005The). Given its central role in immune regulation, IL-2 is a critical factor in both promoting immune activation and preventing excessive immune reactions, with significant implications for autoimmune diseases and therapeutic interventions (Malek2010Interleukin2).

## Structure
Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a cytokine with a primary structure consisting of a polypeptide chain of 133 amino acids (Rose2003Structural). Its secondary structure is characterized by a compact bundle of four anti-parallel alpha helices connected by three loops (Rose2003Structural). The tertiary structure of IL-2 forms a globular shape, with a four-helix topology described as an up-up-down-down four-helix bundle (Rickert2005The). This structure is maintained in the IL-2/IL-2Ra complex, with minor structural adaptations in the receptor binding site (Rickert2005The). 

IL-2 interacts with its receptors, IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb, and the common gamma chain (γc), forming a quaternary complex. The IL-2/IL-2Ra interaction involves hydrophobic ridges around residues Phe 42 and Tyr 45, which insert into grooves between the IL-2Ra beta strands (Wang2005Structure). The IL-2/IL-2Rb interface is highly polar, involving residues from helices A and C in IL-2 (Wang2005Structure). 

Post-translational modifications of IL-2 include glycosylation, which can affect its molecular mass, ranging from 15 to 18 kDa (Rose2003Structural). IL-2 splice variants, such as IL-2d2 and IL-2d3, act as natural inhibitors by lacking regions involved in IL-2Ra interaction (Rickert2005The).

## Function
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of T cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. IL-2 is primarily produced by activated CD4+ T cells and acts by binding to the IL-2 receptor, which is composed of three subunits: IL-2Rα (CD25), IL-2Rβ (CD122), and the common γ subunit (CD132). This receptor complex facilitates high-affinity binding and initiates signaling pathways essential for T cell function (Ross2018Signaling).

IL-2 is vital for the activation of STAT5-mediated transcriptional programs, which are necessary for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). These cells are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Malek2008The; Ross2018Signaling). IL-2 signaling supports the proliferation and growth of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by sustaining glycolytic metabolism and biosynthesis through the mTORC1 pathway, which is important for nutrient uptake and protein synthesis (Ross2018Signaling).

IL-2 also plays a role in the differentiation of T cells, influencing the expression of genes such as FoxP3, which is essential for Treg cell development, and repressing genes that inhibit Th17 cell differentiation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Malek2008The; Ross2018Signaling). The cytokine's ability to modulate immune responses makes it a key factor in both promoting immune activation and preventing excessive immune reactions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL2 gene are associated with various autoimmune diseases and immune system disorders. Deficiencies in IL-2 or its receptor components can lead to severe autoimmunity, as seen in mice models where IL-2 deficiency results in lethal autoimmunity and impaired regulatory T cell (Treg) production (Malek2008The). In humans, mutations in the CD25 gene, a part of the IL-2 receptor, are linked to severe autoimmunity, lymphadenopathy, and persistent viral infections (Malek2008The). Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-2 receptor components, such as CD25 and CD122, that are associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes (Malek2008The).

Alterations in IL-2 expression levels can also impact disease susceptibility. Reduced IL-2 production is linked to increased frequency of type 1 diabetes in certain mouse models, suggesting that IL-2 haplodeficiency can contribute to autoimmune disease development (Yamanouchi2007Interleukin2). Conversely, excessive IL-2 signaling can exacerbate autoimmunity, highlighting the need for balanced IL-2 activity (Malek2010Interleukin2). IL-2 therapy, while beneficial in increasing Treg cell numbers, carries the risk of exacerbating autoimmune conditions if not carefully regulated (Malek2010Interleukin2).

## Interactions
Interleukin 2 (IL-2) interacts with its receptor complex, which consists of three subunits: IL-2Rα (CD25), IL-2Rβ (CD122), and the common gamma chain (γc, CD132). IL-2 initially binds to IL-2Rα, facilitating the recruitment of IL-2Rβ and γc to form a high-affinity receptor complex. This complex is crucial for IL-2 signaling, which involves the activation of Janus family kinases (JAK1 and JAK3) and the phosphorylation of STAT proteins, particularly STAT5A and STAT5B. These STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Malek2008The; Ross2018Signaling).

IL-2 also engages in interactions that activate the Ras-ERK MAP kinase cascade through the adapter protein SHC, which forms a complex with GRB2 and SOS. This pathway is important for T cell proliferation and differentiation (Ross2018Signaling). Additionally, IL-2 signaling involves the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates metabolic and transcriptional programs in T cells (Ross2018Signaling).

The IL-2 receptor complex is involved in tyrosine phosphorylation events, with IL-2Rβ being a substrate for associated tyrosine kinases. This phosphorylation is an early event in IL-2 signaling and is essential for the transduction of growth signals in T cells (Mills1990Interleukin).
