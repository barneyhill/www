# ADGRB1

## Overview
ADGRB1, also known as brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), is a gene that encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically a transmembrane receptor. The protein product, adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including synaptic development, cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and angiogenesis. BAI1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a signal peptide, an RGD integrin-binding motif, and thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) that facilitate interactions with other cellular components. These structural features enable BAI1 to function as a receptor involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and the regulation of angiogenesis, particularly in the brain and kidney. The gene's expression and function are significant in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis and have implications in pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion; Parag2024Novel).

## Structure
The ADGRB1 gene encodes the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. BAI1 is a transmembrane receptor with a predicted size of 173.5 kDa and consists of 1584 amino acids (Parag2024Novel). The protein features a modular structure, including a signal peptide, an RGD integrin-binding motif, and five thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) in its extracellular region. These TSRs interact with CD36 on endothelial cells and bind to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and RTN4R on neurons (Parag2024Novel).

Following the TSR domain is a hormone-binding domain (HBD) of unknown ligand and a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which stimulates autoproteolytic cleavage at a GPCR proteolysis site (GPS). This cleavage separates the N-terminal extracellular fragment (NTF) from the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF), which includes a 7-helical transmembrane (7TM) domain anchoring BAI1 to the cell membrane (Parag2024Novel). The intracellular loops of BAI1 bind to various proteins, activating Rho signaling, and the intracellular C terminus features a proline-rich region (PRR) and a helical domain (HD) that recruits ELMO/DOCK180 to activate Rac1 signaling (Parag2024Novel).

BAI1 also exists in shorter isoforms generated from an alternative promoter in intron 17, resulting in proteins of 76.9 kDa and 70.8 kDa, which lack most of the N-terminal region and the GAIN domain (Parag2024Novel). These structural differences may affect the cellular localization and signaling function of the isoforms (Parag2024Novel).

## Function
ADGRB1, also known as BAI1, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily active in the brain. In healthy human cells, ADGRB1 is involved in regulating synaptic development and function, contributing to neural connectivity and brain function. It plays a significant role in cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and angiogenesis. ADGRB1 is expressed in the kidney at both mRNA and protein levels, with prominent expression in proximal and distal tubules, suggesting a role in kidney development and physiology (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

ADGRB1 is known to suppress angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is crucial for maintaining normal tissue homeostasis and preventing excessive vascular growth. This function is particularly important in the context of tumor suppression, as ADGRB1 downregulation is associated with increased tumor angiogenesis and growth in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion). The gene's role in angiogenesis is further supported by its inverse correlation with vascular density in other tumor types, as demonstrated in an in vivo tumor model where ADGRB1 overexpression reduced tumor growth and microvessel density (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADGRB1 gene, also known as BAI1, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ADGRB1 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal kidney tissues, with even lower levels in advanced RCC. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor angiogenesis and growth, suggesting that ADGRB1 acts as an antiangiogenic factor. Overexpression of ADGRB1 in RCC models has been shown to reduce tumor growth by decreasing microvessel density and VEGF expression (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, ADGRB1 is downregulated in Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This downregulation is linked to increased neuronal cell death, a hallmark of PD. The regulation of ADGRB1 by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suggests that its decreased expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD by promoting neuronal cell death (Choi2018New).

ADGRB1 is also involved in tumorigenesis in other cancers, such as gliomas and colorectal cancers, where its aberrant expression is linked to tumor progression. Restoration of ADGRB1 expression can alleviate tumor proliferation and vascularization, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mathema2017Regulatory).

## Interactions
ADGRB1, also known as BAI1, interacts with several proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It acts as a negative regulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which is crucial for p53 stability. BAI1 inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby stabilizing p53. This interaction is specific to BAI1 and involves its seven-transmembrane domain, particularly a unique VSV motif in the first cytoplasmic loop, which is crucial for MDM2 binding (Morgan2019The; Zhu2018BAI1).

BAI1 also interacts with the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 by binding to MDM2, preventing PSD-95 degradation. This interaction stabilizes PSD-95, which is important for synaptic plasticity and function (Zhu2015BAI1; Tu2018The).

In the context of apoptotic cell clearance, BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor by interacting with ELMO1. This interaction is crucial for the ELMO/Dock180/Rac signaling module, which facilitates the engulfment of apoptotic cells. BAI1 binds to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells through its thrombospondin type 1 repeats, promoting the internalization of these cells (Park2007BAI1).

BAI1 is also processed into a fragment called Vstat40, which has anti-angiogenic activity. This processing involves the enzyme MMP-14, which cleaves BAI1 extracellularly, suggesting a colocalization on the cell membrane (Cork2012A).
