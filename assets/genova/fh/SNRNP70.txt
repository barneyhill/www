# SNRNP70

## Overview
The SNRNP70 gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 (U1-70K), a pivotal component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is integral to the pre-mRNA splicing process. U1-70K is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine-rich regions, which are essential for its function and localization within the nucleus (Romac1994The). As a core component of the spliceosome, U1-70K is involved in recognizing the 5' splice site of pre-mRNA, facilitating spliceosome assembly and function (Hu2022U1). Beyond its nuclear role, U1-70K also participates in cytoplasmic processes, particularly in neurons, where it influences axonal growth and synaptogenesis (Nikolaou2020Cytoplasmic). The protein's interactions with other splicing factors and its involvement in alternative polyadenylation underscore its multifaceted role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation (Hu2022U1).

## Structure
The SNRNP70 gene encodes the U1-70K protein, a crucial component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The primary structure of U1-70K includes an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and two arginine-rich regions, which are essential for its function and nuclear localization (Romac1994The). The RRM is approximately 80 amino acids long and contains specific residues necessary for correct folding and RNA contact (Romac1994The). 

The secondary structure of the U1-70K protein features alpha-helices and beta-sheets typical of RRMs, with a structural loop 5 containing basic residues crucial for nuclear localization (Romac1994The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to facilitate RNA interaction, with loop 5 being solvent-accessible and distinct from RNA-interacting strands (Romac1994The). 

In terms of quaternary structure, U1-70K associates with other components of the U1 snRNP complex, playing a role in spliceosome assembly (Fan2021Phylogenetic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein also exhibits splice variant isoforms, with a truncated C-terminal in some animal species (Fan2021Phylogenetic).

## Function
SNRNP70 encodes a protein that is a core component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is involved in recognizing the 5' splice site of pre-mRNA, facilitating the assembly and function of the spliceosome, primarily within the cell nucleus (Hu2022U1). Beyond its nuclear functions, SNRNP70 also has significant roles in the cytoplasm, particularly in neurons. It is localized in axonal compartments where it regulates motor axonal growth, acetylcholine receptor clustering, and neuromuscular synaptogenesis. In this context, SNRNP70 protects certain axonal transcripts from degradation and regulates splice variants crucial for synapse formation (Nikolaou2020Cytoplasmic).

SNRNP70 also influences alternative polyadenylation (APA) by interacting with 3' end processing factors such as CPSF6. It promotes the usage of proximal APA sites, which can affect mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Hu2022U1). The protein's interaction with CPSF6 and PABPN1 is mediated by its LC1 domain, which is involved in phase separation processes that influence APA site selection (Hu2022U1). These activities highlight SNRNP70's multifaceted role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the SNRNP70 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In gastrointestinal-natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (GI-NKTCL), SNRNP70 mutations occur in 21% of patients, with specific mutations like p.Asp236_Arg237del and p.Arg155Gln/Pro identified. These mutations are associated with decreased overall survival in melanoma and increased expression of immune checkpoint-related genes in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (Li2022Integrated).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SNRNP70 is a key component of the splicing machinery, which is significantly altered in RA leukocytes. Overexpression of SNRNP70 has been shown to downregulate inflammatory mediators, suggesting its role in modulating inflammation and disease progression (IbáñezCosta2021Splicing).

SNRNP70 also plays a critical role in neuromuscular development. In zebrafish, loss of SNRNP70 function leads to defects in motor neuron development and neuromuscular junction formation, indicating its importance in motor connectivity. These findings suggest that alterations in SNRNP70 expression could impact neuromuscular development and potentially contribute to related disorders (Nikolaou2020Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
The SNRNP70 gene encodes the U1-70K protein, a crucial component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing. U1-70K interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate spliceosome assembly. It is phosphorylated by Cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1) at Ser-226, which is essential for its interaction with the serine-arginine (SR) protein SRSF1 and other U1 snRNP-associated proteins. This phosphorylation event allows U1-70K to bind SRSF1, promoting stable interactions within the spliceosome (Aubol2021CLK1).

U1-70K is also involved in interactions with the SMN complex and the Sm ring system, which are critical for linking SR proteins to the spliceosome's initiation (Aubol2021CLK1). Additionally, U1-70K is part of the extensive overlap between the U1 snRNP machinery and the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) machinery, indicating its role in transcription and splicing processes. This overlap includes numerous proteins associated with transcription, splicing, and motor neuron diseases (Chi2018Interactome). The interaction between U1-70K and RNAP II is mediated by the FUS protein, which is necessary for coupling transcription to splicing (Yu2015FUS).
