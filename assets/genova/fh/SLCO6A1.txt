# SLCO6A1

## Overview
SLCO6A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 6A1 (OATP6A1), which is part of the organic anion transporter protein (OATP) family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the transmembrane transport of a variety of organic anions, including drugs, toxins, and steroid hormone conjugates. OATP6A1, in particular, is noted for its role in the transport of thyroid hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, which are implicated in the regulation of spermatogenesis (Khan2016Analysis). The gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with significant expression in the testis and lower levels in the brain, spleen, fetal brain, and placenta (Hagenbuch2013The; Khan2016Analysis). Despite its conserved nature and potential physiological importance, the specific functions of SLCO6A1 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, although its involvement in various health conditions has been explored (Zhang2019Genetic).

## Function
The SLCO6A1 gene encodes the OATP6A1 protein, a member of the organic anion transporter protein (OATP) family, which is involved in the transport of various low-molecular-weight substrates, including drugs, toxins, and steroid hormone conjugates. This transporter is particularly noted for its role in the transport of thyroid hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, which are believed to play a role in the regulation of spermatogenesis in the gonads (Khan2016Analysis). The SLCO6A1 gene exhibits tissue-specific expression, with strong expression in the testis and weaker expression in the brain, spleen, fetal brain, and placenta (Hagenbuch2013The; Khan2016Analysis).

In terms of genetic variability, SLCO6A1 is one of the more conserved genes within the SLCO family, with a low number of common variants and a high number of rare variants (Zhang2019Genetic). This conservation suggests a potentially critical role in physiological processes, although specific functions in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed in the available literature. The gene's expression in various tissues and its involvement in hormone transport indicate its importance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
The SLCO6A1 gene has been investigated for its potential role in various psychiatric disorders and other health conditions. In the Han Chinese population, a study found a statistically significant association between the SNP rs7734060 in the SLCO6A1 gene and major depressive disorder (MDD), although no significant association was found with schizophrenia (SCZ) for the SNP rs6878284, despite previous findings in the Swedish population (Khan2016Analysis). 

SLCO6A1 has also been implicated in severe early-onset obesity (EOO) through a possible recessive pattern of inheritance involving rare copy number variants (CNVs) and sequence variants (RSVs). A patient with a deletion partially encompassing SLCO6A1 suggested a major contribution of CNVs to obesity (SerraJuhé2017Novel).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), SLCO6A1 was expressed in 14.1% of samples, although its expression did not significantly impact overall survival (Svoboda2018Clinical). The gene's expression in cancer suggests a potential role in tumor biology, although its clinical significance remains unclear. 

Overall, while SLCO6A1 is associated with certain conditions, the evidence is not uniformly strong across all studies and populations.
