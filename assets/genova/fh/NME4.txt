# NME4

## Overview
NME4 is a gene that encodes the protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase D (NDPK-D), also known as Nm23-H4, which is a mitochondrial kinase involved in various cellular processes. NDPK-D is primarily localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it plays a critical role in phosphotransfer and lipid transfer, particularly involving cardiolipin, an essential phospholipid for mitochondrial membrane stability. The protein's hexameric structure and conserved cationic triad facilitate its binding to cardiolipin, enabling it to support mitochondrial dynamics, energy homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling. NME4 is also implicated in mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control, marking it as a key player in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Alterations in NME4 expression or mutations can lead to disrupted mitochondrial function and are associated with increased metastatic potential in various cancers, highlighting its significance as a metastasis suppressor and potential prognostic marker (Schlattner2013Dual; TokarskaSchlattner2008The; Lacombe2021The).

## Structure
The NME4 gene encodes the nucleoside diphosphate kinase D (NDPK-D), also known as Nm23-H4, which is a mitochondrial protein with a unique structural composition. NDPK-D is characterized by its symmetrical hexameric structure, allowing it to form complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Schlattner2013Dual; TokarskaSchlattner2008The). This hexameric assembly is crucial for its function in phosphotransfer and intermembrane lipid transfer, particularly involving cardiolipin, an anionic phospholipid (Schlattner2013Dual; TokarskaSchlattner2008The).

The protein's structure includes a conserved cationic triad (RRK motif) that mediates its binding to cardiolipin, which is essential for its lipid transfer function (Schlattner2013Dual). The interaction with cardiolipin is facilitated by specific residues such as Arg-90, which plays a critical role in binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane (TokarskaSchlattner2008The). Mutation of Arg-90 significantly reduces binding affinity, highlighting its importance in the protein's structural integrity and function (TokarskaSchlattner2008The).

NME4's structure also supports its role in mitochondrial processes, such as coupling nucleotide transfer with respiration, and its involvement in apoptotic signaling through cardiolipin transfer (Schlattner2013Dual; TokarskaSchlattner2008The). The protein's ability to cross-link membranes without fusion is a notable feature of its quaternary structure, facilitating its functional roles in the mitochondria (Schlattner2013Dual).

## Function
The NME4 gene encodes the nucleoside diphosphate kinase D (NDPK-D), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function and cellular energy homeostasis. NDPK-D is primarily localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it binds with high affinity to cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for mitochondrial membrane stability (TokarskaSchlattner2008The). This binding facilitates the coupling of nucleotide transfer with mitochondrial respiration, allowing NDPK-D to regenerate GTP from ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation. This process is vital for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics, as it supports the function of OPA1, a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion and cristae remodeling (Schlattner2018NME4nucleoside).

NDPK-D is also involved in local ADP regeneration, which is tightly coupled with oxidative phosphorylation, enhancing mitochondrial respiration efficiency (TokarskaSchlattner2008The). In healthy cells, NME4 supports a connected mitochondrial network, preventing fragmentation and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Lacombe2021The). Additionally, NME4 participates in mitophagy by facilitating the externalization of cardiolipin, marking dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation, thus contributing to mitochondrial quality control and cellular homeostasis (Schlattner2018NME4nucleoside).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the NME4 gene, which encodes nucleoside diphosphate kinase D (NDPK-D), are associated with increased metastatic potential in various cancers. In breast cancer, low NME4 expression correlates with aggressive tumor types, such as triple-negative breast cancer, and is linked to poor prognosis. This is due to its role in suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasion markers (Lacombe2021The). In cervical carcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, inactivation of NME4 leads to enhanced cell scattering, loss of intercellular adhesion, and increased cell migration and invasion (Prunier2023Mechanisms).

NME4 mutations disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to fragmentation and metabolic reprogramming, which contribute to a pro-metastatic phenotype. These changes are associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activation of AMPK signaling, promoting cancer cell motility and invasion (Lacombe2021The). In oral cancer, miR-196 inhibits NME4 expression, enhancing metastasis through the JNK-TIMP1-MMP signaling pathway (Lu2014OncomiR196).

Overall, NME4 acts as a metastasis suppressor, and its altered expression or mutation can significantly impact cancer progression, making it a potential prognostic marker for cancer outcomes (Lacombe2021The).

## Interactions
NME4, also known as nucleoside diphosphate kinase D (NDPK-D), is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondria. It forms complexes with the pro-fusion motor protein OPA1 at the inner mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is essential for mitochondrial fusion and dynamics, as NME4 provides GTP to OPA1, facilitating its fusion and remodeling activities (Prunier2023Mechanisms; Lacombe2021The). The interaction with OPA1 is crucial for maintaining a fused mitochondrial network, which is important for preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis (Prunier2023Mechanisms).

NME4 also binds with high affinity to cardiolipin, a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, which is necessary for its interaction with OPA1 and GTP fueling (Schlattner2021The). This binding facilitates the transfer of cardiolipin to the mitochondrial surface, triggering signaling pathways like mitophagy or apoptosis (Schlattner2021The). The protein's hexameric structure allows it to cross-link anionic phospholipid-containing liposomes, suggesting it could promote intermembrane contacts (TokarskaSchlattner2008The). These interactions highlight NME4's role in mitochondrial dynamics and its potential implications in processes such as cancer metastasis suppression and cellular energy metabolism.
