# KDM6B

## Overview
KDM6B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 6B, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. This enzyme plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation by specifically demethylating trimethylated and dimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3/2), thereby influencing gene expression by removing repressive chromatin marks (LagunasRangel2021KDM6B). As a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, lysine demethylase 6B requires Fe2+ as a cofactor and is involved in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and cellular responses to environmental stimuli (LagunasRangel2021KDM6B). The protein's interactions with other molecular pathways, such as the RAS-RAF pathway and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), underscore its significance in cellular senescence, apoptosis, and cancer biology (Hua2021KDM6). Mutations in KDM6B have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical relevance (Yamamoto2014Loss; Stolerman2019Genetic).

## Structure
KDM6B, also known as lysine demethylase 6B, is characterized by its structural domains, including the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, a zinc binding domain, and a linker domain. The JmjC domain is crucial for its demethylase activity and features a beta sheet jelly roll fold with small scaffold alpha helices (Jones2017Structural). The zinc binding domain is involved in substrate specificity, interacting with the H3(17-23) region of histone peptides. A notable histidine to glutamine substitution at position 1564 in this domain enhances substrate affinity compared to KDM6A (Jones2017Structural).

The protein's tertiary structure includes a hydrophobic pocket and undergoes conformational changes upon peptide binding, which are important for its function (Jones2017Structural). KDM6B can accept various N-alkylated lysine analogues, indicating a degree of catalytic promiscuity (Hopkinson2018Human).

KDM6B may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its function and stability. It also has several splice variant isoforms, potentially differing in regulatory roles and interactions. These structural features and modifications contribute to KDM6B's role in gene expression regulation.

## Function
KDM6B, also known as lysine demethylase 6B, is a histone demethylase that specifically targets the trimethylated and dimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3/2). This demethylation process is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, as it removes repressive marks, thereby allowing the reexpression of target genes (LagunasRangel2021KDM6B). KDM6B functions as a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, requiring Fe2+ as a cofactor, molecular oxygen, and 2-oxoglutarate as co-substrates, producing CO2 and succinate (LagunasRangel2021KDM6B).

In healthy human cells, KDM6B plays a significant role in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and differentiation processes, influencing cell fate decisions (LagunasRangel2021KDM6B). KDM6B is dynamically regulated between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to extracellular signals or exogenous stresses, promoting gene transcription by removing the H3K27me3 mark in the promoter regions of its target genes (LagunasRangel2021KDM6B). This activity is essential for maintaining proper chromatin state and gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting developmental control and cellular responses to environmental stimuli (Jones2017Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KDM6B gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In neurodevelopmental disorders, genetic variants in KDM6B have been linked to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and dysmorphic features. Patients with these variants often exhibit symptoms such as speech and motor development delays, neuromuscular hypotonia, autism spectrum disorder, and distinct facial features. These alterations are predicted to cause a loss of protein function, contributing to the observed neurodevelopmental disorders (Stolerman2019Genetic).

In cancer, KDM6B plays a significant role in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Loss of KDM6B expression enhances the aggressiveness of PDAC by downregulating the tumor suppressor gene C/EBPα, leading to increased tumor sphere formation and metastasis. KDM6B is considered a tumor suppressor in this context, and its expression is high in precancerous lesions but decreases as the cancer becomes more malignant (Yamamoto2014Loss).

In hematological malignancies, KDM6B is implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). It is overexpressed in AML, correlating with poor prognosis, and is necessary for the self-renewal of leukemia-initiating cells in MLL-AF9 AML. Inhibitors targeting KDM6B, such as GSK-J4, have shown potential in reducing proliferation and inducing apoptosis in AML cells (Mallaney2019Kdm6b; Li2018Therapeutic).

## Interactions
KDM6B, also known as lysine demethylase 6B, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in epigenetic regulation. It interacts with nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) to promote its own expression, which is further influenced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) (Hua2021KDM6). KDM6B is involved in the RAS-RAF pathway, activating tumor suppressor proteins p16INK4A and p14ARF, which are crucial for inducing cellular senescence and apoptosis (Hua2021KDM6). It also interacts with estrogen receptor (ER) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in the presence of estrogens or retinoic acid, affecting cancer cell proliferation and differentiation (Hua2021KDM6).

In the context of mouse palatogenesis, KDM6B interacts with the transcription factor TFDP1 to activate Trp53 expression, which is essential for regulating the p53 signaling pathway (Guo2022KDM6B). This interaction is crucial for proper craniofacial development, as it influences DNA damage response and cell proliferation (Guo2022KDM6B). KDM6B also forms part of a complex with TFDP1, highlighting their collaborative role in activating Trp53 expression in palatal mesenchyme (Guo2022KDM6B). These interactions underscore KDM6B's role in modulating gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms.
