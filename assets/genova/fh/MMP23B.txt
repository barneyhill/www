# MMP23B

## Overview
MMP23B is a gene that encodes the protein matrix metallopeptidase 23B, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role as zinc-dependent endopeptidases, which are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components. MMP23B is distinct from other MMPs due to its unique domain structure, which includes a type-II transmembrane domain and a cysteine-rich immunoglobulin-like domain, suggesting specialized functions at the cell surface (Jackson2010Update). The protein is involved in the regulation of voltage-gated potassium channels and has been implicated in various physiological processes, including cartilage and bone formation, as well as pathological conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (Galea2013Domain). MMP23B's interactions with other proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular and tissue homeostasis (Qi2010Mmp23b; Galea2013Domain).

## Structure
MMP23B is a unique member of the matrix metalloprotease family, characterized by its distinct domain structure. The protein consists of 391 amino acids and includes four main domains: an N-terminal pro-domain, a central catalytic domain, a cysteine-rich toxin-like domain (TxD), and a C-terminal immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) domain (Galea2013Domain). The pro-domain features a type-II transmembrane domain that anchors MMP23B to the plasma membrane, differing from other MMPs by lacking the cysteine-switch motif (Galea2013Domain). 

The catalytic domain of MMP23B contains conserved metal ion binding sites, typically coordinating two calcium and two zinc ions, essential for its enzymatic activity (Galea2013Domain). The TxD shares homology with the ShKT family of proteins and is structurally similar to sea anemone toxins, characterized by three short α-helices and a conserved salt-bridge crucial for folding (Galea2013Domain). The IgCAM domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and shares sequence similarity with Ig-like C2 type domains of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Galea2013Domain). MMP23B is encoded by two genes, MMP23A and MMP23B, located on chromosome 1p36.3, likely resulting from a recent duplication event (Galea2013Domain).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 23B (MMP23B) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, which are zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in various cellular processes. MMP23B is unique due to its atypical domain architecture, which includes a type-II transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cysteine-rich immunoglobulin-like domain, replacing the hemopexin-like domain found in other MMPs (Jackson2010Update). This structure suggests that MMP23B may have specific functions at the cell surface, particularly in the regulation of potassium channel trafficking.

MMP23B is involved in the regulation of voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically by trapping Kv1.3 channels in the endoplasmic reticulum and blocking potassium ion passage through the channel pore (Galea2013Domain). This interaction is crucial for modulating the surface expression of Kv1.3 channels, which are implicated in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases (Galea2013Domain).

In addition to its role in potassium channel regulation, MMP23B is expressed in tissues such as the ovary, testis, and prostate, as well as in chondrocytes and osteoblasts, indicating a potential role in cartilage and bone formation (Galea2013Domain). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
MMP23B has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In endometrial cancer, MMP23B is highly expressed and associated with poor survival prognosis. Its downregulation has been shown to reduce cell viability, increase apoptotic factors, and inhibit cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024The). 

In colorectal cancer, upregulation of MMP23B is linked to shorter overall and disease-specific survival times, indicating its prognostic significance (Yu2021Comprehensive). MMP23B is also associated with poorer prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it correlates with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in modulating the immune microenvironment (Liu2023Identification).

In inflammatory bowel disease, MMP23 is upregulated in active disease states, particularly in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and is involved in the inflammatory process (Fonseca‐Camarillo2020Increased). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MMP23B in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MMP23B, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in various biological processes. One significant interaction is with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), where MMP23B facilitates the release of TNF from the cell membrane. This interaction is crucial for liver development and hepatocyte proliferation, as demonstrated in zebrafish models where MMP23B acts upstream of TNF in the signaling pathway (Qi2010Mmp23b).

MMP23B also interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which regulate its proteolytic activity. These interactions are important for maintaining the balance of extracellular matrix remodeling, influencing processes such as tissue repair and inflammation (Galea2013Domain).

In the context of cancer, MMP23B has been shown to interact with apoptosis factors such as CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9 through MMP inhibitors like TIMP1. This interaction plays a role in the regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways, particularly in endometrial cancer, where downregulation of MMP23B leads to increased apoptosis and reduced cancer cell viability (Li2024The).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MMP23B in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.
