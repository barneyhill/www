# WNK1

## Overview
WNK1 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is notable for its unique structural feature of lacking the invariant catalytic lysine typically found in protein kinases. This kinase plays a pivotal role in regulating ion transport and cell volume, primarily through its involvement in the phosphorylation and activation of downstream kinases such as SPAK and OSR1. These kinases are crucial for the function of ion cotransporters, which are essential for maintaining cellular ion balance and responding to osmotic stress (Anselmo2006WNK1; Vitari2005The). WNK1 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in various physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, kidney function, and endothelial cell activities. Mutations in the WNK1 gene are linked to conditions such as pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, highlighting its clinical significance in hypertension and electrolyte balance disorders (Delaloy2003Multiple; Anselmo2006WNK1).

## Structure
WNK1 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase characterized by a unique kinase domain that lacks the invariant catalytic lysine typically found in subdomain II of protein kinases. Instead, WNK1 contains a cysteine at this position, with lysine 233 in subdomain I potentially compensating for the missing lysine, as its mutation abolishes kinase activity (Xu2000WNK1). The primary structure of WNK1 includes a kinase domain, a small N-terminal domain, and a long C-terminal tail (Xu2000WNK1).

The secondary structure of WNK1 features a combination of α-helices and β-strands. The N-lobe of the kinase domain comprises β-strands and an α-helix, while the C-lobe includes an α-helix and a hinge region that accommodates ATP and inhibitors (Jonniya2019Investigating). The autoinhibitory domain (WNK1-AI) is a compact monomer with three β-strands forming a curved base packed against two α-helices (Moon2013Solution).

Phosphorylation at Ser 382 is crucial for WNK1 activity, stabilizing the activation loop and facilitating structural rearrangements that enhance ligand binding (Jonniya2019Investigating). WNK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which significantly impacts its structural dynamics and function (Jonniya2019Investigating).

## Function
WNK1 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport and cell volume in healthy human cells. It is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of the SPAK and OSR1 protein kinases, which are essential for the regulation of the Na+, K+, 2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) activity. This regulation is significant for maintaining ion balance and cell volume control, particularly in response to osmotic stress (Anselmo2006WNK1; Vitari2005The).

WNK1 is ubiquitously expressed and is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences blood pressure regulation and kidney function. It is implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-Smad signaling pathway, where it binds to and phosphorylates Smad2, affecting Smad-mediated transcriptional responses (Lee2007Biological). WNK1 also plays a role in endothelial cell function and angiogenesis, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through its substrate kinases OSR1 and SPAK (Dbouk2014Actions).

Mutations in WNK1 are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, a form of hypertension, highlighting its role in blood pressure regulation (Anselmo2006WNK1). WNK1's activity is modulated by hyperosmotic stress, which increases its autophosphorylation and subsequently activates SPAK and OSR1, enhancing NKCC1 function in ion uptake (Zagórska2006Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNK1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2), also known as Gordon syndrome, is a Mendelian form of hypertension linked to mutations in WNK1. These mutations often involve large deletions in the first intron, leading to increased gene expression without directly affecting the gene product. This results in hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis (Xu2005WNK1; Delaloy2003Multiple).

Familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) is another condition associated with WNK1 mutations. The kinase-defective isoform KS-WNK1, highly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule, plays a crucial role in sodium and potassium transport. Mutations affecting the conserved acidic motif of WNK1 can lead to increased KS-WNK1 abundance, aberrant activation of the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), and hyperkalemia without hypertension (LouisDitPicard2020Mutation; Hadchouel2010Decreased).

Alterations in WNK1 expression are also implicated in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIA (HSAN IIA), where a novel nonsense variant and a large deletion result in decreased WNK1 expression, leading to insensitivity to pain and sweating disorders (Wang2019The).

## Interactions
WNK1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the protein kinases SPAK and OSR1, which are involved in ion transport regulation. WNK1 phosphorylates these kinases, activating them to regulate ion cotransporters such as the Na+:Cl- cotransporter (NCC) and the Na+:K+:2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1/2) (Dbouk2014Actions; Zagórska2006Regulation). 

WNK1 also interacts with Smad proteins, particularly Smad2 and Smad3, in the TGFβ-Smad signaling pathway. This interaction involves the kinase domain of WNK1 binding to the MH2 domain of Smad2, leading to phosphorylation at multiple sites, which is crucial for signaling cross-talk (Lee2007Biological).

In the context of mRNA export, WNK1 interacts with the termination factor PCF11, phosphorylating it at specific residues. This phosphorylation disrupts PCF11's interaction with RNA Polymerase II, facilitating mRNA release from the transcription site (Volanakis2017WNK1).

WNK1 also acts as an assembly factor for the human ER membrane protein complex (EMC) by interacting with EMC2. This interaction helps stabilize EMC2 and prevent nonspecific interactions during EMC assembly (Pleiner2021WNK1).
