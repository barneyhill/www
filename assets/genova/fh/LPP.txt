# LPP

## Overview
The LPP gene encodes the LIM domain containing preferred translocation partner in lipoma, a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, and gene regulation. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich N-terminal region and three C-terminal LIM domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are essential for its localization to focal adhesions and cell-cell contacts (Petit2005The; Petit2000LPP). LPP is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, allowing it to participate in transcriptional activation within the nucleus, thereby linking cell adhesion sites to gene expression regulation (Petit2005The). It interacts with various proteins, including members of the Ena/VASP family, vinculin, and the PR130 subunit of the PP2A complex, which are integral to its role in cell motility and adhesion dynamics (Janssens2016PP2A; Petit2000LPP). The gene's involvement in chromosomal translocations and altered expression is associated with several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2019LPP; Dahéron2001Human).

## Structure
The LPP protein is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes a proline-rich N-terminal region and three C-terminally located LIM domains. These LIM domains are rich in cysteine and histidine residues, forming zinc fingers that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Petit2005The; Petit2000LPP). The N-terminal region contains two proline-rich stretches similar to the 'FPPPP' motifs found in zyxin, which are crucial for interactions with proteins of the Ena/VASP family (Petit2000LPP). 

LPP's nuclear export signal (NES) is located in the pre-LIM region, specifically between amino acids 117-128, and is essential for its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Petit2000LPP). The protein also contains binding sites for α-actinin and VASP, which are located in the pre-LIM region (Petit2005The). 

The LIM domains are critical for targeting LPP to focal adhesions, with the linker between LIM domains 1 and 2 playing a pivotal role in this targeting (Petit2005The). LPP can interact with the tumor suppressor protein Scrib through its C-terminal tail, specifically via a sequence that includes threonine at position -2 and leucine at position 0 (Petit2005The). 

LPP is known to exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles in cellular processes (Janssens2016PP2A).

## Function
The LPP gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and gene regulation in healthy human cells. LPP is primarily localized at focal adhesions and cell-to-cell contacts, where it interacts with members of the VASP family, supporting its role in the spatial control of actin organization (Petit2000LPP). The protein is also involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, interacting with proteins such as vinculin and zyxin (Petit2000LPP).

LPP can shuttle to the nucleus, where it has transcriptional activation capacity, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction from cell adhesion sites to the nucleus, potentially regulating gene expression (Petit2005The). The nuclear export sequence in the N-terminal part of LPP regulates its nuclear localization, and removal of this sequence leads to its accumulation in the nucleus, enhancing transcriptional activation (Petit2000LPP).

LPP also interacts with the PR130 subunit of the PP2A complex, forming a catalytically competent trimer involved in cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell motility and adhesion dynamics, as evidenced by experiments showing that knockdown of LPP and PR130 results in decreased cell migration (Janssens2016PP2A).

## Clinical Significance
The LPP gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosomal translocations and altered expression. In astrocytoma, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LPP gene, such as rs2378456, are associated with a higher risk and poorer prognosis. High expression levels of LPP correlate with poorer survival outcomes in low-grade glioma patients (Chen2019LPP). In breast cancer, LPP is crucial for metastasis, particularly in the formation of invadopodia, which are structures that facilitate cancer cell invasion. Phosphorylation of LPP by Src kinase is essential for its role in promoting metastasis, and targeting this pathway could be a therapeutic strategy (Ngan2017LPP).

In lung cancer, SNPs in the 3′ untranslated region of the LPP gene, such as rs1064607, are linked to increased cancer risk, particularly in males. These polymorphisms may affect gene expression by altering miRNA-mRNA interactions (Yan2019Single). In bladder cancer, LPP acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation through ubiquitination by UBE2S and TRIM21 is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis (Xiao2023UBE2S). LPP is also involved in secondary acute leukemia through fusion with the MLL gene, contributing to leukemogenesis (Dahéron2001Human).

## Interactions
The LPP protein interacts with several proteins involved in cell adhesion and motility. It is known to bind with members of the Ena/VASP family, particularly VASP, through its N-terminal proline-rich region containing FPPPP motifs. This interaction is significant for controlling actin dynamics by increasing the rate of actin polymerization (Petit2000LPP). LPP also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein Scrib via the PDZ domains of Scrib and the carboxy-terminus of LPP, which is crucial for their localization at cell-cell contacts (Petit2005The).

LPP forms a complex with the PR130 subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme, specifically through its LIM domains. This interaction is essential for regulating cell adhesion and migration, as the LPP-PR130 complex is involved in promoting dynamic focal contacts (Janssens2016PP2A). The interaction between LPP and PR130 is dynamic and may dissociate during focal adhesion maturation (Janssens2016PP2A). LPP also interacts with other proteins such as α-actinin and palladin, which are involved in actin organization and cell motility (Van2013Biotin).
