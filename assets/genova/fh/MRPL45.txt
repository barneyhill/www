# MRPL45

## Overview
MRPL45 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L45, which is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, particularly in the co-translational insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a bridging factor, MRPL45 facilitates the interaction between the mitoribosome and the inner membrane protein Oxa1, which is essential for the proper insertion of both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded proteins into the inner membrane, thereby supporting mitochondrial function and energy production (Smits2007Reconstructing). Additionally, MRPL45 is involved in the quality control of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, interacting with the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL6 to ensure the degradation of defective proteins, thus maintaining cellular protein quality (Lavie2022The).

## Function
MRPL45 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in the co-translational insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, acting as a bridging factor between the mitoribosome and the inner membrane protein Oxa1. This interaction is essential for the insertion of both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded proteins into the inner membrane, which is vital for mitochondrial function and energy production (Smits2007Reconstructing).

MRPL45 is permanently tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane, a feature that is crucial for its role in translating hydrophobic and integral membrane proteins. This tethering helps the ribosome function effectively in the mitochondrial environment, which is characterized by the presence of reactive oxygen species (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

In addition to its role in protein synthesis, MRPL45 is involved in the quality control of newly synthesized mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. The E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL6 interacts with MRPL45, participating in the degradation of defective proteins to prevent the accumulation of faulty mitochondrial proteins, thereby maintaining protein quality control in cells (Lavie2022The).

## Interactions
MRPL45 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit (39S) and is involved in several interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It is part of an orthologous group that includes the yeast protein Mba1, which is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1. This association is important for the insertion of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded proteins into the inner membrane, suggesting that MRPL45 may act as a bridging factor between the mitoribosome and Oxa1, facilitating co-translational insertion of proteins (Smits2007Reconstructing).

MRPL45 interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRPL24, as part of the mitoribosomal large subunit. A mutation in MRPL24 affects its interaction with MRPL45, leading to disturbances in the assembly of the 39S mitoribosomal subunit and decreased levels of MRPL45, which impacts mitochondrial translation activity (Di2020A).

MRPL45 is also involved in interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL6, which regulates the quality control of newly synthesized mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. FBXL6 interacts with MRPL45, and this interaction is crucial for the degradation of defective MRPL45 proteins, indicating a role in ribosome-associated quality control (Lavie2022The).
