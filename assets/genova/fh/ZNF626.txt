# ZNF626

## Overview
ZNF626 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 626, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. This protein family is known for its role in transcriptional regulation, often acting as transcriptional repressors. Zinc finger protein 626 is involved in complex regulatory networks, interacting with various proteins to influence gene expression. It has been implicated in several health conditions, including psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as in cancer, particularly ovarian carcinomas. The gene is located on chromosome 19, a region frequently associated with genetic alterations in cancer. The evolutionary significance of ZNF626 is underscored by evidence of positive selection in the human lineage, particularly affecting its KRAB domain, although the specific implications of these evolutionary changes remain to be fully elucidated (Chang2023AcetylationMimic; Jovanovic2021Positive; Bainomugisa2021Using; Micci2010Array‐CGH; Gao2008A).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF626 has been implicated in several health conditions due to its role in gene regulation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near ZNF626 has been linked to bipolar disorder, suggesting a potential association with this psychiatric condition (Jovanovic2021Positive). Additionally, ZNF626 has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a study involving monozygotic twins, where DNA methylation changes in the gene were more likely to be associated with PTSD than by chance (Bainomugisa2021Using).

In the context of cancer, ZNF626 is located in a region of chromosome 19 that frequently shows genetic gains in ovarian carcinomas. This suggests a potential role in cancer through overexpression or rearrangement, which could be pathogenetically significant (Micci2010Array‐CGH). Although specific diseases directly linked to ZNF626 mutations or expression changes are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance.

The evolutionary significance of ZNF626 is also noted, with positive selection observed in the human lineage, particularly in the KRAB domain of the protein. However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with these evolutionary changes are not detailed (Jovanovic2021Positive).

## Interactions
ZNF626, a KRAB-zinc finger protein, has been identified to interact with various proteins, suggesting its involvement in complex regulatory networks. In a study investigating protein-protein interactions among transcription factors involved in liver cell proliferation, ZNF626 was found to interact with ID3 and FHL2. These interactions were identified using a matrix mating yeast two-hybrid technique, which assessed interaction strength through reporter genes (Gao2008A).

In the context of leukemic K562 cells, ZNF626 was shown to interact exclusively with a TRIM28 mutant, TRIM28-K304Q, which mimics acetylation. This interaction was identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, highlighting a potential role in gene expression regulation. The TRIM28-K304Q mutation alters interactions with KRAB-zinc-finger proteins, including ZNF626, which may influence transcriptional repression activities (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

Despite these findings, a study on positive selection in gene regulatory factors during human evolution did not find evidence of ZNF626 interacting with other proteins or nucleic acids in the analyzed databases, indicating that its interaction network might be context-dependent or not fully characterized (Jovanovic2021Positive).
