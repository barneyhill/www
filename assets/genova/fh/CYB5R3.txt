# CYB5R3

## Overview
The CYB5R3 gene encodes the enzyme cytochrome b5 reductase 3, a crucial component in cellular electron transfer processes. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and is involved in various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid desaturation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism. Cytochrome b5 reductase 3 exists in two main isoforms: a soluble form found in erythrocytes and a membrane-bound form located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial outer membrane. The enzyme facilitates electron transfer from NADH to cytochrome b5, playing a vital role in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress. Mutations in the CYB5R3 gene can lead to recessive congenital methemoglobinemia, a condition affecting the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and, in severe cases, causing neurological impairments (Siendones2014MembraneBound; Rahaman2015Structure; Gupta2020Mutation).

## Structure
The human CYB5R3 gene encodes cytochrome b5 reductase 3, a protein involved in electron transfer processes. The molecular structure of CYB5R3 includes two main domains: the FAD-binding domain, spanning residues Thr-30 to Ser-145, and the NADH-binding domain, from Ser-173 to Phe-300. These domains are connected by a linker sequence from Gly-146 to Lys-172, which allows for movement between the domains (Rahaman2015Structure). The FAD-binding domain is crucial for interactions with the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, which is non-covalently bound and facilitates electron transfer (GutiérrezMerino2021Structural).

The protein's secondary structure includes motifs such as '91RxYTSxxSN97', which are significant for flavin binding, with specific residues like R91, Y93, and S127 playing roles in flavin coordination (GutiérrezMerino2021Structural). The tertiary structure forms a globular shape, and the quaternary structure involves dimerization. Post-translational modifications may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, affecting the protein's function and localization.

CYB5R3 exists in different isoforms due to splice variants, which influence its cellular localization and function. The soluble isoform is primarily responsible for recycling methemoglobin in erythrocytes, while the membrane isoform is anchored in subcellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial outer membrane (GutiérrezMerino2021Structural).

## Function
The CYB5R3 gene encodes the enzyme cytochrome b5 reductase 3, which plays a critical role in various electron transfer processes within healthy human cells. This enzyme is involved in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism, primarily functioning in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Rahaman2015Structure). It facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to cytochrome b5 or plasma membrane coenzyme Q, producing cytosolic NAD+ and maintaining cellular redox balance (Siendones2014MembraneBound).

CYB5R3 exists in two isoforms: a soluble form in erythrocytes and a membrane-bound form found in the mitochondrial outer membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane. The membrane-bound isoform is particularly important for the elongation and unsaturation of fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism (Siendones2014MembraneBound). It also plays a role in maintaining the reduced forms of antioxidants like coenzyme Q, a-tocopherol, and ascorbate, providing protection against lipid peroxidation (Siendones2014MembraneBound).

In vascular smooth muscle cells, CYB5R3 modulates the redox state of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), influencing nitric oxide (NO) signaling and cGMP levels, which are crucial for cardiovascular function (Rahaman2017Cytochrome). The enzyme's activity is linked to the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is involved in cell growth and survival, and is regulated by transcription factors such as Nrf2 and FOXO3a (Siendones2014MembraneBound).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYB5R3 gene lead to recessive congenital methemoglobinemia (RCM), a condition characterized by elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood, which reduces its oxygen-carrying capacity. RCM is classified into two types: Type I, which primarily causes cyanosis, and Type II, which includes severe neurological impairments. Type I is associated with missense mutations that result in unstable enzymes in red blood cells, while Type II involves nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations leading to low enzyme activity in all tissues (Bouatrous2023Identification; Gupta2020Mutation).

Type I RCM is generally benign, presenting with cyanosis and symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath. Type II RCM is more severe, with neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, developmental delay, and brain atrophy, often resulting in high morbidity and mortality (Siendones2018Cellular; Iolascon2021Recommendations). The mutations in CYB5R3 disrupt metabolic processes like fatty acid desaturation and cholesterol biosynthesis, crucial for brain development (Bouatrous2023Identification).

The CYB5R3 gene is also involved in lipid metabolism and maintaining a stable redox environment, which is essential for neuronal viability and protection against oxidative stress. Deficiencies in CYB5R3 can lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, potentially causing neuronal damage through demyelination (Siendones2018Cellular).

## Interactions
CYB5R3, or cytochrome b5 reductase 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in electron transfer processes. It interacts with NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) on the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it regulates NOX4 activity. This interaction is facilitated by CYB5R3's ability to reduce ubiquinone to semiubiquinone, which NOX4 uses to convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (Yuan2021Cooperation). The proximity and interaction between CYB5R3 and NOX4 have been confirmed through various assays, including proximity ligation and APEX2 biotinylation (Yuan2021Cooperation).

CYB5R3 also interacts with cytochrome b5 (Cb5), forming a complex that is essential for electron transfer. This interaction involves specific amino acids and results in conformational changes that facilitate electron transfer processes (GutiérrezMerino2021Structural). The interaction with Cb5 is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry and involves residues near the FAD group of CYB5R3, which are crucial for the electron transfer mechanism (GutiérrezMerino2021Structural).

Additionally, CYB5R3 undergoes ufmylation, interacting with proteins such as UFBP1 and UFL1. This modification affects its conformation and enzymatic activity, highlighting its role in ER-phagy (Ishimura2022The). These interactions underscore CYB5R3's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
