# MPZL1

## Overview
MPZL1, or myelin protein zero-like 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein product of MPZL1 is involved in critical cellular processes such as signaling, adhesion, and migration, and is characterized by an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable-like structure and an intracellular domain containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (He2006MPZL1PZR; Yu2018Structural). These motifs facilitate interactions with protein tyrosine phosphatases like SHP-2, influencing various signaling pathways (Jia2013Amplification). MPZL1 is expressed in multiple tissues, with notable expression in the heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and plays a significant role in cancer biology, where its altered expression and interactions contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Chen2019MPZL1; He2006MPZL1PZR).

## Structure
The myelin protein zero-like protein 1 (MPZL1) is characterized by its extracellular domain, which exhibits a typical immunoglobulin variable-like domain structure. This domain is composed of 11 antiparallel β-strands that form a barrel-like shape, organized into two β-sheets. A disulfide bond between Cys58 and Cys135 stabilizes the structure, and the hydrophobic core is consistent with immunoglobulin variable domains (Yu2018Structural). The crystal structure of MPZL1 was determined at a resolution of 2.7 Å, revealing a compact core due to additional strands compared to myelin protein zero (MPZ), with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.643 Å from MPZ (Yu2018Structural).

MPZL1 is glycosylated at Asn50 and Asn130, with Asn50 being more heavily glycosylated, which is crucial for its interaction with concanavalin A (ConA) (Yu2018Structural). The protein exists as a homodimer in the crystal structure, with hydrogen bonds between Ser86 and Val145 playing a key role in dimerization (Yu2018Structural). Mutations in residues involved in dimerization can lead to monomeric states, suggesting that MPZL1 may exist in different forms in vivo (Yu2018Structural).

## Function
MPZL1, also known as myelin protein zero-like protein 1, is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed in multiple tissues, with lower expression in the brain and higher levels in the heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas (He2006MPZL1PZR). The protein contains an extracellular domain that shares sequence similarity with myelin protein zero (MPZ) and an intracellular domain with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that interact with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (Jia2013Amplification).

MPZL1 plays a role in cell signaling pathways by acting as a substrate for SHP-2, which can dephosphorylate MPZL1, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (He2006MPZL1PZR). The glycosylation of MPZL1, particularly at Asn50, is crucial for its interaction with concanavalin A (ConA), a lectin that can agglutinate glycoproteins on cell membranes, suggesting a role in cell signaling or interaction processes (Yu2018Structural). MPZL1's involvement in these molecular processes indicates its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular functions and communication.

## Clinical Significance
MPZL1 is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MPZL1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, correlating with intrahepatic metastasis and higher tumor grades. This overexpression enhances the migratory and metastatic potential of HCC cells through a signaling cascade involving Src-mediated phosphorylation of cortactin (Jia2013Amplification). In ovarian cancer, MPZL1 is genomically amplified and overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via activation of Src kinase (Chen2019MPZL1). 

In HER2-positive breast cancer, MPZL1 forms a signaling complex with GRB2 and PTPN11, influencing cell adhesion and potentially contributing to cancer progression (Beigbeder2017MPZL1). In gallbladder carcinoma, high MPZL1 expression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, enhancing migration and survival through interactions with SHP2 (Liu2019MPZL1). 

MPZL1 also plays a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) chemoresistance, where its downregulation by the long non-coding RNA SPRY4-IT1 increases sensitivity to cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug (Ye2020&lt; Long; p&gt). These findings suggest that MPZL1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
MPZL1, also known as myelin protein zero-like 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in cancer cell signaling and adhesion. In HER2-positive breast cancer cells, MPZL1 forms a signaling complex with the GRB2 adaptor protein and the PTPN11 phosphatase. This interaction is phosphotyrosine-dependent and is crucial for cell adhesion and migration. The complex formation is facilitated by the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on MPZL1, with Tyr241 being particularly important for maintaining the association with GRB2 (Beigbeder2017MPZL1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MPZL1 interacts with Src kinase and cortactin, promoting cell migration and metastasis. MPZL1 overexpression leads to increased phosphorylation of cortactin, a process dependent on Src kinase activity. This interaction suggests a novel MPZL1/Src/cortactin signaling pathway that enhances the metastatic potential of HCC cells (Jia2013Amplification).

In ovarian cancer, MPZL1 is implicated in the activation of Src kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates pro-metastatic proteins such as p130 and cortactin. This interaction promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration, highlighting MPZL1's role in cancer progression (Chen2019MPZL1).
