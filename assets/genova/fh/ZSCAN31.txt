# ZSCAN31

## Overview
ZSCAN31, also known as ZNF323, is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 31 protein, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger and SCAN domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively, categorizing it as a transcription factor (Pi2002A). ZSCAN31 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas, and plays a crucial role in human embryonic development and neuronal function (Yang2024Deciphering; Luo2015Systematic). The protein's involvement in brain morphology and psychiatric disorders, as well as its interactions with other proteins such as TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma, underscores its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Liu2020Correlation; Yang2024Deciphering).

## Structure


## Function
ZSCAN31, also known as ZNF323, is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a significant role in human embryonic development and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas (Luo2015Systematic). The protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting its function as a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression (Li2021Functional). In healthy human cells, ZSCAN31 is implicated in the regulation of neuronal functions and brain structure, particularly through its role in excitatory neurons and astrocytes (Yang2024Deciphering).

In excitatory neurons, ZSCAN31 is associated with a negative causal effect on brain volumes, such as the right hippocampus and whole brain volume, indicating its influence on brain morphology (Yang2024Deciphering). In astrocytes, ZSCAN31 is linked to positive effects on various traits, including psychiatric disorders and brain regional volumes, suggesting its involvement in maintaining brain health and function (Yang2024Deciphering). The gene's activity in astrocytes may also contribute to the regulation of neuronal excitability and intrinsic neural circuitry, highlighting its role in complex brain-associated traits (Yang2024Deciphering).

## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN31, also known as ZNF323, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In schizophrenia, ZSCAN31 is identified as a risk gene, with lower expression levels observed in patients, particularly in brain regions relevant to the disorder. This suggests that alterations in ZSCAN31 expression may contribute to the disease's progression and its impact on brain structure, especially in thalamocortical connectivity (Yang2024Deciphering; Luo2015Systematic).

In cancer, ZSCAN31 has been associated with both esophageal and lung cancers. Genetic analyses have identified ZSCAN31 as a pleiotropic gene, suggesting its involvement in the comorbidity between these cancers. The gene's expression patterns across various cancer types indicate its potential role in cancer development and progression, possibly serving as a therapeutic target or biomarker (Zhang2023Exposing).

The gene's expression in astrocytes is also linked to psychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder, with significant effects on brain regional volumes and white matter microstructure phenotypes. This highlights the gene's cell type-specific regulation and its potential influence on brain structures and disorders (Yang2024Deciphering).

## Interactions
ZSCAN31, a protein encoded by the human gene of the same name, is involved in various protein interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZSCAN31 has been shown to physically interact with the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, indicating a direct binding between the two proteins. The study found a positive correlation between the expression levels of ZSCAN31 and TAZ, suggesting that their interaction may play a role in the progression of HCC (Liu2020Correlation).

ZSCAN31 is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its zinc finger and SCAN domains, which are known for their roles in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. These domains suggest that ZSCAN31 may participate in multiprotein complexes or engage in regulatory interactions that influence gene expression. However, specific interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond TAZ have not been detailed in the provided context. The SCAN domain, in particular, is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially allowing ZSCAN31 to form dimers or participate in complex regulatory networks (Pi2002A).
