# PPIC

## Overview
The PPIC gene encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase C (CyPC), a member of the cyclophilin family known for its role in protein folding and cellular signaling. CyPC functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, facilitating the proper folding of proteins by catalyzing the isomerization of proline residues, a critical process in protein maturation (Marks1996Cellular). This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in calcium signaling, and is also present on the cell surface, suggesting a role in the secretory pathway and cellular regulation (Friedman1993Cloning). CyPC interacts with various proteins, including the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, highlighting its significance in immune response modulation (Davis2010Structural). The PPIC gene has clinical relevance, particularly in liver fibrosis, where its expression is linked to fibrotic processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Yang2021Ppic).

## Function
Cyclophilin C (CyPC), encoded by the PPIC gene, is a member of the cyclophilin family, which is involved in protein folding through its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. This enzymatic function facilitates the proper folding of proteins by catalyzing the isomerization of proline residues in peptide chains, a critical step in the maturation and function of many proteins (Marks1996Cellular). CyPC is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is thought to play a role in mediating calcium signaling within this organelle, potentially through interactions with calcium-binding proteins like calreticulin (Marks1996Cellular).

CyPC is also found on the surface of viable cells and may be involved in protein processing within the secretory pathway, suggesting a role in cellular signaling or regulation (Friedman1993Cloning). The protein interacts with a glycoprotein known as CyCAP, which may indicate a role in protein folding or cellular processes, possibly acting as a molecular bridge in signaling pathways (Friedman1993Cloning). Despite these insights, the specific function of CyPC in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, as its interactions and roles are complex and multifaceted (Friedman1993Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
The PPIC gene, encoding peptidylprolyl isomerase C, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Alterations in PPIC expression are associated with fibrotic liver conditions, such as those induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in mice and rats, as well as in human liver diseases like alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis (Yang2021Ppic). The upregulation of PPIC in these conditions suggests its involvement in fibrotic processes. Knockdown studies in murine models have shown that reducing PPIC expression leads to decreased fibrotic area, collagen deposition, and hydroxyproline levels, indicating its role in promoting fibrosis and hepatic damage (Yang2021Ppic).

PPIC is also involved in the activation of hepatic stellate cells, a key event in liver fibrosis. The gene's expression is modulated by miR-137-3p, a microRNA that negatively regulates PPIC. This interaction forms part of a regulatory network that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions in liver fibrosis (Yang2021Ppic). The study of PPIC in the context of liver fibrosis highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, given the limited success of current treatments for fibrotic liver diseases (Yang2021Ppic).

## Interactions
PPIC, a member of the cyclophilin family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in protein folding and catalysis. The S2 gatekeeper region of PPIC plays a significant role in determining substrate specificity and binding energy, showing a preference for aromatic residues at the P2 position, which are often preceded by basic or aromatic residues at P3. This specificity is attributed to the acidic character of the gatekeeper region, which influences the binding and catalytic activity of PPIC (Davis2010Structural).

PPIC interacts with cyclosporin A, a well-known immunosuppressant, and this interaction has been studied using crystallization and structural analysis. The binding of cyclosporin A to PPIC was confirmed through thermal stabilization assays and isothermal calorimetry, which provided insights into the binding affinities and structural properties of PPIC in complex with cyclosporin A (Davis2010Structural).

The structural diversity within the cyclophilin family, including PPIC, is highlighted by variations in the S2 pocket and loop regions, which may influence protein interactions. These structural features contribute to the unique substrate preferences and binding interactions of PPIC, distinguishing it from other cyclophilin isoforms (Davis2010Structural).
