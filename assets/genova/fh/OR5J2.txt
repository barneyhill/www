# OR5J2

## Overview
The OR5J2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily J member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odor molecules. The OR5J2 gene is located on chromosome 11 and contributes to the vast repertoire of olfactory receptors that enable the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response. These receptors share a common structure characterized by seven transmembrane domains, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
