# CD109

## Overview
CD109 is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein, which is a member of the α2-macroglobulin/complement (AMCOM) family. The CD109 protein is characterized by its role as a negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, particularly in human keratinocytes, where it modulates cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and wound healing (Finnson2006Identification). The protein's structure includes several key motifs and post-translational modifications that contribute to its function and interaction with TGF-β receptors (Lin2002Cell; Finnson2006Identification). CD109 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mo2020CD109; Lee2020Elevation).

## Structure
CD109 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that belongs to the α2-macroglobulin/complement (AMCOM) family. The protein is composed of 1445 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 162 kDa, although it can also exist in a 150 kDa form due to autolytic cleavage (Lin2002Cell; Finnson2006Identification). The primary structure includes a 21-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal GPI-anchor signal sequence, with cleavage predicted to occur after amino acid 1420 (Lin2002Cell; Finnson2006Identification).

CD109 contains several key motifs, including a thioester signature sequence (residues 918-924) and a thioester reactivity-defining hexapeptide, which are characteristic of the α2M family (Lin2002Cell; Finnson2006Identification). The protein also features a putative bait region (residues 651-683) that contributes to its protease inhibitory activity (Lin2002Cell).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which may influence the protein's function and localization (Lin2002Cell). CD109 is expressed in multiple isoforms, including CD109 and CD109S, with differential expression in tissues such as keratinocytes and the placenta (Finnson2006Identification). The protein's interaction with TGF-β receptors suggests a complex quaternary structure, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context (Finnson2006Identification).

## Function
CD109 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that plays a significant role in modulating the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway in human keratinocytes. It acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β1-induced responses by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which are critical components of the TGF-β signaling cascade. This inhibition leads to a reduction in TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activity and extracellular matrix production, including the synthesis of fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (Finnson2006Identification).

CD109 forms a heteromeric complex with TGF-β receptors, including types I, II, and III, and can interact directly with the type I receptor (RI) even in the absence of the TGF-β1 ligand. This interaction suggests that CD109 modulates receptor activity rather than sequestering the ligand (Finnson2006Identification). The protein is involved in processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and wound healing by influencing TGF-β signaling pathways. CD109's expression is down-regulated in certain cancers, indicating a potential role in tumor progression (Finnson2006Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD109 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In cervical squamous cell carcinoma, CD109 is overexpressed and contributes to cancer aggressiveness and tumorigenicity through the regulation of EGFR and STAT3 signaling pathways (Mo2020CD109). In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, CD109 is associated with metastasis and drug resistance via activation of the EGFR-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. High CD109 expression correlates with poor survival prognosis in lung cancer patients (Lee2020Elevation).

CD109 is also upregulated in various types of squamous cell carcinoma, including esophagus, uterine cervix, cutaneous, oral cavity, and gallbladder SCCs. Its expression often correlates with the differentiation stage of tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Qi2018CD109). In glioma, CD109 is expressed in tumor stem-like cells and contributes to aggressive tumor behavior (Shiraki2017Significance).

In non-small cell lung cancer, CD109 interacts with desmoglein-2, influencing tumorigenic cell growth behavior. This interaction is associated with lower overall survival in patients, highlighting its potential as a targetable protein complex (Lückstädt2024CD109).

## Interactions
CD109 is known to participate in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CD109 interacts with desmoglein-2 (DSG2), a cell adhesion molecule. This interaction is implicated in promoting pro-tumorigenic properties, as CD109 and DSG2 may form an endogenous protein complex on the cell surface, influencing cell growth in three-dimensional cell foci (Lückstädt2024CD109).

In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), CD109 interacts with glycoprotein 130 (GP130), a component of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the stemness and tumorigenicity of GSCs. The CD109-GP130 interaction facilitates the activation of the STAT3 pathway, which is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Silencing CD109 results in reduced STAT3 activation and a shift towards a more differentiated cell state, highlighting the importance of this interaction in glioblastoma plasticity and chemoresistance (Filppu2021CD109GP130).

CD109 also interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway in the context of lung cancer metastasis. It acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β and Smad signaling, but its increased expression enhances metastatic ability through STAT3 activation, mediated by Jak kinases (Chuang2017Molecular).
