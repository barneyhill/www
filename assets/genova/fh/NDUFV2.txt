# NDUFV2

## Overview
The NDUFV2 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V2, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is integral to the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular energy production by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation (Liu2011Mitochondrial; Kishita2021Genome). The NDUFV2 protein is characterized by a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster, known as the N1a cluster, which regulates electron transfer and minimizes reactive oxygen species production, thereby maintaining cellular redox balance (Pamplona2021Is). Mutations in the NDUFV2 gene are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, including early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, and Leigh syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Bénit2003Mutant; Cameron2015Exome). Additionally, alterations in NDUFV2 have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in both energy metabolism and neurological health (Liu2011Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The NDUFV2 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, specifically involved in the electron transport chain. It is composed of 249 amino acids and is processed into a mature form weighing approximately 24 kDa (Pamplona2021Is). The protein structure includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its localization to mitochondria. This sequence is characterized by a high content of basic, hydrophobic, and hydroxylated amino acids, forming an amphiphilic α-helix essential for mitochondrial import (Liu2011Mitochondrial).

The secondary structure of NDUFV2 includes seven alpha-helices, three beta-strands, and two turns (Pamplona2021Is). It contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster known as the N1a cluster, which is located in a hydrophobic environment within the protein. This cluster plays a regulatory role in electron transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, although it does not directly participate in electron transport (Pamplona2021Is).

The NDUFV2 protein is homologous to the 24-kDa subunit found in other species, indicating its conserved nature across different organisms (Liu2011Mitochondrial). The proper assembly and function of complex I depend on the presence of NDUFV2, which is essential for NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity (Liu2011Mitochondrial).

## Function
The NDUFV2 gene encodes a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This enzyme complex facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a key step in cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (Liu2011Mitochondrial; Kishita2021Genome). 

NDUFV2 contains a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster, known as the N1a cluster, which plays a regulatory role in electron transfer and helps minimize the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by acting as a temporary electron storage site (Pamplona2021Is; Liu2011Mitochondrial). This regulatory function is essential for maintaining the redox balance and preventing oxidative damage within the cell.

In healthy human cells, NDUFV2 is vital for the proper assembly and function of complex I, ensuring efficient ATP production and energy metabolism. Its dysfunction can lead to decreased ATP levels and mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its importance in cellular energy homeostasis (Bergman2018NDUFV2; Liu2011Mitochondrial). The protein is also involved in neuronal development, as its suppression can impair neuronal migration (Bergman2018NDUFV2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFV2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders. A notable mutation is a 4-bp deletion in intron 2 (IVS2+5_+8delGTAA), which affects the splicing donor site, leading to a truncated protein that is mislocalized to the cytosol instead of the mitochondria. This mislocalization results in a significant deficiency in mitochondrial complex I activity, contributing to early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy (Bénit2003Mutant; Liu2011Mitochondrial). 

NDUFV2 mutations have also been linked to progressive cavitating leukoencephalopathy, characterized by developmental delay and neurological symptoms. Whole genome and exome sequencing have identified several missense mutations in NDUFV2 that affect the structural stability and function of the protein, leading to complex I deficiency (Liu2021Whole). 

Additionally, NDUFV2 mutations are implicated in Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder. Compound heterozygous mutations, including a known intronic mutation and a novel frameshift mutation, have been identified in patients with Leigh syndrome, expanding the phenotypic presentation associated with complex I deficiency (Cameron2015Exome). 

Alterations in NDUFV2 expression or interactions may also be involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's (Liu2011Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
NDUFV2 is a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain by facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone. This protein is involved in several interactions within the complex I assembly. It contains a cofactor binding site for a [2Fe-2S] cluster known as the N1a cluster, which is essential for regulating electron transfer and minimizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Pamplona2021Is).

In the context of schizophrenia, NDUFV2 has been shown to have impaired import into mitochondria, which affects its interaction with other subunits of complex I, leading to reduced complex I activity. This impairment is linked to altered protein structure and mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia-derived cell lines (Bergman2018NDUFV2). The NDUFV2 protein's interactions are also influenced by its pseudogene, NDUFV2P1, which contributes to mitochondrial complex I deficits in schizophrenia (Bergman2018NDUFV2).

NDUFV2 is also involved in mitochondrial targeting, where mutations affecting its mitochondrial targeting sequence can lead to diseases such as early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy. These mutations disrupt the protein's import into mitochondria, affecting its interactions within the complex (Liu2011Mitochondrial).
