# JAML

## Overview
The JAML gene encodes the Junctional Adhesion Molecule-Like (JAML) protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes and plays a crucial role in immune response and inflammation. JAML is prominently expressed in hematopoietic tissues and is localized at cell-cell contact sites, facilitating leukocyte transmigration and enhancing cell adhesion to endothelial cells. It interacts with the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), which is significant for leukocyte migration and γδ T cell activation, particularly during epithelial challenges such as wound repair or inflammation. JAML's function is regulated by integrin activation and involves forming homodimers, which are essential for its adhesive capabilities. The protein's role in immune cell migration and function is similar to other members of the junctional adhesion molecule family, contributing to its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, and cancer (MoogLutz2003JAML; Luissint2008JAML–mediated; Verdino2010The; Yang2024Macrophage).

## Structure
The Junctional Adhesion Molecule-Like (JAML) protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, known as D1 and D2, which form a compact assembly through interdomain interactions such as a parallel β-sheet, numerous hydrogen bonds, a salt bridge, and hydrophobic packing (Verdino2010The). The interface between these domains buries a molecular surface area of 1,050 Å², indicating a rigid structure (Verdino2010The).

The D1 domain of JAML is involved in binding with the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), characterized by a hydrophilic interaction involving charged residues (Verdino2010The). In contrast, the D2 domain interacts with the HL4E10 Fab antibody through hydrophobic interactions, with significant contributions from aromatic residues (Verdino2011Molecular). The CDR H3 of HL4E10 is deeply inserted into a pocket between the JAML C0C00 and DE loops, forming numerous van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds (Verdino2011Molecular).

JAML can undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may aid in protein stabilization and prevent non-specific interactions (Verdino2010The). The protein can also form homodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Verdino2010The).

## Function
The JAML gene encodes a protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in cell adhesion processes. JAML is prominently expressed in hematopoietic tissues, particularly in granulocytes, and is localized at the cell plasma membrane in areas of cell-cell contacts, suggesting its role in homophilic interactions (MoogLutz2003JAML). The protein is involved in leukocyte transmigration, enhancing myeloid leukemia cell adhesion to endothelial cells, and is considered a novel member of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family (MoogLutz2003JAML).

JAML facilitates leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, which is crucial for immune response and inflammation. It is expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, and memory T cells, and its function is regulated by the activation of VLA-4 integrin (Luissint2008JAML–mediated). The interaction between JAML and the Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is significant for leukocyte migration and activating γδ T cell responses, which has implications for epithelial challenges such as wound repair or inflammation (Verdino2010The). JAML's role in cell adhesion and communication is similar to other JAM family proteins, contributing to immune cell migration and function (MoogLutz2003JAML).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the JAML gene are implicated in several diseases. In atherosclerosis, JAML is significantly upregulated in patients with coronary artery disease and in atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE -/- mice. This upregulation enhances the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of PKM2, activating NF-κB signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome, which accelerates atherosclerosis progression. Inhibiting JAML in macrophages is suggested as a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis (Yang2024Macrophage).

In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), JAML expression is induced in podocytes, correlating with lipid accumulation and reduced glomerular filtration rate. JAML modulates podocyte lipid metabolism through the SIRT1-SREBP1 pathway, and its deletion reduces podocyte injury and proteinuria, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for DKD (Fu2020Elevation).

JAML is also associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), where its upregulation is linked to increased inflammation and renal dysfunction. JAML deficiency ameliorates renal dysfunction and inflammatory responses in murine models of AKI, suggesting that targeting JAML could be a novel therapeutic strategy for AKI (Huang2022JAML).

In cancer, JAML overexpression in tumor vascular endothelial cells promotes cancer proliferation via angiogenesis through the VEGF signaling pathway, making it a potential target for cancer treatment (yanan2024JAML).

## Interactions
JAML (junction adhesion molecule like) is involved in several key protein interactions that facilitate its role in cell adhesion and immune response. One of the primary interactions of JAML is with the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR). This interaction is characterized by a face-to-face, handshake-like binding between their respective β-sheets, involving specific charged amino acids and salt bridges, which are crucial for the recruitment of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) to a JAML intracellular sequence motif (Verdino2010The). The JAML-CAR interaction is essential for leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and neutrophil migration across epithelial tight junctions (Zen2005Neutrophil).

JAML also forms cis homodimers, which are critical for its function. The dimerization of JAML is necessary for its interaction with CAR, and mutations that disrupt dimerization significantly reduce its adhesive capabilities (Luissint2008JAML–mediated). Additionally, JAML interacts with the monoclonal antibody HL4E10, which mimics CAR in inducing JAML-mediated responses, although it binds to a different domain, avoiding competition with the endogenous JAML-CAR interaction (Verdino2011Molecular). These interactions highlight JAML's role in immune surveillance and tissue repair.
