# MED18

## Overview
MED18 is a gene that encodes the protein Mediator complex subunit 18, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED18 protein is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, where it forms a heterodimer with MED20, contributing to the formation of a stable transcription initiation complex (Larivière2006Structure). This protein is essential for transcription initiation, termination, and chromatin organization, influencing gene expression by facilitating interactions between enhancers and promoters (Yin2014The; Carlsten2013The). MED18 also interacts with various transcription factors, playing roles in diverse biological processes, including plant defense and flowering time regulation (Lai2014MED18). Additionally, alterations in MED18 expression have been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Xuan2019Long).

## Structure
The MED18 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, MED18 forms a heterodimer with Med20, characterized by pseudo two-fold symmetry. The Med18 protein consists of an eight-stranded beta-barrel with a central pore and three flanking helices, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structure (Larivière2006Structure). The interaction between Med18 and Med20 is primarily hydrophobic, involving the alpha2 helices of both subunits and the beta5 strands at the opening of the Med20 barrel (Larivière2006Structure).

In the context of the Mediator head module, MED18 is part of the Med8C/18/20 trimeric complex. This complex is essential for forming a stable transcription initiation complex and efficient transcription activation (Larivière2006Structure). The Med8C/18/20 complex is conserved across species, with hydrophobic core residues similar from yeast to humans (Larivière2006Structure). The Med18-Med20 interaction has a significant heterodimer interface, with a buried surface area of 3,900 Å², indicating a robust quaternary structure (Larivière2006Structure). The proper assembly of the Med8-Med18-Med20 complex requires the presence of all three proteins during folding, highlighting their interdependence (Adler2009Med8).

## Function
MED18 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a crucial multiprotein assembly that facilitates transcription regulation in eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in the initiation of transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors such as the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB. MED18, along with MED20, forms a heterodimer that is part of the Mediator head module, which is essential for the formation of a stable transcription initiation complex and efficient basal transcription (Larivière2006Structure).

MED18 is involved in transcriptional termination, as its absence in yeast compromises the recruitment of termination factors and RNA polymerase II to the 3' end of genes, leading to a readthrough phenotype. This suggests that MED18 is crucial for proper transcription termination and gene expression regulation (Yin2014The; Carlsten2013The).

The Mediator complex, including MED18, also plays a role in chromatin organization, influencing gene expression by facilitating chromatin looping and enhancer-promoter communication. This interaction is important for maintaining the 3D organization of chromatin, which is essential for proper transcriptional outcomes (Carlsten2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MED18 gene have been implicated in the progression of gastric cancer. The long non-coding RNA SNHG3 has been shown to promote gastric cancer by regulating the methylation of the MED18 gene. SNHG3 interacts with EZH2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, leading to increased methylation of the MED18 promoter and suppression of its expression. This suppression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that MED18 may function as a tumor suppressor in this context (Xuan2019Long).

In Arabidopsis thaliana, MED18 is involved in susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Mutations in MED18 confer resistance to this pathogen, indicating its role in regulating defense pathways. The med18 mutants show altered expression of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid-associated genes, which are crucial for plant defense responses. This suggests that MED18 is part of a complex regulatory network that modulates plant susceptibility to pathogens (Fallath2017MEDIATOR18). While these findings are specific to plants, they highlight the potential for MED18 to influence disease resistance mechanisms, which could have parallels in other organisms.

## Interactions
MED18 is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by interacting with various transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. MED18 physically interacts with several transcription factors, including ABI4, YY1, and SUF4, each binding to different DNA sequences in their respective target genes. The interaction with ABI4 is significant for regulating the ABA pathway genes ABI4 and ABI5, with MED18 being recruited to the ABI5 promoter at the ABI4-binding site (Lai2014MED18). MED18 also interacts with the transcriptional repressor YY1, which is important for plant defense against pathogens like Botrytis cinerea. This interaction does not affect YY1's DNA-binding activity but may regulate its transcriptional repression function (Lai2014MED18).

MED18's interaction with SUF4, a zinc finger-containing protein, is crucial for delayed flowering by promoting FLC expression. This interaction involves MED18 being recruited to the FLC promoter, particularly at the TATA box and the SUF4-binding site (Lai2014MED18). MED18 is also part of the Med8/18/20 subcomplex within the Mediator complex, where it interacts with Med8 and Med20, forming a stable transcription initiation complex essential for efficient transcription (Larivière2006Structure).
