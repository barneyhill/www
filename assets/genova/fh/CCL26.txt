# CCL26

## Overview
CCL26, also known as eotaxin-3, is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 26, a member of the chemokine family involved in immune system regulation. This chemokine is primarily recognized for its role in the recruitment and migration of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, to sites of inflammation, particularly in allergic responses. The protein functions by binding to the CCR3 receptor, which is predominantly expressed on eosinophils, facilitating their movement and contributing to eosinophilia-related diseases (Domaingo2023Chemokine; Hoeck2001Activation). Additionally, CCL26 can interact with the CX3CR1 receptor, albeit with lower affinity, influencing the chemotaxis of various immune cells (Nakayama2010Eotaxin3CC). The gene's expression is regulated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, and it is implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Hoeck2001Activation; Shou2019CCL26).

## Structure


## Function
CCL26, also known as eotaxin-3, is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the recruitment and migration of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. It primarily functions by binding to the CCR3 receptor, which is predominantly expressed on eosinophils, facilitating their movement to sites of inflammation (Hoeck2001Activation). CCL26 is also a functional ligand for the CX3CR1 receptor, although it binds with lower affinity compared to CX3CL1, another ligand for CX3CR1. Despite this lower affinity, CCL26 can induce chemotaxis in various immune cells, including eosinophils, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and monocytes (Nakayama2010Eotaxin3CC).

In healthy human cells, CCL26 is abundantly produced by IL-4- and IL-13-stimulated vascular endothelial cells and human dermal fibroblasts, mediated by the transcription factor STAT6 (Hoeck2001Activation). It plays a role in the emigration and migration of eosinophils and other CCR3-expressing cells in Th2-shifted conditions, which are associated with allergic responses (Nakayama2010Eotaxin3CC). CCL26 is also involved in the recruitment of cells expressing CX3CR1 in conditions like atopic dermatitis, especially when CX3CL1 expression is low (Nakayama2010Eotaxin3CC).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL26 gene, also known as eotaxin-3, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving allergic and inflammatory responses. In asthma, lower DNA methylation levels in the promoter region of CCL26 are associated with increased gene expression, which correlates with asthma severity and eosinophil counts in sputum and blood (Larouche2018Methylation). CCL26 is also significantly upregulated in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), where it is the most highly induced gene, correlating with eosinophil and mast cell levels in the esophagus. This upregulation is largely driven by IL-13, which enhances CCL26 expression through STAT6-mediated pathways (Zhernov2021Molecular; Sherrill2014Genetic; Blanchard2006Eotaxin3).

In autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), CCL26 levels vary with disease stages, being upregulated in secondary progressive MS and during remission in NMOSD. This suggests a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions, potentially through its effects on blood-brain barrier integrity and inflammation (Shou2019CCL26). CCL26's involvement in these diseases highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CCL26, also known as eotaxin-3, is a chemokine that primarily interacts with the CCR3 receptor on eosinophils, playing a significant role in eosinophil chemotaxis and eosinophilia-related diseases (Domaingo2023Chemokine; Errahali2009CCL26Targeted). CCL26 exhibits a strong interaction with tenascin-C (TNC), a glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix (ECM). This interaction enhances eosinophil chemotaxis by facilitating CCL26's binding to heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan that acts as a co-receptor (Domaingo2023Chemokine). The binding affinity of CCL26 to TNC is notably higher compared to other chemokines, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.27 µM, indicating a strong and specific interaction (Domaingo2023Chemokine).

CCL26 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cell surfaces, which are crucial for its chemotactic activity. The interaction is primarily driven by electrostatic forces between the positively charged amino acids of CCL26 and the negatively charged sulfate groups of GAGs, forming an immobilized chemotactic gradient essential for leukocyte infiltration during inflammatory events (Pum2022The). Additionally, CCL26's interaction with the RNA-binding protein HuR enhances the stability of its mRNA, suggesting a role in posttranscriptional regulation (Tian2018Interleukin‐4‒induced).
