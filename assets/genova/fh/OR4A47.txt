# OR4A47

## Overview
The OR4A47 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily A member 47, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including OR4A47, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. These receptors share a common structure characterized by seven transmembrane domains, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
