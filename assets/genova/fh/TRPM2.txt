# TRPM2

## Overview
The TRPM2 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 2, a non-selective cation channel that is permeable to calcium ions. This protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family and plays a pivotal role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and apoptosis. TRPM2 is activated by ADP-ribose and is involved in various physiological processes, including calcium homeostasis, insulin secretion, immune responses, and synaptic transmission. The channel's structure is characterized by a tetrameric assembly with distinct domains, such as the C-terminal NUDT9-H domain, which is crucial for its function. TRPM2's activity is modulated by intracellular calcium and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and it interacts with several proteins, influencing cellular processes related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Due to its involvement in numerous physiological and pathological conditions, TRPM2 is considered a potential therapeutic target for diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (Malko2020TRPM2; Kühn2020StructureFunction; Belrose2018TRPM2:).

## Structure
The TRPM2 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, characterized by its permeability to calcium ions. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. Notably, the C-terminal NUDT9-H domain is involved in ADP-ribose binding, which is essential for channel gating (Wang2018Structures; Zhao2021Structural). 

The secondary structure of TRPM2 features a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly within the melastatin homology regions (MHR) 1/2 and 3/4. These regions are integral to the protein's architecture, with MHR1/2 having a beta-strand core surrounded by short alpha-helices, and MHR3/4 consisting of stacked alpha-helices (Zhao2021Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, TRPM2 exhibits a three-tiered assembly. The bottom tier includes the NUDT9-H domain and MHR1/2, the middle tier comprises the MHR4 domain and rib helix, and the top tier contains the transmembrane domain (TMD) and TRP helices (Wang2018Structures). 

The quaternary structure of TRPM2 is a tetrameric assembly, with each subunit contributing to the overall function of the channel. This assembly is stabilized by extensive intra- and inter-subunit interactions (Zhao2021Structural). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and regulation. Splice variant isoforms of TRPM2 contribute to its functional diversity, allowing for varied physiological roles (Zhao2021Structural).

## Function
The TRPM2 gene encodes a calcium-permeable, non-selective cation channel that is widely expressed in human tissues, except for bone and cartilage. It plays a crucial role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and apoptosis. The channel is activated by ADP-ribose (ADPR) and is involved in various physiological processes, including calcium homeostasis and cellular signaling pathways (Kühn2020StructureFunction; Belrose2018TRPM2:).

In healthy human cells, TRPM2 is implicated in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, contributing to glucose metabolism. It also plays a role in immune responses by promoting inflammation through cytokine production and enhancing bacterial clearance in phagocytes (Sita2018TRPM2; Belrose2018TRPM2:). In the central nervous system, TRPM2 is involved in synaptic transmission and microglial activation, affecting synaptic plasticity and memory (Sita2018TRPM2; Faouzi2014TRPM2).

TRPM2 also regulates endothelial barrier function by mediating calcium entry in response to oxidative stress, which can influence vascular permeability and integrity (Hecquet2009TRPM2). The channel's activity is modulated by intracellular calcium and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which enhance its activation (Kühn2020StructureFunction).

## Clinical Significance
The TRPM2 gene is implicated in various diseases due to its role in calcium signaling and oxidative stress response. In cancer, TRPM2 is highly expressed in several types, including neuroblastoma, breast, lung, pancreas, prostate, and leukemia. Its high expression is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, leading to worse outcomes in conditions like neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer (Lin2018TRPM2; Bao2022The). In melanoma, TRPM2 expression is elevated, contributing to disease progression and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Foster2023TRPM2).

TRPM2 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where its activation by oxidative stress leads to neuronal cell death (Malko2020TRPM2; Belrose2018TRPM2:). In cardiovascular diseases, TRPM2 is involved in endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis, contributing to conditions like ischemia/reperfusion injury and atherosclerosis (Malko2020TRPM2). In liver diseases, TRPM2 is linked to ischemia-reperfusion injury and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where its expression correlates with lipid accumulation and cell injury (Ali2021TRPM2). These findings highlight TRPM2's significance in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TRPM2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It physically associates with EFHC1, a protein linked to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. This interaction occurs at the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminus of TRPM2 and is specific, as EFHC1 does not interact with endophilin. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging studies have confirmed that TRPM2 and EFHC1 co-localize in the plasma membrane area of HEK293 cells, suggesting a functional partnership in the brain, particularly in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and ependymal cells (Katano2012The).

TRPM2 also interacts with p47 phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, under high glucose conditions. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is involved in IL-1β secretion. TRPM2-mediated calcium influx is necessary for the phosphorylation of p47 phox, linking TRPM2 to oxidative stress responses and inflammasome activation in human monocytic cells (Tseng2016TRPM2).

These interactions highlight TRPM2's role in modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, making it a potential therapeutic target for conditions like chronic inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders (Wang2018Structures).
