# OR2Y1

## Overview
The OR2Y1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily Y member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory transduction pathway. OR2Y1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants to initiate signal transduction, ultimately leading to the perception of smell (Horowitz2014Olfactory). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2Y1 has been linked to metabolic processes, with methylation patterns associated with obesity indicators such as body mass index and waist circumference, as well as dietary intakes (RamosLopez2019Associations). The gene's expression in non-chemosensory tissues suggests additional physiological roles, potentially influencing food intake and energy balance (RamosLopez2019Associations).

## Function
OR2Y1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the olfactory transduction network. OR2Y1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Horowitz2014Olfactory). 

The methylation patterns of OR2Y1 have been associated with obesity indicators such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, suggesting a link between olfactory receptor function and metabolic processes. These methylation patterns also correlate with dietary intakes, particularly total energy intake, indicating that OR2Y1 may influence food intake and energy balance (RamosLopez2019Associations). 

OR2Y1 is expressed in a small fraction of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and its expression pattern is conserved across species, including primates, suggesting a fundamental role in olfactory function (Horowitz2014Olfactory). The receptor's activity in non-chemosensory tissues also implies potential roles in various physiological and metabolic functions beyond odor detection (RamosLopez2019Associations).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2Y1 gene has been implicated in obesity-related conditions through its role in olfactory function and metabolic regulation. Studies have shown that methylation patterns in the OR2Y1 gene are associated with obesity features such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. These methylation changes correlate with dietary intakes, suggesting a potential influence on appetite regulation and predisposition to obesity (RamosLopez2019Associations). 

Research has also identified a missense variant in the OR2Y1 gene that is significantly associated with obesity, with an odds ratio of 13.6, indicating a strong link to this condition (Barbitoff2018Identification). The gene's expression in nonchemosensory tissues suggests it may play roles in broader physiological and metabolic functions, potentially affecting food intake and energy balance (RamosLopez2019Associations).

While the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, these findings highlight the clinical significance of OR2Y1 in obesity and related metabolic disorders. The gene's involvement in olfactory transduction and its potential impact on dietary behaviors underscore its importance in understanding the genetic basis of obesity (Matiashova2023The).
