# SLC9A7

## Overview
The SLC9A7 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 9 member A7, commonly referred to as NHE7, which is a member of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE) family. This protein is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and post-Golgi vesicles, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining pH homeostasis by exchanging intracellular hydrogen ions (H+) with cytoplasmic sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+) ions. NHE7 is characterized by its transmembrane structure, featuring 12 conserved membrane-spanning segments, and functions as a homodimer. It is involved in essential cellular processes such as glycosylation, endocytosis, and cell motility, with significant expression in neuronal and endocrine tissues. Mutations in the SLC9A7 gene, such as the p.Leu515Phe variant, have been linked to nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability, highlighting the gene's importance in neurodevelopmental processes (Orlowski2004Diversity; Pedersen2019The; Khayat2018A).

## Structure
The SLC9A7 protein, also known as NHE7, is a member of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger family and is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and post-Golgi vesicles. It is characterized by a common membrane topology with 12 conserved membrane-spanning segments at the N-terminus, which is typical of the Na+/H+ exchanger family (Orlowski2004Diversity). The C-terminal region of the protein is hydrophilic and faces the cytoplasm, containing sites for phosphorylation and binding of ancillary factors, indicating a regulatory function (Orlowski2004Diversity).

SLC9A7 assembles as a homodimer, a structural feature that is crucial for its function as a transporter (Khayat2018A). The protein is glycosylated at a single N-glycosylation site, which is important for its post-translational maturation and stability (Khayat2018A). The protein's structure includes a large exofacial reentrant loop between membrane segments M9 and M10, resembling the pore-loop structure in ion channels, which may be part of the ion conduction pathway (Orlowski2004Diversity).

The SLC9A7 protein is involved in regulating organellar pH, endocytosis, and cell motility, with a significant presence in neuronal and endocrine tissues (Pedersen2019The). The Leu515Phe mutation in SLC9A7 affects its glycosylation pattern and Golgi acidification, leading to impaired biosynthetic maturation and stability (Khayat2018A).

## Function
The SLC9A7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE) family, specifically known as NHE7. This protein is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in regulating the pH within the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for maintaining the acidic environment necessary for proper glycosylation and protein processing (Khayat2018A). SLC9A7 functions by exchanging intracellular H+ ions with cytoplasmic Na+ or K+ ions, thereby contributing to pH homeostasis and ion balance within cells (Orlowski2004Diversity; Khayat2018A).

In healthy human cells, SLC9A7 plays a critical role in the glycosylation of proteins, a process essential for various cellular functions, including neural development and synaptic vesicle trafficking (Khayat2018A). The protein's activity in the Golgi apparatus is vital for the maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides and the glycosylation of secretory membrane glycoproteins, impacting cell-cell adhesion and synapse formation (Khayat2018A). SLC9A7 is ubiquitously expressed, with significant expression in neuronal and endocrine tissues, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and neurological functions (Pedersen2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC9A7 gene, specifically the recurrent missense variant p.Leu515Phe (L515F), are associated with nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability. This variant has been identified in multiple families and is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, speech delay, and hypotonia in affected males (Khayat2018A). The L515F mutation leads to a gain-of-function effect, causing alkalinization of the trans-Golgi network and post-Golgi compartments, which disrupts normal glycosylation processes (Khayat2018A). This disruption in glycosylation is crucial as it affects neural precursor cell migration, cell adhesion, and synapse formation, contributing to the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in individuals with the mutation (Khayat2018A).

The mutation does not significantly affect protein stability or membrane trafficking but results in reduced N-linked complex glycosylation and altered Golgi pH (Khayat2018A). This impaired glycosylation is evidenced by an abnormal N-glycosylation profile of serum transferrin in affected individuals, indicating a glycosylation disorder (Khayat2018A). The findings suggest that proper Golgi acidification is critical for the complex glycosylation of SLC9A7 and other secretory cargo, and mutations in SLC9A7 can lead to intellectual disability and glycosylation disorders (Khayat2018A).

## Interactions
The SLC9A7 gene encodes the NHE7 protein, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and localization. NHE7 is known to bind with several cytosolic proteins, including SCAMPS, calmodulin, caveolin, CD44, and GLUT1. These interactions are crucial for vesicle trafficking and other cellular processes (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Fuster2013Traditional). The C-terminal region of NHE7 is responsible for its localization to the trans-Golgi network, and it is partially localized to lipid rafts where it associates with caveolin (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

NHE7 is also involved in interactions with RACK1, a protein that influences its trafficking between the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Pedersen2019The). This interaction is significant for the regulation of NHE7's cellular localization and function. Despite these known interactions, the physiological relevance of NHE7 remains poorly defined, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in cellular processes (Fuster2013Traditional).
