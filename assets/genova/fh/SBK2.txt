# SBK2

## Overview
The SBK2 gene encodes the protein SH3 domain binding kinase family member 2, which is part of the kinase family. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of cellular activities. The SBK2 gene is involved in encoding a protein that interacts with other cellular components to influence pathways critical for cell function and development. Although specific details about the structure, function, and interactions of the SBK2 gene and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, ongoing research continues to explore its potential roles in cellular mechanisms and its implications in health and disease.
