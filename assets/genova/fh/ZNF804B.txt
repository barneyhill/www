# ZNF804B

## Overview
ZNF804B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 804B, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and are often involved in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 804B is implicated in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and signal transduction pathways. Although the specific functions of ZNF804B are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in the regulation of genes involved in neural development and function. Research into ZNF804B has also suggested potential links to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding the genetic basis of these conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
