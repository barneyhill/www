# GREP1

## Overview
GREP1, or glycine-rich extracellular protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by its abundance of glycine residues and its localization in the extracellular matrix. The GREP1 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the structural and signaling functions of the extracellular matrix. It interacts with key extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and EMILIN2, suggesting a role in maintaining extracellular matrix integrity and influencing cell-matrix interactions (Prensner2020Noncanonical). Additionally, GREP1 has been linked to the regulation of secreted proteins like the metabolic cytokine GDF15, which is involved in cancer cell survival. The gene's expression is notably altered in several cancer types, including breast cancer and gliomas, where it is associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Prensner2020Noncanonical; Petralia2020TBIO19.). As such, GREP1 is considered a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in oncology.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
GREP1 (Glycine-Rich Extracellular Protein-1) has been identified as a significant factor in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer and gliomas. Alterations in GREP1 expression are associated with cancer cell survival and progression. In breast cancer, GREP1 is highly expressed, and its knockout leads to a significant loss of viability in cancer cell lines, correlating with decreased patient survival (Prensner2020Noncanonical). This suggests that GREP1 may serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.

In gliomas and other cancer types, GREP1 expression is also elevated. Knockout of GREP1 in over 200 cancer cell lines, including glioblastoma, results in reduced cell viability and cell cycle arrest (Petralia2020TBIO19.; Prensner2020TBIO26.). The interaction between GREP1 and the oncogenic cytokine GDF15 is crucial, as GREP1 knockout decreases GDF15 levels, while its overexpression increases them. Supplementation with GDF15 can partially rescue the growth inhibitory effects of GREP1 knockout, indicating a functional relationship between these proteins in cancer cell survival (Prensner2020Noncanonical). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GREP1 in cancer and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
GREP1 (glycine-rich extracellular protein 1) is known to participate in physical interactions with other proteins, particularly those associated with the extracellular matrix. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses have shown that GREP1 is strongly associated with extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and EMILIN2 (Prensner2020Noncanonical). These interactions suggest that GREP1 may play a role in the structural or signaling functions of the extracellular matrix.

The study of GREP1 also revealed its impact on the expression of other secreted proteins. Notably, GREP1 knockout resulted in decreased levels of the metabolic cytokine GDF15, while overexpression of GREP1 increased GDF15 levels. This correlation was observed across multiple tumor types, indicating a functional interaction between GREP1 and GDF15 that influences cancer cell survival (Prensner2020Noncanonical). Recombinant GDF15 was able to partially rescue the loss of cell viability caused by GREP1 knockout, further supporting the interaction between these proteins (Prensner2020Noncanonical).

While these findings highlight significant interactions involving GREP1, specific details on its interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond those mentioned are not provided in the available context.
