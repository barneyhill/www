# COX8A

## Overview
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8A (COX8A) is a gene that encodes a protein component of Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the function of Complex IV, which serves as the terminal enzyme in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a critical step in cellular respiration and energy production. COX8A is categorized as a transmembrane protein, as it is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial energy production and cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the COX8A gene have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunctions, such as Leigh-like syndrome, underscoring its importance in normal mitochondrial and cellular function (Shao2020Insitu; Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

## Function
COX8A encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8A, a component of Complex IV in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This complex is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which is a critical step in cellular respiration. The activity of COX8A contributes to the establishment of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Shao2020Insitu; Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

COX8A is encoded by nuclear DNA and is involved in the structural assembly and regulation of Complex IV. It plays a role in maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial energy production, which is vital for various cellular processes, including metabolism and apoptosis (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial). The protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the overall function of the electron transport chain, ensuring effective energy conversion and cellular homeostasis (Shao2020Insitu).

Mutations in COX8A have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions, such as Leigh-like syndrome, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal mitochondrial and cellular function (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX8A gene are associated with severe clinical conditions, most notably Leigh-like syndrome and epilepsy. A specific splice site mutation, c.115-1G>C, leads to aberrant splicing and a significant reduction in functional COX8A transcript levels. This mutation results in a severe deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity, reducing it to about 5-10% of normal levels in muscle and fibroblasts (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome; Hallmann2015Loss). The deficiency in COX activity is linked to symptoms such as primary pulmonary hypertension, microcephaly, developmental delay, drug-resistant epilepsy, and non-ambulatory spasticity (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome).

The mutation disrupts the regular splice site, causing a frame shift and likely resulting in a non-functional protein. This leads to a marked reduction in the fully assembled COX complex, impairing its stability and activity (Hallmann2015Loss). The study of a patient with this mutation confirmed the critical role of COX8A in maintaining COX complex function, as the expression of wild-type COX8A in patient fibroblasts significantly increased COX activity (Hallmann2015Loss). Despite the mutation, no compensatory changes in COX8C transcript levels were observed (Hallmann2015Loss).

## Interactions
COX8A, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), is involved in various interactions within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It consistently interacts with other COX subunit genes, indicating possible physical interactions at the genomic level. This was demonstrated using chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, which showed that COX8A interacts with each of the remaining nine nucleus-encoded COX subunit genes, suggesting a coordinated transcriptional regulation (Dhar2009Chromosome).

The study also found that COX8A interacts with mitochondrial transcription factors such as Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m, as cross-linked products were consistently detected, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation (Dhar2009Chromosome). Additionally, COX8A is part of a module with other subunits like COX5B, COX6C, and COX7C, which requires several assembly factors for its formation (Cerqua2018COX16).

Mutations in COX8A have been associated with mitochondrial pathologies, affecting the stability of the COX enzyme rather than its biogenesis, as the mutation does not lead to the accumulation of COX assembly intermediates (Čunátová2020Role). This highlights the importance of COX8A in maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme complex.
