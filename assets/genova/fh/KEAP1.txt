# KEAP1

## Overview
KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. The KEAP1 protein functions primarily as a substrate adaptor for a Cullin-3 (Cul3)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets the transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation under non-stress conditions. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by preventing the unnecessary activation of antioxidant response elements (ARE)-driven genes. Structurally, KEAP1 is characterized by several domains, including the BTB domain, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with NRF2, and the Kelch domain, which binds to the Neh2 domain of NRF2. KEAP1 also acts as a sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stress, undergoing conformational changes that inhibit NRF2 ubiquitination, thereby allowing NRF2 to activate protective genes. Mutations in the KEAP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, where they contribute to increased NRF2 activity and cancer cell survival (Kobayashi2004Oxidative; Zhang2004Keap1; Zhang2003Distinct).

## Structure
The KEAP1 protein is a polypeptide chain composed of approximately 625 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 70 kDa, primarily located in the cytoplasm (Song2024Posttranslational). Its structure includes five distinct domains: the N-terminal region (NTR), the BTB domain, the intervening region (IVR), the double-glycine repeat (DGR, Kelch) domain, and the C-terminal region (CTR) (Kopacz2020Beyond). The BTB domain, spanning amino acids 50-179, is involved in homodimerization and interactions with the Cullin-3-Rbx-1-E3 ligase complex, and it senses electrophilic compounds through a reactive cysteine residue (C151) (Kopacz2020Beyond). The Kelch domain, consisting of amino acids 327-611, forms a six-bladed β-propeller structure, enabling interactions with diverse proteins, including Nrf2 (Zhang2003Distinct; Kopacz2020Beyond).

KEAP1 contains 27 cysteine residues, which are crucial for its function, particularly in redox reactions and interactions with electrophile compounds (Kopacz2020Beyond). Post-translational modifications, such as S-sulfhydration and alkylation, can disrupt KEAP1's interaction with Nrf2, allowing Nrf2 to activate antioxidant response genes (Song2024Posttranslational). Alternative splicing of the KEAP1 gene results in different isoforms, including a 444 amino acid long isoform lacking the DGR domain (Kopacz2020Beyond).

## Function
KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) is a crucial regulatory protein involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by modulating the activity of the transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2). In healthy human cells, KEAP1 functions as a substrate adaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets NRF2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process ensures that NRF2 levels remain low under non-stress conditions, preventing unnecessary activation of antioxidant response elements (ARE)-driven genes (Kobayashi2004Oxidative; Zhang2004Keap1).

KEAP1 achieves this regulation by binding to the N-terminal Neh2 domain of NRF2, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and facilitating its degradation (Itoh1999Keap1; Zhang2003Distinct). The protein contains several domains, including the BTB domain, which is involved in dimerization and interaction with NRF2, and the Kelch domain, which binds to the Neh2 domain of NRF2 (DinkovaKostova2005The). KEAP1 also acts as a sensor for oxidative stress; upon exposure to oxidative or electrophilic stress, KEAP1 undergoes conformational changes that inhibit NRF2 ubiquitination, allowing NRF2 to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus to activate protective genes (Zhang2004Keap1; Zhang2003Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KEAP1 gene are clinically significant in several diseases, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These mutations lead to the dysregulation of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, resulting in increased NRF2 activity, which promotes cancer cell survival and resistance to therapy (Singh2006Dysfunctional). In NSCLC, KEAP1 mutations are associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced progression-free and overall survival, especially in lung adenocarcinoma (Nadal2019Mutations; Goeman2019Mutations). These mutations contribute to resistance against conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and are linked to immune evasion (Nadal2019Mutations).

In addition to lung cancer, KEAP1 mutations have been implicated in other cancers, such as breast and endometrial cancer, where specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KEAP1 are associated with disease progression and patient survival (Dhamodharan2018Association). The mutations in KEAP1 can lead to the constitutive activation of NRF2, which upregulates cytoprotective genes, including those involved in drug resistance, thereby providing a selective advantage for cancer progression (Ohta2008Loss). These findings underscore the potential of KEAP1 mutations as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in various cancers.

## Interactions
KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) is a regulatory protein that interacts with various substrates, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses. Its primary interaction is with the transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), which it regulates through ubiquitination and degradation. KEAP1 binds to NRF2 via two motifs in the Neh2 domain of NRF2: the high-affinity ETGE motif and the lower-affinity DLG motif. These interactions are essential for controlling NRF2 stability and its ubiquitination, which is a key mechanism in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis (Tong2006Keap1; Lo2006Structure).

KEAP1 forms a homodimer and acts as a substrate adaptor for the Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination of NRF2. The Kelch domain of KEAP1, with its six-bladed β-propeller structure, binds substrates through a small, shallow pocket subdivided into six subpockets, which accommodate the negatively charged residues of NRF2 (Zhang2020Emerging).

Beyond NRF2, KEAP1 interacts with several noncanonical substrates, including p62/SQSTM1, IKKβ, PGAM5, PALB2, and MCM3. These interactions lead to diverse cellular outcomes, such as the degradation of PGAM5 and IKKβ, and modulation of PALB2's interaction with BRCA1, affecting homologous recombination repair (Zhang2020Emerging).
