# TXNDC15

## Overview
TXNDC15 is a gene that encodes the protein thioredoxin domain containing 15, also known as TMX5, which is a member of the thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein family and part of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily. This protein is characterized as a single-span type I transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in the formation of mixed disulfides with endogenous polypeptides, facilitated by its unique CRFS active site. TMX5 is involved in the ER-to-Golgi cycling of proteins, interacting with other PDI family members such as ERp44, which is essential for its localization in pre-Golgi compartments. The protein's function and interactions suggest its involvement in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular localization. Mutations in TXNDC15 have been implicated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome, a ciliopathy, and have also been associated with protective effects against lung cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2021Rare; Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15; Breslow2017A).

## Structure
The TXNDC15 protein, also known as TMX5, is a member of the thioredoxin-related transmembrane (TMX) protein family and part of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily. It is a single-span type I transmembrane protein composed of 360 amino acids. The protein features a large luminal domain that is hexa-glycosylated and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Notably, it lacks canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).

The primary structure of TXNDC15 includes five cysteine residues, with a noncanonical CRFS active site at cysteine 220, which is crucial for its function as a natural trapping mutant protein. This active site allows TXNDC15 to form mixed disulfides with endogenous proteins (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15). The protein's secondary structure likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of thioredoxin family proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

TXNDC15 interacts with other proteins, such as ERp44, through covalent and non-covalent interactions, which are significant for its ER localization. The association with ERp44 involves the formation of mixed disulfides, particularly between cysteine residues 114 and/or 124 of TXNDC15 and cysteine 29 of ERp44 (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15). The protein's glycosylation status indicates its trafficking between the ER and Golgi compartments, with some portions undergoing complex glycosylation in the Golgi (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).

## Function
TMX5, also known as TXNDC15, is a member of the thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein family, which is part of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily. It is involved in the formation of mixed disulfides with endogenous polypeptides, facilitated by its unconventional CRFS active site. This allows TMX5 to engage in disulfide bonds with various proteins, particularly Golgi-resident polypeptides, without the need for mutation (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).

TMX5 is a single-span type I protein with a large luminal domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. It lacks canonical ER retention signals, suggesting it may traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments. TMX5 interacts with other PDI family members, such as ERp57, PDI, and ERp44, through its non-catalytic cysteine residues. The interaction with ERp44 is crucial for the ER localization of TMX5 in pre-Golgi compartments (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).

The protein is involved in the ER-to-Golgi cycling of proteins lacking ER retention motifs, and its glycosylation status indicates that a portion of it reaches the medial Golgi complex. TMX5's physiological role is still under investigation, but it is thought to play a role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular localization in healthy human cells (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TXNDC15 gene have been linked to Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective ciliogenesis. The gene encodes a thioredoxin domain-containing transmembrane protein, and its knockout has been shown to cause defects in Hedgehog signaling, which can be rescued by introducing wildtype TXNDC15. The mutant allele found in MKS patients behaves like a null allele, suggesting TXNDC15 as a novel MKS gene. Cilia in TXNDC15 knockout cells exhibit increased variability in length and decreased levels of the ciliary GTPase ARL13B, indicating a potential role in ciliopathies (Hartill2017Meckel–Gruber; Breslow2017A).

In the context of cancer, rare deleterious variants in TXNDC15 have been associated with a protective effect against lung cancer. A specific variant, p.E9G fs*68del, was found to interact with family history of lung cancer, suggesting a potential protective role in individuals with such a history (Liu2021Rare). Additionally, genomic studies have identified deletions in the TXNDC15 gene in small cell lung cancer, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Du2018Genomic).

## Interactions
TXNDC15, also known as TMX5, is a member of the thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein family and interacts with several proteins within the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily. It forms covalent and non-covalent associations with PDI family members such as ERp57, PDI, and ERp44. The interaction with ERp44 is particularly significant, involving the formation of a mixed disulfide bond between the catalytic cysteine residue 29 of ERp44 and the non-catalytic cysteine residues 114 and/or 124 of TMX5. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of TMX5 in pre-Golgi compartments (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).

TMX5 also engages with secretory proteins, mainly Golgi-resident polypeptides, through its active site cysteine residue at position 220. Mutation of this active site cysteine reduces TMX5's engagement with endogenous proteins in mixed disulfides but does not affect its association with PDI, ERp57, and ERp44 (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15). These interactions suggest that TMX5 plays a role in the ER-to-Golgi cycling of proteins and may influence the release of its client proteins through interactions with oxidoreductases like PDI and ERp57 (Soldà2024TMX5TXNDC15).
