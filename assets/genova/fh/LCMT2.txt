# LCMT2

## Overview
Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 2 (LCMT2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 2, which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through methylation. This enzyme specifically targets the carboxyl group of leucine residues, playing a crucial role in amino acid metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids like leucine, which are vital for glutamate synthesis (Jensen2020Homoarginine). LCMT2 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences protein interactions, stability, and localization, thereby affecting cellular processes and organismal development (Jensen2020Homoarginine). The gene has been implicated in colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability, where frameshift mutations may disrupt normal DNA methylation processes, contributing to tumorigenesis (Yeon2017Frameshift). Understanding the structure, function, and clinical significance of LCMT2 is essential for elucidating its role in cellular metabolism and disease.

## Structure
LCMT2 (leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 2) is an enzyme characterized by its primary structure, which consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure of LCMT2 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of LCMT2 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This folding allows LCMT2 to form specific domains that are crucial for its function in protein methylation.

LCMT2 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications can play a significant role in regulating the enzyme's function and stability. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of LCMT2 may exist, leading to variations in its structure and potentially altering its enzymatic properties. These isoforms can result in differences in the protein's function and its role in cellular processes. The presence of these structural features and modifications highlights the complexity and versatility of LCMT2 in its biological roles.

## Function
LCMT2 (leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 2) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through methylation. This enzyme specifically methylates the carboxyl group of leucine residues, forming alpha-leucine ester residues. This modification is significant in the context of amino acid metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids like leucine, which are crucial for glutamate synthesis (Jensen2020Homoarginine).

LCMT2 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in regulating protein function and signaling pathways. By adding methyl groups to specific amino acids, LCMT2 influences protein interactions, stability, and localization, thereby affecting cellular processes and organismal development. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and metabolic balance (Jensen2020Homoarginine).

In studies involving AGAT-deficient mice, LCMT2 was identified as a gene with altered expression, highlighting its involvement in amino acid metabolism. However, its expression was not normalized by creatine or homoarginine supplementation, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism that is not solely dependent on these metabolites (Jensen2020Homoarginine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LCMT2 gene have been implicated in colorectal cancers (CRCs), particularly those with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). A study by Yeon et al. identified frameshift mutations in the LCMT2 gene in 2.5% of MSI-H CRC cases, specifically noting a c.1356delT (p.Phe452LeufsX11) mutation in exon 1. These mutations were somatic and heterozygous, indicating their occurrence in tumor cells rather than inherited germline mutations (Yeon2017Frameshift). The study did not find these mutations in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs, suggesting a specific association with MSI-H CRCs (Yeon2017Frameshift).

The presence of frameshift mutations in LCMT2 and other methyltransferase genes may contribute to cancer development by disrupting normal DNA methylation processes, which are crucial for regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. Although the study did not establish a direct link between LCMT2 mutations and specific clinical outcomes, it highlights the potential role of these genetic alterations in tumorigenesis through gene inactivation (Yeon2017Frameshift). The research underscores the importance of understanding intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer evolution and its implications for clinical treatment strategies.
