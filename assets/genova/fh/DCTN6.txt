# DCTN6

## Overview
DCTN6 is a gene that encodes the protein dynactin subunit 6, a critical component of the dynactin complex. This complex is integral to intracellular transport processes, functioning as an activator of the cytoplasmic dynein motor protein. Dynactin subunit 6 is part of the pointed-end subcomplex, which is involved in the selective targeting and movement of endomembrane cargo, such as early and recycling endosomes. The protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular organization and facilitating processes like mitosis and endocytosis. DCTN6's interactions with other proteins, including Reticulon 3 and viral proteins, underscore its importance in both cellular function and disease contexts, such as neurodegeneration and cancer (Sharoar2021Dynactin; Hammesfahr2012Evolution; Borca2019Structural).

## Function
DCTN6, also known as dynactin subunit 6, is a component of the dynactin complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport by acting as an activator of the cytoplasmic dynein motor protein. This complex is essential for various cellular processes, including vesicle transport, organelle positioning, and cell division (Hammesfahr2012Evolution). DCTN6 is part of the pointed-end subcomplex of dynactin, which includes other subunits like DCTN4, DCTN5, and Arp11. This subcomplex is involved in the selective targeting of endomembrane cargo, facilitating the movement of early and recycling endosomes (Yeh2012Dynactin’s; Borca2019Structural).

In healthy human cells, DCTN6 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the structural integrity and function of the dynactin complex. It is involved in processes such as mitosis, endocytosis, and maintaining cellular organization (Hammesfahr2012Evolution). The interaction between DCTN6 and other dynactin subunits is crucial for the complex's ability to bind to subcellular structures and facilitate dynein-dependent motility (Yeh2012Dynactin’s). This interaction is vital for the proper functioning of cellular transport mechanisms, impacting overall cellular health and function.

## Clinical Significance
DCTN6 (dynactin subunit 6) is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in intracellular transport and its interactions within the dynactin complex. Alterations in DCTN6 expression have been linked to neurodegenerative conditions. In mouse models, DCTN6 deficiency is associated with increased levels of RTN3 protein and the formation of reticulon 3-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites (RIDNs), which are linked to aging and potentially neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (Sharoar2021Dynactin).

In the context of cancer, DCTN6 expression levels have prognostic significance. In low-grade glioma (LGG), high expression of DCTN6 is associated with favorable overall survival, suggesting a protective role (Su2021Study). Conversely, in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), DCTN6 is often downregulated, and its altered expression is linked to poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Ullah2022A). The gene's hypomethylation in LIHC tissues correlates with higher mRNA expression levels, which may contribute to its differential expression and impact on cancer progression (Ullah2022A).

## Interactions
DCTN6, also known as dynactin subunit 6, is a component of the dynactin complex, which plays a crucial role in dynein-mediated intracellular transport. DCTN6 interacts with several proteins, forming part of the dynactin complex essential for microtubule-based cytoplasmic dynein motor activity. This interaction facilitates the transport of various cellular cargos along microtubules (Borca2019Structural).

DCTN6 has been shown to interact specifically with the N-terminal domain of Reticulon 3 (RTN3), a protein involved in axonal transport. This interaction is crucial for dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport, and its deficiency can lead to impaired retrograde trafficking and increased RTN3 aggregation in neurons (Sharoar2021Dynactin). In the context of aging and neurodegeneration, DCTN6 deficiency enhances the formation of RTN3-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites (RIDNs) in mouse brains, indicating its role in maintaining neuronal function (Sharoar2021Dynactin).

DCTN6 also interacts with the structural glycoprotein E2 of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) during the virus's infectious cycle. This interaction is significant for the virus's replication and virulence, as disrupting it leads to reduced virus replication and attenuated virulence in vivo (Borca2019Structural).
