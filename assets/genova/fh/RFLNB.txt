# RFLNB

## Overview
The RFLNB gene encodes the protein refilin B, a small hydrophilic protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in vertebrates. Refilin B is characterized by its intrinsically unstructured nature and short half-life, which is stabilized through interactions with filamin proteins. This stabilization is essential for maintaining the appropriate stoichiometry with physiological targets, influencing cellular processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chondroprogenitor differentiation through TGF-β signaling pathways (Baudier2018The). The protein's interaction with filamin is vital for promoting the formation of large actin superstructures and stabilizing actin filaments, thereby contributing to the spatiotemporal regulation of mechanosensory functions (Baudier2018The). Refilin B's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in normal skeletal development and growth, as well as its potential implications in various diseases, including pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and sarcoma (Ulukaya2021Single; Wen2022Novel).

## Structure
Refilin B (RFLNB) is a small hydrophilic protein composed of 214 amino acids, sharing over 70% amino acid identity with refilin A (Baudier2018The). The protein is characterized by two conserved domains: an N-terminal domain that functions as a dimerization interface and a C-terminal domain containing filamin-binding sites (Baudier2018The). The N-terminal domain, spanning residues 10-66, also contains degradation signals (Baudier2018The).

Refilin B is intrinsically unstructured, with nearly 50% of its residues being unstructured and lacking predicted α-helical domains, as revealed by PSI-blast-based secondary structure prediction (Baudier2018The). This unstructured nature contributes to its short half-life, which is influenced by degradation motifs such as a PEST sequence and a phosphodegron motif (Baudier2018The).

The protein's interaction with filamin is crucial for its stability and function. When bound to filamin, refilin B's stability is enhanced, preventing rapid degradation (Baudier2018The). The binding involves four potential filamin-binding domains (BD1-BD4) on the refilin monomer, with BD2 and BD4 being essential for actin-bundling activity (Baudier2018The).

## Function
The RFLNB gene encodes the protein refilin-B, which plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in vertebrates. Refilin-B is involved in modulating the function of filamin proteins, which are crucial for maintaining the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is intrinsically unstructured and has a short half-life, but it can be stabilized through interactions with filamin proteins, which is essential for maintaining the appropriate stoichiometry with physiological targets (Baudier2018The).

Refilin-B interacts with filamin to influence the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton, promoting the formation of large actin superstructures and stabilizing actin filaments. This interaction is crucial for the spatiotemporal regulation of mechanosensory functions, affecting cellular processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chondroprogenitor differentiation through TGF-β signaling pathways (Baudier2018The).

In healthy human cells, refilin-B is involved in integrating the mechanosensory functions of filamin, particularly in the context of TGF-β signaling, which is crucial for normal skeletal development and growth (Baudier2018The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas associated with cell movement and structural integrity.

## Clinical Significance
RFLNB (refilin B) has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RFLNB is overexpressed in relapse-associated cell clusters, correlating with poor overall survival and shorter event-free survival. This overexpression is linked to pathways associated with chemoresistance and poor survival outcomes, such as RhoGDI signaling (Ulukaya2021Single). 

In sarcoma, high expression levels of RFLNB are part of a gene signature that categorizes patients into high-risk groups, associated with higher mortality and shorter survival times. This gene signature is used as an independent prognostic factor for sarcoma patients (Wen2022Novel).

RFLNB is also included in a gene signature for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), although it did not show variations in the samples analyzed. This signature is used to classify metastatic potential, with RFLNB being part of the network that includes other genes, lncRNAs, and miRNAs (Farias2023Machine).

In the context of split-hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency (SHFLD), RFLNB is part of a genomic rearrangement, although its specific role in limb malformations remains unclear (Shen201817p13.3).

## Interactions
Refilin B (RFLNB) is known for its interactions with filamin proteins, particularly filamin B (FLNB), which are crucial for actin-cytoskeleton dynamics. RFLNB binds to filamin, stabilizing it and promoting the formation of actin bundles. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal domain of RFLNB, which contains multiple filamin-binding domains (BD1-BD4) that are essential for its actin-bundling activity (Baudier2018The). The binding of RFLNB to filamin can lock filamin into an open conformation, exposing cryptic F-actin-binding domains necessary for high-avidity F-actin binding, which enhances the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Baudier2018The).

RFLNB also plays a role in TGF-β signaling pathways. It competes with Smad2 and Smad3 for binding to the IgFLN21 domain of FLNB, releasing these Smad proteins into the cytoplasm where they can be phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (Baudier2018The). This interaction is significant for cell fate decisions during processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chondroprogenitor differentiation (Baudier2018The). The absence of RFLNB affects actin-bundling and cell junction dissolution, impacting cell transitions and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins (Baudier2018The).
