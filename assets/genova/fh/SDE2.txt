# SDE2

## Overview
SDE2 is a gene that encodes the SDE2 telomere maintenance homolog, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and RNA processing. The SDE2 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, a central intrinsically disordered region, and a C-terminal SAP domain, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and other proteins (Weinheimer2022Extended; Floro2021SDE2). Functionally, SDE2 is integral to maintaining DNA replication fork integrity and genome stability, interacting with key components of the replication machinery such as the fork protection complex and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Jo2016PCNADependent; Rageul2020SDE2). Additionally, SDE2 plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and alternative splicing, processes essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (Floro2021SDE2). Dysregulation of SDE2 has been implicated in genomic instability and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in disease contexts (Luo2020Proteome).

## Structure
The SDE2 protein is composed of 451 amino acids and features several distinct structural domains. It contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a central intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and a C-terminal SAP domain (Weinheimer2022Extended; Floro2021SDE2). The UBL domain is cleaved in response to DNA damage, which may generate fragments involved in RNA processing (Floro2021SDE2). The SAP domain is characterized by a helix-extended loop-helix motif, which is crucial for DNA binding, particularly at DNA replication forks (Weinheimer2022Extended). This domain includes a unique C-terminal tail (CTT) that enhances DNA binding affinity through interactions with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Weinheimer2022Extended).

The SAP domain's structure is composed of three primary helices, with helices 2 and 3 forming the classic SAP motif. The DNA binding residues are primarily located in the interhelical loop (Weinheimer2022Extended). The CTT contains positively charged residues, such as lysine 444 and 447, which further stabilize DNA interactions (Weinheimer2022Extended). The protein's structure was determined using NMR spectroscopy, revealing a helix-extended loop-helix core consistent with canonical SAP folds (Weinheimer2022Extended). SDE2 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and stability (Floro2021SDE2).

## Function
The SDE2 gene encodes a protein that is essential for several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and the regulation of alternative splicing, which are vital for proper gene expression and cellular function. SDE2 is involved in rRNA processing, a necessary step in ribosome maturation, and its loss leads to defects in translation and cell viability (Floro2021SDE2). The protein interacts with the U2 snRNP complex, influencing pre-mRNA splicing and defining splice site boundaries, particularly for introns with high GC content and weak splice sites (Floro2021SDE2).

SDE2 is also crucial for maintaining DNA replication fork integrity. It interacts with the fork protection complex (FPC) component TIMELESS, stabilizing its localization to replication forks and protecting stalled forks from degradation. This interaction is vital for efficient DNA replication and genome stability (Rageul2020SDE2). The protein contains a SAP domain that binds single-stranded DNA at replication forks, contributing to its role in the replication stress response (Weinheimer2022Extended). SDE2's functions in these processes are essential for maintaining cellular viability and preventing genomic instability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SDE2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those related to genomic instability and cancer. SDE2 is essential for ribosome biogenesis and the regulation of alternative splicing, and its depletion can lead to cell death in organisms such as C. elegans and Bos taurus taurus. This suggests that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SDE2 could potentially be linked to human diseases, although this is not yet confirmed (Floro2021SDE2). 

In the context of cancer, SDE2 plays a critical role in the DNA damage response and replication stress. Its dysregulation is associated with increased genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer progression. For instance, in prostate cancer cells, SDE2 is involved in regulating PCNA monoubiquitination, a process that promotes error-prone DNA repair pathways. Downregulation of SDE2 in prostate cancer is linked to poorer patient outcomes, suggesting its protective role against hypoxia-mediated DNA damage responses (Luo2020Proteome). 

Furthermore, SDE2's involvement in ribosome biogenesis and alternative splicing suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to ribosomopathies, such as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, where a significant percentage of cases have no known genetic cause (Floro2021SDE2).

## Interactions
SDE2 is a protein that plays a significant role in DNA replication and repair processes through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is associated with the replication fork protection complex (FPC) by directly interacting with the C-terminus of the TIMELESS (TIM) protein, which is crucial for stabilizing TIM and ensuring its proper localization at replication forks. This interaction is essential for maintaining replication fork integrity and progression (Lo2020Roles; Rageul2020SDE2).

SDE2 also interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA clamp that regulates DNA replication and repair. This interaction is necessary for the PCNA-dependent cleavage and degradation of SDE2, which is crucial for the response to replication stress (Jo2016PCNADependent). Additionally, SDE2 is involved in the Arg/N-end rule pathway, where its C-terminal fragment is targeted for degradation by ubiquitin ligases UBR1 and UBR2, highlighting its role in proteolytic pathways (Rageul2019Conditional).

SDE2's interaction with the p97 UFD1-NPL4 complex is also significant, as it facilitates the degradation of SDE2 in response to DNA damage, thereby contributing to replication fork recovery and DNA damage bypass (Rageul2019Conditional).
