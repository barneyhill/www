The encoded protein interacts with and stabilizes the GTPase activating protein tuberin. This hamartin-tuberin complex negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling which is a major regulator of anabolic cell growth. This protein also functions as a co-chaperone for Hsp90 that inhibits its ATPase activity. This protein functions as a facilitator of Hsp90-mediated folding of kinase and non-kinase clients, including TSC2 and thereby preventing their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mutations in this gene have been associated with tuberous sclerosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
