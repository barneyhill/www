# ANKRD45

## Overview
ANKRD45 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 45 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 45 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific functions of ANKRD45 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, the protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein due to its localization within the cell. Research into ANKRD45 has indicated potential involvement in signaling pathways and cellular regulatory mechanisms, although further studies are required to elucidate its precise biological roles and implications in health and disease.
