# AKR1C1

## Overview
The AKR1C1 gene encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1, which is a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones, functioning as a 3-ketosteroid reductase. It plays a critical role in the reduction of potent steroid hormones to their less active forms, thereby regulating hormonal balance and activity within the body (Rižner2014Role; PENNING2000Human). The AKR1C1 protein is characterized by a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, known as a TIM-barrel, which is typical of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (ElKabbani2010Structurebased; Rižner2014Role). This cytosolic enzyme is expressed in various human tissues and is involved in processes such as endometrial development and neuroprotection (ElKabbani2010Structurebased). Additionally, AKR1C1 has been implicated in cancer progression and cellular stress responses through its interactions with other proteins, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chang2021AKR1C1).

## Structure
The AKR1C1 protein is characterized by a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, also known as a TIM-barrel, which is a common feature in the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (ElKabbani2010Structurebased; Rižner2014Role). This structure consists of a cylindrical core of eight β-strands surrounded by eight α-helices, forming a β-barrel (Rižner2014Role). The active site is located at the C-terminal end of the barrel, where the cofactor NADP+ binds in an extended conformation (ElKabbani2011Inhibitors). The enzyme's catalytic tetrad, consisting of Asp50, Tyr55, Lys84, and His117, is situated at the base of the barrel, forming an oxyanion pocket that interacts with the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor (ElKabbani2010Structurebased; Rižner2014Role).

The inhibitor-binding pocket of AKR1C1 is lined by side chains from eleven amino acid residues, including Tyr24, Leu54, Tyr55, and His117, among others (ElKabbani2011Inhibitors). Specific leucine residues, such as Leu308, play a significant role in inhibitor binding and selectivity (ElKabbani2010Structurebased). The enzyme is cytosolic and primarily acts as a reductase in vivo, with a preference for NADPH as a cofactor (Rižner2014Role). AKR1C1 is expressed in various human tissues and is involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones, impacting processes like endometrial development and neuroprotection (ElKabbani2010Structurebased).

## Function
The AKR1C1 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldo-keto reductase family, playing a crucial role in human steroid metabolism. This enzyme functions primarily as a 3-ketosteroid reductase, catalyzing the reduction of potent steroid hormones into their less active forms, thereby regulating their activity and maintaining hormonal balance in healthy cells (Rižner2014Role; PENNING2000Human). AKR1C1 is involved in the inactivation of progesterone to 20α-hydroxy-pregn-4-ene-3-one and the reduction of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) to 3β-androstanediol (3β-Diol), a potent agonist of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) (Rižner2014Role).

In the brain, AKR1C1 inactivates the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, which modulates the GABA A receptor and acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, impacting neuroreceptor modulation (Rižner2014Role). The enzyme is also active in the liver, where it contributes to the metabolism of circulating testosterone and other steroids, converting them into less active forms to prevent excess hormonal activity (PENNING2000Human). AKR1C1's activity is significant in estrogen-sensitive tissues and androgen target tissues, where it influences processes such as cell apoptosis and proliferation (Rižner2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AKR1C1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In bladder cancer, increased AKR1C1 expression is associated with enhanced invasiveness and drug resistance, particularly to cisplatin. This resistance can be mitigated by using AKR1C inhibitors, such as flufenamic acid, which increase sensitivity to chemotherapy (Matsumoto2016Aldoketo). AKR1C1 is also upregulated in metastatic bladder cancer lesions, suggesting its role in metastasis and therapy resistance (Matsumoto2016Aldoketo).

In endometrial cancer, AKR1C1 is involved in the metabolism of progesterone and estrogen, with its upregulation potentially contributing to altered hormone levels that favor cancer progression (Rižner2006AKR1C1). The gene's expression is higher in the secretory phase of the endometrium and may be linked to uterine diseases, including endometriosis and endometrial cancer, by affecting local concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (Rižner2012Enzymes).

AKR1C1 polymorphisms have been studied in relation to cancer risk, with mixed results. While some studies found associations with breast cancer in specific populations, others did not find significant links with other cancers, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Alshogran2017Pharmacogenetics). The gene is also implicated in anxiety disorders, with certain variants linked to anxiety symptoms in panic disorder, particularly in females (Alshogran2017Pharmacogenetics).

## Interactions
AKR1C1 interacts with several proteins in a catalytic-independent manner, playing significant roles in cancer progression and cellular stress responses. One notable interaction is with SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1), where AKR1C1 promotes autophagy by binding directly to SQSTM1. This interaction is enhanced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are key inducers of autophagy. AKR1C1 augments SQSTM1 oligomerization, increasing its affinity for binding cargo, which is crucial for its function as an autophagy receptor (Chang2021AKR1C1).

AKR1C1 also interacts with STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), promoting metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This interaction suggests that protein interactions, rather than catalytic activity, are vital for AKR1C1's tumor-promoting functions (Chang2021AKR1C1).

These interactions highlight the importance of AKR1C1 in linking autophagy and oxidative stress pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for targeting AKR1C1 in cancer treatment (Chang2021AKR1C1). The study of these interactions provides insights into the non-catalytic roles of AKR1C1 in cancer biology.
