# NLGN4X

## Overview
NLGN4X is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the neuroligin 4 X-linked protein, a member of the neuroligin family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules. This protein plays a critical role in the formation and function of synapses, particularly in the central nervous system, by facilitating the interaction between postsynaptic neurons and presynaptic neurexins. Neuroligin 4 X-linked is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a complex structure that includes an extracellular esterase-like domain and a PDZ-binding motif, which are essential for its synaptic functions (Fabrichny2007Structural; Yumoto2020Autismassociated). The protein's involvement in synaptic plasticity and signaling is underscored by its phosphorylation-dependent interactions and its role in enhancing excitatory synaptic transmission (Nguyen2020A; Bemben2015Autismassociated). Mutations in NLGN4X have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance in cognitive and social behaviors (Laumonnier2004XLinked; Bemben2015Autismassociated).

## Structure
The NLGN4X gene encodes the neuroligin 4 X-linked protein, which is part of the neuroligin family involved in synapse formation. The primary structure of NLGN4X includes a signal peptide, an extracellular esterase-like domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular PDZ-binding motif (Yumoto2020Autismassociated). The secondary structure features a twisted 12-stranded central beta-sheet surrounded by 14 alpha helices, characteristic of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold (Fabrichny2007Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, NLGN4X contains a central pocket that, while not catalytic, may provide flexibility due to its capacity for solvent and ion binding. This pocket is partially occupied by the Cys-loop, which is longer in NLGN4X compared to its enzyme relatives, influencing substrate accessibility (Fabrichny2007Structural). The quaternary structure of NLGN4X involves dimerization through a four-helix bundle, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Fabrichny2007Structural).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which may influence binding interactions (Fabrichny2007Structural). The protein also features a conserved Leu-Arg-Glu (LRE) laminin binding motif, though its exact function is unclear (Fabrichny2007Structural). Variants in NLGN4X, such as the R87W mutation, can impair protein folding and export, affecting synaptic function (Zhang2009A).

## Function
NLGN4X encodes the neuroligin 4 X-linked protein, which is a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule crucial for synapse formation and function in the nervous system. In healthy human cells, NLGN4X is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and is involved in excitatory synaptic transmission. It localizes primarily to excitatory postsynaptic compartments, where it plays a significant role in the maturation and function of synapses (Toya2023The; Marro2019Neuroligin4).

The protein is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC), and its phosphorylation at the T707 site is essential for enhancing excitatory postsynaptic currents. This phosphorylation is crucial for synaptogenesis and maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (Bemben2015Autismassociated). NLGN4X interacts with presynaptic neurexins, facilitating synaptic connectivity and communication, which is vital for maintaining synaptic plasticity and proper neural network function (Nguyen2020A).

NLGN4X's role in synaptic function is underscored by its ability to enhance synaptic strength and increase excitatory synaptic transmission, as evidenced by increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in neurons (Nguyen2020A). This function is critical for cognitive and social behaviors, as disruptions in NLGN4X can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (Nguyen2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NLGN4X gene are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disabilities. These mutations can disrupt synaptic signaling and neuronal communication, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in these conditions. For instance, the R704C mutation in NLGN4X affects phosphorylation by protein kinase C, which is crucial for enhancing excitatory synapses, leading to synaptic dysfunction in ASDs (Bemben2015Autismassociated). Another mutation, R87W, impairs NLGN4X glycosylation, destabilizes the protein, and blocks its transport to the cell surface, resulting in a loss of synapse-formation activity (Zhang2009A).

The NLGN4X gene is also implicated in X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), with mutations leading to a wide spectrum of phenotypes, from mild mental retardation to more severe forms associated with autism (Laumonnier2004XLinked). These mutations can result in truncated proteins that impair synaptic development and function, affecting cognitive and communication processes (Laumonnier2004XLinked). The phenotypic heterogeneity observed in conditions associated with NLGN4X mutations suggests modulation by genetic or nongenetic factors, highlighting the complexity of its clinical significance (Laumonnier2004XLinked).

## Interactions
NLGN4X, or neuroligin 4 X-linked, is a synaptic cell adhesion molecule that interacts with presynaptic neurexins to form trans-synaptic complexes essential for synaptic signaling and plasticity. The interaction between NLGN4X and neurexins is characterized by a Ca²⁺-dependent binding mechanism, which is crucial for synapse maturation and maintenance. The structural analysis of the neurexin-neuroligin complex reveals that the LNS domain of neurexin binds to the electronegative surface of NLGN4, forming a complex with a flat binding interface and a buried surface area of 560 Å² on each partner. This interaction is facilitated by salt bridges and polar interactions, suggesting a moderate-affinity interaction that may contribute to synaptic plasticity (Fabrichny2007Structural).

NLGN4X is also involved in phosphorylation-dependent interactions. Phosphorylation at threonine 707 (T707) by protein kinase C (PKC) enhances synaptogenesis, potentially through novel protein interactions that recruit glutamatergic receptors or presynaptic terminals. The R704C mutation in NLGN4X disrupts this phosphorylation, affecting synaptic enhancement and is associated with autism spectrum disorders (Bemben2015The; Bemben2015Autismassociated). These interactions highlight the role of NLGN4X in synaptic assembly and function.
