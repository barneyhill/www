# RUNX2

## Overview
RUNX2 is a gene that encodes the RUNX family transcription factor 2, a pivotal protein in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone development. As a transcription factor, RUNX2 plays a crucial role in the expression of genes necessary for bone formation and skeletal development. The protein is characterized by a conserved Runt domain, which facilitates DNA binding and interaction with core-binding factor beta (CBFβ), enhancing its transcriptional activity (Kim2005Four; Gomathi2020Regulation). RUNX2 is involved in both intramembranous and endochondral ossification processes, influencing the maturation of chondrocytes and the expression of bone matrix genes (Komori2017Roles; Lee2000Runx2). Additionally, RUNX2 interacts with various signaling pathways and proteins, such as SMADs and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), to coordinate bone formation and angiogenesis (Javed2008Structural; Kwon2011Physical). Mutations in the RUNX2 gene are linked to skeletal disorders, including cleidocranial dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance in bone-related pathologies (Hordyjewska‐Kowalczyk2019Functional).

## Structure
RUNX2, a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, is characterized by several functional domains essential for its role in bone development and osteoblast differentiation. The protein contains a highly conserved Runt domain, consisting of 128 amino acids, which is crucial for DNA binding and protein heterodimerization with CBFβ (Kim2005Four; Gomathi2020Regulation). This domain includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminal end, facilitating its transport into the nucleus (Kim2005Four).

RUNX2 also features a proline-serine-threonine (PST) rich domain, a glutamine/alanine-rich domain, and a VWRPY motif at the C-terminal end, which interacts with the Groucho protein to mediate transcriptional repression (Gomathi2020Regulation). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which regulate its stability and transcriptional activity (Gomathi2020Regulation; Jonason2009Posttranslational).

RUNX2 is expressed as two major isoforms, type I and type II, which differ in their amino termini and are produced through alternative promoter usage and splicing (Elango2006Expression; Gomathi2020Regulation). These isoforms have distinct expression patterns and functions in osteogenesis (Jonason2009Posttranslational).

## Function
RUNX2 is a critical transcription factor involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, which are essential for bone formation. It regulates the expression of several bone matrix genes, including Spp1, Ibsp, and Bglap2, and is necessary for both intramembranous and endochondral ossification processes (Komori2017Roles; Lee2000Runx2). RUNX2 is expressed in the perichondrium and chondrocytes, where it inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and promotes maturation, playing a crucial role in skeletal development (Jonason2009Posttranslational).

RUNX2 functions as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, forming a heterodimer with Cbfb to enhance its DNA-binding capacity (Komori2017Roles). It is involved in the transcriptional activation of osteoblast-specific genes in response to physiological regulators such as TGF-β1 and BMP-2, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by the ERK/MAPK pathway (Ge2009Identification; Lee2000Runx2). RUNX2 is also involved in repressing rRNA gene expression during interphase and mitosis, potentially inhibiting cell growth by affecting ribosome biogenesis (Jonason2009Posttranslational).

In addition to its role in bone formation, RUNX2 is involved in angiogenesis, interacting with hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) to stimulate the expression of angiogenic genes such as VEGF, which is crucial for bone vascularization (Kwon2011Physical). RUNX2's activity is localized to subnuclear foci associated with the nuclear matrix, a localization essential for its function in bone development (Jonason2009Posttranslational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RUNX2 gene are primarily associated with cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a rare autosomal dominant skeletal disorder. CCD is characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, delayed closure of cranial sutures, and dental anomalies. The majority of pathogenic RUNX2 mutations are missense variants located in the Runt domain, which is essential for DNA binding and protein heterodimerization (Hordyjewska‐Kowalczyk2019Functional). Nonsense mutations, such as c.199C>T, lead to truncated proteins and are also implicated in CCD (Zhang2017Analysis). These mutations often result in reduced transactivation potential of RUNX2, affecting its function in bone development (Hordyjewska‐Kowalczyk2019Functional).

Alterations in RUNX2 expression can also influence other conditions. For instance, RUNX2 mutations affecting the nuclear matrix-targeting signal (NMTS) can lead to compromised osteogenic differentiation, resulting in severe skeletal defects (Zaidi2006Alterations). Additionally, RUNX2 variants have been implicated in nonsyndromic midline craniosynostosis, where they may contribute to disease by altering gene function (Cuellar2020Gainoffunction). These findings underscore the critical role of RUNX2 in skeletal development and its association with various bone-related disorders.

## Interactions
RUNX2, a transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms complexes with core-binding factor beta (CBFβ), enhancing its DNA binding capability (Meyer2014The). RUNX2 interacts with SMAD proteins, which are substrates for BMP and TGFβ receptors, to transduce signals necessary for bone development. This interaction is facilitated by a specific domain in the C-terminus of RUNX2, known as the SMAD interacting domain (SMID) (Javed2008Structural).

RUNX2 also interacts with histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which is recruited to chromatin by RUNX2 to repress the p21 CIP1/WAF1 promoter during osteoblast differentiation (Westendorf2002Runx2). The interaction between RUNX2 and Osterix (Osx) is critical for the transcriptional osteogenic program, with MAPK pathways regulating their interaction through phosphorylation (Artigas2014Mitogenactivated).

RUNX2 also interacts with HIF-1α to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression, which is crucial for angiogenesis and osteogenesis. This interaction involves both direct and indirect binding to regulatory regions of the VEGF gene (Kwon2011Physical). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RUNX2 in bone formation and development.
