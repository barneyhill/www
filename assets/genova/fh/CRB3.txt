# CRB3

## Overview
CRB3 is a gene that encodes the protein crumbs cell polarity complex component 3, a transmembrane protein integral to the Crumbs family. This protein is pivotal in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and integrity, primarily through its role in the Crumbs complex, which is essential for the establishment of apico-basal polarity in mammalian epithelial cells (Roh2003The; Lemmers2004CRB3). CRB3 is characterized by a short extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail containing conserved motifs crucial for protein-protein interactions (Djuric2016The). The protein exists in two splice variant isoforms, Crb3A and Crb3B, which differ in their C-terminal sequences and interaction capabilities (Djuric2016The). CRB3's interactions with proteins such as PALS1 and PATJ are vital for tight junction assembly and epithelial polarity maintenance (Roh2003The). Additionally, CRB3 plays a regulatory role in the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor in various cancers (Mao2017CRB3).

## Structure
CRB3 is a transmembrane protein that is part of the Crumbs family, characterized by a short extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of CRB3 contains highly conserved motifs, including a FERM domain-binding motif (FBM) and a PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM), which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Djuric2016The). The PBM interacts with the PDZ-domain protein PALS1, which is involved in epithelial cell polarity and tight junction formation (Loie2015CRB3A). The FBM associates with FERM domain proteins, such as Ehm2, which play a role in actin cytoskeleton organization (Loie2015CRB3A).

CRB3 exists in two splice variant isoforms, Crb3A and Crb3B, which differ in their C-terminal sequences. Crb3A contains the conserved 'ERLI' motif, while Crb3B has a 'CLPI' variant, making it the only Crumbs-family member lacking the ERLI sequence (Djuric2016The). This difference affects their mobility and interaction with other proteins, such as Pals1, with Crb3A showing a stronger interaction (Djuric2016The). The extracellular domain of CRB3 is N-glycosylated, although the function of this modification is not well understood (Loie2015CRB3A).

## Function
CRB3 is a crucial component of the Crumbs complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and integrity. It is involved in the establishment of apico-basal polarity in mammalian epithelial cells by localizing to tight junctions and the apical plasma membrane (Roh2003The; Lemmers2004CRB3). CRB3 interacts with Pals1 and PATJ, forming a complex that is essential for tight junction assembly and the maintenance of epithelial polarity (Roh2003The). The protein contains a PDZ-binding motif that is critical for its interaction with Pals1, which is necessary for tight junction formation and apical membrane organization (Roh2003The).

CRB3 also plays a role in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway, acting as an upstream regulator that influences cell proliferation and apoptosis. It interacts with proteins such as Kibra and FRMD6, which are involved in the phosphorylation of YAP, a key effector in the Hippo pathway (Mao2017CRB3). This regulation is crucial for contact inhibition, a process that prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation, highlighting CRB3's role in maintaining normal cell function and preventing tumor growth (Mao2017CRB3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CRB3 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and breast cancer. In ccRCC, CRB3 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is significantly reduced due to increased DNA methylation. This methylation negatively correlates with CRB3 mRNA expression and is associated with advanced pathological stages and poor prognosis. High levels of CRB3 DNA methylation are linked to shorter overall survival in ccRCC patients, suggesting that CRB3 methylation could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Li2019DNA).

In breast cancer, CRB3 downregulation is associated with increased tumor malignancy and cancer stem cell traits. The loss of CRB3 expression leads to enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion potential, which are key features of cancer stem cell activity. CRB3 downregulation affects the Hippo signaling pathway, particularly through the activity of TAZ, promoting cancer stem cell traits and tumorigenic potential. CRB3's role in maintaining epithelial polarity and preventing EMT is crucial for inhibiting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Li2017CRB3; Mao2017CRB3).

## Interactions
CRB3 interacts with several proteins to maintain epithelial cell polarity and integrity. It forms a complex with PALS1 and PATJ, which is crucial for establishing polarity in mammalian epithelial cells. The interaction between CRB3 and PALS1 is mediated by the PDZ domain of PALS1 and the ERLI motif at the C-terminus of CRB3. This interaction is essential for the localization of CRB3 to the apical surface and tight junctions in epithelial cells (Makarova2003Mammalian; Roh2003The; Lemmers2004CRB3).

CRB3 also directly interacts with Par6, a protein involved in tight junction regulation. This interaction is mediated by the ERLI motif of CRB3 and the PDZ domain of Par6, playing a significant role in the morphogenesis of tight junctions (Lemmers2004CRB3).

In Sertoli cells, CRB3 interacts with actin-binding proteins such as Arp3 and Eps8, which are involved in actin organization. These interactions are crucial for the remodeling of actin microfilaments and maintaining the integrity of the blood-testis barrier (Gao2016Polarity). CRB3's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in regulating cell junctions and tissue architecture.
