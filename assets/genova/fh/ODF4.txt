# ODF4

## Overview
The ODF4 gene encodes the protein outer dense fiber of sperm tails 4, which is a critical component of the outer dense fibers (ODFs) in the sperm flagellum. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and motility of sperm, thereby contributing to male fertility. As a structural protein, ODF4 is involved in energy transfer processes within the sperm flagellum, facilitating ATP transport in collaboration with adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2). These interactions are essential for the energy metabolism required for sperm movement. The absence of ODF4 in model organisms, such as mice, results in abnormal sperm morphology and impaired motility, leading to infertility, which underscores its importance in reproductive biology (Ito2023The).

## Function
The ODF4 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sperm tails. This protein is a component of the outer dense fibers (ODFs) of the sperm flagellum, which are essential for maintaining the proper shape and motility of sperm, thereby contributing to male fertility (Ito2023The). ODF4 is involved in energy transfer within the sperm flagellum, working in conjunction with adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) to facilitate ATP transport to different parts of the flagellum. This process is vital for the energy metabolism required for sperm movement, with ATP being produced by the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the midpiece and glycolysis in the principal piece of the flagellum (Ito2023The).

In mice, the absence of ODF4 leads to abnormal sperm flagellar shape and impaired motility, resulting in male infertility. These abnormalities can be reversed by restoring ODF4, highlighting its essential role in maintaining sperm structure and function (Ito2023The). Although the specific function of ODF4 in human cells is not directly addressed, its role in mice suggests a similar importance in human sperm motility and fertility (Ito2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ODF4 gene have significant implications for male fertility. The ODF4 gene is crucial for maintaining the proper structure and function of sperm flagella. In mice, the deletion of ODF4 leads to male infertility due to abnormal sperm morphology, including bent or hairpin-shaped flagella, and impaired motility. This is primarily because the absence of ODF4 results in the reduced expression of AK1 and AK2 proteins, which are essential for energy metabolism in sperm flagella (Ito2023The).

The lack of ODF4 disrupts the correct positioning of AK1 and AK2, leading to uncontrolled ATP consumption and impaired flagellar movement, which are critical for sperm motility and fertility (Ito2023The). In Odf4 knockout mice, the midpiece of the sperm flagellum becomes immotile, and the spermatozoa exhibit backward progression rather than forward movement, further contributing to infertility (Ito2023The).

These findings suggest that mutations in the ODF4 gene could potentially lead to fertility issues in humans by disrupting sperm function, although the precise mechanisms and clinical implications in humans remain to be fully elucidated (Ito2023The).

## Interactions
ODF4 interacts with adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) in sperm flagella, forming a complex crucial for ATP transport and energy metabolism. This interaction is essential for maintaining sperm motility and proper flagellar shape. In Odf4 knockout mice, the absence of ODF4 leads to a significant reduction in AK1 and AK2 levels in sperm flagella, resulting in impaired ATP transport and abnormal flagellar movement, which causes male infertility (Ito2023The).

ODF4 is more broadly distributed in the flagella than the cytoskeletal protein ODF2, suggesting that ODF4 may have additional roles beyond being a structural component. Soluble ODF4, which can be extracted with a milder detergent, is implicated in the correct positioning of AK1 and AK2 in the flagellum (Ito2023The). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed that AK1 and AK2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with ODF4, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins (Ito2023The). These interactions are critical for the energy balance and motility of sperm, highlighting the importance of ODF4 in reproductive biology.
