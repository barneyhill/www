# TUBB8B

## Overview
TUBB8B is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin beta 8B, which is a member of the tubulin family of proteins. Tubulins are globular proteins that polymerize to form microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The tubulin beta 8B protein plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of microtubules, which are involved in various cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and maintenance of cell shape. As a structural protein, tubulin beta 8B is integral to the proper functioning of the microtubule network, and its dysregulation can have significant implications for cellular dynamics and health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
