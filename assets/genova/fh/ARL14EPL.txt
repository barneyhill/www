# ARL14EPL

## Overview
ARL14EPL is a gene that encodes the protein known as ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 14 effector protein like. This protein functions as an effector protein, primarily interacting with ARL14, a small GTPase, to regulate vesicular trafficking and membrane dynamics. These processes are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and are particularly significant in immune cell functions, such as cytokine secretion and cell migration. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and plays a vital role in facilitating immune responses. In addition to its physiological roles, ARL14EPL has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where it forms part of a prognostic signature. Despite its recognized importance in disease contexts, the specific functions of ARL14EPL in normal human cells require further investigation (Unknownauthors2020PalmitateandFructoseInteracttoInduceHumanHepatocytestoProduceProFibroticTranscriptionalResponsesinHepaticStellateCellsExposedtoConditionedMedia; Zhou2023Integrative).

## Function
ARL14EPL (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 14 effector protein like) is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, primarily functioning as an effector protein that interacts with ARL14, a small GTPase. This interaction plays a crucial role in regulating vesicular trafficking and membrane dynamics, processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. ARL14EPL is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it influences immune cell functions, including cytokine secretion and cell migration. These activities are vital for the immune response, as they facilitate the movement and communication of immune cells within the body (Unknownauthors2020PalmitateandFructoseInteracttoInduceHumanHepatocytestoProduceProFibroticTranscriptionalResponsesinHepaticStellateCellsExposedtoConditionedMedia).

In the context of disease, ARL14EPL has been identified as part of a prognostic signature in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting its potential role in cancer biology. However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain less defined, as studies have primarily focused on its expression and implications in disease states (Zhou2023Integrative). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving ARL14EPL in normal physiological conditions.
