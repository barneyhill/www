# GLP2R

## Overview
The GLP2R gene encodes the glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. This receptor is a member of the class B glucagon-secretin receptor family and is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices and a large extracellular domain, which are essential for ligand binding and receptor activation (Moon2012Structural). The glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor plays a pivotal role in maintaining intestinal health by promoting epithelial cell proliferation, enhancing nutrient absorption, and preserving gut barrier integrity (Drucker2014Physiology; Yusta2000Enteroendocrine). It is activated by glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a hormone secreted by enteroendocrine L cells in response to nutrient intake, which subsequently triggers signaling pathways that enhance intestinal blood flow and lipid metabolism (Morrow2021Distinct; Guan2006GLP2). The receptor's function is crucial for maintaining mucosal integrity and energy absorption, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders, as well as in cancer progression (Song2022GLP2GLP2R; Taher2018GLP2).

## Structure
The glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor (GLP2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that belongs to the class B glucagon-secretin receptor family. It features a common architecture with seven transmembrane helices and a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of approximately 120 residues (Moon2012Structural). The ECD is structured with a core folding stabilized by disulfide bonds and a salt bridge, forming a Sushi domain, which is conserved across class B GPCRs (Moon2012Structural). This domain is crucial for ligand recognition and binding.

The secondary structure of the GLP2R includes a high alpha-helix content, as revealed by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, with peaks at 193 nm, 208 nm, and 222 nm (Jamshidi2021Expression). The tertiary structure of the ECD-GLP2R complexed with teduglutide shows a single alpha helix and two central antiparallel β-sheets stabilized by disulfide bonds (Jamshidi2021Expression).

Post-translational modifications of GLP2R include glycosylation, which results in molecular masses larger than the predicted size due to these modifications (Drucker2014Physiology). These structural features are essential for the receptor's function and its interaction with ligands.

## Function
The GLP2R gene encodes the glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. This receptor plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal health by promoting epithelial cell proliferation, enhancing nutrient absorption, and preserving gut barrier integrity (Drucker2014Physiology; Yusta2000Enteroendocrine). GLP2R is activated by glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which is secreted by enteroendocrine L cells in response to nutrient intake. Upon activation, GLP2R signaling enhances the secretion of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and increases intestinal blood flow, which is mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Morrow2021Distinct; Guan2006GLP2).

GLP2R also plays a role in lipid metabolism by stimulating the release of pre-formed triglyceride particles, rather than increasing their synthesis or decreasing their clearance (Morrow2021Distinct). The receptor's activation leads to intestinotrophic effects, such as promoting intestinal cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, and increasing villus height, which collectively enhance nutrient absorption and gut barrier function (Dubé2007Frontiers; Morrow2021Distinct). These processes are essential for maintaining mucosal integrity and energy absorption, reducing the need for parenteral nutrition in conditions like short-bowel syndrome (Drucker2014Physiology).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or signaling of the GLP2R gene have been implicated in various metabolic and gastrointestinal conditions. Dysregulation of GLP2R signaling can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and fasting dyslipidemia, characterized by increased hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production, which is a common complication in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Taher2018GLP2). In the context of a high-fat diet, the absence of GLP2R exacerbates fatty liver conditions, as evidenced by increased hepatic triglyceride accumulation and elevated plasma ALT and AST levels (Taher2018GLP2).

GLP2R signaling is also associated with cancer progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, GLP2R expression is significantly up-regulated in drug-resistant lines, enhancing cell viability and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cisplatin (Song2022GLP2GLP2R). Additionally, GLP2R is expressed in various gastrointestinal tumors, and its stimulation is linked to pathways involved in tumorigenesis, such as the PI3K/Akt pathway and b-catenin signaling, which are associated with cancer and tumor growth (Orhan2018The). These findings suggest that GLP2R plays a significant role in both metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
The glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor (GLP2R) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the gastrointestinal tract. GLP2R is co-localized with serotonin in enteroendocrine cells and with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in enteric neurons. These interactions suggest that GLP2R plays a role in mediating intestinal vasodilation through neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide (NO), serotonin (5-HT), and VIP (Guan2006GLP2). 

In porcine and human gut tissues, GLP2R is found in chromogranin A-immunoreactive enteroendocrine cells and HuC/HuD-immunoreactive enteric neurons. It is also associated with neuron-specific markers like PGP 9.5, VIP, and eNOS, indicating its involvement in neurotransmitter signaling pathways (Guan2006GLP2). 

Additionally, GLP2R does not interact with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) such as RAMP1 or RAMP2, as shown in studies using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. This lack of interaction is attributed to potential repulsive interactions based on structural considerations (Kotliar2022Elucidating). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in regulating blood flow and other gastrointestinal functions.
