# ZNF785

## Overview
ZNF785 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 785, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate specific DNA-binding capabilities, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. Zinc finger protein 785 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by interacting with specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. The protein's structure, rich in cysteine and histidine residues, allows for the coordination of zinc ions, which is essential for maintaining its functional conformation. While the precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF785 are still under investigation, its role in DNA binding and potential post-translational modifications suggest it may have significant implications in cellular function and regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
ZNF785 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The primary structure of ZNF785 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for the coordination of zinc ions within the zinc finger motifs. These motifs typically contribute to the protein's ability to interact with specific DNA sequences.

The secondary structure of ZNF785 includes beta sheets and alpha helices, which are common structural elements in zinc finger proteins. These elements facilitate the formation of the zinc finger domains, allowing the protein to maintain a stable conformation necessary for its function.

In terms of tertiary structure, ZNF785 involves the folding of its zinc finger domains into a stable, functional conformation. This folding is critical for the protein's ability to bind DNA effectively. Zinc finger proteins like ZNF785 generally do not form quaternary structures, as they typically function as monomeric units.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination may occur in ZNF785, potentially influencing its function and stability. Additionally, splice variants of ZNF785 can lead to different isoforms, which may have diverse functional roles within the cell.
