# RBBP7

## Overview
RBBP7, or retinoblastoma binding protein 7, is a gene that encodes a chromatin remodeling factor known as RB binding protein 7. This protein is a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure, which facilitates interactions with various proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Cai2023Unveiling; Moody2018Probing). RBBP7 is a core component of several chromatin-modifying complexes, including the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), playing a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation, histone modification, and chromatin dynamics (Cai2023Unveiling; Zhan2024Interpreting). The protein's involvement in processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt/β-catenin signaling underscores its significance in cancer biology (Cai2023Unveiling). Additionally, RBBP7 is implicated in cell development, differentiation, and senescence, with notable expression in the kidneys and brain, where it influences gene expression related to reproductive development and cellular aging (Zhan2024Interpreting).

## Structure
RBBP7, a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. This structure facilitates multiple protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Cai2023Unveiling; Moody2018Probing). The protein shares a high sequence identity of 89% with RBBP4, indicating structural similarities (Brasen2017Expression). 

RBBP7 interacts with various proteins within epigenetic complexes such as NuRD, PRC2, and DREAM, suggesting specific binding sites and domains that facilitate these interactions (Cai2023Unveiling). In the NuRD complex, RBBP7 binds to MTA proteins using the same surface as it binds histone H4, although in the complete complex, it only binds histone H3 (Brasen2017Expression). 

The protein's β-propeller structure provides several interaction surfaces, including a canonical binding site on the top face, which binds to un-methylated histone H3 and other transcription factors (Moody2018Probing). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as RBBP7 is involved in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in various cancers (Cai2023Unveiling). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate RBBP7's activity, although specific details are not provided in the context (Brasen2017Expression). Multiple splice variants of RBBP7 exist, potentially altering its functional interactions (Brasen2017Expression).

## Function
RBBP7, also known as RB binding protein 7, is a chromatin remodeling factor that plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is a component of several chromatin-modifying complexes, including the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and the histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) complex. These complexes are involved in transcriptional regulation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions (Cai2023Unveiling; Zhan2024Interpreting).

RBBP7 interacts with histone H3/H4, mediating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression through histone deacetylation and methylation (Cai2023Unveiling). It is also involved in the deposition of CENP-A at centromeres, a process crucial for chromosome segregation during cell division. RBBP7 functions as a substrate-specific adaptor within the CRL4 complex, facilitating the loading of newly synthesized CENP-A onto centromeres during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Mouysset2015CRL4RBBP7).

In addition to its role in chromatin dynamics, RBBP7 is implicated in cell development, differentiation, and senescence. It is strongly expressed in the kidneys and brain, where it regulates gene expression related to reproductive development and cellular aging (Zhan2024Interpreting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RBBP7 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In male infertility, particularly non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), mutations in RBBP7 can lead to maturation arrest (MA) and are associated with testicular tumors, such as Leydig cell tumors. A specific deleterious hemizygous variant of RBBP7 was identified in two brothers with MA, resulting in premature protein translation termination and impaired interaction with histone H4, which is crucial for DNA repair (Li2023Xlinked).

In cancer, RBBP7 is overexpressed in several types, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In ESCC, high RBBP7 expression is linked to poor overall survival and increased tumor invasion and migration, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Yu2018RBBP7). In HCC, RBBP7 promotes cell proliferation and glycolysis, contributing to the Warburg effect via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and is associated with poor prognosis (Fang2024RBBP7).

RBBP7 also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease, where reduced expression is associated with increased tau acetylation and phosphorylation, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation and neuronal death (Dave2021Identification).

## Interactions
RBBP7, also known as RB binding protein 7, is a nuclear protein involved in various chromatin remodeling complexes. It is a core component of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as MTA1-MTA3, GATAD2A, GATAD2B, and MBD3. RBBP7, along with RBBP4, is dynamically associated with the NuRD complex, and its interactions are sensitive to high nonionic detergent concentrations, indicating a role as a histone chaperone (Kloet2014Towards).

RBBP7 also interacts with the lysine acetyltransferase p300, which is involved in tau acetylation, a process linked to Alzheimer's disease. This interaction suggests that RBBP7 may regulate p300-induced tau acetylation, potentially reducing tau pathology (Dave2021Identification).

In the context of centromeric deposition, RBBP7 functions as a substrate-specific adaptor in the CRL4 complex, facilitating the loading of CENP-A, a histone H3 variant essential for chromosome segregation. It interacts with CUL4A and DDB1, stabilizing pre-nucleosomal CENP-A and HJURP (Mouysset2015CRL4RBBP7).

RBBP7 is also involved in the PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex and interacts with histone proteins H3 and H4, as well as other proteins like PHF6 and FOG-1, through its WD40 motif-containing structure (Yu2018RBBP7; Abbey2018Targeting).
