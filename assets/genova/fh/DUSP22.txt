# DUSP22

## Overview
DUSP22, or dual specificity phosphatase 22, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dual specificity phosphatase family, which is involved in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by DUSP22 is characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, thereby modulating the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and other signaling molecules (Lang2019DualSpecificity). As a phosphatase, DUSP22 plays a crucial role in immune response regulation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis by acting as a scaffold protein in pathways such as ASK1-MKK7-JNK (Ha2019Phosphorylation). It is expressed in various tissues, with notable abundance in the heart and muscle, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through the inhibition of pathways like JAK/STAT3 (Mélard2016Molecular). DUSP22's dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2024DUSP22).

## Function
DUSP22, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 22, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in regulating signal transduction pathways by dephosphorylating both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. It is involved in modulating immune responses and cellular proliferation by inactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Lang2019DualSpecificity). DUSP22 functions as a scaffold protein in the ASK1-MKK7-JNK pathway, facilitating interactions between key components of the pathway, which is crucial for apoptosis regulation (Ha2019Phosphorylation). Its phosphatase activity is not necessary for JNK activation, indicating a unique role in immune cell signaling (Lang2019DualSpecificity).

In healthy human cells, DUSP22 is expressed in various tissues, with higher mRNA levels in myeloid cells among immune cells, and is most abundant at the protein level in the heart and muscle (Lang2019DualSpecificity). It is involved in the regulation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, where it inhibits STAT3 signaling, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis (Mélard2016Molecular). DUSP22's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus influences cell growth and differentiation, playing a protective role against conditions like ankylosing spondylitis by modulating immune responses and cytokine production (Chen2023Dualspecificity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DUSP22 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly lung cancer. DUSP22 is frequently mutated in lung, colon, and other tumors, and its expression is often downregulated in these cancers (Sasaki2019Dysfunction). In lung cancer, DUSP22 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the EGFR/c-Met signaling pathways. Loss of DUSP22 function leads to increased EGFR activity, enhancing cell growth, migration, and immune evasion through increased PD-L1 expression (Lin2024DUSP22). This makes DUSP22-deficient tumors more dependent on EGFR signaling, suggesting that targeting EGFR could be an effective therapeutic strategy for these cancers (Lin2024DUSP22).

In prostate cancer, DUSP22 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal tissues, and this reduction is associated with shorter progression-free survival. The loss of DUSP22 function contributes to prostate cancer progression by promoting aberrant activation of EGFR-ERKs and androgen receptor signaling (Lin2019DUSP22). DUSP22 also plays a role in peripheral T-cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer, where its decreased expression is linked to poor prognosis (Lin2024DUSP22). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DUSP22 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
DUSP22 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. It physically interacts with Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), dephosphorylating it at specific residues (Y397 and Y576 + Y577). This interaction is crucial for mitigating the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by inhibiting downstream NF-κB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, which are involved in inflammation and metabolic regulation (Ge2022Hepatocyte).

DUSP22 also acts as a scaffold protein in the ASK1-MKK7-JNK signaling pathway. It associates with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7), and JNK1/2, enhancing JNK activation. This interaction is independent of its phosphatase activity and is crucial for regulating cell death and JNK-mediated apoptosis (Ju2016Scaffold).

Additionally, DUSP22 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR2, inducing its proteasomal degradation. This interaction requires the phosphatase activity of DUSP22 and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays (Shih2024The). DUSP22 also interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), dephosphorylating it at Ser-118, which modulates ERa-mediated transcriptional activity (Sekine2007DUSP22LMWDSP2).
