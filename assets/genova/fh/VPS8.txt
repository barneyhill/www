# VPS8

## Overview
VPS8 is a gene that encodes the VPS8 protein, a critical component of the CORVET (Class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) complex, which is involved in endosomal tethering and fusion processes. The VPS8 protein is characterized by a RING finger zinc-binding motif, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its function in vacuolar protein sorting and endosomal trafficking (Horazdovsky1996A; Pawelec2010Mapping). As a subunit of the CORVET complex, VPS8 plays a pivotal role in the endosomal recycling pathway, particularly in the trafficking of integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion, migration, and focal adhesion assembly (Jonker2018Vps3). The protein's ability to interact with other components, such as Vps3 and Vps21, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular functions related to integrin trafficking and recycling (Markgraf2009The; Jonker2018Vps3).

## Structure
The VPS8 protein is a subunit of the CORVET complex, involved in endosomal tethering and fusion. It is characterized by a RING finger zinc-binding motif, specifically the RING H2 variant, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Horazdovsky1996A). The protein is hydrophilic and lacks obvious hydrophobic domains, yet it associates with cellular membranes, suggesting an intrinsic ability to bind membranes (Horazdovsky1996A; Pawelec2010Mapping). 

Vps8 contains multiple membrane-binding regions, with a significant domain located between amino acids 164 and 253 (Pawelec2010Mapping). The N-terminal three-quarters of Vps8 are important for binding with the small GTPase Vps21, while the C-terminal quarter is crucial for interaction with the HOPS core complex (Pawelec2010Mapping). 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions within the CORVET complex (Pawelec2010Mapping). Despite the absence of obvious membrane-binding motifs, Vps8's structure allows it to participate in complex interactions necessary for its role in vacuolar protein sorting and endosomal trafficking (Pawelec2010Mapping).

## Function
VPS8 is a subunit of the CORVET complex, which is involved in the endosomal recycling process in human cells. It plays a critical role in the trafficking of integrins from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, a process essential for integrin-dependent functions such as cell adhesion, migration, and focal adhesion assembly (Jonker2018Vps3). VPS8, along with Vps3, localizes to Rab4-positive recycling vesicles and Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, indicating its involvement in a specific recycling pathway (Jonker2018Vps3).

The protein can form a complex independently of the CORVET core components, which is significant for integrin recycling (Jonker2018Vps3). VPS8 is crucial for the efficient recycling of β1 integrins, which are important for cell-ECM interactions, and its depletion leads to reduced cell adhesion and migration (Jonker2018Vps3). The interaction of VPS8 with the CHEVI complex on recycling membranes further supports its role in integrin trafficking (Jonker2018Vps3).

In summary, VPS8 is essential for maintaining cellular functions related to integrin trafficking and recycling, which are vital for cell adhesion, spreading, and migration in healthy human cells (Jonker2018Vps3).

## Interactions
VPS8 is a subunit of the CORVET complex and participates in various protein interactions crucial for endosomal trafficking. It directly interacts with Vps3, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-binding experiments, which show that Vps8 binds to the C terminus of Vps3. This interaction is significant for their function in endosomal recycling (Jonker2018Vps3).

VPS8 also interacts with Vps21, a Rab5 homolog, in its GTP-bound form. This interaction is essential for the clustering of late endosomal compartments and is stronger than previously detected interactions with other CORVET components. The binding site for Vps21-GTP is located in the C-terminal half of Vps8 (Pawelec2010Mapping; Markgraf2009The).

In Drosophila, VPS8 forms a complex with Vps16A, Dor/Vps18, and Car/Vps33A, known as the miniCORVET complex. This complex is involved in endosomal fusion processes and acts upstream of the HOPS complex. The interaction with Dor/Vps18 has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid experiments (Lőrincz2016MiniCORVET).

VPS8's interactions with the HOPS core complex are also significant, with the C-terminal quarter of VPS8 being crucial for this binding. Deletions affecting HOPS binding have a strong impact on endocytic trafficking (Pawelec2010Mapping).
