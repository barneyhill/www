# CYP1A1

## Overview
CYP1A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of substrates, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and various endogenous compounds. As a monooxygenase, CYP1A1 plays a significant role in phase I drug metabolism, facilitating the conversion of lipophilic substances into more water-soluble forms, which are then further processed by phase II enzymes. The enzyme's activity is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which modulates its expression in response to environmental stimuli. CYP1A1 is also implicated in the bioactivation of procarcinogens, influencing cancer risk and other disease susceptibilities (Androutsopoulos2009Cytochrome; Mescher2018Modulation).

## Structure
The CYP1A1 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by its role in drug metabolism and the synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. The primary structure of CYP1A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure includes canonical 12 alpha-helices and three of four beta-sheets, which are typical of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Joshi2017Identification). 

The tertiary structure of CYP1A1 forms a compact, globular shape with a heme-binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain allows the enzyme to interact with substrates and inhibitors, facilitating various metabolic processes (Lewis1999Molecular). The active site of CYP1A1 is hydrophobic, which aligns with its preference for lipophilic substrates (Lewis1999Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is possible, which could result in different functional properties, but specific variants are not detailed in the provided information. The structural flexibility and hydration patterns of CYP1A1, influenced by water molecules, play a significant role in its function and interaction with ligands (Dutkiewicz2023Hydration).

## Function
The CYP1A1 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the cytochrome P450 family, which is involved in the oxidative metabolism of both exogenous and endogenous compounds. In healthy human cells, CYP1A1 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic amines, aflatoxins, caffeine, and certain pharmaceutical drugs, as well as endogenous substances like melatonin, steroid hormones, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Mescher2018Modulation). The enzyme is primarily regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which, upon activation by ligands, translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of CYP1A1 by binding to xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs) (Mescher2018Modulation).

CYP1A1 is involved in phase I metabolism reactions, such as oxidation and dealkylation, which enhance the water solubility of lipophilic substrates, facilitating their further conjugation by phase II enzymes (Mescher2018Modulation). This process is essential for drug metabolism and detoxification, as well as the bioactivation of procarcinogens, impacting detoxification processes and influencing cancer risk (Androutsopoulos2009Cytochrome). The enzyme's activity can modulate inflammatory and tumor-promoting responses, and its metabolites may activate AHR signaling, forming a feedback loop that enhances CYP1A1 expression and activity (Mescher2018Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYP1A1 gene are associated with an increased risk of various cancers and other diseases. Polymorphisms such as MspI, Ile462Val, and Thr461Asn have been linked to lung, breast, cervical, colorectal, larynx, and prostate cancers, as well as conditions like endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and ulcerative colitis (Kwon2021Biological). In particular, the CYP1A1m1 and CYP1A1m2 polymorphisms are significantly associated with breast cancer risk in Iraqi women, especially among smokers (Naif2018Association). 

CYP1A1 is also implicated in lung cancer, with polymorphisms such as CYP1A1*2C and *4 associated with increased risk, particularly in smokers (Ezzeldin2017Genetic). The gene's expression is influenced by environmental factors like tobacco smoke, which can lead to its overexpression in malignant tissues, such as in lung and breast cancers (Androutsopoulos2009Cytochrome). 

In cervical cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP1A1, such as rs4646903, have been associated with increased risk, with certain SNP-SNP interactions further elevating this risk (Li2016The). These genetic variations can affect the enzyme's ability to metabolize carcinogens, thereby influencing cancer susceptibility.

## Interactions
CYP1A1 interacts with various nuclear proteins through a negative regulatory element (NRE) that modulates its gene expression. This NRE is divided into subfragments, including NRE106 and NRE170, which bind specific nuclear proteins. A 21-bp palindrome within NRE106 is crucial for these interactions, with guanine/cytosine-rich sequences flanking the palindrome also playing a role in protein binding. These interactions are essential for the negative regulation of the CYP1A1 promoter, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting (Boucher1993Specific).

The binding of nuclear proteins to the NREs results in the down-regulation of gene expression, as shown in experiments with HepG2 cells where NREs reduced CAT expression by 70-75%. This suggests that the negative regulatory activity involves specific protein-DNA interactions, with conserved sequences being significant for binding (Boucher1993Specific).

CYP1A1 also interacts with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is essential for its catalytic activity. CPR acts as an electron transfer partner, facilitating the oxidative metabolism of substrates by CYP1A1. This interaction is crucial for the enzyme's function in drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Kandel2014Role).
