# ZNF404

## Overview
ZNF404 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 404, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 404 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF404 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in gene expression regulation and may be implicated in certain diseases. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional mechanisms and clinical significance of ZNF404.
