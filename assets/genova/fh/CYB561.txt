# CYB561

## Overview
The CYB561 gene encodes cytochrome b561, a transmembrane protein integral to the function of catecholamine and neuropeptide secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine tissues. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane alpha helix domains and two heme groups, which facilitate its role as an electron carrier. Cytochrome b561 is crucial for the regeneration of semidehydroascorbate to ascorbate, a process essential for the biosynthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine, particularly within chromaffin granules (van2018Mutations). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining normal catecholamine levels, impacting cardiovascular regulation and sympathetic nervous system function (Shibao2020Congenital). Mutations in CYB561 have been linked to a novel orthostatic hypotension syndrome and are associated with various cancers, highlighting its significance in both cardiovascular and oncological contexts (van2018Mutations; Zhuo2024CYB561).

## Structure
The CYB561 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is integral to catecholamine and neuropeptide secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine tissues. The protein is characterized by six transmembrane alpha helix domains, forming a helical bundle structure (van2018Mutations; Holst2023Comparison). It contains two heme groups, which are essential for its function as a transmembrane electron carrier, facilitating the regeneration of semidehydroascorbate to ascorbate (van2018Mutations; Bérczi2023Spectral). These heme groups are coordinated by four conserved histidine residues, with two hemes positioned on either side of the vesicular membrane (Holst2023Comparison).

The protein's structure is further detailed through homology modeling, as no experimentally solved structure of the human cytochrome b561 is available. This modeling uses the cytochrome b561 structure of A. thaliana as a template, suggesting the impact of mutations on its conformation (van2018Mutations). The CYB561 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. Variants of the protein can arise from alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
The CYB561 gene encodes cytochrome b561, a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine within catecholamine secretory vesicles (van2018Mutations). This protein functions as a trans-membrane electron carrier, facilitating the continuous regeneration of semidehydroascorbate to ascorbate inside chromaffin granules and neuropeptide secretory vesicles (van2018Mutations). Ascorbic acid, regenerated by cytochrome b561, is essential for the activity of dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH), the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine (van2018Mutations; Shibao2020Congenital).

Cytochrome b561 is widely expressed in human tissues, with particularly strong expression in the brain's cortex and hippocampus (van2018Mutations). It is a heme-containing enzyme with six transmembrane alpha helix domains and four histidine residues that coordinate two heme-b molecules, which accept electrons from ascorbate (van2018Mutations). This electron transport is vital for maintaining the redox state between cytosolic and intravesicular ascorbic acid, ensuring the proper biosynthesis of norepinephrine and the amidation of neuropeptides (van2018Mutations). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal catecholamine levels, impacting cardiovascular regulation and sympathetic nervous system function (Shibao2020Congenital).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYB561 gene are linked to a novel autosomal recessive orthostatic hypotension syndrome. This condition is characterized by severe orthostatic hypotension, recurrent hypoglycemia, and low norepinephrine levels, resembling dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency but with normal DβH activity (van2018Mutations). The syndrome is more severe than DβH deficiency, with additional complications such as renal insufficiency and reduced life expectancy due to hypotensive crises or profound hypoglycemia (van2018Mutations). Mutations such as a missense variant c.262G>A, p.Gly88Arg, and a nonsense mutation c.131G>A, p.Trp44* have been identified in affected individuals (van2018Mutations).

Altered expression of CYB561 is also associated with various cancers. In breast cancer, elevated CYB561 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly M2 macrophages, which may influence tumor progression (Zhuo2024CYB561). In castration-resistant prostate cancer, CYB561 supports the neuroendocrine phenotype, contributing to therapy resistance and aggressive tumor behavior (Azur2024CYB561). These findings suggest that CYB561 plays a significant role in both cardiovascular and cancer-related pathologies.
