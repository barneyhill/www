# SPX

## Overview
The SPX gene encodes the spexin hormone, a neuropeptide involved in various physiological processes, including metabolism, energy balance, and stress response. Spexin is categorized as a peptide hormone and functions as a ligand for galanin receptors GALR2 and GALR3, influencing feeding behavior, glucose metabolism, and lipid uptake. The gene is located on chromosome 12 in humans, and the mature spexin peptide consists of 14 amino acids, characterized by a conserved α-helical structure crucial for receptor interaction (Lim2019Evolution; DARAKCI2022Structure). Spexin's expression in both central and peripheral tissues highlights its role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and its altered levels have been associated with conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Türkel2022Impact; Liu2019Spexin).

## Structure
The spexin (SPX) hormone is a neuropeptide encoded by the SPX gene, located on chromosome 12 in humans. The mature peptide consists of 14 amino acids with the sequence NWTPQAMLYLKGAQ, which is highly conserved across vertebrate species (Lim2019Evolution; DARAKCI2022Structure). The primary structure of SPX includes a signal peptide and two dibasic pro-hormone cleavage sites, with the mature peptide sequence encoded by the third and fourth exons (Lim2019Evolution).

The secondary structure of SPX is characterized by an α-helical region extending from amino acids 5 to 14, as observed in both human and mouse models (Wong2021Mousea; DARAKCI2022Structure). This helical structure is crucial for its interaction with receptors, particularly the GALR2 and GALR3 receptors, through specific residues such as Lys 11, which is the only charged residue in the helical region (Wong2021Mousea).

SPX is phylogenetically related to the GAL/KISS peptide family and is closer to the GAL family. It can activate GAL2 and GAL3 receptors but not GAL1 receptors, indicating its role as an endogenous ligand for these receptors (DARAKCI2022Structure). The peptide is involved in various physiological functions, including food intake, metabolism, and stress response (DARAKCI2022Structure).

## Function
Spexin (SPX) is a peptide hormone encoded by the SPX gene, involved in various physiological processes in humans. It is highly expressed in endocrine and epithelial tissues, including the adrenal gland, pancreas, and visceral fat, suggesting its role in transepithelial transport and epithelial cell renewal (Gu2015Spexin). In the central nervous system, spexin is found in the hypothalamus, where it influences autonomic functions such as food intake regulation and glucose metabolism (Pałasz2021Spexinexpressing).

Spexin acts as a natural satiety-inducing peptide, regulating feeding behavior, energy utilization, and body weight. It is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, with a negative correlation observed between spexin levels and blood glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test, indicating its role in glucose homeostasis (Gu2015Spexin). Spexin also affects lipid metabolism, as it is known to reduce long chain fatty acid uptake in adipocytes, which may contribute to its role in energy balance and weight regulation (Walewski2014Spexin).

The peptide functions as a ligand for galanin receptors GALR2 and GALR3, influencing various biological effects, including energy homeostasis and cognitive functions (Pałasz2021Spexinexpressing). Its expression and activity in both central and peripheral tissues highlight its significance in maintaining metabolic processes and overall organismal energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPX gene, which encodes the spexin hormone, have been linked to several metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Reduced levels of spexin are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. In obese individuals, spexin levels are inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI), insulin, and age, suggesting its role in energy regulation and lipid metabolism (ElSaka2021Effect; Türkel2022Impact). 

In the context of cardiovascular diseases, spexin has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-induced metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating its potential therapeutic role in ischemic conditions and heart failure (Liu2019Spexin). Spexin's involvement in lipid metabolism is further highlighted by its ability to decrease hepatic lipids and liver enzymes in models of hepatic steatosis, suggesting a protective role against liver-related metabolic disorders (DARAKCI2022Structure).

In renal dysfunction, particularly in the context of obesity, spexin has demonstrated protective effects by improving insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and reducing renal oxidative stress and inflammation. These effects are mediated through its interaction with galanin receptor-2 (GALR-2) (ElSaka2021Effect). Overall, spexin's regulatory roles in metabolism and its altered expression in various diseases underscore its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Spexin (SPX) is known to interact with galanin receptors, specifically GALR2 and GALR3. These interactions are significant as SPX acts as a natural ligand for these receptors, activating them and influencing various physiological processes. The activation of GALR2 and GALR3 by SPX has been demonstrated through experiments using HEK293-Gqi cells, where SPX treatment increased SRE-luc activity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating functional interaction (Kim2014Coevolution). 

SPX's interaction with GALR2 and GALR3 is supported by phylogenetic analyses, which suggest that SPX is evolutionarily closer to the galanin family than to the kisspeptin family, indicating a shared evolutionary origin (Kim2014Coevolution). The binding assays conducted with human GALR2 and GALR3 further confirm SPX's role as a ligand for these receptors, highlighting its potential involvement in regulating feeding behavior, energy metabolism, and reproductive hormone release (Kim2014Coevolution).

In addition to its receptor interactions, SPX expression is regulated by factors such as palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, which can elevate the expression of SPX, GALR2, and GALR3 mRNA in GnRH neurons. This regulation involves signaling pathways like MAPK and PKC, suggesting a complex network of interactions that influence SPX's role in reproductive and metabolic functions (Wang2020Palmitate).
