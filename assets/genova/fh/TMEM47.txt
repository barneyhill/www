# TMEM47

## Overview
TMEM47 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 47, a member of the PMP22/EMP/Claudin superfamily, which is primarily involved in cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in the regulation of epithelial cell junction maturation and morphogenesis. TMEM47 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in the organization of cell junctions, particularly adherens junctions, by interacting with proteins such as E-cadherin and β-catenin. It also influences actomyosin contractility, affecting cell morphology and surface area. The protein's function is conserved across species, and it has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including drug resistance in cancer and potential roles in neurological disorders (Charng2016Exome; Men2021Overexpression; Dong2016Vertebrate).

## Structure
TMEM47 is a tetraspan protein characterized by four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its structural configuration. These domains create one intracellular and two extracellular loops, with both the amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-termini predicted to be intracellular (Dong2016Vertebrate). The C-terminal domain is crucial for the protein's proper localization and function, as its deletion results in mislocalization and failure to rescue certain phenotypes in experimental models (Dong2016Vertebrate). 

TMEM47 is part of the PMP22/EMP/Claudin superfamily, which is known for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. Although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, TMEM47's interaction with other proteins suggests a complex role in cellular junctions. It associates with adherens junction proteins and tight junction proteins such as Par6B and aPKCl, indicating its involvement in junctional maturation and morphogenesis (Dong2016Vertebrate).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing TMEM47's function and localization. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which can affect its structural and functional properties.

## Function
TMEM47 is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of epithelial cell junction maturation and morphogenesis. It is part of the PMP22/EMP/Claudin family and plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and function by influencing the organization of cell junctions. TMEM47 is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is expressed during kidney development, where it regulates the activity of Fyn, a protein involved in cell signaling (Dong2016Vertebrate).

In epithelial cells, TMEM47 is positioned developmentally between adherens junction and tight junction assembly. It colocalizes with adherens junction proteins such as E-cadherin and β-catenin, but not with tight junction proteins, indicating its specific role in adherens junction organization (Dong2016Vertebrate). TMEM47 influences the dynamics of F-actin polymerization, which is crucial for the localization and assembly of tight junctions (Dong2016Vertebrate).

The protein's interaction with the actomyosin machinery suggests its involvement in regulating actomyosin contractility, which affects apical surface area and cell morphology. Overexpression of TMEM47 leads to increased levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain and reduced apical surface area, while knockdown results in expanded surface area, highlighting its role in actomyosin-driven morphogenesis (Dong2016Vertebrate). TMEM47's function is conserved across species, as evidenced by its ability to rescue morphological defects in C. elegans vab-9 mutants (Dong2016Vertebrate).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM47 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily through its role in drug resistance in cancer. In breast cancer, overexpression of TMEM47 is associated with resistance to tamoxifen, a common treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Studies have shown that TMEM47 is significantly upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells, leading to decreased apoptosis and increased drug resistance. Knocking down TMEM47 in these cells increases their sensitivity to tamoxifen, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for tamoxifen resistance (Men2021Overexpression).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM47 is linked to chemoresistance, particularly to cisplatin-based treatments. TMEM47 expression is higher in HCC patients who do not respond to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with cisplatin. Overexpression of TMEM47 in HCC cells enhances resistance to cisplatin, while its inhibition increases drug sensitivity by promoting apoptosis and reducing the expression of drug metabolism and efflux genes (Ng2020Clinical).

TMEM47 has also been identified as a candidate gene in neurological disorders through exome sequencing studies, although its specific role in these conditions requires further investigation (Charng2016Exome). Additionally, TMEM47 is involved in a genetic inversion associated with X-linked muscular dystrophy in Labrador retrievers, although the gene itself is not disrupted (Barthélémy2020Xlinked).

## Interactions
TMEM47 is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of epithelial cell junction maturation and morphogenesis. It associates with adherens junction proteins such as E-cadherin and β-catenin, colocalizing along the lateral membrane in MDCK cells (Dong2016Vertebrate). TMEM47 also interacts with components of the Par protein complex, specifically co-immunoprecipitating with aPKCl and Par6B, although these interactions are described as weak or transient (Dong2016Vertebrate). Overexpression of TMEM47 disrupts the junctional localization of Par6B and aPKCl, indicating a regulatory role in their localization (Dong2016Vertebrate).

TMEM47's interactions extend to the actomyosin machinery, influencing F-actin polymerization and phosphorylated myosin light chain levels, which suggests a role in regulating actomyosin-driven apical morphogenesis (Dong2016Vertebrate). It does not co-immunoprecipitate with tight junction proteins like occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1, and Par3, highlighting its distinct interaction profile (Dong2016Vertebrate). These interactions position TMEM47 as a key regulator in the transition from adherens to tight junctions, affecting the localization and assembly of tight junction proteins (Dong2016Vertebrate).
