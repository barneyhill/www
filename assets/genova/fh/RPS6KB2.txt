# RPS6KB2

## Overview
RPS6KB2 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase B2 (S6K2), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the mTOR signaling pathway. This kinase is integral to the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival by phosphorylating the ribosomal protein S6, thereby enhancing protein synthesis (Sridharan2020Distinct; Yi2021Ribosomal). S6K2 is distinguished from its homolog S6K1 by its nuclear localization sequence, which allows it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, a process modulated by growth factor-induced phosphorylation (Sridharan2020Distinct). The protein's involvement in the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway underscores its importance in cellular metabolism and energy balance, influencing cell size, proliferation, and glucose homeostasis (Meyuhas2009Chapter). Additionally, RPS6KB2 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to different clinical outcomes, particularly in breast and colon cancers (Slattery2011Genetic; Ilozumba2022mTOR).

## Structure
RPS6KB2, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase B2, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the mTOR signaling pathway. The protein is part of the S6 kinase family and has a modular structure comprising an N-terminal regulatory region, a kinase domain, a kinase extension domain, and a C-terminal regulatory region (Sridharan2020Distinct). The C-terminal region includes a proline-rich domain, which may interact with SH3-domain containing proteins, contributing to its wide spectrum of substrates (Sridharan2020Distinct; Sever2018S6K2).

RPS6KB2 exists in two isoforms, p54 and p56, produced through alternative translation start sites. The p56 isoform contains an additional 13 amino acids at the N-terminal region, which includes a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS), making it predominantly nuclear. In contrast, the p54 isoform is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Sridharan2020Distinct; Sever2018S6K2).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in the activation of RPS6KB2. Phosphorylation occurs at serine sites (S417/420/423) by ERK and at a threonine site (T388) by mTOR, which are essential for its activation and function in cellular growth and survival (Sever2018S6K2).

## Function
RPS6KB2 encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-2 (S6K2), a serine/threonine kinase involved in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. S6K2 phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), a process that enhances protein synthesis and is essential for cell growth and survival (Sridharan2020Distinct; Yi2021Ribosomal). Unlike its close homolog S6K1, S6K2 contains a nuclear localization sequence, allowing it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This shuttling is regulated by growth factor-induced phosphorylation, which affects its localization and function (Sridharan2020Distinct).

S6K2 is suggested to be the principal kinase for rpS6 phosphorylation, a critical event in cell growth regulation (Sridharan2020Distinct). The activity of S6K2 is regulated by dephosphorylation through PHLPP, which is upregulated by mTORC1, indicating its role in the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway (Yi2021Ribosomal). S6K2's involvement in these pathways highlights its importance in cellular metabolism and energy balance, contributing to the regulation of cell size, proliferation, and glucose homeostasis (Meyuhas2009Chapter).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPS6KB2 gene, which encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase B2, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, RPS6KB2 is associated with different clinical outcomes depending on its expression levels and genetic alterations. Studies have shown that RPS6KB2 is under-expressed in breast tumors from Black women compared to White women, which may contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer mortality (Ilozumba2022mTOR). Over-expression of RPS6KB2 is linked to higher-grade tumors and HER2+ status, although these associations were not statistically significant (Ilozumba2022mTOR). 

RPS6KB2 amplification and increased mRNA expression have been observed in primary breast tumors, correlating with positive estrogen receptor (ER) status and potentially predicting responsiveness to tamoxifen treatment (PérezTenorio2010Clinical). In metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, significant amplification of RPS6KB2 suggests its role in disease progression (Saravia2019Patterns). 

In colon cancer, genetic variations in RPS6KB2 have been associated with an increased risk, highlighting its potential role in the carcinogenic process (Slattery2011Genetic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RPS6KB2 in cancer prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
RPS6KB2, also known as p54-S6K2, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the mTOR signaling pathway. It interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes such as transcription, splicing, and ribosome biogenesis. RPS6KB2 predominantly localizes to the nucleus and nucleolus, where it interacts with proteins like nucleolin (NCL), PARP1, ILF3, and XRCC6 (Pavan2016Different). These interactions suggest its involvement in mRNA splicing, DNA conformation changes, and translational initiation (Pavan2016Different).

RPS6KB2 also co-localizes with FMRP and FXR1 in cytoplasmic granules, indicating potential interactions in stress granules, which are involved in mRNA storage during cellular stress (Pavan2016Different). It phosphorylates hnRNPA1, a protein involved in RNA binding, in an FGF-2-dependent manner, promoting the translation of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL and XIAP (Roy2014hnRNPA1). This phosphorylation enhances cap-independent translation from the IRESs of these mRNAs, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where RPS6KB2 modulates specific mRNA translation through hnRNPA1 (Roy2014hnRNPA1).

RPS6KB2 is also implicated in DNA repair processes, interacting with proteins such as XRCC5, XRCC6, and PARP1, indicating a role in DNA repair and apoptotic processes (Pavan2016Different).
