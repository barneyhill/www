# ABRAXAS2

## Overview
ABRAXAS2 is a gene that encodes the protein abraxas 2, a critical component of the BRISC (BRCC36 isopeptidase complex) involved in cellular deubiquitination processes. This protein functions as a scaffold within the BRISC complex, facilitating the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins, which is essential for regulating protein stability and function. Abraxas 2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and modulating cellular responses to DNA damage. Additionally, it is involved in the regulation of Type I interferon signaling, highlighting its importance in immune response modulation. The interactions of abraxas 2 with other proteins, such as BRCC36 and BRCA1, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer development when mutated or dysregulated (Ma2020Quantitative; Chandler2024Molecular).

## Function
ABRAXAS2, also known as the BRISC complex subunit, plays a crucial role in deubiquitination processes within cells. It is a central scaffold protein in the BRISC (BRCC36 isopeptidase complex), which is involved in the removal of ubiquitin from proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. This activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular responses to DNA damage (Ma2020Quantitative; Chandler2024Molecular).

ABRAXAS2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it assembles various components of the BRISC complex and retains it in this cellular compartment (Ma2020Quantitative). It is involved in regulating the localization of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage, which is critical for DNA repair processes (Ma2020Quantitative). The interaction of ABRAXAS2 with other proteins, such as BRCC36, is important for the enzymatic activity and cellular localization of the BRISC complex (Chandler2024Molecular).

The BRISC complex, with ABRAXAS2 as a component, is also implicated in the regulation of Type I interferon signaling, which is relevant for immune response modulation (Chandler2024Molecular). This highlights the multifaceted role of ABRAXAS2 in cellular processes that are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ABRAXAS2 gene have been implicated in the development of certain cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancers. This gene plays a critical role in the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability. When ABRAXAS2 is mutated or its expression is dysregulated, the integrity of the genome can be compromised, leading to increased susceptibility to cancer. The gene's involvement in the BRISC complex is crucial for its function, and disruptions in its interactions with other proteins within this complex can further exacerbate genomic instability. This instability is a known factor in the initiation and progression of cancer, as it can lead to the accumulation of additional genetic alterations that drive tumorigenesis. The precise mechanisms by which ABRAXAS2 mutations contribute to cancer development are still under investigation, but its role in DNA repair highlights its importance in preventing malignant transformation. Understanding the clinical significance of ABRAXAS2 mutations and expression changes is vital for developing targeted therapies and improving cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
ABRAXAS2, also known as the BRISC complex subunit, is involved in several critical protein interactions within the BRISC and BRCA1-A complexes. In the BRISC complex, ABRAXAS2 forms a core component alongside BRCC36, interacting with SHMT2 and BRCC45. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the BRISC complex, which plays a role in immune signaling. Mutations in ABRAXAS2, such as A142R, E144A, and E144R, can disrupt its interaction with SHMT2, leading to altered immune responses (Walden2019Metabolic).

ABRAXAS2 is also part of the BRCA1-A complex, where it interacts with BRCA1 and RAP80. This complex is essential for the DNA damage response, particularly in the formation of DNA damage-induced foci. The interaction between ABRAXAS2 and BRCA1 is mediated through a phospho-SPXF motif, which is crucial for recruiting BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage (Wang2007Abraxas). These interactions highlight the role of ABRAXAS2 in maintaining genomic stability and regulating immune signaling pathways.
