# EVX2

## Overview
The EVX2 gene encodes the even-skipped homeobox 2 protein, which is a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors. These proteins are critical in regulating gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation of body structures. EVX2 is located within the HOXD gene cluster, a region known for its role in limb and skeletal development. The protein encoded by EVX2 is involved in the regulation of developmental processes, and its proper function is essential for normal limb formation. Disruptions in the EVX2 gene, such as deletions or amplifications, have been linked to various developmental disorders, including synpolydactyly and split-hand/foot malformation, as well as certain ovarian teratomas (Goodman2002A; Wang2024Amplifications).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EVX2 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, particularly affecting limb formation. A notable condition linked to EVX2 is synpolydactyly (SPD), characterized by the presence of extra fingers or toes that are often fused together. This condition can result from a 117-kb microdeletion that removes the EVX2 gene along with the HOXD9-HOXD13 cluster, leading to haploinsufficiency of these genes, which are crucial for limb development (Goodman2002A). The deletion disrupts regulatory elements, potentially misdirecting the expression of other HOXD genes, contributing to the SPD phenotype (Goodman2002A).

In addition to SPD, EVX2 is implicated in split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM), a condition involving limb malformations. Larger deletions encompassing the entire HOXD cluster, including EVX2, have been associated with SHFM, suggesting a distinct genetic basis compared to SPD (Goodman2002A).

Furthermore, amplifications of EVX2, along with the HOXD cluster, have been identified in mature cystic teratomas of the ovary. These genetic changes may contribute to the characteristics of teratomas, particularly in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, although the specific role of EVX2 in these processes is not fully detailed (Wang2024Amplifications).
