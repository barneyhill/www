# ABHD17A

## Overview
ABHD17A is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 17A, a depalmitoylase enzyme involved in the regulation of protein palmitoylation. This protein is categorized as a depalmitoylase due to its role in removing palmitate groups from proteins, a post-translational modification that influences protein localization and function. ABHD17A is characterized by an acylated N-terminal helix and a conserved loop, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with cellular membranes (Holme2024An). The protein plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways by regulating the palmitoylation status of key proteins such as N-Ras, impacting processes like cell growth and differentiation (Lin2015ABHD17). ABHD17A's activity is crucial for maintaining proper cellular functions and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and immune disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Remsberg2021ABHD17; Dixon2023Attenuating).

## Structure
The ABHD17A protein is characterized by an acylated N-terminal helix and a conserved loop, both of which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and membrane interaction. The N-terminal helix contains four cysteine residues that undergo S-acylation, a post-translational modification essential for the protein's localization to the plasma membrane and its enzymatic function (Holme2024An). This acylation aids in the insertion of the N-terminal helix into the lipid bilayer, facilitating the proper orientation of the substrate binding pocket (Holme2024An). The N-terminal helix and the adjacent loop penetrate the membrane to specific depths, with the N-helix reaching approximately 11 Å and the loop about 1 Å into the membrane (Holme2024An).

The loop contains hydrophobic residues, such as F222, Y229, and F231, which are important for the enzyme's activity and membrane insertion (Holme2024An). The N-helix and loop frame the substrate-binding pocket, which is a hydrophobic cavity near the membrane, with the catalytic serine positioned for substrate depalmitoylation (Holme2024An). The structure of ABHD17A, including its acylated N-terminus and conserved loop, is shared among all three ABHD17 proteins, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism (Holme2024An).

## Function
ABHD17A is a protein that functions as a depalmitoylase, playing a crucial role in the regulation of protein palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that affects protein localization and function. In healthy human cells, ABHD17A is involved in the dynamic regulation of palmitate turnover on proteins such as N-Ras, which is essential for its proper subcellular localization and signaling activity. This process is independent of other known depalmitoylases like APT1 and APT2 (Lin2015ABHD17).

ABHD17A is targeted to cellular membranes by an acylated N-terminal cysteine cluster, which is crucial for its membrane localization and enzymatic activity. This acylation allows ABHD17A to interact with the plasma membrane and endosomes, facilitating the depalmitoylation of membrane-associated proteins (Holme2024An). The protein's activity is regulated by the insertion of its acylated N-terminal helix and a conserved loop into the membrane, which positions the substrate binding pocket optimally for lipid extraction (Holme2024An).

ABHD17A's function in depalmitoylation is significant for cellular signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell growth and differentiation, and it may have implications for cancer cell growth (Remsberg2021ABHD17; Lin2015ABHD17).

## Clinical Significance
ABHD17A is implicated in several diseases due to its role in depalmitoylation, which affects protein localization and function. Alterations in ABHD17A expression or its interactions can significantly impact cancer progression. In particular, ABHD17A is involved in the depalmitoylation of N-Ras, a process crucial for Ras signaling and cancer growth. Inhibiting ABHD17A can impair N-Ras signaling and reduce the growth of NRAS-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in N-Ras-driven cancers (Remsberg2021ABHD17; Lin2015ABHD17).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ABHD17A-mediated depalmitoylation of Rap2b affects cell migration and invasion. This process relocates Rap2b from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, suppressing cell migration and invasion, which could have implications for CRC metastasis (Zhu2024Inhibiting).

ABHD17A also plays a role in the regulation of NOD2, an immune receptor associated with Crohn's disease. Inhibiting ABHD17A can enhance the membrane localization and signaling of NOD2, potentially rescuing the function of certain Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 variants (Dixon2023Attenuating). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ABHD17A in various diseases, particularly in cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
ABHD17A is involved in the depalmitoylation of proteins, a process that influences their localization and function. It interacts with N-Ras, a protein involved in signaling pathways, by removing palmitate groups, which affects N-Ras's subcellular localization. This interaction is crucial for regulating N-Ras palmitate turnover and its localization within the cell, particularly at the plasma membrane and endosomes (Lin2015ABHD17). ABHD17A is also implicated in the regulation of BK channels, specifically deacylating the STREX domain, which affects channel activity. This interaction is site-specific and does not affect other domains of the BK channel, indicating a selective role in modulating channel function (McClafferty2020Sitespecific).

The protein's activity is regulated by its structural elements, including an S-acylated N-terminal helix and a conserved loop, which are essential for its interaction with lipid bilayers and substrate engagement. These elements help stabilize the conformation of the binding pocket, facilitating interactions with acylated peptides (Holme2024An). While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, ABHD17A's role in depalmitoylation suggests it may participate in transient interactions with various palmitoylated proteins.
