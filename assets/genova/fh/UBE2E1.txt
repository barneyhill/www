# UBE2E1

## Overview
UBE2E1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1, a pivotal component in the ubiquitination pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins through the attachment of ubiquitin molecules. UBE2E1 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, DNA repair, and chromatin modification, by facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E1 activating enzymes to substrate proteins, often in conjunction with E3 ligases (Wu2024Structureguided; Wheaton2017UbE2E1/UBCH6). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression, particularly through its interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and its role in histone modification (Wheaton2017UbE2E1/UBCH6). UBE2E1's function and interactions have significant implications in health and disease, including its involvement in cancer prognosis and ciliopathies (Luo2016Microarraybased; Szymanska2020Regulation).

## Structure
UBE2E1 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process. The protein contains a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is responsible for binding to E1 and E3 enzymes, although UBE2E1 can also function independently of E3 ligases in certain contexts (Wu2024Structureguided).

The crystal structure of UBE2E1 has been determined in complex with other proteins, such as the TRIM21 RING domain and a SETDB1-derived hexapeptide. These studies reveal that UBE2E1 can form a complex with TRIM21, where specific residues like Asp 133 and Asp 163 are involved in lysine anchoring and substrate-induced communication (Anandapadamanaban2019E3). The interaction with the hexapeptide shows that UBE2E1 recognizes the peptide in an L-shaped conformation, with specific residues forming critical interactions (Wu2024Structureguided).

In terms of quaternary structure, UBE2E1 can form complexes with multiple protein partners, including forming a ternary complex with ubiquitin and TRIM21 (Anandapadamanaban2019E3). The structural insights from these complexes provide a model for understanding the ubiquitination process in other E2-RING complexes.

## Function
UBE2E1, also known as UbcH6, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (uH2AK119) in healthy human cells. This modification is primarily mediated by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which is essential for gene silencing and chromatin modification (Wheaton2017UbE2E1/UBCH6). UBE2E1 interacts with PRC1 components, such as Ring1A and Ring1B, and is necessary for the PRC1-catalyzed ubiquitination of H2A, which is linked to the transcriptional repression of the INK4a/ARF locus, a critical region for cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression (Wheaton2017UbE2E1/UBCH6).

UBE2E1 is also involved in self-ubiquitination, a process that regulates its activity. This self-ubiquitination is enhanced by interacting E3 ligases and can be modulated by the deubiquitinase USP7, which prevents UBE2E1 degradation (Banka2015RING). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular processes such as DNA repair and response to stress (Banka2015RING). UBE2E1's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive ubiquitination, which could lead to uncontrolled cell growth (Banka2015RING).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2E1 has been identified as a significant prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression levels of UBE2E1 are associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in AML patients. This correlation was validated in an independent cohort, indicating that UBE2E1 expression could serve as a predictor for chemotherapy response. Patients with lower UBE2E1 expression were more likely to achieve complete remission, while those with higher expression were more likely to have no response to chemotherapy (Luo2016Microarraybased).

UBE2E1 also plays a role in ciliogenesis and interacts with the MKS1 protein. Mutations or loss of UBE2E1 lead to defects in ciliogenesis, characterized by reduced cilia incidence and length. This dysfunction is linked to deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is a hallmark of ciliopathy disease states. The interaction between UBE2E1 and MKS1 is crucial for maintaining regulated levels of β-catenin, and dysregulation can contribute to ciliopathies such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Joubert syndrome (Szymanska2020Regulation).

## Interactions
UBE2E1, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence its function in ubiquitination processes. UBE2E1 interacts with ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), which deubiquitinates UBE2E1, maintaining its steady-state levels in cells. This interaction is crucial for modulating the balance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by coupling ubiquitination and deubiquitination activities (Sarkari2013Ubiquitinspecific).

UBE2E1 also forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21. The crystal structure of this complex reveals a substrate-targeting mode where UBE2E1 captures a ubiquitin-targeted TRIM21 substrate lysine in its active site. This interaction is essential for TRIM21's ubiquitination activity, highlighting the role of UBE2E1 in substrate selectivity and ubiquitin transfer (Anandapadamanaban2019E3).

Additionally, UBE2E1 interacts with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), specifically Ring1A and Ring1B/BMI1, facilitating the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119. This interaction underscores UBE2E1's role in chromatin modification and gene regulation (Wheaton2017UbE2E1/UBCH6).
