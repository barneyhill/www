# CCDC17

## Overview
CCDC17 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 17, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These domains are typically involved in structural support and intracellular transport. The CCDC17 protein is predominantly expressed in ciliated cells, where it is believed to play a crucial role in ciliary function, particularly in the ciliary axoneme, a key structural component of cilia. Immunostaining studies have localized CCDC17 to both the ciliary tip and the basal body region, suggesting its involvement in processes at these sites, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated (Blackburn2017Quantitative; Lindskog2014The). As a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family, CCDC17 is integral to the proper functioning of cilia, and its interactions within the ciliary structure are of significant interest for understanding ciliary biology and related cellular processes (Hu2019The).

## Structure


## Function
CCDC17 is a protein encoded by the CCDC17 gene, characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are often involved in structural support and intracellular transport. In healthy human cells, CCDC17 is primarily expressed in ciliated cells, where it is thought to play a role in ciliary function. Immunostaining studies have shown that CCDC17 localizes to both the ciliary tip and the basal body region, suggesting its involvement in processes occurring at these sites, although its specific function remains unclear (Blackburn2017Quantitative; Lindskog2014The).

The protein is not detectable in undifferentiated cells but is present in differentiated ciliated cells and isolated ciliary axonemes, indicating its role as an integral component of the ciliary axoneme (Blackburn2017Quantitative). CCDC17 is also part of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family, which is crucial for cilia function in ciliated cells (Hu2019The). Despite its expression pattern and localization, the exact molecular activities and organismal outcomes of CCDC17's involvement in ciliary biology are not well-characterized, necessitating further research to elucidate its precise roles in cellular and physiological processes (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CCDC17 is a protein that has been identified as a significant component of the ciliary axoneme, particularly in human airway cilia. It is one of the most abundant proteins in the axonemal proteome, suggesting a substantial role in ciliary structure or function (Blackburn2017Quantitative). Immunostaining of CCDC17 reveals a bi-modal pattern with strong signals at both the ciliary tip and the basal body region, indicating its potential involvement in ciliary biology (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

While specific interactions of CCDC17 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, it is known to be part of the ciliary structure, which inherently involves interactions with other ciliary proteins. The coiled-coil domains of CCDC17 suggest it may participate in protein-protein interactions, potentially forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in transient interactions that influence cellular processes (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

In the context of ubiquitin ligase complexes, CCDC17 has been studied for its interaction with ASB7, a substrate receptor in the CRL5 ubiquitin ligase complex. ASB7 binds strongly to CCDC17 degrons in vitro, with a dissociation constant indicating a low-micromolar affinity, suggesting a direct binding interaction (Zhou2024Molecular). However, specific interactions of CCDC17 with other proteins or nucleic acids outside of this context are not detailed in the available literature.
