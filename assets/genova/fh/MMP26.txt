# MMP26

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 26 (MMP26) is a gene that encodes a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, which are zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components. The protein product, also known as MMP-26, is characterized by a minimal domain structure, lacking the hemopexin-like domain found in many other MMPs, and is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues. MMP-26 plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling and repair processes, particularly in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle, and is regulated by steroid hormones such as estradiol and progesterone. It is capable of cleaving a variety of extracellular matrix proteins and activating other MMPs, such as pro-MMP-9, which further implicates it in processes like cellular migration and cancer progression. The gene's expression is notably altered in various cancers, including those of the prostate, breast, and endometrium, where it may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (MARCHENKO2001Characterization; Pilka2003Epithelial; Semaan2013MMP26).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 26 (MMP26) is a unique member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, characterized by its minimal domain structure. The protein consists of 261 amino acids and includes a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and a catalytic domain, but notably lacks the hemopexin-like domain common to other MMPs (Mu2013Efficient; Semaan2013MMP26). The propeptide domain contains a distinctive 'cysteine-switch' motif, PHCGVPD, which features a histidine residue instead of the typical arginine, contributing to its unique activation mechanism (MARCHENKO2001Characterization; Park2000Identification).

The catalytic domain of MMP26 includes a conserved zinc-binding motif, HEIGHSLGLQHS, essential for its proteolytic activity (MARCHENKO2001Characterization). MMP26 has three cysteine residues, with the potential for a disulfide bridge between two of them, which may contribute to a more rigid structure (MARCHENKO2001Characterization). The protein also contains three possible N-linked glycosylation sites, which may play a role in its stability and function (Semaan2013MMP26).

MMP26 is primarily expressed intracellularly and has a wide substrate specificity, including extracellular matrix proteins and non-ECM proteins (Mu2013Efficient). Its structure and unique features suggest it may have specific biological and pathological functions distinct from other MMPs (Park2000Identification).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 26 (MMP-26) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, playing a significant role in tissue remodeling and repair processes. In healthy human cells, MMP-26 is expressed in epithelial cells of the endometrium and is involved in the regulation of ECM components, contributing to tissue remodeling during the menstrual cycle (Pilka2003Epithelial; Isaka2002Matrix). Its expression peaks at mid-cycle, suggesting a role in reproductive processes, particularly in the transition from the proliferative to the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (Pilka2003Epithelial).

MMP-26 is capable of cleaving a variety of ECM and plasma proteins, including type IV collagen, fibronectin, and gelatin, and it can activate pro-MMP-9, which is involved in further ECM degradation (Liu2010GnRH; Semaan2013MMP26). This proteolytic activity is crucial for processes such as cellular migration and tissue remodeling. MMP-26 is also regulated by steroid hormones like estradiol and progesterone, indicating its involvement in hormonally driven processes (Pilka2003Epithelial). The enzyme's activity is inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which modulate its function in ECM remodeling (Semaan2013MMP26).

## Clinical Significance
MMP26, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 26, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, MMP26 plays a role in activating MMP-9, which is involved in early skin carcinogenesis, suggesting its contribution to tumor progression (Gobin2019A). The gene is specifically expressed in epithelial carcinomas, such as those of the lung, breast, endometrium, and prostate, with limited expression in normal tissues, indicating its potential role in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (MARCHENKO2002Promoter).

The regulation of MMP26 involves transcription factors like TCF-4 and AP-1, which are crucial for its expression in cancer cells. Mutations in these regulatory motifs can significantly affect MMP26 transcriptional activity, highlighting the gene's stringent regulation in epithelial cancers (MARCHENKO2002Promoter). In breast cancer, high expression of MMP26 is associated with prolonged survival, suggesting a complex role in cancer prognosis (Cheng2022Landscape).

Despite its involvement in cancer, MMP26 does not show significant correlation with immune cell infiltration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, indicating a lack of interaction with the immune microenvironment in this context (Liu2023Identification).

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 26 (MMP-26) interacts with various proteins, primarily through its enzymatic activity and regulatory mechanisms. MMP-26 is known to cleave several extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin, vitronectin, and denatured collagen, which suggests its involvement in tissue remodeling and cancer progression (MARCHENKO2001Characterization). 

MMP-26 also interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which regulate its activity. TIMP-4 is identified as a potent inhibitor of MMP-26, and their expression is notably higher in preinvasive stages of prostate and breast cancers (Lee2006Coordinated). Although co-immunoprecipitation studies show limited evidence of complex formation between MMP-26 and TIMP-4, immunostaining suggests possible colocalization in prostate cancer tissues (Lee2006Coordinated). 

MMP-26 can also activate progelatinase B (pro-MMP-9), which is crucial for extracellular matrix remodeling, further implicating its role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Lee2006Coordinated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MMP-26 in modulating the extracellular environment and influencing cancer progression.
