# SMYD1

## Overview
SMYD1 is a gene that encodes the protein SET and MYND domain containing 1, which is a member of the SMYD family of histone methyltransferases. This protein is characterized by the presence of SET and MYND domains, which are crucial for its role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. The SET domain confers methyltransferase activity, allowing the protein to transfer methyl groups to lysine residues on histone proteins, thereby influencing transcriptional activation. The MYND domain, a zinc finger motif, facilitates protein-protein interactions. SMYD1 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it plays a vital role in muscle development and function. It is involved in the regulation of myocardial differentiation and is essential for cardiac development, acting through pathways such as GSK3β/β-catenin and ERK signaling. Alterations in SMYD1 expression or mutations in the gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and certain cancers (Tracy2018The; AbuFarha2011Proteomic; Chang2024SMYD1).

## Structure
SMYD1 is a protein characterized by the presence of SET and MYND domains, which are integral to its function in chromatin modification. The SET domain is associated with methyltransferase activity, facilitating the transfer of methyl groups to lysine residues on histone proteins, a key process in gene regulation (AbuFarha2011Proteomic). The MYND domain, a zinc finger motif, is involved in protein-protein interactions and is organized around two zinc atoms chelated by cysteines and histidine (Zhang2022Unique). 

SMYD1 shares structural similarities with other SMYD family proteins, such as SMYD2 and SMYD3, including a TPR-like domain at the C-terminus (AbuFarha2011Proteomic). The protein's structure includes a split-SET domain, which is a common feature among SMYD proteins, contributing to substrate binding and enzymatic activity (Foreman2011Structural). 

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as methylation, which are crucial for its function. SMYD1 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization within the cell (AbuFarha2011Proteomic). These structural features enable SMYD1 to play a significant role in muscle development and chromatin modification.

## Function
The SMYD1 gene encodes a histone methyltransferase that plays a critical role in cardiac and skeletal muscle development. It primarily targets histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 36 (H3K36), influencing transcriptional activation and gene expression regulation (Tracy2018The). SMYD1 is involved in the regulation of myocardial differentiation, essential for cardiac development and function. It acts as a transcriptional activator of GSK3β through histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), impacting the GSK3β/β-catenin and ERK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cardiac progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation (Chang2024SMYD1).

In healthy human cells, SMYD1 is expressed in the heart from fetal development into adulthood, suggesting its role in maintaining heart homeostasis (Tracy2018The). It also modulates oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses by methylating non-histone targets like TRB3, which is involved in stress response pathways (Rasmussen2015Smyd1). SMYD1's activity is crucial for the proper proliferation and differentiation of cardiomyocytes, and its loss can lead to impaired cell proliferation and activation of stress pathways, contributing to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Rasmussen2015Smyd1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SMYD1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. The R320Q missense mutation in SMYD1 is associated with the AnWj-negative blood group phenotype, which can complicate blood transfusions due to the scarcity of compatible blood units. This mutation is suggested to disrupt the protein's structure and function, as indicated by 3D protein modeling and evolutionary conservation analysis (Yahalom2018SMYD1). The AnWj-negative phenotype is also linked to clinical disorders such as lymphoid malignancies, immunologic disorders, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Yahalom2018SMYD1).

In the context of cancer, SMYD1 expression is differentially regulated in various tumors. It is significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, while its expression is higher in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Liu2021Comprehensive). SMYD1 mutations have been implicated in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) and show a mutation frequency of 9% in esophageal carcinoma, 3% in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and 4% in stomach adenocarcinoma (Liu2021Comprehensive). These alterations suggest a potential role for SMYD1 in tumorigenesis and as a marker for prognostic prediction in certain cancers.

## Interactions
SMYD1 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in muscle development and function. It is known to interact with skNAC, a muscle-specific transcription factor, during cardiac development. This interaction is essential for skeletal muscle growth and cardiac development, as demonstrated by the embryonic lethality observed in mice lacking skNAC (Park2010skNAC). SMYD1 methylates skNAC at the K1975 site, a process necessary for the transcriptional activation of myoglobin, a protein important for oxygen transport in muscle tissues (Zhu2023Lysine). The interaction between SMYD1 and skNAC requires the MYND domain of SMYD1 and the PXLXP motif of skNAC (Zhu2023Lysine).

SMYD1 also interacts with other proteins, including MICAL, a protein involved in myofilament organization, and FK506 binding protein 8, which regulates BCL2 (Park2010skNAC). Additionally, SMYD1 interacts with myosin chaperones such as Hsp90a1 and Unc45b, which are crucial for myosin protein folding and sarcomere assembly (Jiao2021Smyd1). These interactions highlight SMYD1's role in regulating muscle-specific gene expression and maintaining muscle structure and function.
