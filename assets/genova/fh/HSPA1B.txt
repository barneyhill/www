# HSPA1B

## Overview
HSPA1B is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1B, a molecular chaperone involved in the cellular stress response. This protein is a member of the Hsp70 family, which is characterized by its role in protein folding, stabilization, and degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Brocchieri2008hsp70; Boyko2017HSP70). Hsp70 proteins, including Hsp70-1B, are crucial in preventing protein aggregation and assisting in the refolding of damaged proteins, particularly during cellular stress such as hyperthermia (Boyko2017HSP70). HSPA1B is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in immune responses and cellular protection mechanisms, including interactions with co-chaperones and other proteins to form multiprotein complexes essential for its function (Ryu2020Proteomewide). The gene's polymorphisms have been linked to several diseases, including cancer, schizophrenia, and asthma, highlighting its clinical significance in genetic stability and disease susceptibility (Guo2011Variations; Faisal2022Diagnostic; Kowalczyk2019Association).

## Structure
HSPA1B is a member of the Hsp70 family, characterized by a highly conserved structure that includes an ATP-binding domain (ABD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The primary structure of HSPA1B consists of 641 amino acids, with a high degree of homology to its paralog Hsp70-1a, differing by only two amino acids (E110D, N499S) (Daugaard2007The). The secondary structure of HSPA1B includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of Hsp70 proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of HSPA1B forms a three-dimensional conformation that facilitates its function as a molecular chaperone, with distinct domains for nucleotide and substrate binding (Phung2023UBQLN2). HSPA1B can also form quaternary structures through interactions with co-chaperones and other proteins, such as UBQLN2, which binds to the ATP-binding domain of HSPA1B (Phung2023UBQLN2).

Common post-translational modifications of HSPA1B include phosphorylation and acetylation, which are typical for proteins in the Hsp70 family, although specific modifications for HSPA1B are not detailed in the context. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and protein degradation pathways (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

## Function
HSPA1B encodes a member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, which functions as a molecular chaperone involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and viability under stress conditions. In healthy human cells, HSPA1B plays a crucial role in protein folding, stabilization, and the degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby preventing protein aggregation and assisting in the refolding of damaged proteins (Boyko2017HSP70). This protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it accumulates under stress conditions to protect genetic material and participate in the reconstitution of the mitotic centrosome (Boyko2017HSP70).

HSPA1B is particularly significant in leukocytes, where it interacts with signaling pathways involved in immune responses, promoting cell survival in inflammation sites (Boyko2017HSP70). The protein is also involved in inhibiting autophagy, a cellular stress response mechanism (Boyko2017HSP70). The expression of HSPA1B is inducible under stress conditions, such as hyperthermia, leading to increased transcriptional activity, especially in mononuclear cells (Boyko2017HSP70). This inducible nature highlights its role in the cellular stress response mechanism, contributing to the protection and repair of cellular components during adverse conditions (Boyko2017HSP70).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HSPA1B gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, the HSPA1B rs6457452T allele is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in Chinese populations, as well as poor survival outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Guo2011Variations). The rs2763979TT genotype is also linked to poor survival in NSCLC patients (Guo2011Variations). These genetic variants result in lower expression of Hsp70, potentially leading to increased DNA damage and genetic instability, which may promote cancer development (Guo2011Variations).

HSPA1B polymorphisms have also been associated with paranoid schizophrenia and suicidal behavior. The rs539689 polymorphism, with the minor allele C, is protective against schizophrenia in males and against suicidal behavior in both sexes (Kowalczyk2019Association). The gene's role in neuroprotection may contribute to these associations.

In asthma, the rs2763979 variant of HSPA1B is implicated in disease susceptibility, although its association with disease severity is not significant (Faisal2022Diagnostic). The gene's expression is altered in asthma, with HSP70 proteins playing roles in both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes (Faisal2022Diagnostic).

## Interactions
HSPA1B, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for cellular stress responses. It interacts with UBQLN2, a protein that undergoes a reversible temperature-induced conformational switch, enhancing its binding to HSPA1B when the temperature is increased from 37°C to 42°C. This interaction is primarily mediated through the ATP-binding domain of HSPA1B, rather than the peptide-binding domain, and is thought to play a role in the heat shock response by facilitating the formation of stress granules (Phung2023UBQLN2).

HSPA1B also interacts with various co-chaperones and client proteins, including HSP90, HOP/STI1, and members of the DnaJ homolog subfamily of HSP40 proteins. These interactions are part of its role in protein folding and stabilization, as well as in the response to cellular stress (Ryu2020Proteomewide). The protein is involved in multiprotein complexes and transient interactions, which are essential for its function in maintaining protein homeostasis and assisting in the folding, stability, and degradation of polypeptides (Ryu2020Proteomewide). These interactions highlight the versatile role of HSPA1B in cellular processes, particularly under stress conditions.
