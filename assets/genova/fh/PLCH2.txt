# PLCH2

## Overview
Phospholipase C eta 2 (PLCη2) is an enzyme encoded by the PLCH2 gene, which is part of the phospholipase C family known for its role in cellular signaling pathways. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into secondary messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are pivotal in regulating intracellular calcium levels and activating protein kinase C (PKC) (Popovics2014A; Popovics2011Phospholipase). PLCη2 is distinguished by its sensitivity to calcium ions, facilitated by its EF-hand domain, and is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it plays a significant role in neuronal signaling and development (Kanemaru2010Phospholipase; Popovics2012Putative). The gene's location on chromosome 1p36.32 links it to various neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as 1p36 deletion syndrome and potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (Lo20101p36.32; Lo2011Role).

## Structure
Phospholipase C eta 2 (PLCη2) is a member of the phospholipase C family, characterized by several conserved structural domains. The protein includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an EF-hand domain, catalytic X and Y domains, and a C2 domain. The PH and C2 domains are crucial for membrane association, with the C2 domain playing a significant regulatory role (Popovics2011Phospholipase). The EF-hand domain contains two EF-loops, with EF-loop 1 being canonical and EF-loop 2 being non-canonical, consisting of 13 residues. This domain is essential for calcium binding, which is critical for the enzyme's activation and function (Popovics2014A).

PLCη2 exhibits multiple splice variants, with five identified for this enzyme, which may influence its activity and localization (Popovics2012Putative). The C-terminal regions of these variants contain proline-rich motifs that potentially interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins, suggesting a role in protein interactions (Popovics2012Putative). The enzyme is sensitive to calcium, and its activity is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium levels, which can be amplified by PLCη2 through its response to Gβγ dimers and GPCR activation (Popovics2011Phospholipase; Popovics2012Putative).

## Function
Phospholipase C eta 2 (PLCη2) is an enzyme involved in the inositol lipid signaling pathway, crucial for cellular communication. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which serve as secondary messengers. IP3 facilitates the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from intracellular stores, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), influencing various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (Popovics2014A; Popovics2011Phospholipase).

PLCη2 is highly sensitive to Ca2+ and is activated by submicromolar concentrations, suggesting its role in amplifying transient Ca2+ signals. This enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in neuronal signaling pathways, particularly in regions associated with memory formation, circadian rhythm regulation, and neurotransmitter release (Popovics2011Phospholipase; Popovics2012Putative). The EF-hand domain of PLCη2, especially EF-loop 1, is crucial for its Ca2+ sensitivity, directing its function in cellular signaling pathways (Popovics2014A).

PLCη2 is expressed in neural regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as in the retina and habenula, indicating its involvement in neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and potentially in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders (Kanemaru2010Phospholipase; Popovics2012Putative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PLCH2 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders and conditions. The PLCH2 gene, located in the 1p36.32 region of chromosome 1, is associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome, which can lead to mental retardation, developmental delays, and other neurological impairments (Lo2011Role). Deletions in this region, including the PLCH2 gene, have been linked to developmental retardation, learning disabilities, and dysmorphic features (Lo2011Role).

The PLCH2 gene is also implicated in the formation and maintenance of neuronal networks, with potential involvement in conditions such as schizophrenia and drug addiction due to its expression in the habenula and retina, which are associated with circadian rhythms (Lo20101p36.32). Additionally, chromosomal rearrangements near the PLCH2 gene locus suggest a potential role in neuronal tumorigenesis, particularly in central nervous system tumors (Popovics2011Phospholipase).

Furthermore, the PLCH2 gene's involvement in apoptosis, a process crucial for normal development and tissue homeostasis, suggests that its deregulation could contribute to autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer (Lo20101p36.32). However, the specific functional role of PLCH2 in these contexts requires further investigation.

## Interactions
Phospholipase C eta 2 (PLCH2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling. One significant interaction is with LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK-1), which plays a role in actin filament dynamics. This interaction is particularly important during retinoic acid-stimulated neurite growth in Neuro2A cells. The interaction between PLCH2 and LIMK-1 has been confirmed using proximity ligand assays, indicating that these interactions occur mainly in the cytosol and to a lesser extent in the nucleus (Arastoo2015Phospholipase).

PLCH2 also interacts with calcium ions through its EF-hand domain, which is essential for its activation. The EF-hand domain contains two EF-loops, with EF-loop 1 being crucial for calcium sensitivity. Mutations in this loop, such as D256A, significantly affect the enzyme's response to calcium, highlighting the importance of this interaction for PLCH2 activity (Popovics2014A).

These interactions suggest that PLCH2 plays a role in regulating actin dynamics and gene expression, contributing to processes like neurite growth and potentially influencing other calcium-dependent signaling pathways (Arastoo2015Phospholipase).
