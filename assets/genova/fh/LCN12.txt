# LCN12

## Overview
LCN12 is a gene that encodes the protein lipocalin 12, a member of the lipocalin family, which is characterized by its ability to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules. Lipocalin 12 is primarily expressed in the male reproductive system, particularly in the epididymis, where it plays a crucial role in sperm maturation and storage. The protein adopts a distinctive eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure, typical of lipocalins, which facilitates its function in binding molecules such as all-trans retinoic acid. This binding capability is essential for various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, which is vital for male fertility. The expression of LCN12 is androgen-dependent, highlighting its significance in the modification of sperm protein profiles during epididymal maturation (Peng2010Conformational; Stopková2021Biological).

## Structure
LCN12 is a member of the lipocalin family, characterized by a conserved β-barrel structure. The primary structure of LCN12 includes conserved motifs typical of lipocalins, such as G-X-W, T-D-Y, and K/R, which are found in specific exons and contribute to its functional properties (Suzuki2004Molecular). The secondary structure of LCN12 is dominated by an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, a common feature among lipocalins, which forms a cup-shaped internal ligand-binding site (Chandrasekaran2024Structure). This β-barrel structure is stabilized by a disulfide bond, which is a typical feature in lipocalins, enhancing the protein's stability and ligand-binding capabilities (Schiefner2015The).

The tertiary structure of LCN12 involves the folding of the β-barrel, which allows it to bind small hydrophobic molecules, such as all-trans retinoic acid, with high specificity (Peng2010Conformational). The quaternary structure of LCN12 is not explicitly detailed, but lipocalins are generally monomeric, suggesting that LCN12 likely functions as a single polypeptide chain (Schiefner2015The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are common in the lipocalin family, although specific modifications for LCN12 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
LCN12 (lipocalin 12) is a protein that plays a significant role in male reproduction, particularly in the epididymis, where it is involved in the maturation and storage of spermatozoa. It functions by transporting hydrophobic molecules, such as all-trans-retinoic acid, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation and various cellular processes (Peng2010Conformational). LCN12 is expressed in the epididymis and its expression is androgen-dependent, suggesting a role in the modification of sperm protein profiles during epididymal maturation (Peng2010Conformational; Stopková2021Biological).

Structurally, LCN12 adopts an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel conformation with a conserved disulfide bond, which contributes to its structural stability and ligand binding capabilities (Peng2010Conformational). The protein's ability to bind retinoic acid with high affinity indicates its involvement in retinoic acid trafficking, which is essential for normal male fertility (Peng2010Conformational). The presence of a conserved disulfide bond between Cys98 and Cys203 further stabilizes the protein by anchoring the C-terminus to the β-barrel, although it is not essential for the formation of the tertiary structure (Peng2010Conformational).
