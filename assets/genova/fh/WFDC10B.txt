# WFDC10B

## Overview
The WFDC10B gene encodes the protein WAP four-disulfide core domain 10B, which is part of the WFDC (Whey Acidic Protein Four-Disulfide Core) family. This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a conserved WAP domain, which typically contains eight cysteine residues forming four disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and function. Proteins in this family are often involved in various biological processes, including immune response and protease inhibition. The specific role of WFDC10B, however, remains to be fully elucidated, although it is hypothesized to play a role in modulating protease activity and may have implications in tissue homeostasis and defense mechanisms. Further research is needed to clarify its precise biological functions and potential clinical significance.
