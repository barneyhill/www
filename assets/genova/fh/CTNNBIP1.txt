# CTNNBIP1

## Overview
CTNNBIP1 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin beta interacting protein 1, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This protein functions primarily as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the interaction between β-catenin and TCF/LEF transcription factors, thereby preventing the transcription of genes that promote oncogenesis (Chang2019The). Catenin beta interacting protein 1 is categorized as a regulatory protein, and it is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates gene expression critical for cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (Chang2019The). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various cancers, including lung, breast, and gastric cancers, where its downregulation is often associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Kosari‐Monfared2018CTNNBIP1; Mukherjee2016Frequent). Consequently, CTNNBIP1 is being explored as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Chang2019The).

## Structure


## Function
CTNNBIP1, also known as catenin beta interacting protein 1, plays a crucial role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including development and tumorigenesis. In healthy human cells, CTNNBIP1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the interaction between β-catenin and TCF/LEF transcription factors, thereby blocking the transcription of target genes within the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Chang2019The). This inhibition prevents the activation of oncogenic phenotypes and is vital for maintaining normal cell proliferation and differentiation.

CTNNBIP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it competes with TCF for binding to β-catenin, thus modulating gene expression (Chang2019The). This regulatory mechanism is significant in embryonic development, tissue differentiation, and carcinogenesis. The protein's activity is associated with reduced cell invasion, induction of cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, highlighting its role in controlling cell growth and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Chang2019The).

In the context of lung cancer, CTNNBIP1 is identified as a suppressor of cancer progression, with its low expression linked to advanced pathological stages and poorer patient survival. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker for lung cancer (Chang2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CTNNBIP1 gene, which encodes the β-catenin interacting protein 1, have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric adenocarcinoma, CTNNBIP1 is significantly downregulated, with this reduction associated with higher tumor grades and viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Kosari‐Monfared2018CTNNBIP1). In breast cancer, frequent inactivation of CTNNBIP1 is observed, often due to promoter methylation and chromosomal deletions, leading to increased β-catenin activity and the overexpression of target genes like EGFR, MYC, and CCND1. These changes are particularly prevalent in aggressive subtypes such as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and Her2+ (Mukherjee2016Frequent).

In lung cancer, CTNNBIP1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with low expression levels linked to increased cancer cell migration and poorer patient survival. This downregulation is often due to promoter hypermethylation, which silences the gene and contributes to tumor progression (Chang2019The). The gene's role in modulating chemotherapy response has also been noted in epithelial ovarian cancer, where specific genetic variants can influence treatment outcomes (Li2020Functional). These findings highlight CTNNBIP1's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CTNNBIP1, also known as catenin beta interacting protein 1, is involved in several interactions that influence the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with β-catenin, inhibiting its association with TCF/LEF transcription factors, thereby preventing the activation of Wnt target genes (Mukherjee2016Frequent; Chang2019The). This interaction is crucial in various cancers, including lung cancer, where CTNNBIP1 acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing β-catenin-mediated oncogenic effects (Chang2019The).

In papillary thyroid cancer, circRNA_102171 interacts with CTNNBIP1, modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by promoting the interaction between β-catenin and TCF/LEF, while its knockdown enhances the interaction between β-catenin and CTNNBIP1, thereby attenuating the pathway (Bi2018CircRNA). In liver tumor-initiating cells, linc00210 interacts with CTNNBIP1, influencing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and self-renewal (Fu2018RETRACTED).

CTNNBIP1 also interacts with RBM10 in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is suggested to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by enhancing the interaction between β-catenin and CTNNBIP1 (Cao2021RBM10). In breast cancer, CTNNBIP1's interaction with β-catenin is crucial for inhibiting the transcriptional activity of nuclear β-catenin, which is a hallmark of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation (Mukherjee2016Frequent).
