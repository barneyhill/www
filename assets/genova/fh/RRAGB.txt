# RRAGB

## Overview
RRAGB is a gene that encodes the Ras-related GTP binding B protein, a member of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a pivotal role in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a GTPase and is integral to cellular responses to nutrient availability, particularly amino acids, influencing processes such as cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. The RagB protein, encoded by RRAGB, forms heterodimers with other Rag proteins, such as RagC or RagD, facilitating the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface. Notably, RagB exists in two isoforms, RagB short and RagB long, which have distinct structural and functional roles, particularly in modulating mTORC1 activity under nutrient-deprived conditions. These isoforms are differentially expressed, with RagB long being brain-specific, and they interact with the GATOR1 complex to regulate mTORC1 signaling. Alterations in RRAGB expression or function have been implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture; Figlia2022Brainenriched; Brady2016Rags).

## Structure
The RRAGB gene encodes a protein that is part of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in mTORC1 signaling. The protein exists in different isoforms, notably RagB short and RagB long, which exhibit distinct structural features and functional roles. RagB long contains a 33-amino acid N-terminal extension and a 28-amino acid insertion in the switch I region, which affects its GTP-binding pocket and reduces its affinity for GTP. This insertion also impacts its interaction with the GATOR1 complex, allowing RagB long to act as a 'sponge' for GATOR1, inhibiting its activity and potentially conferring resistance to nutrient starvation (Figlia2022Brainenriched).

The RagB protein forms heterodimers with other Rag proteins, such as RagC or RagD, which is essential for its function in mTORC1 signaling. These heterodimers undergo conformational changes depending on their nucleotide-binding states, which are crucial for mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). The structural dynamics of these heterodimers are influenced by specific domains, including the C-terminal Roadblock domain, which mediates changes in the GTPase domains (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture).

## Function
The RRAGB gene encodes the RagB protein, a GTPase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for cellular responses to nutrient availability, particularly amino acids, and is involved in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy (Figlia2022Brainenriched; Brady2016Rags). RagB forms heterodimers with other Rag proteins, such as RagC or RagD, to facilitate the localization of mTORC1 to lysosomes, where it becomes activated in response to nutrient signals (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture; Brady2016Rags).

RagB exists in two isoforms, RagB short and RagB long, which have distinct roles in modulating mTORC1 activity. RagB short can inhibit GATOR1, a negative regulator of mTORC1, through interaction with the DEPDC5 subunit, maintaining mTORC1 activity during nutrient deprivation. RagB long, a brain-specific isoform, acts as a 'sponge' to obstruct GATOR1's GAP activity, enhancing mTORC1 activity without hyperactivation (Figlia2022Brainenriched). In neurons, high expression of RagB isoforms helps maintain mTORC1 activity during amino-acid starvation, supporting critical neuronal functions like dendritic growth and synaptic plasticity (Figlia2022Brainenriched).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RRAGB gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In the context of cancer, high expression levels of RagB, a protein encoded by RRAGB, are associated with resistance to nutrient deprivation, allowing tumor cells to maintain high mTORC1 activity. This mechanism is observed in glioblastomas, ovarian cancers, and follicular lymphomas, where mutations in GATOR1 components or elevated RagB expression contribute to mTORC1 resistance under low nutrient conditions (Figlia2022Brainenriched). In colorectal cancer (CRC), RRAGB is upregulated and negatively correlates with patient prognosis. It is involved in a positive feedback loop with HIF1A and mTORC1 that promotes tumor progression. The circular RNA circEXOC6B can bind to RRAGB, inhibiting this loop and suppressing CRC growth, suggesting that RRAGB plays a role in CRC progression and chemoresistance (Li2022circEXOC6B).

In neurological contexts, high RagB expression in neurons helps maintain mTORC1 activity during nutrient deprivation, which is crucial for neuronal function. Alterations in RagB expression or function could impact conditions related to mTORC1 activity, such as epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders (Figlia2022Brainenriched).

## Interactions
RRAGB, a member of the Rag GTPase family, is involved in several critical interactions that regulate mTORC1 signaling. It forms heterodimers with RRAGC or RRAGD, which are essential for mTORC1 activation on lysosomes. These heterodimers facilitate the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, a key step in its activation by amino acids (Figlia2022Brainenriched; Li2022circEXOC6B).

In colorectal cancer, RRAGB interacts with circEXOC6B, a circular RNA that binds to RRAGB and inhibits its ability to form heterodimers with RRAGC/D. This interaction suppresses the mTORC1 pathway, which is often hyperactive in cancer, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy (Li2022circEXOC6B).

RRAGB also interacts with the GATOR1 complex, a GTPase-activating protein that regulates mTORC1 activity. RagB isoforms, particularly RagB short and RagB long, exhibit differential interactions with GATOR1, affecting mTORC1 signaling. RagB short inhibits GATOR1 through DEPDC5 binding, while RagB long acts as a 'sponge' to inhibit GATOR1's GAP activity, allowing mTORC1 to remain active even under nutrient-deprived conditions (Figlia2022Brainenriched).
