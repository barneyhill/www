# CHADL

## Overview
The CHADL gene encodes the Chondroadherin-Like Protein, a crucial component in the biology of cartilage and connective tissues. This protein is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein due to its role in collagen binding and modulation of chondrocyte differentiation. CHADL is primarily expressed in cartilage, where it contributes to maintaining tissue integrity and cellular communication. Its involvement in collagen binding underscores its importance in the structural stability of cartilage, influencing the composition and function of the extracellular matrix. The protein's regulatory effects on chondrocytes are essential for cartilage development and maintenance, and its differential expression has been linked to joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. Consequently, CHADL is considered a potential therapeutic target for cartilage-related disorders (Tuerlings2021RNA).

## Function
The CHADL gene encodes the Chondroadherin-Like Protein, which is involved in collagen binding and acts as a negative modulator of chondrocyte differentiation. This protein is primarily active in cartilage and connective tissues, where it contributes to maintaining tissue integrity and cellular communication. CHADL's role in collagen binding suggests it is crucial for the structural stability of cartilage, influencing the extracellular matrix's composition and function (Tuerlings2021RNA).

In healthy human cells, CHADL is implicated in modulating chondrocyte differentiation, which is essential for cartilage development and maintenance. The protein's interaction with collagen and its regulatory effects on chondrocytes indicate its involvement in maintaining cartilage homeostasis and potentially influencing tissue repair processes (Tuerlings2021RNA). The differential expression of CHADL, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis, suggests that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of joint diseases, although its specific functions in healthy tissues require further investigation (Tuerlings2021RNA).

Overall, CHADL's activities in collagen binding and chondrocyte modulation highlight its importance in cartilage biology and its potential as a therapeutic target for cartilage-related disorders (Tuerlings2021RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHADL gene have been associated with various musculoskeletal disorders, particularly osteoarthritis (OA). A frameshift mutation in CHADL, which introduces a premature stop codon, is linked to an increased risk of total hip replacement due to OA. This mutation is inherited in a recessive manner, and individuals who are homozygous for this mutation tend to undergo hip replacement at a younger age compared to non-carriers. The mutation is prevalent in populations of European and Middle-Eastern descent and less common in East-Asians (Ingvarsson2017Whole).

In addition to genetic mutations, variations in the expression levels of CHADL have been implicated in OA. The OA susceptibility allele rs117018441-T, located in an intron of CHADL, is associated with higher expression of the gene in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. This increased expression may negatively regulate bone and cartilage, suggesting that CHADL could be a potential therapeutic target for OA, particularly in the knee (Tuerlings2021RNA). The gene's involvement in collagen binding and modulation of chondrocyte differentiation further underscores its role in OA pathophysiology (Tuerlings2021RNA).
