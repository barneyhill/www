# DYSF

## Overview
The DYSF gene encodes dysferlin, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the repair of muscle cell membranes. Dysferlin is characterized by its multiple C2 domains, which facilitate calcium-dependent interactions with phospholipids, essential for the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane during membrane repair processes (Bansal2004Dysferlin; Woolger2017Limited). This protein is predominantly located at the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle fibers, where it is crucial for maintaining muscle integrity by repairing membrane disruptions (Bansal2004Dysferlin). Mutations in the DYSF gene are associated with dysferlinopathies, a group of muscular dystrophies that include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy, characterized by progressive muscle weakness (Anwar2024The; Liu1998Dysferlin). Dysferlin's interactions with other proteins, such as annexins and calpain-3, further underscore its role in muscle repair and the modulation of disease severity (Anwar2024The; Drescher2023Analysis).

## Structure
Dysferlin is a large transmembrane protein involved in muscle membrane repair, encoded by the DYSF gene. It is characterized by a complex structure that includes multiple tandem C2 domains, which are approximately 130 residues long and typically form a β-sandwich structure with a Ca2+ binding pocket (Dominguez2022Redefining). These C2 domains are crucial for Ca2+-regulated protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, playing a key role in the protein's function (Woolger2017Limited).

The protein's tertiary structure is modular, consisting of four main domains: the C2A domain, a mid-region module (C2B-C2C-Fer-DysF), a terminal four C2 domain module, and a calpain-cleaved mini-dysferlin C72 (Woolger2017Limited). Dysferlin also contains a unique DysF domain, which is a nested repeat structure found only in ferlins and certain yeast proteins (Woolger2017Limited).

Dysferlin can form dimers, mediated by its transmembrane domain and multiple C2 domains, except for the C2A domain, which is involved in Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding (Xu2011Dysferlin). This dimerization is essential for its role in membrane repair, facilitating the bridging of membranes at damage sites (Xu2011Dysferlin).

## Function
Dysferlin, encoded by the DYSF gene, is a crucial protein involved in the repair of the plasma membrane in muscle cells. It plays a significant role in the calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, a process essential for resealing membrane tears and maintaining muscle cell integrity (Bansal2004Dysferlin; Bansal2003Defective). Dysferlin is primarily located at the sarcolemma, the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle fibers, and is enriched at sites of membrane disruption, where it facilitates the fusion of vesicles to repair the membrane (Bansal2004Dysferlin; Bansal2003Defective).

The protein contains several C2 domains, which mediate its interaction with phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner, similar to synaptotagmins, proteins known for their role in vesicle trafficking and membrane repair (Bansal2004Dysferlin; Liu1998Dysferlin). Dysferlin's function is critical for muscle cell repair and maintenance, as evidenced by the progressive muscular dystrophy observed in dysferlin-null mice, which exhibit impaired membrane repair despite having structurally intact sarcolemmas (Bansal2004Dysferlin). Dysferlin's role in membrane repair underscores its importance in maintaining muscle integrity and function in healthy human cells (Bansal2003Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DYSF gene, which encodes the dysferlin protein, are linked to a group of muscular dystrophies known as dysferlinopathies. These conditions include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM), characterized by progressive muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase levels, indicative of muscle damage (Anwar2024The; Nguyen2007Phenotypic; Liu1998Dysferlin). Dysferlinopathies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity, meaning the same mutation can result in different clinical presentations among individuals (Izumi2020The; Liu1998Dysferlin).

The mutations in the DYSF gene can lead to mRNA instability, degradation, or the production of misfolded proteins, which are subsequently degraded, affecting muscle membrane repair (Anwar2024The). Dysferlinopathies are also influenced by interactions with other proteins, such as annexins and calpain-3, which can modify disease severity (Anwar2024The). The clinical spectrum of dysferlinopathies includes atypical phenotypes like proximodistal weakness and asymptomatic hyperCKemia, complicating diagnosis and treatment (Nguyen2007Phenotypic). Diagnostic approaches often involve genetic screening, electromyographic studies, and muscle biopsies to confirm dysferlin deficiency (Zhang2021Abnormal; Nguyen2007Phenotypic).

## Interactions
Dysferlin (DYSF) is involved in various protein interactions crucial for muscle membrane repair. It interacts with annexin-A1, which binds to its cC2A and C2F domains in a calcium-dependent manner, playing a significant role in muscle repair (Drescher2023Analysis). Calpain-3 (CAPN3) also interacts with these domains, particularly the C2F domain, suggesting its involvement in vesicle release regulation (Drescher2023Analysis). Mitsugumin-53 binds to the cC2A region of dysferlin, essential for acute membrane repair (Drescher2023Analysis).

Dysferlin forms complexes with AHNAK, interacting through its C2A domain, which is important for cell membrane differentiation and repair (Huang2006AHNAK). This interaction is calcium-independent, as shown by GST pull-down assays (Huang2006AHNAK). Dysferlin also interacts with caveolin-3, suggesting a role in calcium-dependent structural rearrangement (Drescher2023Analysis).

In addition, dysferlin interacts with proteins like moesin (MSN) and polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF), which are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and caveolae formation, respectively (Cacciottolo2011Reverse). These interactions highlight dysferlin's role in maintaining sarcolemmal integrity and its involvement in multiprotein complexes essential for muscle function and repair (de2010Proteomic).
