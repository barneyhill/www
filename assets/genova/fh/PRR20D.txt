# PRR20D

## Overview
The PRR20D gene encodes the proline-rich 20D protein, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is part of a larger family of proline-rich proteins that are involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and structural functions. The proline-rich 20D protein is implicated in protein-protein interactions due to its proline-rich domains, which facilitate binding with other proteins. Although the specific biological roles of PRR20D and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, they are believed to play a role in cellular signaling and structural integrity, potentially influencing various physiological and pathological processes. Further research is needed to fully understand the functional implications of PRR20D in human health and disease.
