# TXNDC17

## Overview
Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17 (TXNDC17) is encoded by the TXNDC17 gene and functions as a small oxidoreductase protein involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. The protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-related domain, which is integral to its redox activity, and is distinguished by a unique N-terminal motif that differentiates it from other thioredoxins (Udayantha2021Molecular). TXNDC17 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including immune response and apoptosis regulation, through its interactions with other proteins such as thioredoxin reductase and BECN1, a key regulator of autophagy (Zeng2024Mechanism; Udayantha2021Molecular). The protein's involvement in redox signaling and oxidative stress regulation has significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in the context of drug resistance and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Guenter2020Evaluating; Zeng2024Mechanism).

## Structure
Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17 (TXNDC17) is a small oxidoreductase protein with a molecular mass of approximately 14 kDa. It is characterized by a thioredoxin-related protein 14 domain, which is a key feature of its structure. The primary structure of TXNDC17 includes a highly conserved N-terminal motif, Cys 43 -Pro 44 -Asp 45 -Cys 46, which is a variation of the Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys motif found in thioredoxin 1 (TRx1) (Udayantha2021Molecular). This motif is crucial for its redox activity, although it does not disrupt hydrogen bonds like TRx1 due to the substitution of glycine-proline with proline-aspartate dipeptides (Udayantha2021Molecular).

The secondary structure of TXNDC17 includes five central β-sheets surrounded by four α-helices, as revealed by three-dimensional modeling (Udayantha2021Molecular). The tertiary structure is further defined by additional conserved cysteines at the C-terminus, which remain unmodified in the native conformation, suggesting a similar inaccessibility in the human homolog (Udayantha2021Molecular). The protein's structure supports its role in maintaining redox homeostasis and its involvement in immune response and apoptosis regulation (Udayantha2021Molecular). Information on quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms is not provided in the context.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TXNDC17 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In neuroblastomas (NB), mutations in TXNDC17 are associated with poor prognosis, with significantly lower 10-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates compared to patients without such mutations. The study found that TXNDC17 mutations occur at a frequency of 2.66% in NB patients, and its overexpression contributes to drug resistance by reducing sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (Zeng2024Mechanism).

In breast and colorectal cancer, TXNDC17 is mentioned in the context of taxane resistance, potentially through its role in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, which stimulates autophagy, a mechanism that can promote cell survival and contribute to chemoresistance (Guenter2020Evaluating). In ovarian cancer, higher expression of TXNDC17 is associated with carboplatin resistance, as it helps detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by the drug, contributing to a more reductive environment in resistant cells (Fan2015A).

These findings suggest that TXNDC17 plays a significant role in mediating drug resistance and impacting prognosis in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17 (TXNDC17) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. TXNDC17 interacts with thioredoxin reductase one (TR1) to accept electrons, facilitating its role in redox signaling and oxidative stress regulation. It also interacts with ribonucleotide reductase, peroxidase, and methionine sulfoxide reductase through its disulfide reductase activities, which are crucial for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis (Udayantha2021Molecular).

In the context of neuroblastomas, TXNDC17 is associated with BECN1, a key regulator of autophagy. This interaction is significant in mediating drug resistance, as TXNDC17 regulates BECN1-mediated autophagy, contributing to chemoresistance in neuroblastoma cells (Zeng2024Mechanism). The correlation between TXNDC17 and BECN1 expression levels suggests a functional interaction that impacts autophagy processes and chemoresistance (Zeng2024Mechanism).

In uterine papillary serous carcinoma, high TXNDC17 expression is linked to increased BECN1 levels, indicating a potential interaction that contributes to chemoresistance through autophagy induction (Peng2021TXNDC17). These interactions highlight the role of TXNDC17 in modulating cellular responses to oxidative stress and chemotherapeutic agents.
