# NCOA2

## Overview
NCOA2, or nuclear receptor coactivator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. The protein, also referred to as SRC-2, functions as a transcriptional coactivator by interacting with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, facilitating the transcriptional activation of target genes. It is characterized by a modular structure that includes domains such as the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Chen2000Steroidnuclear; Sun2020Nuclear). NCOA2 is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including energy metabolism, reproductive health, and cellular responses to hypoxia, and is implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly cancers, where its expression and interactions are often dysregulated (Xu2009Normal; Dasgupta2014Nuclear).

## Structure
NCOA2, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 2, is a member of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family. It features a modular structure with several distinct domains that facilitate its role as a transcriptional coactivator. The protein contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and a PAS domain at the N-terminus, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Chen2000Steroidnuclear; Sun2020Nuclear). The PAS domain, specifically the PAS-B domain, plays a crucial role in recognizing LXXLL motifs, which are essential for binding to nuclear receptors and other coactivators (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA).

NCOA2 also includes a serine/threonine-rich (S/T) domain, which is enriched with phosphorylation sites, allowing regulation through post-translational modifications (Sun2020Nuclear). The protein has two transactivation domains, AD1 and AD2, at the C-terminus. AD1 interacts with histone acetyltransferases like CBP and p300, while AD2 interacts with coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA; Sun2020Nuclear).

NCOA2 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles (Bulynko2010Nuclear). These structural features and modifications enable NCOA2 to participate in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with various nuclear receptors and transcription factors.

## Function
NCOA2, also known as SRC-2, is a transcriptional coactivator involved in regulating gene expression by interacting with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. It plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, reproductive functions, and cellular responses to hypoxia. In energy metabolism, NCOA2 influences hepatic glucose release and dietary fat absorption by coactivating the orphan nuclear receptor RORα on the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) promoter and interacting with the fuel-sensor kinase AMPK (Dasgupta2014Nuclear). It also modulates brown adipose tissue activity, promoting thermogenesis and energy expenditure, which protects against high-fat-induced obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity (Dasgupta2014Nuclear).

In reproductive health, NCOA2 is crucial for normal spermatogenesis and placental development, affecting fertility in both males and females (Xu2009Normal). It also plays a role in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation, impacting angiogenesis and cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions (Tsai2015NcoA2Dependent). NCOA2 is active in the nucleus, where it recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes to facilitate transcriptional activation (Sun2020Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NCOA2 gene are implicated in various cancers and conditions. In prostate cancer, NCOA2 overexpression is associated with the initiation of epithelial neoplastic transformation and is significantly upregulated in metastatic cases. This overexpression leads to more invasive and metastatic tumors, particularly under androgen deprivation conditions, and is independent of PTEN status. The overexpression activates PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, promoting metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer (Qin2014Androgen).

NCOA2 is also involved in several gene fusions linked to different malignancies. In soft tissue angiofibroma, the AHRR-NCOA2 fusion results from a recurrent translocation, leading to the upregulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor target genes (Jin2012Fusion). In mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, the HEY1-NCOA2 fusion serves as a characteristic molecular marker, aiding in diagnosis (Wang2011Identification). Additionally, the MEIS1-NCOA2 fusion defines a distinct subtype of renal sarcoma, characterized by a primitive spindle cell phenotype (Argani2018Novel).

These findings highlight the role of NCOA2 in various cancers, where its mutations or altered interactions contribute to disease progression and aggressiveness.

## Interactions
NCOA2, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role as a transcriptional coactivator. NCOA2 interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) complex, playing a role in gene regulation by the AHRC. This interaction is crucial for the transcription of TCDD-responsive genes, as NCOA2 is recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin in a TCDD-dependent manner (Beischlag2002Recruitment).

NCOA2 also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and ARNT, where it competes with HIF-1α to form complexes with ARNT. This interaction affects hypoxia response element (HRE) transactivation, suggesting a regulatory role in hypoxic conditions (Tsai2015NcoA2Dependent).

In the context of viral infections, NCOA2 interacts with the RTA protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), enhancing RTA's expression and stability. This interaction is essential for the lytic replication of the virus, indicating NCOA2's role in viral reactivation (Wei2019NCOA2).

NCOA2 also forms complexes with other members of the SRC/NCoA family, such as NCoA-3, through specific domain interactions, although it shows limited direct interaction with NCoA-1 (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA).
