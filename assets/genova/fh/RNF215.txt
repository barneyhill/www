# RNF215

## Overview
RNF215 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 215, a member of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase family characterized by the presence of a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways that are crucial in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Wu2023Ring). The RNF215 protein is involved in modulating the immune microenvironment and angiogenesis, with its expression correlating with immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis-related genes (Wu2023Ring). Due to its significant role in tumorigenesis and progression, RNF215 is considered a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC (Wu2023Ring).

## Clinical Significance
RNF215 (ring finger protein 215) has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC). Its expression is significantly higher in CRC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis and progression. High RNF215 expression is associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival in CRC patients, as well as with clinicopathological features such as younger age, lymphatic invasion, and distant metastases (Wu2023Ring). 

RNF215 is involved in key signaling pathways associated with cancer, including the MAPK, RAS, PI3K/AKT, and WNT pathways, which are known to be dysregulated in CRC. Its expression is positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells like NK cells, CD8 T cells, and Tregs, and negatively correlated with T helper cells, indicating a role in immune infiltration and angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment (Wu2023Ring).

The gene's expression is also linked to mutations in other genes, such as BRAF, where higher RNF215 expression is observed in the mutated BRAF group compared to the wild-type group in CRC. This suggests a potential interaction between RNF215 expression and BRAF mutations, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Wu2023Association).

## Interactions
RNF215, a ring finger protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are significant in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. The study by Wu et al. identified nine hub genes associated with RNF215, including FBXO2, SYVN1, UBR1, UBOX5, ASB8, RNF185, MARCH2, NUP50, and CD2BP2, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis through these interactions (Wu2023Ring). RNF215 is also implicated in key signaling pathways related to cancer, such as the MAPK, RAS, PI3K/AKT, and WNT pathways, indicating its role in cellular signaling processes (Wu2023Ring).

The protein's expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 T cells, and negatively with T helper cells, highlighting its potential role in modulating the immune microenvironment in CRC (Wu2023Ring). RNF215 is also associated with angiogenesis, as its expression correlates with angiogenesis-related genes like VEGFA (Wu2023Ring). These interactions and associations suggest that RNF215 may serve as a molecular marker for poor survival and a potential therapeutic target in CRC, participating in CRC formation through various signaling pathways and interactions with other proteins (Wu2023Ring).
