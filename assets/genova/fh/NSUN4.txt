# NSUN4

## Overview
NSUN4 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial RNA m5C methyltransferase protein, which plays a pivotal role in the modification and assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes. The NSUN4 protein is characterized as a methyltransferase, specifically involved in the methylation of mitochondrial rRNA, a process essential for the proper formation and function of mitoribosomes (Cámara2011MTERF4; Metodiev2014NSUN4). It forms a complex with MTERF4, which is crucial for its localization and function within the mitochondria, facilitating the assembly of ribosomal subunits (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). The NSUN4 gene is vital for mitochondrial translation and energy production, and its dysfunction can lead to severe mitochondrial diseases and developmental issues (Blanco2014Role). Additionally, NSUN4 has been implicated in cancer progression, where its expression levels may serve as a prognostic marker in certain cancers, such as lung squamous cell carcinoma and gliomas (Wang2020Identification; Pan2021m5C).

## Structure
NSUN4 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4) is an RNA m5C methyltransferase involved in mitochondrial rRNA modification. The primary structure of NSUN4 includes sequence signature motifs characteristic of the RNA m5C methyltransferase family, which are essential for its methyltransferase activity (Cámara2011MTERF4). The protein exhibits a classical Rossman-like fold, typical of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, with a core seven-stranded beta sheet (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). This fold is crucial for the binding of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a co-substrate necessary for its methyltransferase function (Yakubovskaya2012Structure).

The tertiary structure of NSUN4 is characterized by a single RNA m5C methyltransferase domain, lacking additional RNA substrate recognition domains (Cámara2011MTERF4). NSUN4 forms a stable complex with MTERF4, indicating a quaternary structure essential for its function in mitochondrial ribosome assembly (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). This interaction is crucial as NSUN4 lacks an intrinsic RNA recognition domain and relies on MTERF4 for proper localization to the mitochondrial ribosome (Cámara2011MTERF4). The MTERF4:NSUN4 complex is essential for directing NSUN4's methylation activity to its site in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA (Yakubovskaya2012Structure).

## Function
The NSUN4 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes. It functions as a dual-purpose protein involved in the methylation of 12S rRNA and the coordination of mitoribosomal assembly. Specifically, NSUN4 methylates cytosine 911 in 12S rRNA, a modification essential for the proper formation of mitoribosomes (Metodiev2014NSUN4). This methylation process is independent of its interaction with MTERF4, although the NSUN4/MTERF4 complex is crucial for assembling the small and large subunits of the mitoribosome into a functional monosome (Metodiev2014NSUN4).

NSUN4 is targeted to the large subunit of the mitoribosome through its interaction with MTERF4, which is necessary for the assembly of functional ribosomes (Cámara2011MTERF4). The absence of NSUN4 leads to impaired mitochondrial translation and respiratory chain deficiency, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function and cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (Metodiev2014NSUN4). NSUN4 is essential for embryonic development, as its complete knockout results in embryonic lethality (Blanco2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
NSUN4 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4) has significant clinical implications due to its role in mitochondrial function and cancer progression. Inactivation of NSUN4 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly affecting the heart, resulting in cardiomyopathy and respiratory chain deficiencies due to impaired mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation (Blanco2014Role; Metodiev2014NSUN4). This dysfunction is critical, as evidenced by embryonic lethality in mice lacking NSUN4, highlighting its essential role in development (Metodiev2014NSUN4).

In cancer, NSUN4 is implicated as an oncogene in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), where its expression is significantly upregulated compared to normal tissues. High NSUN4 expression is associated with shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Pan2021m5C). NSUN4 expression is also linked to the cell cycle, mTOR, and p53 signaling pathways, which are crucial in cancer progression (Pan2021m5C). In gliomas, NSUN4 expression correlates with tumor grade and IDH mutation status, indicating its potential role in glioma prognosis (Wang2020Identification). These findings suggest that NSUN4 expression alterations and mutations could have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer prognosis and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
NSUN4 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in ribosomal biogenesis and RNA modification. It forms a stable complex with MTERF4, a member of the MTERF family, which is essential for mitochondrial ribosome assembly. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity and involves specific regions of both proteins, with MTERF4 utilizing its C-terminal alpha-helices and NSUN4 involving an alpha-helix and nonconserved loops (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). The NSUN4/MTERF4 complex is crucial for targeting NSUN4 to the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, facilitating the methylation of 16S rRNA and ensuring proper ribosomal assembly (Cámara2011MTERF4; Metodiev2014NSUN4).

NSUN4 also interacts with mitochondrial rRNA, specifically methylating cytosine 911 in 12S rRNA, a modification necessary for mitochondrial translation. While NSUN4 can methylate 12S rRNA independently, its interaction with MTERF4 is required for the proper assembly of ribosomal subunits (Metodiev2014NSUN4). The NSUN4/MTERF4 complex preferentially binds double-stranded RNA, playing a structural role during ribosomal assembly by preventing premature subunit interactions (Metodiev2014NSUN4).
