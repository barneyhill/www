# RRM2

## Overview
The RRM2 gene encodes the ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2, a critical component of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme complex, which is essential for DNA synthesis and repair. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, interacting with the larger RRM1 subunit to form the active RNR complex, which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a key step in DNA replication and repair processes (Zhou2001Characterization). The RRM2 protein is characterized by its inclusion of a tyrosine free radical and non-heme iron, which are vital for its enzymatic activity (Zhou2001Characterization). It is expressed predominantly during the S-phase of the cell cycle and is subject to regulation by various transcription factors and post-translational modifications, such as acetylation (Afrasiabi2014RRM2; Chen2019Acetylation). Due to its pivotal role in maintaining nucleotide pools and cellular viability, RRM2 is a significant focus in cancer research, where its overexpression is often linked to poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior (Giang2023Targeting; Mazzu2019A).

## Structure
The RRM2 gene encodes the ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair. The primary structure of RRM2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function in the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme complex. The secondary structure of RRM2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function (Afrasiabi2014RRM2).

RRM2 forms a dimer with a molecular weight of approximately 88,000, and it contains a tyrosine free radical and non-heme iron, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Zhou2001Characterization). The tertiary structure of RRM2 involves the overall 3D shape that allows it to interact with the larger RRM1 subunit through its C-terminus, facilitating the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxynucleotides (Afrasiabi2014RRM2).

The quaternary structure of RRM2 involves its assembly with RRM1 to form the active ribonucleotide reductase complex. RRM2 is expressed maximally during the S-phase of the cell cycle and is regulated by transcription factors such as E2F (Afrasiabi2014RRM2). The protein also contains a KEN-box on the N-terminus, which is recognized during mitosis for poly-ubiquitination or degradation (Afrasiabi2014RRM2).

## Function
The RRM2 gene encodes the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a crucial enzyme in DNA synthesis and repair. This enzyme is responsible for converting ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, which are essential precursors for DNA replication and repair processes (Zhou2001Characterization). The RRM2 protein contains a tyrosine free radical and non-heme iron, which are critical for its enzymatic activity. It functions as part of a larger complex with the M1 subunit, and this complex is active during the S-phase of the cell cycle, making it rate-limiting for DNA synthesis (Zhou2001Characterization).

RRM2 plays a significant role in cell proliferation by ensuring a sufficient supply of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis, thus maintaining genomic stability. It is involved in DNA repair mechanisms, helping to provide the necessary nucleotides for genome replication and repair following DNA damage (Zhou2001Characterization). The expression of RRM2 is regulated by various factors, including transforming growth factor ß1 and chemotherapeutic agents, which can influence its activity in response to cellular stress and damage (Zhou2001Characterization). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, reflecting its involvement in critical cellular processes (Zhou2001Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The RRM2 gene, encoding the ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2, plays a significant role in cancer progression due to its involvement in DNA synthesis and repair. Overexpression of RRM2 is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including prostate cancer, where it is associated with increased genomic instability, higher Gleason scores, and metastasis development (Mazzu2019A). In prostate cancer, RRM2 overexpression is driven by the transcription factor FOXM1 and is correlated with lethal disease outcomes (Mazzu2019A). 

In glioma, RRM2 knockdown reduces cell migration and proliferation, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Sun2019RRM2). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high RRM2 mRNA expression is associated with shorter overall survival, although protein expression levels do not show the same significance (KlimaszewskaWiśniewska2021Expression). 

RRM2 is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where its high expression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages (Ma2020Independent). In atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, RRM2 overexpression is linked to aggressiveness and poor survival rates, with RRM2 inhibitors like COH29 showing potential therapeutic effects (Giang2023Targeting). These findings highlight RRM2 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
RRM2, a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis by interacting with RRM1 to form the active ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex. This interaction is essential for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a key step in DNA replication and repair (Specks2015A). The interaction between RRM1 and RRM2 is critical for the enzyme's function, as demonstrated by mutations that disrupt this interaction, leading to non-viability in model organisms (Specks2015A).

RRM2 is also subject to regulation through post-translational modifications, such as acetylation. Acetylation at lysine 95 (K95) on RRM2 disrupts its homodimer formation, thereby inactivating the RNR complex. This modification is mediated by the acetyltransferase KAT7, while deacetylation is facilitated by Sirt2, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle (Chen2019Acetylation). The interaction between RRM2 and Sirt2 is enhanced following DNA damage, promoting deacetylation and sustaining RNR activity (Chen2019Acetylation).

These interactions and modifications highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing RRM2's role in maintaining nucleotide pools and cellular viability, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Chen2019Acetylation).
