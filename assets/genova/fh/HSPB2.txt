# HSPB2

## Overview
HSPB2 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein family B (small) member 2, also known as Myotonic Dystrophy Kinase Binding Protein (MKBP). This protein is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, which functions primarily as molecular chaperones. HSPB2 is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis, particularly in muscle tissues, by preventing protein aggregation and unfolding under stress conditions. It plays a significant role in muscle integrity and function, as well as in cardiac cells, where it is associated with mitochondrial functions and protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The protein's interactions are specific, forming complexes with other proteins involved in mitochondrial and myofibril functions, and it is distinct from other sHSPs like HSP27 and αB-crystallin. HSPB2's expression and interactions have clinical significance, particularly in cancer, where its levels can influence tumor progression and patient outcomes (Grose2015Characterization; Hu2008HSPB2MKBP; Sklirou2022High).

## Structure
HSPB2, also known as Myotonic Dystrophy Kinase Binding Protein (MKBP), is a small heat shock protein characterized by its unique structural features. The primary structure of HSPB2 consists of 182 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 20.2 kDa (Hu2008HSPB2MKBP). It shares more than 30% sequence identity with other human small heat shock proteins, particularly in the α-crystallin domain, which spans positions 65 to 147 (Hu2008HSPB2MKBP).

The secondary structure of HSPB2 is predominantly composed of beta-sheets, with 50.5% beta-sheet content, 3.4% helix, and 53.9% random coil, as revealed by far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Prabhu2012HspB2Myotonic). The tertiary structure is characterized by a highly accessible tryptophan residue, indicating a solvent-exposed position (Prabhu2012HspB2Myotonic).

HSPB2 forms concentration-dependent oligomers, with molecular masses ranging from 56 kDa to 297 kDa, indicating a polydisperse quaternary structure (Prabhu2012HspB2Myotonic). It can form heterotetramers with HSPB3, with a specific 3:1 subunit ratio, which prevents interaction with other small heat shock proteins (Boelens2020Structural). The α-crystallin domain is crucial for dimer formation, serving as a building block for these oligomeric structures (Boelens2020Structural).

## Function
HSPB2, a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, functions primarily as a molecular chaperone, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. It is involved in protecting myofibrillar proteins from unfolding or aggregation during stress conditions, thereby preserving muscle integrity (Hu2008HSPB2MKBP). HSPB2 is localized at the neuromuscular junction and the Z band of myofibrils, indicating its involvement in muscle structure and function (Hu2008HSPB2MKBP).

In cardiac cells, HSPB2 is associated with mitochondrial functions, where it helps maintain mitochondrial integrity and function. It interacts with mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, transport, and metabolism, suggesting a role in energy production and cellular respiration (Grose2015Characterization). HSPB2 also plays a role in protecting cardiac cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury by preserving ATP levels and stabilizing mitochondrial function (Grose2015Characterization).

HSPB2's chaperone activity extends to protecting specific proteins, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), from heat-induced aggregation, which is crucial for maintaining ATP levels and preventing apoptosis in cardiac cells (Grose2015Characterization). This specificity highlights HSPB2's role in cellular stress responses and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HSPB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, high mRNA expression levels of HSPB2 are associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence and poor survival outcomes. Patients with HSPB2-positive tumors have a 2.29-fold higher risk of tumor recurrence and a 2.45-fold higher risk of poor overall survival compared to those with HSPB2-negative tumors (Sklirou2022High). In bladder cancer, HSPB2 expression is downregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues, but higher expression levels are linked to more advanced stages and grades, such as muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This suggests a dual role where HSPB2 may delay progression in early stages but promote aggressiveness in advanced stages (Gianniou2023Evaluation).

In colorectal cancer, HSPB2 is a direct target of miR-17-5p, which downregulates its expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Overexpression of HSPB2 in colorectal cancer cells inhibits cell viability and migration, indicating its potential role in suppressing tumor progression (Yu2021miR175p). These findings highlight the complex role of HSPB2 in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can significantly impact disease progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
HSPB2, also known as MKBP, is a small heat shock protein that participates in various protein interactions, particularly within muscle tissues. It forms homophilic interactions and is part of a unique small heat shock protein complex in striated muscles, distinct from those involving HSP27 and αB-crystallin (Hu2008HSPB2MKBP). HSPB2 specifically interacts with myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) through its α-crystallin domain, a unique interaction not shared by other small heat shock proteins like αB-crystallin and HSP27 (Hu2008HSPB2MKBP). 

In cardiac tissues, HSPB2 has been shown to interact with a variety of proteins involved in mitochondrial and myofibril functions. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified 84 high-confidence binding partners, including ATP synthase subunit alpha and electron-transfer-flavoprotein, which are involved in mitochondrial function (Grose2015Characterization). HSPB2 also interacts with other small heat shock proteins such as HspB5, but not with HspB3 or HspB8, indicating specificity in its interactions (Grose2015Characterization). These interactions suggest that HSPB2 plays a significant role in stabilizing myofibril structure and maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly under stress conditions like ischemia/reperfusion injury (Grose2015Characterization).
