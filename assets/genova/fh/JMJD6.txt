# JMJD6

## Overview
The JMJD6 gene encodes the protein jumonji domain containing 6, which functions as an arginine demethylase and lysine hydroxylase. This protein is categorized as a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase, characterized by its jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. JMJD6 is involved in various cellular processes, including histone modification and RNA processing, by demethylating arginine residues on histones and hydroxylating lysine residues, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Chang2007JMJD6; Kwok2017Jmjd6). Additionally, JMJD6 plays a role in mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation, interacting with several proteins and complexes to modulate these processes (Kwok2017Jmjd6; Webby2009Jmjd6). Its activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular responses to DNA damage, and it has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and interactions can influence tumor progression and prognosis (Huo2019JMJD6; Aprelikova2016The).

## Structure
The JMJD6 protein is characterized by a jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is a conserved feature among 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases. This domain spans residues 141 to 305 and forms a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, also known as a cupin fold, which is barrel-like with eight anti-parallel β-strands forming major and minor β-sheets. The Fe2+ binding site, essential for enzymatic activity, is located at the open end of the barrel and is composed of His187, Asp189, and His273, following the conserved HXD/E(Xn)H motif (Böttger2015The; Kwok2017Jmjd6).

JMJD6 can form various oligomeric structures, including dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. Dimerization involves α-helices at the N- and C-terminal ends (residues 61-68 and 322-334) (Kwok2017Jmjd6). The protein also contains a polyserine (polyS) stretch domain at its C-terminus (residues 340-365), which influences subnuclear localization (Böttger2015The; Kwok2017Jmjd6).

JMJD6 has several predicted nuclear localization sites and a nuclear export signal, as well as a putative sumoylation site and an AT-hook domain, which is a hybrid between a canonical and an extended AT-hook (Kwok2017Jmjd6). The protein can undergo autohydroxylation, potentially facilitating intermolecular cross-linking (Kwok2017Jmjd6).

## Function
The JMJD6 gene encodes a protein that functions as a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure. JMJD6 acts as a histone arginine demethylase, specifically targeting dimethylated arginine residues on histones H3 and H4, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Chang2007JMJD6; Kwok2017Jmjd6). It also catalyzes lysyl-hydroxylation, influencing chromatin configuration by potentially inhibiting subsequent acetylation and methylation (Kwok2017Jmjd6).

In addition to its role in histone modification, JMJD6 is involved in RNA processing, particularly in mRNA splicing. It hydroxylates serine/arginine-rich proteins and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein components, affecting splice site selection and splicing efficiency (Kwok2017Jmjd6; Webby2009Jmjd6). JMJD6 also interacts with the 7SK complex at gene promoters, facilitating the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing, thus promoting efficient mRNA elongation (Kwok2017Jmjd6).

JMJD6 is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional control, chromatin structure, and RNA splicing, contributing to cellular differentiation and development (Kwok2017Jmjd6). Its enzymatic activities are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular responses to DNA damage (Huo2019JMJD6).

## Clinical Significance
JMJD6 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene regulation and protein modification. In breast cancer, high JMJD6 expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in ER-positive and Myc-high tumors, where it cooperates with the Myc oncogene to enhance tumor progression and metastasis (Aprelikova2016The). JMJD6 also influences breast cancer by promoting cellular proliferation and motility, with its expression linked to aggressive tumor types (Lee2012JMJD6).

In colon cancer, JMJD6 negatively regulates the tumor suppressor p53 through hydroxylation, leading to reduced p53 activity and increased cancer cell survival. Its overexpression correlates with aggressive clinical behaviors and poor prognosis (Wang2014JMJD6).

JMJD6 is also involved in liver cancer, where it regulates HNF4α and promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation by influencing CDK4 expression (Wang2022Role; Yang2020Jumonji). In prostate cancer, JMJD6 is linked to castration resistance and shorter survival, acting as a regulator of AR-V7 (Wang2022Role).

Overall, JMJD6's expression alterations and interactions play significant roles in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Yang2020Jumonji).

## Interactions
JMJD6 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. It is known to interact with SIRT1, facilitating its recruitment to chromatin, which is crucial for modulating the DNA damage response (DDR) by regulating histone acetylation levels (Huo2019JMJD6). JMJD6 also interacts with BRD4, which is necessary for its recruitment to chromatin in response to DNA damage (Huo2019JMJD6).

In RNA processing, JMJD6 binds to Arg/Ser-rich domains of several SR and SR-like proteins, including U2AF65, SRSF11, and Luc7L2, which are involved in mRNA splicing (Böttger2015The; Kwok2017Jmjd6). It forms a trimeric complex with the U2AF65/U2AF35 heterodimer, influencing the selection of splice sites and alternative splicing events (Kwok2017Jmjd6). JMJD6 also interacts with the 7SK snRNA complex, facilitating the release of P-TEFb and promoting transcriptional elongation (Kwok2017Jmjd6).

JMJD6's interactions extend to proteins involved in immune responses and viral replication, such as TRAF6 and RNA helicase A (DHX9), highlighting its diverse functional roles (Kwok2017Jmjd6).
