# TMEM212

## Overview
TMEM212 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 212, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully understood. The TMEM212 gene has garnered attention due to its potential role in the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD). Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms within TMEM212, such as the rs2270568 variant, which may influence the risk of developing sPD. These findings suggest that TMEM212 could be involved in the regulation of hormone secretion, potentially affecting disease progression (Wang2021Sporadic). Further research is necessary to clarify the biological pathways and interactions mediated by transmembrane protein 212 and to understand its contribution to neurodegenerative diseases (Wang2021Sporadic).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM212 gene, also known as FLJ23172, has been implicated in sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD). Research has identified the T allele of the rs2270568 polymorphism within the TMEM212 gene as a potential risk locus for sPD. This allele was found to have a significantly higher minor allele frequency in sPD patients compared to controls, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. Although the rs2270568 mutation is synonymous, it resides within a pathogenicity region, indicating that it might influence disease development. The study speculates that alterations in this polymorphism could affect the secretion of hormones such as androgen and progesterone, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of sPD (Wang2021Sporadic).

Despite these findings, the exact mechanisms by which TMEM212 contributes to sPD remain unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathways and interactions involved. The study highlights the complexity of genetic factors in sPD and underscores the importance of identifying significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their potential functional impacts (Wang2021Sporadic).
