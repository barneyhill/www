# DKK1

## Overview
DKK1, or Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein known for its role as an antagonist in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a signaling inhibitor and is crucial in regulating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. DKK1 achieves its inhibitory function by binding to the LRP5/6 co-receptors, thereby preventing the formation of a signaling complex with Wnt and frizzled proteins. This action blocks the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a key mediator in the pathway, thus modulating gene transcription (Niehrs2006Function; Krishnan2006Regulation). The protein's role extends to critical physiological processes such as bone formation and embryonic development, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis and proper developmental patterning (Niehrs2006Function). DKK1's interactions with other proteins, such as LRP6 and CKAP4, further underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, including cancer and fibrotic diseases (Niehrs2006Function; Kimura2016CKAP4).

## Structure
DKK1 is a secreted protein that plays a critical role in inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein is composed of 266 amino acids and features two conserved cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), CRD1 and CRD2, each containing five disulfide bonds, which are essential for its function (Wen2023Molecular; Jiang2022Drug). These domains are separated by a sequence of unknown function and variable length (Jiang2022Drug). The C-terminal domain of DKK1, known as DKK1c, is necessary and sufficient for Wnt pathway inhibition and is responsible for binding to the LRP6 receptor (Jiang2022Drug).

The secondary structure of DKK1 includes alpha helices and random coils, with no beta-sheet structures detected in the recombinant form (Malaei2019In). The tertiary structure has been modeled to show structural similarity with residues 182-266 from the 3S2K PDBID (Malaei2019In). DKK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including potential N-linked glycosylation at Asn225 and O-linked glycosylation at Ser30, which contribute to differences between its apparent molecular size and theoretical molecular weight (Krupnik1999Functional; Jiang2022Drug). The protein's quaternary structure and any potential splice variant isoforms have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DKK1 (Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1) is a critical regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. DKK1 functions as an antagonist of Wnt signaling by binding to the lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) co-receptors, thereby preventing the formation of a signaling complex with Wnt and frizzled (Fz) proteins. This inhibition blocks the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a key mediator in the pathway, thus modulating gene transcription (Niehrs2006Function; Krishnan2006Regulation).

In healthy human cells, DKK1 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper development. It is involved in bone formation by regulating osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, acting as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling to maintain physiological bone mass levels (Niehrs2006Function). DKK1 is also crucial during embryonic development, particularly in head and limb formation, by creating signaling gradients that pattern the early embryo (Niehrs2006Function). Additionally, DKK1's expression is prominent in eye development, where it is essential for proper eye field splitting (Niehrs2006Function).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DKK1 gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and fibrotic conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated DKK1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased invasiveness, and recurrence. This is linked to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting a compromised ability of DKK1 to inhibit Wnt signaling due to genetic alterations affecting β-catenin stability (Yu2009Elevated). High DKK1 levels in HCC patients correlate with worse overall and disease-free survival, making it a potential prognostic marker (Yu2009Elevated).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), DKK1 expression is often downregulated, and its interaction with the S100A4 gene affects tumor progression. High S100A4 levels suppress DKK1, maintaining an activated Wnt pathway, which is associated with poor survival outcomes. Restoring DKK1 expression could improve CRC prognosis (Dahlmann2021Combination).

DKK1 also plays a role in fibrotic diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, elevated DKK1 levels are linked to joint destruction and bone erosion, while in pulmonary fibrosis, increased DKK1 expression is observed in fibrotic lungs, suggesting a role in modulating bronchial epithelial cell maintenance (Klavdianou2017Dkk1:).

## Interactions
DKK1 (dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1) is known for its interactions with several proteins, primarily as a modulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. DKK1 binds with high affinity to the Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), forming a binary 1:1 complex that inhibits Wnt signaling by preventing the receptor's interaction with Wnt-Fz (Niehrs2006Function). This interaction is mediated by the colipase fold within DKK1, which is crucial for LRP6 binding and Wnt inhibition (Niehrs2006Function).

DKK1 also interacts with Kremen1 and Kremen2 (Krm1/2), which are single-pass transmembrane proteins. These interactions enhance DKK1's ability to block Wnt signaling by forming a ternary complex with LRP6, leading to the endocytosis and removal of LRP6 from the plasma membrane (Niehrs2006Function).

In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, DKK1 binds to cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), a novel receptor, using its CRD1 domain. This interaction leads to the internalization of CKAP4 in a clathrin-dependent manner and activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression (Kimura2016CKAP4). The DKK1/CKAP4 axis is particularly significant in cancer progression, including pancreatic and lung cancers (Kimura2016CKAP4).
