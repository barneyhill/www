# KCNE4

## Overview
The KCNE4 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 4, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in modulating the activity of various voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. This regulatory subunit is involved in diverse physiological processes, including cardiac repolarization and vascular contractility, by influencing the gating and kinetics of Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and Kv7.4 (Jepps2015Fundamental; Grunnet2002KCNE4). KCNE4 is characterized by a unique tetraleucine motif that facilitates its interaction with other proteins, including calmodulin and Kv1.3, thereby modulating channel surface expression and function (Roig2021Calmodulindependent; Solé2019The). The gene's expression and function are critical in various tissues, including the heart, vasculature, kidney, and uterus, where it contributes to maintaining normal physiological functions and has been implicated in conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias (Abbott2016KCNE4).

## Structure
The KCNE4 protein is a regulatory subunit that modulates voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly Kv1.3. Its primary structure includes a unique tetraleucine motif (L69-72) located in the juxtamembrane region of the C-terminus, which is crucial for its dimerization and interaction with calmodulin (CaM) and Kv1.3 (Roig2021Calmodulindependent; Solé2019The). This motif forms an accessible loop that facilitates protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's regulatory functions (Roig2021Calmodulindependent).

The secondary and tertiary structures of KCNE4 are not explicitly detailed in the available literature, but the presence of the tetraleucine motif suggests a loop structure that is accessible for interactions (Roig2021Calmodulindependent). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, as KCNE4 can form both monomeric and dimeric complexes, unlike other KCNE family members (Roig2021Calmodulindependent).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect KCNE4's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The protein also has a longer isoform due to an N-terminal extension, which is common among vertebrates and includes an additional glycosylation site (Abbott2016Novel). This extended form is absent in Mus musculus due to the lack of an ATG start site in exon 1 (Abbott2016Novel).

## Function
KCNE4 encodes a regulatory subunit that modulates the function of various voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, playing a crucial role in cellular excitability and physiological processes. In the cardiovascular system, KCNE4 is involved in the regulation of KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) channels, which are essential for cardiac repolarization. KCNE4 acts as an inhibitory subunit, significantly reducing KCNQ1 current without affecting its surface expression, thereby influencing cardiac rhythm and potentially contributing to conditions like long QT syndrome (Abbott2016KCNE4; Grunnet2002KCNE4).

In vascular smooth muscle cells, KCNE4 regulates Kv7.4 channels, which are important for controlling arterial tone. It enhances the membrane abundance and activity of Kv7.4, influencing vascular contractility and resting membrane potential, thus playing a role in maintaining normal vascular reactivity (Jepps2015Fundamental).

KCNE4 is also expressed in other tissues, including the kidney and uterus, where it modulates different potassium channels, such as BK channels, affecting processes like K+ secretion and uterine function (Abbott2016KCNE4). The protein is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it interacts with channel complexes to modulate their gating and kinetics (Abbott2016KCNE4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNE4 gene have been linked to various cardiac arrhythmias. The KCNE4 gene is a regulatory subunit for potassium channels, and its variants can significantly impact cardiac function. One notable polymorphism, the E/D variant at position 145, has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). The 145D variant is considered an independent risk factor for AF in certain populations, as it augments the KCNQ1 current, potentially shortening the atrial effective refractory period and predisposing individuals to AF (MA2007Modulation; Abbott2016KCNE4).

KCNE4 also plays a role in modulating the activity of other potassium channels, such as Kv4.3, which are involved in cardiac repolarization. Alterations in KCNE4 expression or function can disrupt normal cardiac electrical activity, contributing to arrhythmias like Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada Syndrome (BrS) (Abbott2016Regulation; Crump2014Arrhythmogenic).

Despite its involvement in cardiac arrhythmias, the association of KCNE4 gene variants with inherited arrhythmia syndromes is relatively low. This may be due to its potential redundancy with other KCNE isoforms or its essential nature, which could make mutations lethal before birth (Abbott2016KCNE4).

## Interactions
KCNE4, a regulatory subunit of potassium channels, interacts with several proteins, notably the Kv1.3 channel and calmodulin (CaM). The interaction with Kv1.3 is mediated by a tetraleucine motif in the C-terminal domain of KCNE4, which serves as a platform for binding. This interaction is crucial for modulating Kv1.3's surface expression and function, impacting immune system responses by retaining Kv1.3 intracellularly and enhancing its inactivation (Solé2019The). KCNE4 can form dimers, a process influenced by the presence of Kv1.3 and CaM, with CaM inhibiting dimer formation in a calcium-dependent manner (Roig2021Calmodulindependent).

KCNE4 also interacts with CaM, a calcium-binding messenger protein, which competes with Kv1.3 for binding to the tetraleucine motif. This competition allows Kv1.3 to escape KCNE4-dependent endoplasmic reticulum retention, facilitating its membrane expression (Roig2021Calmodulindependent). The interaction with CaM is essential for KCNE4's function, as it controls dimerization and membrane targeting, thereby modulating its interaction with Kv1.3 (Roig2021Calmodulindependent). KCNE4's interaction with CaM is also critical for modulating other potassium channels, such as KCNQ1, where it inhibits potassium currents through a similar mechanism (Ciampa2010KCNE4).
