# PSMC5

## Overview
PSMC5 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 5, a crucial component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein is part of the AAA family of ATPases, which are involved in ATP-dependent protein degradation, a process essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The PSMC5 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and stress responses. It is involved in the spatial control of signaling pathways, such as the ERK1/2 pathway, by modulating protein ubiquitylation and interacting with key signaling molecules. PSMC5 is also implicated in the regulation of neuroinflammatory responses and has been associated with several cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Bi2023PSMC5; He2021PSMC5; Jang2015Spatial).

## Structure
The PSMC5 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex, which is involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of the PSMC5 protein includes 406 amino acids, with a full-length cDNA sequence of 1,221 base pairs (Wang2004Full). The protein features a leucine zipper (LZ) domain located in the N-terminal regions, specifically in exon 3 and exon 4, and a conserved ATPase domain (CAD) spanning from exon 6 to exon 11. The CAD domain contains a putative ATP-binding motif 'GPPGTGKT' and an ATP hydrolysis motif 'DEID' (Wang2004Full).

In terms of tertiary structure, PSMC5 is part of the AAA family of ATPases, which are characterized by a conserved AAA module crucial for ATP binding and energy-requiring biological reactions (Tanahashi1998Chromosomal). The quaternary structure involves its integration into the proteasome complex, where it forms part of the heterohexameric ATPase ring that acts as a mechanical motor, unfolding substrates and translocating them via the central pore of the ATPase ring (Mao2020Structure). The protein is highly conserved across species, sharing 92% identity with the human PSMC5 gene and 90% with the mouse homologue (Wang2004Full).

## Function
PSMC5 is a crucial component of the 26S proteasome, involved in ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses (Jang2015Spatial). PSMC5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the removal of damaged or misfolded proteins, ensuring cellular health and function (Jang2015Spatial).

In the context of ERK1/2 signaling, PSMC5 is part of the Shoc2 scaffold complex, where it modulates the ubiquitylation of Shoc2 and RAF-1 by displacing the E3 ligase HUWE1. This modulation affects ERK1/2 activity, which is crucial for cellular responses to external stimuli (Jang2015Spatial). PSMC5's ATPase activity and oligomerization are necessary for the recruitment of the Shoc2-PSMC5 complex to endosomes, influencing the spatial control of signaling pathways (Jang2015Spatial).

PSMC5 also plays a role in the remodeling of signaling complexes, affecting the ubiquitylation of proteins within these complexes and modulating the amplitude of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This function is vital for normal cell growth, motility, and preventing developmental disorders (Jang2015Spatial).

## Clinical Significance
PSMC5 has been implicated in several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In CRC, PSMC5 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. It promotes CRC progression by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling and modulating immune cell infiltration, particularly influencing tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils (He2021PSMC5). PSMC5 is also linked to immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting its potential as a target for immune checkpoint blockade therapy (He2021PSMC5).

In LUAD, PSMC5 is overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels, with reduced promoter methylation correlating with this overexpression. This hypomethylation is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival in LUAD patients. Genetic alterations such as amplifications and mutations in PSMC5 are linked to poor patient outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Ullah2022Evaluating; Ullah2022Identifying). PSMC5's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration and is negatively correlated with overall survival in LUAD, highlighting its role in cancer progression and potential for targeted therapies (Ullah2022Evaluating).

## Interactions
PSMC5, also known as proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 5, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a component of the 26S proteasome complex, which is crucial for protein degradation. PSMC5 interacts with transcription factors and is associated with transcription activation, elongation, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling (Bi2023PSMC5).

In the context of neuroinflammation, PSMC5 interacts with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor involved in LPS-induced inflammation. This interaction is significant in regulating microglial polarization and activation, suggesting that PSMC5 modulates TLR4-mediated pathways to influence neuroinflammatory responses (Bi2023PSMC5).

PSMC5 also plays a role in the spatial control of Shoc2 scaffold-mediated ERK1/2 signaling. It interacts with Shoc2 and the E3 ligase HUWE1, modulating the ubiquitylation of Shoc2 and RAF-1. This interaction affects the amplitude of ERK1/2 signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and motility. PSMC5's ATPase activity is essential for recruiting Shoc2 to endosomes, where it remodels the Shoc2 complex by sequestering HUWE1 (Jang2015Spatial).
