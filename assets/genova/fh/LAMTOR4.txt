# LAMTOR4

## Overview
LAMTOR4, also known as C7orf59, is a gene that encodes the protein late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 4. This protein is a critical component of the Ragulator complex, which is integral to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. The LAMTOR4 protein functions as an adaptor, facilitating the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface in response to amino acid availability. It forms a dimer with LAMTOR5 (HBXIP) and interacts with other components of the Ragulator complex, such as LAMTOR1, through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, contributing to the stability and function of the complex (Mu2017Structural; Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its interactions and the assembly of the Ragulator complex, thereby influencing mTORC1 signaling (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4). LAMTOR4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including nutrient sensing, cell growth, and metabolism, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Tsujimoto2023The).

## Structure
The LAMTOR4 protein, also known as C7orf59, is a component of the Ragulator complex, which plays a crucial role in mTORC1 signaling. Structurally, LAMTOR4 forms a dimer with LAMTOR5 (HBXIP), and this dimer is part of the larger pentameric Ragulator complex (Mu2017Structural; Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4). The crystal structure of the human HBXIP-C7orf59 dimer has been resolved at 2.9 Å resolution, revealing an unfolded N terminus in C7orf59 that is essential for binding with p18, another component of the Ragulator complex (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4).

LAMTOR4 interacts with LAMTOR1 through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, contributing to the stabilization of the Ragulator complex (Mu2017Structural). The protein lacks the α3-helix found in other Ragulator subunits, but this is compensated by the α-helices of LAMTOR1 (Mu2017Structural). A key post-translational modification of LAMTOR4 is the phosphorylation at Ser67 by protein kinase A (PKA), which affects its interaction with p18 and the stability of the Ragulator complex (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4). This phosphorylation site is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in the regulation of the complex's assembly (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4).

## Function
LAMTOR4, also known as C7orf59, is a crucial component of the Ragulator complex, which plays a significant role in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. LAMTOR4 is part of a pentameric complex that includes p18, MP1, p14, and HBXIP (LAMTOR5), and it is tethered to the lysosomal surface. It facilitates the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 by promoting the GTP-bound form of RagA/B during amino acid sufficiency, which is critical for mTORC1 activation (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4; De2020Quantitative).

LAMTOR4's interaction with other components of the Ragulator complex, particularly p18, is modulated by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of LAMTOR4 at Ser67 by Protein Kinase A (PKA) negatively impacts its interaction with p18, affecting the assembly and stability of the Ragulator complex. This phosphorylation serves as a regulatory mechanism, influencing the complex's ability to facilitate mTORC1 activation in response to cellular signals (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4).

In healthy human cells, LAMTOR4 is involved in lysosomal positioning and size regulation, impacting nutrient sensing and cellular homeostasis. It also plays a role in integrin signaling and lysosome biogenesis, contributing to various cellular functions beyond metabolism (Tsujimoto2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the LAMTOR4 gene can significantly impact cellular processes due to its role in the activation of the mTORC1 pathway. Alterations in LAMTOR4 expression or function have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes. In cancer, aberrant mTOR signaling, potentially resulting from LAMTOR4 mutations, can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, contributing to tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of LAMTOR4 may also affect neurodegenerative diseases by disrupting normal cellular metabolism and autophagy, processes that are crucial for neuronal health and function. In metabolic syndromes, altered LAMTOR4 activity can impact the regulation of cellular metabolism, leading to imbalances that contribute to conditions such as obesity and diabetes. These associations highlight the clinical significance of LAMTOR4 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by mTOR pathway dysregulation.

## Interactions
LAMTOR4, also known as C7orf59, is a crucial component of the Ragulator complex, which is essential for mTORC1 signaling. It interacts with other proteins such as LAMTOR1, LAMTOR2, LAMTOR3, and LAMTOR5 to form this pentameric complex. LAMTOR4, along with LAMTOR5, forms a subcomplex through β-sheet formation and hydrophobic interactions, similar to the LAMTOR2-LAMTOR3 pair (Mu2017Structural). 

LAMTOR4 interacts specifically with LAMTOR1 through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the stability of the Ragulator complex. The α2-helix of LAMTOR1 interacts with residues on LAMTOR4, such as L9, I12, F63, and others, forming a stable interface (Mu2017Structural). 

The phosphorylation of LAMTOR4 at Ser67 by Protein Kinase A (PKA) modulates its interaction with p18, another component of the Ragulator complex. This phosphorylation can lead to the breakdown of the Ragulator complex, affecting mTORC1 signaling (Rasheed2019C7orf59LAMTOR4). The interaction between LAMTOR4 and other Ragulator components is essential for the localization and function of the complex in amino acid sensing and cellular growth regulation (Condon2019Nutrient).
