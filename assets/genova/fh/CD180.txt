# CD180

## Overview
CD180, also known as RP105, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in B cell function. The CD180 protein is a receptor that forms a complex with MD-1, facilitating its expression on the cell surface and enabling it to function as a sensor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of bacterial cell walls. This receptor is structurally similar to the TLR4/MD-2 complex and is involved in the regulation of immune responses by modulating signaling pathways that influence B cell proliferation and survival (Antosz2010Different; Nagai2002Requirement). CD180's ability to interact with various signaling molecules, such as the kinase PIM-1L, underscores its role in promoting cell survival and preventing overactivation of the immune system (Egli2015Human; Antosz2010Different). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in both normal immune function and pathological conditions, including hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders (Yang2018CD180; Edwards2023The).

## Structure


## Function
CD180, also known as RP105, is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly in B cells. It functions as a sensor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and regulates B cell proliferation. In healthy human cells, CD180 expression is significantly higher compared to leukemic cells, indicating its involvement in normal immune function (Antosz2010Different). CD180 forms a complex with MD1, which is essential for its cell surface expression and function in LPS recognition and signaling (Nagai2002Requirement). This complex is structurally similar to the TLR4/MD-2 complex and is involved in the activation of Lyn and phosphorylation of CD19, which are part of the signaling pathways that mediate immune responses (Antosz2010Different).

CD180 also interacts with the kinase PIM-1L, enabling it to transmit signals that promote B cell survival and proliferation. This interaction leads to increased phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein BAD, enhancing cell survival (Egli2015Human). CD180's role in modulating immune responses is further highlighted by its ability to inhibit TLR4-signaling, preventing overactivation of the immune system (Antosz2010Different).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in CD180 expression and function have been implicated in various diseases, particularly hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD180 expression is associated with disease outcomes. Higher expression levels correlate with early-stage disease and better survival rates, while lower expression is linked to advanced disease stages and shorter survival (Edwards2021Expression; Edwards2023The). CD180's interaction with signaling pathways, such as AKT and p38MAPK, influences CLL cell survival and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Edwards2023The; Porakishvili2015Rewiring).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CD180 negatively regulates TLR7 and TLR9 signaling, which are involved in immune cell hyperactivation. CD180-negative macrophages and dendritic cells are increased in SLE patients, and targeting CD180 with specific antibodies has shown potential in ameliorating lupus symptoms in mouse models (Yang2018CD180; You2015Ligation). CD180's role in modulating immune responses highlights its significance in autoimmune disease pathogenesis and treatment strategies.

CD180 expression is also relevant in other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Kawasaki disease, where its expression levels may influence disease severity and progression (Edwards2023The).

## Interactions
CD180, also known as RP105, forms a 2:2 heterodimer with the protein MD-1, which is essential for its expression on the cell surface. This interaction is analogous to the TLR4-MD-2 complex, where MD-1 is crucial for the stability and function of CD180 (Edwards2023The; Nagai2002Requirement). CD180 does not interact with MD-2, highlighting the specificity of its association with MD-1 (Nagai2002Requirement).

CD180 is involved in the regulation of TLR4 signaling by interacting with the TLR4-MD-2 complex. This interaction inhibits the binding of microbial ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to TLR4, thereby modulating immune responses (Divanovic2005Negative). The RP105-MD-1 complex specifically inhibits TLR4-driven signaling pathways, including IL-8 production and NF-κB transactivation, in a dose-dependent manner (Divanovic2005Negative).

In B cells, CD180 interacts with CD19, leading to the phosphorylation of CD19 and the recruitment of signaling molecules such as Lyn and Vav, which are crucial for CD180-mediated signaling (Edwards2023The). CD180 also associates with PIM-1L kinase, indicating its role as an adaptor molecule in signal transduction (Edwards2023The).
