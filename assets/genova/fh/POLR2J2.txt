# POLR2J2

## Overview
POLR2J2 is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit J2, a component of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is essential for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells. This subunit plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. The protein encoded by POLR2J2, categorized as a transcriptional regulator, is involved in various cellular processes, including the synthesis of mRNA precursors and microRNAs. It is particularly noted for its interaction with transcription factors such as ATF4, which enhances transcriptional activation. POLR2J2's expression and regulation are implicated in several diseases, including Huntington's disease and cervical cancer, where its altered expression may serve as a biomarker or influence disease progression (GRABINSKI2014MULTIFUNCTIONALIZED; Proshkin2019The; Hart2023miR34a5p).

## Function
POLR2J2 encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is involved in the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression. RNA polymerase II is responsible for synthesizing mRNA precursors and microRNAs, which are essential for various cellular processes and organismal development (GRABINSKI2014MULTIFUNCTIONALIZED).

In response to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) treatments, the POLR2J2 subunit is generally up-regulated, indicating its potential involvement in the transcriptional response to such exposures. However, it is down-regulated in the presence of NTP-cRGD-SPIONs, suggesting a nuanced role in cellular responses to different environmental stimuli (GRABINSKI2014MULTIFUNCTIONALIZED). The specific function of POLR2J2 in healthy human cells is not detailed, but its regulation in response to SPIONs implies a role in adapting transcriptional activity under varying conditions (GRABINSKI2014MULTIFUNCTIONALIZED).

POLR2J2 is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to the transcriptional machinery that governs gene expression, impacting cellular signaling and protein synthesis (GRABINSKI2014MULTIFUNCTIONALIZED).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2J2 gene has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In Huntington's Disease (HD), miR-34a-5p, a microRNA, targets POLR2J2, potentially regulating it at the protein level through translational inhibition. Although no significant changes in POLR2J2 mRNA expression were observed in HD samples, its regulation by miR-34a-5p suggests a role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Hart2023miR34a5p).

In CLN3 disease, POLR2J2 is significantly downregulated across all patient groups, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's progression. This downregulation suggests that POLR2J2 may serve as a biomarker or modifier gene affecting the clinical course of CLN3 disease (Lebrun2011Analysis).

In cervical cancer, POLR2J2 is downregulated compared to normal tissues, highlighting its potential role in cancer development. This downregulation is part of a broader pattern of altered expression of RNA binding proteins, which are crucial in regulating gene expression and may impact cancer progression (Huang2021Expression; Huang2021Expressiona).

## Interactions
The POLR2J2 gene encodes the hRPB11bα isoform, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is involved in several specific protein interactions. One notable interaction is with the transcription factor ATF4. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal b-Zip domain of ATF4 and is crucial for the activation of RNA polymerase II on gene promoters regulated by ATF4. The interaction between hRPB11bα and ATF4 enhances transcriptional activation, as demonstrated by increased reporter gene activity in co-transfection experiments (Proshkin2019The).

The interaction between hRPB11bα and ATF4 is isoform-specific, with hRPB11bα showing a stronger affinity for ATF4 compared to the major isoform hRPB11a. This specificity is attributed to differences in the C-terminal region of hRPB11bα, as deletion of the last 10 amino acids significantly reduces its affinity for ATF4 (Proshkin2019The).

Additionally, POLR2J2 is identified as a direct target of miR-34a-5p, a microRNA involved in Huntington's disease, suggesting a regulatory role in gene expression (Hart2023miR34a5p). These interactions highlight the functional specificity and regulatory potential of the POLR2J2 gene product in transcriptional processes.
