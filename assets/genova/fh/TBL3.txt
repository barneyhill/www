# TBL3

## Overview
TBL3 (transducin beta like 3) is a human gene that encodes the transducin beta-like protein 3, which is primarily involved in the processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This protein is categorized as a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, playing a crucial role in the maturation of 45S pre-rRNA into the mature 18S and 28S rRNA components of the ribosome (Li2021RNA). TBL3 is also implicated in the nucleolar localization of proteins, suggesting its involvement in a conserved mechanism for rRNA processing (Bao2024A). Beyond its role in ribosome biogenesis, TBL3 interacts with expanded CAG repeats in RNA transcripts associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and Huntington's disease, potentially influencing RNA-RBP interactions and contributing to disease pathology (Li2021RNA).

## Function
TBL3 (transducin beta like 3) is involved in the processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in human cells. It plays a critical role in the maturation of 45S pre-rRNA, which is a precursor to the mature 18S and 28S rRNA components of the ribosome. Knockdown of TBL3 in HEK293T cells results in increased levels of unprocessed 45S pre-rRNA and decreased ratios of mature 18S and 28S rRNA to 45S pre-rRNA, indicating its essential role in normal rRNA processing (Li2021RNA). TBL3 is also involved in the nucleolar localization of proteins, as its localization is dependent on UTP3, a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome. This suggests that TBL3 is part of a conserved mechanism for nucleolar localization and rRNA processing (Bao2024A).

In addition to its role in rRNA processing, TBL3 interacts with expanded CAG repeats in RNA transcripts associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and Huntington's disease. This interaction is specific to CAG repeats and may influence RNA-RBP interactions, potentially contributing to disease pathology (Li2021RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TBL3 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and Huntington's disease (HD). TBL3, a human homolog of yeast UTP13, plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. Disruptions in TBL3 function can lead to impaired maturation of 45S pre-rRNA, resulting in decreased levels of 18S and 28S rRNA. This disruption has been observed in postmortem cerebellar tissues from patients with SCA2 and HD, suggesting a link between TBL3 dysfunction and the pathogenesis of these diseases (Li2021RNA).

In SCA2, the expanded ATXN2 transcript interacts aberrantly with RNA-binding proteins, including TBL3, which is a component of the small subunit processome involved in rRNA processing. This interaction may contribute to the neurotoxicity observed in SCA2 by affecting RNA metabolism and rRNA maturation (Li2021RNA). Similarly, TBL3 binds to expanded CAG repeats in the ATXN2 and HTT transcripts, which may play a role in the RNA neurotoxicity seen in both SCA2 and HD (Li2021RNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TBL3 in the context of neurodegenerative diseases associated with repeat expansion mutations.

## Interactions
TBL3, a human gene encoding the transducin beta-like protein 3, is involved in interactions with expanded CAG repeats in RNA transcripts, particularly those of the ATXN2 and HTT genes. This interaction is specific to CAG repeats, as TBL3 does not bind to CUG repeats. The binding affinity of TBL3 to these repeats is stronger with continuous CAG sequences compared to interrupted ones, suggesting that TBL3 may recognize the hairpin structure formed by CAG repeat RNA. The presence of a structured competitor RNA, such as tRNA, can abolish this interaction, indicating that TBL3's binding is dependent on the RNA structure of the CAG repeats (Li2021RNA).

In the context of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and Huntington's disease (HD), TBL3 is implicated in the maturation of 45S pre-rRNA. Its interaction with expanded ATXN2 may disrupt its function, affecting rRNA maturation. Knockdown of TBL3 leads to increased levels of unprocessed 45S pre-rRNA, indicating a disruption in rRNA processing. This suggests that aberrant RNA-RBP interactions involving TBL3 may affect rRNA processing in these diseases (Li2021RNA).
