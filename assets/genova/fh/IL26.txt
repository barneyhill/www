# IL26

## Overview
Interleukin 26 (IL26) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin-26, which is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family. This protein is primarily involved in immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammation and host defense against bacterial infections. Interleukin-26 is produced by various immune cells, including Th17 cells and alveolar macrophages, and functions by interacting with a specific receptor complex composed of IL-20R1 and IL-10R2. This interaction activates signaling pathways that are crucial for immune modulation, such as the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. The protein is characterized by its ability to form homodimers and its structural similarity to other IL-10 family members, featuring a tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds. Interleukin-26 also exhibits unique properties, such as binding to DNA and chromatin, which enhance its role in inflammatory processes and microbial defense (Che2014Interleukin26; Fickenscher2004Interleukin26; Meller2015TH17).

## Structure
Interleukin-26 (IL-26) is a cytokine that forms homodimers, a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Zdanov2004Structural; Fickenscher2004Interleukin26). The primary structure of IL-26 consists of 171 amino acids, including a hydrophobic signal sequence of 21 amino acids (Fickenscher2004Interleukin26). It shares 24.7% amino acid identity with IL-10, indicating a degree of structural similarity (Trivella2010Structure).

The secondary structure of IL-26 is predicted to include six helices, similar to other IL-10 family members (Fickenscher2004Interleukin26). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for its dimerization (Trivella2010Structure; Wei2019Interleukin10). Specifically, cysteine residues at positions 32, 79, 102, 121, and 124 are involved in these disulfide bonds (Trivella2010Structure).

IL-26 interacts with a receptor complex composed of IL-20R1 and IL-10R2, which is unique to this cytokine within the IL-10 family (Trivella2010Structure). The protein has a high affinity for heparin, suggesting interactions with glycosaminoglycans on proteoglycans, potentially acting as co-receptors (Trivella2010Structure). Glycosylation is largely excluded from IL-26, which may influence its tertiary structure (Fickenscher2004Interleukin26).

## Function
Interleukin-26 (IL-26) is a cytokine involved in the immune response, particularly in the lungs. It is primarily produced by alveolar macrophages and Th17 cells, and plays a significant role in antibacterial host defense by mobilizing neutrophils to sites of infection. IL-26 enhances the release of neutrophil-mobilizing cytokines such as IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, and GM-CSF, which are crucial for effective immune responses in the lungs (Che2014Interleukin26).

IL-26 functions by signaling through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL-10R2 and IL-20R1. This signaling pathway is involved in modulating immune responses, including the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, which are important for neutrophil activity and chemotaxis (Che2021Interleukin26; Che2014Interleukin26). IL-26 also directly kills bacteria by forming pores in bacterial membranes, contributing to its antimicrobial properties (Meller2015TH17).

In addition to its role in antibacterial defense, IL-26 is involved in inflammatory processes. It is known to stimulate the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and enhance the chemotaxis of neutrophils, thereby focusing their migration to sites of bacterial exposure (Che2021Interleukin26). IL-26's activity in extracellular spaces and its ability to influence cell signaling pathways underscore its importance in immune system modulation.

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 26 (IL-26) is implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In Crohn's disease, IL-26 is upregulated in inflamed colonic lesions, correlating with increased expression of IL-8 and IL-22, suggesting its role in modulating intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and proinflammatory gene expression (Dambacher2008The). IL-26 is also elevated in the inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, but is reduced in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating a complex role in disease activity (Song2022Interleukin26).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), IL-26 is overexpressed in synovial fluid and serum, promoting the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the generation of Th17 cells, which are involved in the inflammatory response characteristic of RA (Corvaisier2012IL26). IL-26 is also associated with psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, where it contributes to inflammatory responses and is linked to genetic susceptibility loci (Meller2015TH17; Corvaisier2012IL26). These findings suggest that IL-26 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of these diseases and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Interleukin 26 (IL-26) is a cytokine that participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune responses. IL-26 interacts with a receptor complex composed of IL-20 receptor 1 (IL-20R1) and IL-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2), which is crucial for activating the STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways (Sheikh2004Cutting). This interaction is essential for IL-26's signaling functions.

IL-26 also exhibits strong DNA-binding properties. It forms complexes with DNA released from dying bacteria, which are visible under confocal microscopy. These IL-26-DNA complexes are protected from degradation by extracellular DNase, enhancing the immunogenicity of the DNA and inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-α, by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Meller2015TH17). The binding of IL-26 to DNA is facilitated by its cationic and amphipathic nature, with specific regions such as helices B and E being involved in this interaction (Poli2017IL26).

IL-26 can also bind to chromatin fibers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and its interaction with DNA is more effective in activating myeloid cells compared to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Poli2017IL26). These interactions highlight IL-26's role in linking extracellular DNA to inflammatory processes and microbial defense (Larochette2019IL26).
