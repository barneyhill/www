# DNLZ

## Overview
The DNLZ gene encodes the DNL-type zinc finger protein, which is a crucial component in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain, a structural motif that facilitates interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins, categorizing it as a regulatory protein involved in mitochondrial processes. The DNL-type zinc finger protein plays a significant role in stress response and the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, which is essential for energy production and cellular metabolism. Dysregulation of the DNLZ gene has been implicated in various diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, highlighting its importance in cellular health and disease pathogenesis (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the DNLZ gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in DNLZ can lead to mitochondrial disorders, which are conditions that arise from failures in the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. These disorders can manifest in a variety of symptoms, often affecting organs and tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscles.

Alterations in DNLZ expression have also been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The gene's involvement in stress response and mitochondrial integrity suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a known factor.

Furthermore, DNLZ has been linked to cancer. Changes in its expression or function can disrupt cellular homeostasis and promote oncogenic processes. The gene's role in regulating mitochondrial function is crucial, as cancer cells often exhibit altered metabolism and energy production. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which DNLZ mutations or expression changes contribute to these diseases remains an active area of research, with potential implications for developing targeted therapies.
