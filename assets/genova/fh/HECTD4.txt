# HECTD4

## Overview
HECTD4 is a gene that encodes the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4, an enzyme categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The HECTD4 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and stress response, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Singh2021Exploring). The gene has been associated with metabolic traits and diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and is implicated in cancer and other conditions (Lee2022The; Singh2021Exploring). Despite its recognized importance, the specific biological functions and substrates of HECTD4 remain largely unexplored, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand its role in cellular signaling and metabolism (Lee2022The).

## Function
HECTD4 (HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4) is an enzyme that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation via the proteasome. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Singh2021Exploring). HECTD4 is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and stress responses. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing protein stability and function, thereby impacting cellular and organismal physiology (Singh2021Exploring).

The HECTD4 gene is associated with metabolic traits, such as fasting blood glucose levels and triglyceride concentrations, particularly in the context of alcohol consumption. Variants in the HECTD4 gene have been linked to decreased metabolic traits, suggesting a protective role against type 2 diabetes (Lee2022The). HECTD4 expression is also responsive to oxidative stress, as its expression is elevated in response to ethanol treatment, which is mitigated by antioxidants (Lee2022The). Despite these findings, the specific biological function and substrates of HECTD4 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate its role in cellular signaling and metabolism (Lee2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HECTD4 gene have been implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions. HECTD4 has been identified as a potential candidate gene for metabolic syndrome, which is linked to diabetes mellitus, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease (Singh2021Exploring). Mutations in HECTD4 have also been found in ovarian endometriosis and various tumor tissues, suggesting its role as a cancer-related gene (Singh2021Exploring). In cholangiocarcinoma cells, the long non-coding RNA HEIH modulates HECTD4 expression, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Singh2021Exploring).

HECTD4 is located in the 12q24 region, a locus associated with several diseases, including type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and coronary artery disease (Wei2019Shared). It is differentially expressed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions of Alzheimer's disease patients (Wei2019Shared). Additionally, HECTD4 has been associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular traits, with specific variants showing sex-specific genetic effects (Cho2021A).

In urothelial carcinoma, mutations in HECTD4 have been found exclusively in tumors that progressed from low-grade to high-grade, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Kittler2018Grade). HECTD4 is also implicated in gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia, with certain SNPs associated with these conditions (Chang2022Polygenic).

## Interactions
HECTD4, a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. In cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) cells, HECTD4 expression is modulated by the long non-coding RNA HEIH, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by interacting with miR-98-5p, a tumor suppressor miRNA. HEIH and miR-98-5p coexist in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and HEIH can modulate the expression of HECTD4, a target gene of miR-98-5p. This interaction promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CHOL cells (Wan2020LncRNA).

HECTD4 has also been identified as a potential candidate gene for metabolic syndrome, with mutations found in various tumor tissues, suggesting a role in cancer. However, specific physical interactions of HECTD4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature (Singh2021Exploring). The structural organization of HECTD4, like other HECT E3 ligases, includes a C-terminal HECT domain crucial for catalytic activity, but the full-length structures and specific interaction partners remain to be fully characterized (Lorenz2017Structural).
