# FOXD4L6

## Overview
FOXD4L6 is a gene that encodes the protein forkhead box D4 like 6, which is part of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which allows them to play crucial roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. Although the specific functions of the FOXD4L6 protein are not fully elucidated, its gene has been associated with certain cancers, particularly in the context of genetic deletions observed in lung squamous cell carcinomas related to arsenic exposure and skull-base chordoma (Martinez2010Arsenicrelated; Bai2021Whole). Further research is necessary to understand the precise biological and clinical implications of FOXD4L6 and its encoded protein.

## Clinical Significance
FOXD4L6 has been implicated in certain cancers, particularly in the context of arsenic exposure and skull-base chordoma. In lung squamous cell carcinomas related to arsenic exposure, DNA losses at 9q12, which include the FOXD4L6 gene, were observed in nearly two-thirds of samples from affected patients. This suggests that the deletion of FOXD4L6 may play a role in arsenic-induced lung neoplasia, although the gene itself has not been directly linked to neoplastic processes (Martinez2010Arsenicrelated).

In skull-base chordoma, a deletion at 9q21.11, which encompasses the FOXD4L6 gene, has been associated with recurrence-free survival. This deletion showed a stronger association with recurrence-free survival than other genetic alterations, indicating its potential as a marker for recurrence in this type of cancer. However, the biological relevance of this deletion remains unclear, necessitating further investigation (Bai2021Whole).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of FOXD4L6 mutations or alterations in its expression level is not well understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in cancer and other diseases.
