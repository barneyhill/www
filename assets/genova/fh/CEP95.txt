# CEP95

## Overview
CEP95, or centrosomal protein 95, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of the centrosome, a critical cellular organelle involved in microtubule organization and cell division. The protein encoded by CEP95 is categorized as a centrosomal protein, playing a pivotal role in maintaining centrosome integrity, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. This function is crucial for the proper progression of the cell cycle and the stability of the cytoskeleton, supporting processes such as ciliogenesis (Bell2024Acute; Zuo2022From). Additionally, CEP95 has been implicated in genetic variations affecting leukocyte telomere length, suggesting a potential role in cellular aging and longevity (Lee2014Genome). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Yan2021Analysis; Nasamran2021Differential).

## Function
CEP95, also known as centrosomal protein 95, is a crucial component in the organization and function of the centrosome, a key cellular structure involved in microtubule organization and cell division. In healthy human cells, CEP95 plays a significant role in maintaining centrosome integrity, which is essential for proper spindle formation during mitosis. This function is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and progression through the cell cycle (Bell2024Acute).

CEP95 is part of the centrosome pathway, which includes genes related to cell division, and is found in the centrosome and spindle pole. These structures are vital for forming mitotic spindles and separating duplicated chromosomes during cell division (Bell2024Acute). The proper functioning of CEP95 ensures the stability of the cytoskeleton and supports processes like ciliogenesis, which depends on organized microtubule structures (Zuo2022From).

Additionally, CEP95 has been associated with genetic variation in leukocyte telomere length, suggesting a potential role in cellular aging and longevity, although its specific function in this context is not fully detailed (Lee2014Genome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CEP95 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. The gene is associated with leukocyte telomere length, which is linked to cellular aging and the risk of late-onset diseases such as cardiovascular disease and dementia. Variations in CEP95 may contribute to these conditions by affecting telomere length, although specific diseases directly associated with CEP95 mutations are not detailed (Lee2014Genome).

CEP95 has also been identified in studies related to Lewy body dementias, including Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD). Differential methylation of the CEP95 gene was noted, suggesting its potential role in the epigenetic landscape of these neurodegenerative disorders (Nasamran2021Differential).

In the context of cancer, CEP95 has been identified as a hub gene in lung adenocarcinoma, a highly invasive form of lung cancer. Its expression level, along with other genes, was correlated with tumor stage, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Yan2021Analysis). These findings suggest that CEP95 may play a role in various diseases through its involvement in cellular processes such as telomere maintenance and cell cycle regulation.

## Interactions
CEP95 is involved in the regulation of replication origins through its interactions with RNA. The CEP95 locus contains an origin at the transcription start site (TSS) and two downstream secondary origins. The presence of CEP95 mRNA is crucial for the activation of these replication origins. Depletion of CEP95 mRNA using siRNA leads to a decrease in the activity of origins on and downstream of the CEP95 TSS, indicating a cis-regulatory mechanism. This effect is specific to the CEP95 locus and does not affect the upstream neighbor gene DDX5. The knockdown of CEP95 mRNA results in decreased chromatin enrichment of replication factors CDC45 and PCNA at local origins, suggesting that CEP95 mRNA plays a role in recruiting these factors to replication origins (Mas2023ORC1).

CEP95 is also associated with genetic loci linked to leukocyte telomere length. A contiguous haplotype in the CEP95 and SMURF2 genes on chromosome 17q23.2 has been significantly associated with variation in leukocyte telomere length, highlighting a potential role in cellular aging processes (Lee2014Genome). However, specific physical interactions of CEP95 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context.
