# OR2T35

## Overview
The OR2T35 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 35, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR2T35 is involved in the transduction of odorant signals, which is a key function in the olfactory system. As a member of the GPCR family, it is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of receptors that interact with G-proteins to initiate intracellular signaling cascades (Seo2023Whole). While primarily associated with olfactory functions, variations in OR2T35 have been studied in the context of various diseases, indicating potential broader biological roles (Heo2017Identification; Dicks2024Exome).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T35 gene has been implicated in various studies exploring its potential clinical significance. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), frameshift indels in OR2T35 were identified, suggesting a possible role in altering protein amino acid sequences that could contribute to disease pathology (Heo2017Identification). Additionally, OR2T35 has been associated with epithelial ovarian cancer, where it was identified as one of the genes with a strong association with non-high-grade serous ovarian cancer, indicating its potential involvement in cancer susceptibility (Dicks2024Exome).

In a study on medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), a frameshift indel in OR2T35 was noted, although the study primarily focused on the gene's impact on biological functions rather than direct disease association (Kim2022Identification). Furthermore, a frameshift variant in OR2T35 was found in a patient with a milder phenotype of xeroderma pigmentosum group C, suggesting that genetic interactions involving OR2T35 might influence disease phenotypes (Seo2023Whole).

Despite these findings, the specific clinical significance of OR2T35 mutations or expression alterations remains not well-documented, and further research is needed to clarify its role in human diseases.
