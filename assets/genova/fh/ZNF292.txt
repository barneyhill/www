# ZNF292

## Overview
ZNF292 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 292, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and gene regulation. This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating transcriptional activity within the nucleus, influencing key cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. ZNF292 is notably involved in the regulation of growth hormone expression, acting in concert with other transcription factors in the pituitary gland. Additionally, it is highly expressed in the developing human brain, particularly in the cerebellum, indicating a significant role in neurodevelopment. Mutations in the ZNF292 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical importance (Mirzaa2020De).

## Function
ZNF292 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. It contains zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding, allowing it to influence the expression of target genes. ZNF292 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional activity, impacting various cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Mirzaa2020De).

In healthy human cells, ZNF292 is involved in the regulation of growth hormone expression. It binds to DNA at the promoter of the growth hormone gene, where it cooperates with the transcription factor POU1F1 to activate transcription in somatotrophs, cells in the pituitary gland responsible for growth hormone production (Mirzaa2020De). This activity highlights its role in organismal development and homeostasis.

ZNF292 is also implicated in neurodevelopment, although its specific functions in this context are not fully understood. It is highly expressed in the developing human brain, particularly in the cerebellum during the prenatal period, suggesting a role in brain development (Mirzaa2020De). Despite its known functions, the complete range of ZNF292's activities in healthy human cells remains largely unexplored.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF292 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Mirzaa2020De; Guo2018Inherited). These disorders often present with additional clinical features such as speech delays, tone abnormalities, dysmorphic facial features, ocular abnormalities, and growth abnormalities (Mirzaa2020De). The majority of pathogenic variants identified in ZNF292 are de novo predicted loss-of-function variants, with a significant number located in exon 8, which encodes a large DNA binding domain of the ZNF292 protein (Mirzaa2020De).

The pathogenic mechanism of ZNF292 mutations may involve escape from nonsense-mediated decay or haploinsufficiency, although the exact process by which these variants disrupt brain development and behavior remains unclear (Mirzaa2020De). Some pathogenic ZNF292 genotypes may be incompletely penetrant, leading to mild or undiagnosed cases of ID/DD/ASD (Mirzaa2020De). The gene's high expression in the developing human brain, particularly the cerebellum, underscores its critical role in neurodevelopment (Mirzaa2020De). Despite its clinical significance, the specific functions of ZNF292 in neurodevelopmental disorders require further investigation (Mirzaa2020De).
