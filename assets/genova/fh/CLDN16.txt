# CLDN16

## Overview
The CLDN16 gene encodes the protein claudin-16, a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial cells, particularly within the renal system. Claudin-16 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the paracellular transport of magnesium and calcium ions in the kidney's thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. This protein forms a cation-selective channel in conjunction with claudin-19, facilitating the reabsorption of these essential ions and maintaining mineral balance. The function and localization of claudin-16 are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interaction with other proteins and its incorporation into tight junctions. Mutations in the CLDN16 gene can lead to familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a condition characterized by impaired ion reabsorption and progressive renal dysfunction (Ikari2014Tight; Hou2008Claudin16).

## Structure
Claudin-16 (CLDN16) is a protein encoded by the CLDN16 gene, playing a crucial role in forming tight junctions in epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney. The primary structure of CLDN16 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function. The secondary structure includes α-helical bundles, particularly in the transmembrane domains, and β-sheet structures in the extracellular loop (ECL) domains (Gong2015Biochemical; Krause2015Assembly).

The tertiary structure of CLDN16 involves the 3D folding necessary for its interaction with other claudins, such as claudin-19, to form a functional tight junction complex. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the permeability barrier in epithelial cells (Hou2008Claudin16; Gong2015Biochemical).

In terms of quaternary structure, CLDN16 forms stable heterodimers with claudin-19 through cis association of their transmembrane domains 3 and 4. This dimerization is vital for their role in tight junctions (Gong2015Biochemical).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are important for the localization and function of CLDN16. Phosphorylation by PKA is necessary for its proper localization at tight junctions, while dephosphorylation can lead to its translocation to the lysosome (Ikari2014Tight).

## Function
The CLDN16 gene encodes the protein claudin-16, which is integral to the formation of tight junctions in the epithelial cells of the kidney, specifically in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Claudin-16 plays a crucial role in the paracellular reabsorption of magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+) ions. It forms a non-selective paracellular cation channel that is essential for maintaining the lumen-positive transepithelial potential necessary for the reabsorption of these ions (Hou2007Transgenic; Hou2008Claudin16).

In healthy cells, claudin-16 interacts with claudin-19 to form a cation-selective tight junction complex, enhancing the selectivity and permeability of the junctions for divalent cations (Hou2008Claudin16). This interaction is critical for the proper function of the renal system, as it ensures the efficient reabsorption of Mg2+ and Ca2+, which is vital for maintaining mineral balance and preventing conditions such as familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) (Hou2008Claudin16).

The localization and function of claudin-16 are regulated by its phosphorylation state, which affects its trafficking to the tight junctions. Proper localization is necessary for its role in Mg2+ homeostasis (Ikari2014Tight; Marunaka2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLDN16 gene are associated with familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a rare autosomal recessive renal tubular disorder. This condition is characterized by excessive renal excretion of magnesium and calcium, leading to nephrocalcinosis and progressive chronic renal failure (ClaverieMartin2015Familial; Kausalya2006Diseaseassociated; García‐Castaño2020Novel). Over 50 pathogenic mutations in CLDN16 have been identified, including missense, nonsense, splice site mutations, and small deletions (ClaverieMartin2015Familial). These mutations can disrupt the paracellular reabsorption of magnesium and calcium in the renal tubule, affecting the protein's function and leading to symptoms such as hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis (Hanssen2014Two; PerdomoRamirez2019Exonic).

Some mutations result in the claudin-16 protein being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex, while others lead to its degradation in lysosomes or impair its ability to facilitate paracellular magnesium transport (Kausalya2006Diseaseassociated). The severity of FHHNC can vary, with some mutations causing a faster decline in renal function (ClaverieMartin2015Familial). Pharmacological chaperones have been suggested as potential therapeutic interventions to rescue the surface expression of some retained claudin-16 mutants (Kausalya2006Diseaseassociated).

## Interactions
Claudin-16 (CLDN16) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in tight junction formation and function. One significant interaction is with PDZRN3, a protein containing RING-finger and PDZ-domains. This interaction is mediated through the PDZ-binding motif at the carboxyl terminus of CLDN16. The association between CLDN16 and PDZRN3 is enhanced by the inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) with H-89, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation (Marunaka2017The).

CLDN16 also interacts with claudin-19 (CLDN19) to form a cation-selective tight junction complex in the kidney's thick ascending limb. This complex is essential for the reabsorption of magnesium and calcium ions. CLDN16 functions as a sodium channel, while CLDN19 acts as a chloride blocker, enhancing the cation selectivity of tight junctions. Mutations in either CLDN16 or CLDN19 that disrupt their interaction can lead to familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) (Hou2008Claudin16).

Additionally, CLDN16 is phosphorylated by PKA, which is crucial for its localization to tight junctions. This phosphorylation enhances its association with ZO-1, a scaffolding protein that helps localize claudins to tight junctions, thereby increasing transepithelial electrical resistance and magnesium ion transport (Ikari2007Claudin‐16).
