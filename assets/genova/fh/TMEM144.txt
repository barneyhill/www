# TMEM144

## Overview
TMEM144 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 144, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span cellular membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The specific functions of transmembrane protein 144 are not fully elucidated, but it is believed to be involved in cellular communication and possibly in the regulation of certain pathways. Research into TMEM144 and its encoded protein continues to uncover its potential implications in health and disease, contributing to a broader understanding of cellular dynamics and molecular biology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
