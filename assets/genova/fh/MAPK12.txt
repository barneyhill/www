# MAPK12

## Overview
MAPK12 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 12, also known as p38γ, which is a member of the MAP kinase family. This protein functions as a serine/threonine kinase and plays a pivotal role in various cellular signaling pathways. It is involved in regulating the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G0 phase to the G1 phase, and is crucial for cellular responses to stress stimuli. MAPK12 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and helps cells adapt to environmental changes. It is part of the broader MAPK signaling cascade, which is essential for transmitting extracellular signals to the cellular machinery, thereby affecting processes such as cytokine production, exocytosis, migration, invasion, and differentiation (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Structure
The MAPK12 protein, also known as p38 gamma, is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which includes a kinase domain crucial for its enzymatic activity (Iqbal2021Design). The secondary structure of MAPK12 is characterized by the presence of α-helices and β-sheets, which are common structural motifs in proteins of this family (Yao2022Genome-wide). 

The tertiary structure of MAPK12 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. This structure is essential for its function and is shared among other MAPK proteins, indicating a conserved role (Yao2022Genome-wide). 

MAPK12 may also form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, which is typical for proteins involved in signaling pathways (Iqbal2021Design). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the activity of MAPK12, as they do for other MAPK family members (Iqbal2021Design). 

The protein may have splice variant isoforms, which could alter its function or localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
MAPK12, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase 12, is a member of the MAP kinase family involved in various cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, MAPK12 plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G0 phase to the G1 phase, which is essential for cell proliferation and response to stress stimuli (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex). It is also involved in maintaining cytoskeleton integrity and myoblast differentiation, which are important for muscle development and function (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex).

MAPK12 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and helps cells adapt to environmental changes. It is part of the broader MAPK signaling cascade, which is critical for transmitting extracellular signals to the cellular machinery, thereby affecting various cellular processes such as cytokine production, exocytosis, migration, invasion, and differentiation (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex). These functions are linked to maintaining normal physiological conditions and responding to stress, highlighting the importance of MAPK12 in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAPK12 gene, also known as p38γ, have been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer and thyroid carcinoma (THCA). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MAPK12 is associated with cancer stem cell expansion and metastasis, leading to decreased patient survival. The presence of G-quadruplex (G4) structures at the MAPK12 promoter is involved in regulating its transcription, and targeting these structures with compounds like TGS24 has shown potential in reducing cancer stemness and metastasis (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex). 

In thyroid carcinoma, elevated MAPK12 mRNA levels are linked to poorer prognosis and shorter overall survival. MAPK12 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and influences the tumor immune microenvironment, affecting immune cell infiltration and sensitivity to immunotherapy (Wang2022Pan‑cancer). 

Beyond cancer, MAPK12 plays a role in ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis, with implications for ovulation and fertility. Prolactin regulates MAPK12 expression, and its dysregulation can lead to ovulation disorders and infertility (Yang2023Prolactin). These findings suggest that MAPK12 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and fertility-related conditions.

## Interactions
MAPK12, also known as p38γ, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It forms a tetrameric complex with HSP90, RAS, and c-JUN, which is crucial for the stability and expression of oncogenic RAS. This complex protects RAS from degradation, and its disruption by the compound TGS24 leads to reduced RAS signaling and decreased expression of stemness-related genes in breast cancer cells (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex). 

MAPK12 also interacts with transcription factors such as Nucleolin and Sp1 at the MAPK12 promoter. Nucleolin stabilizes G-quadruplex (G4) structures, while Sp1 promotes the formation of duplex DNA, influencing the transcriptional regulation of MAPK12. These interactions are significant for maintaining the transcriptional homeostasis of MAPK12, as demonstrated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of G4 motifs, which leads to undetectable levels of MAPK12 transcripts (Sengupta2024G-quadruplex).

In addition, MAPK12 is part of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, where it integrates signals from upstream kinases and regulates downstream gene transcription. This pathway is essential for various cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation (Wang2008Protein).
