# GRM5

## Overview
The GRM5 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system by modulating synaptic activity and cellular signaling. As a transmembrane receptor, mGluR5 is primarily located in the postsynaptic membrane of neurons and is involved in various physiological processes, including learning, memory, and neuroprotection. The receptor's activation by glutamate triggers intracellular signaling cascades that influence calcium ion release and protein kinase activation, impacting neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic). mGluR5 is also implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Xu2021Genetic; Gray2008Clozapine; Haas2015Metabotropic).

## Structure
The GRM5 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a G-protein coupled receptor involved in neurotransmission. The primary structure of mGluR5 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor, which includes a large extracellular domain, a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, and an intracellular C-terminal tail (Koehl2019Structural). The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices within the 7TM domain, which is typical of G-protein coupled receptors (Christopher2018StructureBased).

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these elements, allowing the receptor to form a functional conformation necessary for ligand binding and signal transduction. The quaternary structure of mGluR5 involves dimerization, which is essential for its activation. The receptor forms dimers through interactions in the extracellular domain, specifically the Venus Flytrap Domain (VFT) and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (Koehl2019Structural).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in mGluR5, influencing its function and regulation. The GRM5 gene also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different mRNA isoforms with distinct 5' untranslated regions, which may affect the receptor's expression and function in various tissues (Corti2003Gene).

## Function
The GRM5 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a significant role in modulating synaptic activity and cellular signaling in the central nervous system. mGluR5 is primarily located in the postsynaptic membrane of neurons and is highly expressed in regions such as the telencephalon, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic). Upon activation by glutamate, mGluR5 is coupled to Gαq/11 proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) and the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3). This signaling cascade results in the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic).

mGluR5 interacts with Homer and Shank proteins, which are crucial for postsynaptic signal transduction and the regulation of calcium and potassium channels (Blacker2017Metabotropic). These interactions facilitate the modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, contributing to learning and memory processes. mGluR5 also plays a role in neuroprotection by activating pathways such as Akt, which promotes cell survival (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic). In astrocytes, mGluR5 activation can influence glutamate release and modulate inflammatory responses, impacting neurotoxicity and apoptosis (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRM5 gene, which encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, abnormalities in mGluR5 signaling, particularly its interaction with the NMDA receptor, contribute to the disorder's pathophysiology. mGluR5 hypoactivity and altered interactions are associated with glutamatergic dysregulation in schizophrenia, and clozapine, an antipsychotic, may exert therapeutic effects by modulating this system (Wang2018mGluR5; Gray2008Clozapine).

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), mGluR5 has been implicated through de novo GRM5 mutations and reduced expression levels. Animal studies suggest that both excessive and inadequate mGluR5 signaling can lead to ASD-like symptoms, affecting social interaction and repetitive behaviors (Xu2021Genetic).

In Alzheimer's disease, mGluR5 interacts with cellular prion protein (PrP C) and is involved in amyloid-beta oligomer formation, contributing to synaptic impairment and cognitive deficits. Targeting the mGluR5 and PrP C interaction has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach (Hamilton2014Metabotropic; Haas2015Metabotropic).

Alterations in mGluR5 expression and function are also linked to other conditions, such as Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome, highlighting its broad clinical significance (Xu2021Genetic).

## Interactions
GRM5, or metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant in the context of neurological disorders. GRM5 interacts with the cellular prion protein (PrP^C), forming a complex that includes intracellular protein mediators such as Homer1b/c, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), and protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta (Pyk2). These interactions are crucial for signaling pathways that affect synaptic plasticity and are influenced by amyloid-beta oligomers, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Haas2015Metabotropic).

The interaction between GRM5 and Homer1b/c is modulated by amyloid-beta oligomers, which can cause dissociation of Homer1b/c from the PrP^C-GRM5 complex, potentially disrupting signaling pathways. Amyloid-beta oligomers also enhance the association between CamKII and GRM5, which may inhibit long-term potentiation by preventing CamKII dissociation (Haas2015Metabotropic).

In the context of schizophrenia, GRM5 has been shown to interact with Homer and synaptopodin, with the latter likely regulating GRM5 membrane localization. A novel interaction between GRM5 and Stx1a was also discovered, suggesting a potential involvement in the functional relationship between NMDAR and GRM5 (McClatchy2023In).
