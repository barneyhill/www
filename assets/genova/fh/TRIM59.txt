# TRIM59

## Overview
TRIM59, or tripartite motif containing 59, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. The TRIM59 protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of autophagy and ubiquitination processes within the cell. It is involved in various cellular mechanisms, including the modulation of autophagic pathways and the stabilization of proteins critical for cell survival and motility. TRIM59 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis through its interactions with key signaling pathways and proteins. Its role in cancer makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in malignancies such as lung and breast cancer (Ahsan2024Multipronged; Mandell2020The; Tan2018TRIM59).

## Structure


## Function
TRIM59 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It plays a significant role in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular degradation process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. TRIM59 modulates the transcription and ubiquitination of BECN1, a central regulator in autophagy, by influencing the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex through TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination and promoting K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1 (Ahsan2024Multipronged). This dual regulatory role highlights its importance in autophagy-related processes.

In the context of cancer, TRIM59 has been shown to inhibit autophagy in lung carcinoma cells by negatively regulating BECN1 mRNA expression, which is linked to its effect on NF-kB activation (Mandell2020The). TRIM59 also interacts with the autophagy machinery to prevent the ubiquitination and autophagic degradation of certain proteins, such as PDCD10, thereby promoting the survival and growth of cancer cells (Mandell2020The).

While the specific function of TRIM59 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in autophagy and ubiquitination suggests a critical role in cellular quality control and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
TRIM59 is implicated in various cancers, with its altered expression levels contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In lung cancer, TRIM59 acts as an oncoprotein, promoting proliferation and metastasis by inducing CDK6 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the ERK pathway. It also affects the cell cycle by regulating CDC25C and CDK1 expression, arresting it in the G2 phase (Zhan2021TRIM). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TRIM59 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and reduced survival, serving as an independent prognostic factor. It is associated with the activation of MTOR and EIF4E signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer progression (Hao2017TRIM59).

In breast cancer, TRIM59 is frequently upregulated, correlating with advanced clinical stages and reduced survival rates. It promotes tumor growth and motility by stabilizing PDCD10, affecting cell contractility and adhesion (Tan2018TRIM59). TRIM59 also plays a role in gefitinib resistance in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells by interacting with STAT3 signaling, contributing to drug resistance (Cui2019TRIM59). These findings highlight TRIM59's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
TRIM59 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It binds to PDCD10, preventing its autophagic degradation and stabilizing its protein levels, which is crucial for breast cancer cell motility by modulating the RhoA-ROCK1 signaling pathway (Tan2018TRIM59). The RING domain of TRIM59 is essential for its interaction with PDCD10 (Tan2018TRIM59).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, TRIM59 interacts with CDK5, which phosphorylates TRIM59 at serine 308, facilitating its nuclear translocation. This interaction is enhanced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation and is crucial for TRIM59's role in promoting tumorigenicity through the ubiquitination and degradation of macroH2A1, a histone variant (Sang2019CDK5dependent). TRIM59 also interacts with importin α5, which is necessary for its nuclear translocation (Sang2019CDK5dependent).

TRIM59 interacts with ECSIT, an adaptor protein involved in innate immune signaling pathways. This interaction negatively regulates NF-κB and IRF3/7-mediated signaling, suggesting a role for TRIM59 in modulating immune responses (Kondo2012TRIM59). These interactions highlight TRIM59's multifaceted role in cancer progression and immune regulation.
