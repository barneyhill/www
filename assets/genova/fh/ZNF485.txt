# ZNF485

## Overview
ZNF485 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 485, a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) family, which is known for its role in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and RNA, allowing it to participate in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. ZNF485 has been implicated in interactions with viral genomes, such as the Zika virus, and is involved in cancer-related pathways, where it is often upregulated in malignancies like lung and breast cancer. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that ZNF485 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Liao2023Dengue; Tan2022A; Machnik2019The).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF485 has been implicated in several types of cancer due to alterations in its expression levels. In bladder cancer, ZNF485 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced cell mobility and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor growth and metastasis. Downregulation of ZNF485 in bladder cancer cell lines has been shown to decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2022A).

In breast cancer, high expression of ZNF485 is linked to poorer overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 2.3, indicating a more than twofold increase in the risk of death for patients with elevated ZNF485 levels. This suggests that ZNF485 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer (Machnik2019The). ZNF485 is also upregulated in lung cancer, particularly in the primitive subtype of lung squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Machnik2019The).

Overall, the altered expression of ZNF485 in various cancers highlights its potential clinical significance as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Machnik2019The).

## Interactions
ZNF485, a member of the KRAB-ZNF family, is involved in specific interactions with viral genomes and is implicated in cancer-related pathways. In the context of viral interactions, ZNF485 has been identified to specifically interact with the Zika virus (ZIKV) genome. This interaction is highly specific, with only one region of the ZNF485 RNA binding to the viral genome, suggesting a precise and targeted interaction influenced by the structural properties of the RNA molecules involved (Liao2023Dengue).

In cancer biology, ZNF485 is part of a group of KRAB-ZNFs that are commonly upregulated in various cancer types, including lung and breast cancer. These proteins typically interact with TRIM28, a co-factor protein, which acts as a scaffold for transcriptional repression complexes. Although specific interactions of ZNF485 with TRIM28 or other proteins are not detailed, the general role of KRAB-ZNFs in forming complexes with TRIM28 suggests that ZNF485 may participate in similar interactions, contributing to chromatin modifications and transcriptional repression (Machnik2019The). The upregulation of ZNF485 in cancer tissues and its association with poor prognosis further indicate its potential involvement in oncogenic pathways (Machnik2019The).
