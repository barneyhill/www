# SIAH2

## Overview
SIAH2 is a gene that encodes the siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, a member of the Seven in Absentia Homologs (SIAHs) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is crucial for regulating protein stability within cells. SIAH2 is particularly significant in the context of hypoxia, where it modulates the stability of prolyl hydroxylases, thereby influencing the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and facilitating cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions (Nakayama2004Siah2). Beyond its role in oxygen homeostasis, SIAH2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, polarity, and stress response pathways, by targeting specific proteins for degradation (Habelhah2002Stressinduced; Kim2013Siah2). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (Xu2021Regulation; Moreno2015The).

## Structure
The SIAH2 protein is a member of the SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a RING finger domain essential for its ligase activity and a substrate binding domain (SBD) that facilitates interaction with target proteins. The crystal structure of SIAH2 reveals a close resemblance to SIAH1, featuring a C-terminal TNF-receptor associated factor (TRAF)-like SBD and two zinc fingers (ZnFs) (Zhang2017The). The SBD consists of two anti-parallel β-sheets, with ZnF2 tightly packed against it, while ZnF1 is more independent (Zhang2017The). The protein dimerizes through the SBD, and the ZnF domains coordinate zinc ions, playing a role in protein-protein interactions (Zhang2017The).

SIAH2 is involved in the regulation of hypoxia-induced pathways, significant in tumor development, and its activity can be influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Anupriya2011Homology). The protein's stability is slightly lower than that of SIAH1, potentially due to differences in specific residues, such as L250, which forms a hydrophobic core with neighboring residues (Zhang2017The). Mutations in these residues can affect protein stability, and the hydrophobic pocket may play a role in compound binding (Zhang2017The).

## Function
The SIAH2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the regulation of protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In healthy human cells, SIAH2 is involved in maintaining oxygen homeostasis by regulating the stability of prolyl hydroxylases, particularly PHD1 and PHD3, which are crucial for the hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α). Under hypoxic conditions, SIAH2 targets PHD3 for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to increased stability and expression of HIF1α, which is essential for cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels (Nakayama2004Siah2).

SIAH2 also regulates cell adhesion and polarity by controlling the stability of the tumor suppressor protein ASPP2. This regulation affects epithelial cell polarity and tight junction integrity, particularly under hypoxic conditions, by modulating the availability of ASPP2 through ubiquitination and degradation (Kim2013Siah2).

Additionally, SIAH2 is involved in stress response pathways by mediating the degradation of TRAF2, a key regulator in cellular responses to stress and cytokines. This process is crucial for modulating TRAF2-dependent signaling pathways, impacting apoptosis and stress kinase regulation (Habelhah2002Stressinduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SIAH2 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. SIAH2 is overexpressed in several malignancies, including lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers, where it often acts as an oncogene. In lung cancer, increased SIAH2 expression is associated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Xu2021Regulation; Moreno2015The). In breast cancer, SIAH2 is linked to aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor treatment outcomes, especially in ER-positive and basal-like subtypes (Chan2011The; Knauer2015The).

SIAH2 also plays a role in the hypoxic response, promoting tumorigenesis by stabilizing HIF-1α, which enhances angiogenesis and tumor growth (Qi2013Regulators; Nakayama2009The). In ovarian cancer, high SIAH2 expression correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival, making it a potential prognostic marker (Gao2016Overexpression). The gene's involvement in the degradation of tumor suppressors and regulation of signaling pathways like Ras/ERK further underscores its role in cancer progression (Xu2021Regulation; Nakayama2009The). These findings suggest that targeting SIAH2 could be a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
SIAH2, a member of the Seven in Absentia Homologs (SIAHs) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate key cellular processes. SIAH2 interacts with prolyl hydroxylases, particularly PHD3, targeting them for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) levels under hypoxic conditions, as the degradation of PHD3 by SIAH2 leads to increased HIF-1α expression (Nakayama2004Siah2).

SIAH2 also interacts with the deubiquitinase USP19 through a PxxxVxP consensus motif, which is important for regulating the activity of USP19 and, consequently, the hypoxia pathway (Zhang2017The). The interaction between SIAH2 and USP19 is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its significance in cellular responses to hypoxia (Zhang2017The).

In addition, SIAH2 is involved in the degradation of Sprouty2, a negative regulator of Ras signaling, thereby modulating the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in cancer progression, as it affects cell proliferation and metastasis (Qi2013Regulators). SIAH2's role in these interactions highlights its importance in cellular stress responses and cancer-related pathways.
