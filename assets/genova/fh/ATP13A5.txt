# ATP13A5

## Overview
ATP13A5 is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase 13A5, which is a member of the P-type ATPase family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to transport ions across cellular membranes using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. ATPase 13A5 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining ion homeostasis within cells. The specific substrates and physiological roles of ATPase 13A5 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in the transport of heavy metal ions, contributing to cellular detoxification processes. Dysregulation of ATP13A5 has been implicated in various neurological disorders, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
