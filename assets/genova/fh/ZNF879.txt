# ZNF879

## Overview
ZNF879 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 879, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. Although the specific biological functions of zinc finger protein 879 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in developmental pathways, particularly those related to cardiac and renal development. Variations in ZNF879 have been associated with congenital conditions such as structural kidney and urinary tract malformations and congenital heart diseases, including Fallot tetralogy, although further research is needed to confirm these associations and understand the gene's precise role in these pathologies (Jinga2018Essential; Fahed2013Genetics; Chan2024Wholegenome).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF879 has been implicated in several congenital conditions, although its clinical significance requires further validation. In the context of structural kidney and urinary tract malformations, ZNF879 was identified as one of four genes with an increased burden of likely deleterious variations. However, the association did not reach stringent Bonferroni-adjusted exome-wide significance, and replication in an independent cohort is necessary to confirm its role in these malformations (Chan2024Wholegenome).

ZNF879 has also been associated with congenital heart diseases (CHD), specifically in the context of Fallot tetralogy, a type of CHD. The gene is mentioned alongside other genes involved in cardiac development, suggesting that mutations in ZNF879 may contribute to the phenotypic variations observed in CHD (Jinga2018Essential; Fahed2013Genetics).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of ZNF879 mutations remains unclear, as the observed genetic variations have not been definitively linked to specific diseases. The complexity of gene interactions and the need for further research are emphasized to better understand the potential role of ZNF879 in these conditions (Jinga2018Essential; Chan2024Wholegenome).
