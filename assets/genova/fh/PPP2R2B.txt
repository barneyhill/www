# PPP2R2B

## Overview
The PPP2R2B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit Bbeta, a critical component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme complex. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. The regulatory subunit Bbeta, encoded by PPP2R2B, modulates the activity and specificity of PP2A, particularly in neuronal cells, where it is essential for maintaining normal brain function and development (Lin2010The; Chen2008PPP2R2B). The gene's expression is influenced by CAG repeat sequences, which can affect its regulatory functions and have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia and Alzheimer's disease (Ramanan2020Variants; A.2012Spinocerebellar). Additionally, PPP2R2B has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor, with its expression levels serving as prognostic markers in various cancers, including breast and bladder cancer (Li2021PPP2R2B; Shen2024Comprehensive).

## Function
The PPP2R2B gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a critical serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP2R2B modulates PP2A activity, influencing cell cycle regulation, tau dephosphorylation, and apoptosis. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal neuronal function, as PP2A is widely expressed in neurons throughout the brain (Lin2010The; Chen2008PPP2R2B).

PPP2R2B is involved in the dephosphorylation of several key proteins, including vimentin, histone-1, and tau, which are associated with the cytoskeleton and chromatin structure. This activity is crucial for cellular functions such as maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and regulating chromatin dynamics (Lin2010The). The gene's expression is regulated by CAG repeat sequences, which act as cis elements to modulate its expression levels. Variations in these repeats can impact the interaction of transcription factors like CREB1, SP1, and TFAP4 with the PPP2R2B promoter, thereby influencing its expression and, consequently, PP2A activity (Lin2010The).

In the context of brain development, PPP2R2B expression is crucial for processes like neuritogenesis and synaptic transmission, which are vital for cognitive functions and memory (Verbinnen2021Protein). The protein's activity in the brain underscores its importance in maintaining neuronal health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP2R2B gene are associated with several diseases. Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the PPP2R2B gene. This expansion is associated with increased promoter activity, potentially leading to dysregulation of gene expression and the onset of SCA12, which is characterized by tremors and ataxia (A.2012Spinocerebellar).

In cancer, PPP2R2B acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, where a specific SNP, rs319217, is associated with altered risk and recurrence. The A variant of this SNP is linked to better outcomes and response to chemotherapy (Vazquez2010A). In triple-negative breast cancer, decreased expression of PPP2R2B is associated with immune evasion and poor clinical outcomes (Li2021PPP2R2B). In bladder cancer, low expression of PPP2R2B correlates with shorter overall survival, suggesting its role as an anti-oncogene (Shen2024Comprehensive).

Additionally, genetic variants in PPP2R2B have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, with certain alleles associated with increased tau deposition, a hallmark of the disease (Ramanan2020Variants).

## Interactions
The PPP2R2B gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is involved in forming multiprotein complexes. PPP2R2B interacts with the catalytic and scaffolding subunits of PP2A to form a holoenzyme complex, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes (Glatter2009An). The regulatory B subunit PPP2R2B is associated with proteins such as SKA1 and SKA2, which are involved in kinetochore function during mitosis, suggesting its role in spindle checkpoint silencing (Glatter2009An).

In the context of breast cancer, PPP2R2B has been identified as a prognostic biomarker, with its expression linked to immune cell infiltration. It is positively associated with CD4 Th1 cells, M1 macrophages, and CD8 T cells, while negatively associated with M2 macrophages, indicating its involvement in immune response modulation (Li2021PPP2R2B). The gene's expression is also linked to immune checkpoint members and antigen presentation family genes, suggesting its role in enhancing anti-tumor immune responses (Li2021PPP2R2B).

In neurodegenerative contexts, PPP2R2B interacts with proteins like tau, influencing microtubule stability. Variations in the CAG repeat length within the PPP2R2B gene can affect its expression, potentially impacting diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia and Alzheimer's disease (Lin2010The).
