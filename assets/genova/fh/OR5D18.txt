# OR5D18

## Overview
OR5D18 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily D member 18, which is a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This receptor is primarily expressed in human enterochromaffin cells within the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a critical role in detecting specific odorant molecules. Upon activation by ligands such as eugenol and thymol, the receptor facilitates an increase in intracellular calcium levels, leading to the release of serotonin. This process is essential for regulating gut motility, nutrient absorption, and metabolic homeostasis, as it may also influence the secretion of hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin (Beito2024Role; Tong2021Ectopic). The involvement of OR5D18 in these physiological processes underscores its potential significance in maintaining energy balance and its possible implications for therapeutic strategies targeting serotonin-related disorders (Oh1970SystemWide).

## Function
OR5D18 is an olfactory receptor expressed in human enterochromaffin (EC) cells within the gastrointestinal tract. This receptor is involved in the detection of specific odorant ligands, such as eugenol and thymol, which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and the subsequent release of serotonin through exocytosis. The release of serotonin plays a crucial role in regulating gut motility and nutrient absorption, and it may also stimulate the release of hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and insulin, contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Beito2024Role; Tong2021Ectopic).

The activation of OR5D18 in EC cells suggests its involvement in sensing dietary and microbial molecules, which can influence hormone release and gut function. This receptor's role in serotonin release is significant for maintaining energy homeostasis and may have implications for therapeutic interventions in disorders related to serotonin imbalance (Tong2021Ectopic; Oh1970SystemWide). While the specific downstream signaling pathways for OR5D18 remain unclear, its function in healthy human cells highlights its potential impact on metabolic regulation and gut physiology (Tong2021Ectopic).
