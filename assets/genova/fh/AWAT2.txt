# AWAT2

## Overview
The AWAT2 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 2, which is a critical component of lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is primarily involved in the synthesis of wax esters by catalyzing the esterification of long-chain fatty alcohols with acyl-CoA. The protein encoded by AWAT2 is essential for various biological processes, including the regeneration of visual pigments in cone photoreceptors and the stabilization of the tear film through its activity in the meibomian glands. The enzyme's function is crucial for maintaining normal visual and ocular surface health, and its dysregulation has been implicated in conditions such as evaporative dry eye disease and epidermolysis bullosa simplex (Widjaja‐Adhi2020Deficiency; Arne2017Allosteric; Bchetnia2011Expression).

## Function
The AWAT2 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 2, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the formation of wax esters. This enzyme is involved in the esterification of long-chain fatty alcohols with acyl-CoA, contributing to the synthesis of waxes that are essential for various biological functions (Widjaja‐Adhi2020Deficiency). In the eye, AWAT2 is particularly important for the esterification of 11-cis-retinol, a process vital for the regeneration of visual pigments in cone photoreceptors. This activity supports the non-canonical visual cycle, which is essential for rapid visual pigment regeneration (Arne2017Allosteric).

AWAT2 is also active in the meibomian glands, where it is responsible for the synthesis of wax esters in meibum, a lipid that stabilizes the tear film and prevents tear evaporation. The absence of AWAT2 leads to a deficiency in wax esters, resulting in increased viscosity of meibum and contributing to evaporative dry eye disease (Widjaja‐Adhi2020Deficiency). The enzyme's activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it facilitates the transfer of acyl moieties onto various substrates, demonstrating broad substrate specificity (Widjaja‐Adhi2020Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the AWAT2 gene, which encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 2, is primarily associated with its altered expression in certain skin disorders. In the context of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a study identified that AWAT2 expression is significantly higher in EBS patients compared to controls. This suggests a potential involvement of AWAT2 in the pathogenesis of EBS, although a direct link to the disease's expression had not been documented prior to this study (Bchetnia2011Expression). The study highlights the possibility that disruptions in fatty acid metabolism, in which AWAT2 is involved, may contribute to the clinical manifestations of EBS (Bchetnia2011Expression).

In another study focusing on marginal MCC deficiency, AWAT2 expression was validated using qPCR, although the study did not specifically address the clinical significance of AWAT2 gene mutations or expression alterations (L2016Biochemical). Despite these findings, the detailed pathogenic mechanisms by which AWAT2 expression affects cell metabolism and contributes to disease remain unclear, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in these processes (Bchetnia2011Expression).
