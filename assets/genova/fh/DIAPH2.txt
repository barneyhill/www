# DIAPH2

## Overview
DIAPH2 is a gene that encodes the protein diaphanous-related formin 2, which is a member of the formin family of proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division (Chiereghin2022Role; LabatdeHoz2021Formins). As a cytoplasmic protein, diaphanous-related formin 2 is involved in actin nucleation and elongation, processes essential for the formation and stabilization of actin filaments, and is regulated by Rho-family GTPases (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). Beyond its structural roles, DIAPH2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell division, migration, and adhesion, and is essential for proper chromosome alignment during mitosis (Cichocka2024DIAPH2; LabatdeHoz2021Formins). The gene's involvement in these fundamental biological processes underscores its importance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in various diseases.

## Function
DIAPH2, or diaphanous-related formin 2, is a protein that plays a critical role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, movement, and division. It is involved in actin nucleation and elongation, processes that are crucial for the formation and stabilization of actin filaments (Chiereghin2022Role; LabatdeHoz2021Formins). DIAPH2 is active in the cytoplasm and is necessary for stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions, contributing to microtubule stabilization and proper chromosome alignment during mitosis (Chiereghin2022Role; LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

In healthy human cells, DIAPH2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, migration, and adhesion, by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics (Cichocka2024DIAPH2). It is also implicated in ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance, although the specific mechanisms are not fully detailed (Chiereghin2022Role). The protein's activity is regulated by Rho-family GTPases, which modulate its transition between inactive and active states, ensuring precise control over actin polymerization (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). Through these functions, DIAPH2 contributes to the development and maintenance of various tissues, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DIAPH2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. DIAPH2 is implicated in premature ovarian failure, also known as primary ovarian insufficiency, which can lead to premature menopause. This condition is often associated with translocations of the X chromosome region that includes DIAPH2, and some patients exhibit ovarian dysgenesis, indicating its role in gonadal development (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

In the context of hearing, a missense variant in DIAPH2 has been associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in an Italian family. This variant segregates with the hearing loss phenotype, suggesting a potential role for DIAPH2 in auditory function, although further studies are needed to confirm its contribution (Chiereghin2023Indepth).

DIAPH2 polymorphisms have also been linked to an increased risk of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Specific polymorphisms, such as rs12851931, are associated with tumor stage and smoking status, indicating a potential role in cancer progression (Cichocka2024DIAPH2).

Additionally, DIAPH2 variants have been associated with age-related macular degeneration, suggesting a link to retinal health (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various diseases, emphasizing its clinical significance.

## Interactions
DIAPH2, a member of the diaphanous-related formin subfamily, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. DIAPH2 interacts with the HIV-1 capsid (CA) and microtubules (MTs), facilitating the transition of HIV-1 cores from actin filaments to MTs, which is essential for the virus's centripetal trafficking. This interaction is independent of the actin-regulatory functions of mDia formins, suggesting a unique role in HIV-1 uncoating and MT stabilization (Innocenti2023Investigating).

In the context of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), DIAPH2 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving 50 experimentally determined proteins. The top DIAPH2-correlated genes in PAAD include HNRNRF, ACBD3, MCMBP, KRAS, and NHEJ1. These interactions are associated with biological processes such as actin filament organization and regulation of cell shape, as well as cellular components like the cell cortex and focal junction (Zhang2022Diaphanousrelated).

DIAPH2 is also implicated in invadopodia formation and tumor cell invasion, which are critical for cancer metastasis. Its role in these processes highlights its involvement in actin nucleation and polymerization, as well as microtubule stability (Zhang2022Diaphanousrelated).
