# ELFN1

## Overview
The ELFN1 gene encodes the extracellular leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 protein, which is a type I transmembrane protein involved in synaptic adhesion and modulation. This protein is characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, which are essential for its interaction with group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), such as mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8 (Tomioka2014Elfn1; Dunn2018Synaptic). ELFN1 plays a critical role in synaptic function by acting as a selective allosteric modulator of these receptors, influencing synaptic signaling and plasticity (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). It is particularly expressed in the brain's hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it is abundant in somatostatin-expressing interneurons, and is also crucial for synapse formation in the retina (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). Mutations in the ELFN1 gene have been associated with neurological disorders such as epilepsy, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining neural circuit balance (Dursun2021Biallelic; Tomioka2014Elfn1).

## Structure
The ELFN1 protein is characterized by the presence of extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, which are crucial for its function in synaptic adhesion and modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (Tomioka2014Elfn1; Dunn2018Synaptic). The LRR domain typically forms a horseshoe-like structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions, while the FN3 domain is a beta-sandwich structure that is essential for binding to mGluRs (Dunn2018Synaptic). The FN3 domain's deletion abolishes the interaction with mGluRs, highlighting its importance (Dunn2018Synaptic).

ELFN1 is a type I transmembrane protein, indicating that it spans the cell membrane with an extracellular domain that interacts with other proteins and a cytoplasmic tail that may be involved in intracellular signaling (Tomioka2014Elfn1). The protein's signal peptide is crucial for its proper localization and function, as mutations in this region can disrupt its ability to bind mGluRs (Dursun2021Biallelic).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. Alternative splicing could result in different isoforms, but these are not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
The ELFN1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function by interacting with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particularly group III mGluRs such as mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8. ELFN1 acts as a selective allosteric modulator of these receptors, influencing their pharmacological properties and synaptic signaling (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic; Dunn2018Synaptic). In the brain, ELFN1 is expressed in various regions, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it is particularly abundant in somatostatin-expressing interneurons (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic).

ELFN1 is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity by recruiting presynaptic mGluR7 to specific synapses, such as those involving somatostatin interneurons in the hippocampus. This recruitment is essential for modulating neurotransmitter release probability and maintaining synaptic balance (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic; Tomioka2014Elfn1). In the retina, ELFN1 is necessary for the formation of synapses between rod photoreceptors and rod ON-bipolar cells, interacting with mGluR6 to ensure proper visual function (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic).

The ELFN1 protein's interaction with mGluRs is mediated by specific structural elements, including leucine-rich repeats and a fibronectin type III domain, which are critical for its binding and modulatory functions (Dunn2018Synaptic). Through these interactions, ELFN1 plays a significant role in maintaining healthy neural circuits and proper synaptic function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELFN1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A study identified a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in ELFN1 associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, autistic features, and joint laxity in three siblings from a consanguineous family (Dursun2021Biallelic). This mutation led to a significant reduction in ELFN1 mRNA expression, suggesting a loss of function (Dursun2021Biallelic).

In mice, the loss of Elfn1 results in hyperactivity and sensory-triggered epileptic seizures, indicating its role in maintaining excitatory and inhibitory balance in neural circuits (Tomioka2014Elfn1). Missense mutations in ELFN1 have been found in patients with epilepsy and ADHD, with these mutations affecting the recruitment of mGluR7, a presynaptic receptor, to synaptic sites (Tomioka2014Elfn1). These findings suggest that the dysfunction of the ELFN1-mGluR7 complex may be a common mechanism underlying these disorders (Tomioka2014Elfn1).

The ELFN1 gene is also associated with hyperactivity and decreased vertical activity in mice, supporting its potential therapeutic role in treating ADHD and epilepsy (Oprea2019Exploring).

## Interactions
The ELFN1 protein is involved in trans-synaptic interactions with group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), specifically mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8. ELFN1 acts as a selective allosteric modulator of these receptors, influencing their signaling and pharmacology. It physically anchors mGluR6 and mGluR7 across retinal and hippocampal synapses, respectively (Dunn2018Synaptic). The interaction between ELFN1 and mGluR7 is crucial for synaptic function, as demonstrated by phenotypic data from Elfn1 knockout mice, which show similarities to mGluR7 knockout mice, including seizure-prone phenotypes (Tomioka2014Elfn1).

ELFN1 recruits presynaptic mGluR7 to somatostatin-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and the proper functioning of neural circuits (Tomioka2014Elfn1). This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of ELFN1, which is necessary for mGluR7 recruitment (Tomioka2014Elfn1). ELFN1 also interacts with mGluR6 in the retina, which is essential for synapse formation between rod photoreceptor cells and rod-bipolar cells (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). The ELFN1 ectodomain, containing leucine-rich repeats and a fibronectin type III domain, is critical for these interactions (Dunn2018Synaptic).
