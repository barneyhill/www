# FCGR3B

## Overview
The FCGR3B gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIb (FcγRIIIB), a low-affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. This receptor is categorized as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and is predominantly expressed on the surface of neutrophils. Unlike other Fc gamma receptors that possess transmembrane domains, FcγRIIIB is anchored to the cell membrane via a GPI linkage, which influences its functional interactions and signaling capabilities (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). The receptor plays a significant role in immune regulation by mediating the binding and clearance of immune complexes, thus contributing to processes such as phagocytosis and the respiratory burst. The expression and function of FcγRIIIB are modulated by genetic variations, including copy number variations, which have been implicated in susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Nagelkerke2019Genetic; Willcocks2008Copy). Despite its critical role in immune responses, the absence of FCGR3B does not necessarily result in adverse health effects, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms within the immune system (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

## Structure
The FCGR3B gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIb, a low-affinity receptor for the Fc region of IgG antibodies. This protein is primarily expressed on neutrophils and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The molecular structure of Fc gamma receptor IIIb includes immunoglobulin-like domains, which are characteristic of its role in binding antibodies. These domains contribute to the receptor's ability to interact with the Fc region of IgG molecules, facilitating various immune responses.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for the function and stability of the Fc gamma receptor IIIb. Glycosylation can affect the receptor's binding affinity and its interactions with other molecules on the cell surface. The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional properties or expression patterns. These splice variants can influence the receptor's role in immune processes and its distribution on neutrophils.

The structural features of Fc gamma receptor IIIb, including its immunoglobulin-like domains and post-translational modifications, are crucial for its function in the immune system, particularly in mediating interactions between neutrophils and IgG antibodies.

## Function
The FCGR3B gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIb (FcγRIIIB), a protein primarily expressed on the surface of neutrophils. This receptor is involved in the binding and internalization of immune complexes, playing a crucial role in immune regulation and homeostasis. FcγRIIIB is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, which distinguishes it from other Fcγ receptors that have transmembrane domains (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). It is involved in the exocytosis of neutrophil granule proteins and calcium influx, and it may cooperate with FcγRIIA to induce these responses (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

Despite its inability to independently signal due to the lack of a transmembrane domain, FcγRIIIB can influence neutrophil functions such as phagocytosis and the respiratory burst, which are critical for the clearance of IgG-opsonized particles (de1995Neutrophil). It also plays a role in the initial capture and recruitment of neutrophils to sites of immune complex deposition under physiological flow conditions, a process important for immune complex-mediated inflammation (Coxon2001FcγRIII).

The receptor's expression level is influenced by the copy number variation of the FCGR3B gene, which affects its function in immune complex handling and neutrophil adhesion (Willcocks2008Copy). Despite its role in immune responses, individuals with a complete deletion of FCGR3B are generally healthy, indicating that other mechanisms can compensate for its absence (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FCGR3B gene, which encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIIb, are associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Copy number variations (CNVs) in FCGR3B, such as deletions and duplications, have been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and systemic sclerosis. Specifically, low copy numbers of FCGR3B are associated with increased susceptibility to these conditions (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). In SLE, FCGR3B deletions are linked to a higher frequency of lupus nephritis (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

FCGR3B CNVs also play a role in sarcoidosis, with low copy numbers contributing to disease susceptibility (Wu2016FCGR3A). In autoimmune blistering diseases like bullous pemphigoid, increased FCGR3B copy numbers are associated with a decreased risk, suggesting a protective role (Recke2015Allelic).

The gene's variations affect neutrophil function, influencing immune complex clearance and reactive oxygen species production, which are critical in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Recke2015Allelic; Nagelkerke2019Genetic). Despite these associations, individuals with complete FCGR3B deletions can remain healthy, indicating that other compensatory mechanisms may exist (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

## Interactions
FCGR3B, also known as CD16b, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily in the context of immune responses. CD16b is predominantly expressed on neutrophils and is known to interact with IgG antibodies, facilitating processes such as phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Treffers2019FcγRIIIb). It acts as a decoy receptor during ADCC, competing with other Fcγ receptors like FcγRIIa for binding to the Fc portion of antibodies, which can limit the effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies (Treffers2019FcγRIIIb).

CD16b is also associated with lipid rafts on the neutrophil surface, where it co-immunoprecipitates with proteins such as proteinase 3 (PR3), cytochrome b558, and NADPH oxidase, suggesting potential interactions in these regions (Patel2019Multiple). These interactions may play a role in signaling pathways that influence neutrophil functions, such as respiratory bursts and cytokine production.

The receptor is linked to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which may influence its binding affinity and interactions with other proteins, such as complement receptor 3 and FcγRIIa (Willcocks2008Copy). These interactions highlight the complex role of FCGR3B in modulating immune responses.
