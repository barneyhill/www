# SPACA9

## Overview
SPACA9, or sperm acrosome associated 9, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural organization and function of cilia and sperm axonemes. The SPACA9 protein is categorized as a microtubule inner protein (MIP) and plays a critical role in stabilizing microtubule structures within the central apparatus of sperm axonemes. It is characterized by its distinct periodic patterns that enhance microtubule stability, which is essential for sperm motility and function (Zhu2024Incell). In addition to its role in sperm cells, SPACA9 is also implicated in ciliary function in human airway epithelial cells, where it localizes along the axoneme (Blackburn2017Quantitative). The protein's interactions with tubulin and other proteins within the sperm flagellum underscore its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of these cellular components (Leung2022Unraveling). While SPACA9 has been noted for its potential role as a tumor suppressor, its specific functions in healthy human cells are still under investigation (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

## Structure


## Function
SPACA9, or sperm acrosomal-associated protein 9, is involved in the structure and function of cilia and sperm axonemes. In human airway epithelial cells, SPACA9 localizes along the entire length of the axoneme, suggesting a role in ciliary function, although it may not be tightly associated with the axoneme (Blackburn2017Quantitative). In the context of sperm cells, SPACA9 is a major microtubule inner protein (MIP) within the central apparatus (CA) microtubules of the sperm axoneme. It exhibits distinct periodic patterns that contribute to the stabilization of the tubule walls, which is crucial for the proper function of sperm cells (Zhu2024Incell). The protein decorates the lumens of microtubule singlets and doublets with specific repeating patterns, such as an 8 nm periodicity in human tracheal cilia, and plays a significant role in enhancing microtubule stability (Zhu2024Incell). SPACA9's positioning at the intersection of tubulin heterodimers and various protofilaments is essential for stabilizing the tubule walls, which is vital for sperm motility and function (Zhu2024Incell). The protein's role as a tumor suppressor has also been noted, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SPACA9 is a protein involved in the structural organization of mammalian sperm flagella, particularly within the microtubule inner protein (MIP) networks. It interacts with both α- and β-tubulin within a dimer and with the M-loop of α-tubulin from a neighboring protofilament. This interaction pattern is specific, as SPACA9 does not interact with the M-loop of the neighboring β-tubulin (Leung2022Unraveling). SPACA9 is positioned at the B06/B07 interface of the B-tubule in sperm doublet microtubules, contributing to the periodic 'ladder rungs' structure observed in subtomogram averages of mammalian sperm (Leung2022Unraveling).

SPACA9 also interacts with SAXO1, another MIP present in the sperm flagellum, which binds longitudinally along protofilaments. This interaction is part of a complex network of proteins that includes FAM166C, PPP1R32, and SMRP1, which collectively contribute to the stability and function of the sperm flagella (Leung2022Unraveling). The arrangement and interactions of SPACA9 within the microtubule structure are crucial for the stabilization of the tubule walls and the overall structural integrity of the sperm flagella (Zhu2024Incell).
