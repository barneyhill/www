# LPAR4

## Overview
LPAR4, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically involved in the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling pathway. The protein product of LPAR4 is a transmembrane receptor characterized by its seven alpha-helical domains, which are typical of GPCRs and facilitate signal transduction across the cell membrane (Li2009Toward). LPAR4 is distinct from classical LPA receptors and shares a closer structural relationship with P2Y purinergic receptors (Choi2010LPA). Functionally, LPAR4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell motility, vascular development, and wound healing, by interacting with multiple G proteins and signaling pathways (Geraldo2021Role; Zhou2019Lysophosphatidic). Its expression in diverse tissues such as the ovary, thymus, and brain underscores its physiological significance (Choi2010LPA). LPAR4's role in pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and vascular development, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic; Engelbrecht2021Lysolipids).

## Structure
The LPAR4 gene encodes the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs, which facilitate its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Li2009Toward). The primary structure of LPAR4 includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its function, with notable residues such as S114(3.28), T187(EL2), and Y265(6.51) involved in ligand binding through hydrogen bonding with the polar head group of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Li2009Toward).

The secondary structure of LPAR4 includes a rhodopsin-like beta-hairpin structure in the extracellular loop 2 (EL2), which is important for ligand recognition (Li2009Toward). The tertiary structure is modeled based on homology with bovine rhodopsin and the human β2-adrenergic receptor, highlighting the receptor's transmembrane helices and their role in forming the ligand-binding pocket (Li2009Toward). The receptor's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the homology models suggest a conformation that supports ligand-induced stabilization for G protein interaction (Li2009Toward). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may influence LPAR4's activity and signaling, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
LPAR4, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is structurally distinct from classical LPA receptors and is more closely related to P2Y purinergic receptors (Choi2010LPA). LPAR4 is involved in mediating morphological changes such as cell rounding and stress fiber formation through the Gα12/13 and Rho/Rho-kinase pathways. It also induces intracellular cAMP accumulation and Ca²⁺ mobilization via Gαs and Gαq/11, respectively (Zhou2019Lysophosphatidic; Choi2010LPA).

In terms of cellular function, LPAR4 negatively regulates cell motility. Its activation inhibits LPA-induced cell migration through LPAR1, and LPAR4-deficient cells show enhanced migratory responses (Geraldo2021Role). LPAR4 is also involved in vascular development and blood pressure modulation, with its signaling affecting endothelial cell function and angiogenesis (Geraldo2021Role; Zhou2019Lysophosphatidic).

LPAR4 is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, thymus, and brain, and is active in the cell membrane, influencing processes like wound healing and vascular development (Geraldo2021Role; Choi2010LPA).

## Clinical Significance
LPAR4 (lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4) plays a significant role in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and vascular development. In cancer, LPAR4 generally exhibits a negative impact on cell proliferation and motility. It attenuates tumor motility and colony formation in colon cancer cell lines, and its knockdown is associated with increased cell motility in pancreatic cancer cells and tumor proliferation in head and neck carcinoma (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic). LPAR4 is also involved in the development of a capillary network in brain tumors, which may enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy and lymphocyte infiltration (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic). However, in fibrosarcoma, LPAR4 promotes cell invasion and invadopodium formation through cAMP/EPAC/Rac1 signaling (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic).

In vascular development, LPAR4 is crucial for endothelial proliferation and vascular branching. Lpar4 knockout mice exhibit developmental vascular defects, leading to embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in embryogenesis (Geraldo2021Role; Engelbrecht2021Lysolipids). LPAR4, along with LPAR6, plays a synergistic role in vascular development, with double-knockout embryos showing severe vascular defects (Geraldo2021Role). These findings underscore the importance of LPAR4 in maintaining vascular integrity and its potential involvement in pathological conditions where vascular development is compromised.

## Interactions
LPAR4 interacts with various proteins and signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and motility. It is known to couple with different G proteins, including Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13, which mediate its signaling effects (Geraldo2021Role). LPAR4 negatively regulates cell motility by modulating the activities of Rho and Rac proteins. It promotes Rho activation while inhibiting Rac activation, which is crucial for controlling cell movement (Lee2008Role). This receptor also interacts with the RhoA/ROCK1/β-catenin signaling pathway, inactivating it to regulate the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells into osteoblasts and adipocytes (Xie2019Lysophosphatidic).

LPAR4's interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway is also significant, as it acts as a negative regulator, affecting the levels of phosphorylated LRP6, GSK-3β, active β-catenin, and TCF7L2 (Xie2019Lysophosphatidic). In the context of osteogenesis, LPAR4 inhibits differentiation through cAMP pathways, contrasting with LPA1, which promotes osteogenic differentiation by increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels (Liu2010LPA). These interactions highlight LPAR4's role in various cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions like cancer and bone disorders.
