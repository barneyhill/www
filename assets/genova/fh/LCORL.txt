# LCORL

## Overview
The LCORL gene encodes the ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor-like protein, which functions as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein plays a significant role in various biological processes, including growth and development, by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids to influence transcriptional activity. LCORL is implicated in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications, particularly through its association with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Majeres2024Defining). The gene has been studied across multiple species, revealing its involvement in growth traits in cattle and horses, as well as its potential link to disease susceptibility in humans, such as familial lung squamous cell carcinoma (LindholmPerry2013Adipose; Byun2018Genomewide). These diverse roles underscore the importance of LCORL in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LCORL gene has been implicated in various conditions due to its role in growth and development. In horses, variations in the LCORL gene are associated with equine recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN), a condition that affects the laryngeal nerves and is linked to increased height. The genetic correlation between height and RLN in Thoroughbred horses suggests that the height-increasing allele of LCORL may also increase the risk of RLN (Boyko2014Genomic). In cattle, LCORL is associated with traits such as feed intake and growth, with its expression in muscle tissue correlating with average daily feed intake and growth phenotypes (LindholmPerry2013Adipose). 

In humans, the LCORL gene has been linked to familial lung squamous cell carcinoma. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the LCORL region, rs71603396, has been identified as significantly associated with this type of lung cancer, suggesting that genetic variations in LCORL may contribute to cancer risk (Byun2018Genomewide). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in growth-related traits and its potential role in disease susceptibility across different species.

## Interactions
LCORL, a transcription factor, is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and biological processes. It interacts with C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1), a transcriptional repressor that affects gene expression and cell cycles (HAN2017Sequence). LCORL is also associated with ubiquitin C, a gene involved in numerous cellular processes, suggesting its role in protein degradation pathways (HAN2017Sequence; Naserkheil2022Exploring).

In cattle, LCORL is part of a locus with the NCAPG gene, which is involved in growth traits (Naserkheil2022Exploring). The LCORL gene has been linked to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), with its long isoform encoding a protein, PALI2, that may interact with PRC2 similarly to PALI1, an accessory protein that enhances PRC2's repressive activity (Majeres2024Defining). This interaction suggests a role in epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling.

LCORL's involvement in regulatory networks is further highlighted by its role in lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions, where it competes with miRNA response elements, indicating its participation in complex gene regulatory networks (Liang2021Identifying). These interactions underscore LCORL's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular function.
