# PPM1G

## Overview
PPM1G is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1G, also known as PP2Cγ, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase. This protein is characterized by its requirement for divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for its enzymatic activity, placing it within the PPM family of phosphatases (Kamada2020Metaldependent). PPM1G plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing, protein translation, and cell growth, by dephosphorylating specific target proteins (Petri2007Dephosphorylation; Liu2013Protein). The protein's unique structure, featuring a highly acidic domain and a nuclear localization signal, facilitates its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular signaling and gene expression (Zhang2024PPM1G; Kamada2020Metaldependent). Clinically, alterations in the PPM1G gene have been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can serve as prognostic indicators (Lin2021Prognostic; Xiong2022High).

## Structure
PPM1G, also known as PP2Cγ, is a serine/threonine phosphatase with a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of PPM1G consists of 546 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 59 kDa, although the observed molecular weight is 75 kDa due to a unique highly acidic domain (AD) of approximately 200 amino acids (Zhang2024PPM1G). This domain is not found in other PPM phosphatases and contributes to the protein's distinct characteristics.

The secondary structure of PPM1G includes a long loop/linker L4 with negatively charged residues, which facilitates interactions with proteins such as the Tat protein of HIV and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The tertiary structure is characterized by a catalytic core that requires divalent metal ions like Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity, similar to other PPM family phosphatases (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

PPM1G also contains a C-terminal Lys-rich region, which is involved in interactions with RNA and other proteins (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The protein's structure allows it to form a holoenzyme complex with the B56d regulatory subunit of PP2A, influencing its localization and substrate specificity (Kumar2019PPM). The presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus facilitates its nuclear localization, essential for its role in dephosphorylating the survival motor neurons (SMN) complex (Petri2007Dephosphorylation).

## Function
PPM1G is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by dephosphorylating specific proteins. In the nucleus, PPM1G is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing through its interaction with the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex. It dephosphorylates SMN and Gemin3, which is essential for the proper localization and stability of the SMN complex within Cajal bodies, nuclear sub-organelles involved in spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein biogenesis (Petri2007Dephosphorylation; Kamada2020Metaldependent).

PPM1G also regulates protein translation and cell growth by dephosphorylating 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a key inhibitor of cap-dependent translation. This activity suppresses protein synthesis and cell growth by maintaining 4E-BP1 in a dephosphorylated state, thereby inhibiting its association with the translation initiation complex (Liu2013Protein).

In the cytoplasm, PPM1G forms a holoenzyme complex with the PP2A regulatory subunit B56d, which is crucial for maintaining adherens junction integrity by dephosphorylating a-catenin at serine 641. This dephosphorylation is necessary for a-catenin's localization to cell junctions, impacting cell adhesion and migration (Kumar2019PPM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPM1G gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of PPM1G is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an independent risk factor for patient survival. Genetic alterations such as amplifications are observed in a subset of HCC patients, correlating with lower overall survival. PPM1G's role in HCC involves interactions with pathways like the cell cycle, WNT, and mTOR, contributing to tumor progression (Zhang2024PPM1G; Xiong2022High).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), PPM1G expression is linked to poor prognosis, with overexpression associated with poor outcomes. It is involved in immune regulation, affecting tumor purity and immune cell infiltration, and is regulated by promoter methylation and copy number variations (Lin2021Prognostic).

PPM1G also plays a role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where its high expression is linked to poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. It is associated with immune checkpoints, which are significant in tumor immune escape (Yin2023Prognostic).

Mutations in PPM1G can disrupt its interaction with the B56d regulatory subunit, affecting cell adhesion and migration, potentially leading to increased tumor cell migration and progression (Kumar2019PPM).

## Interactions
PPM1G, a serine/threonine phosphatase, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, where it dephosphorylates SMN and Gemin3, crucial for the localization and stability of the SMN complex within Cajal bodies in the nucleus (Petri2007Dephosphorylation). PPM1G also forms a holoenzyme complex with the B56d subunit of the PP2A phosphatase complex, which is essential for maintaining adherens junction integrity by modulating a-catenin and controlling cell migration (Kumar2019PPM).

In transcription regulation, PPM1G binds to 7SK RNA and HEXIM1, preventing the reassembly of P-TEFb into the 7SK snRNP complex, thus sustaining transcription elongation. This interaction is regulated by ATM kinase, which phosphorylates PPM1G, enhancing its recruitment to the 7SK snRNP (Gudipaty2015PPM1G). PPM1G also interacts with the RelA subunit of NF-κB, facilitating its recruitment to target gene promoters and modulating NF-κB transcriptional activity (Hyder2020The). These interactions highlight PPM1G's role in regulating cellular signaling and gene expression.
