# ZIM2

## Overview
ZIM2 is a gene located on human chromosome 19q13, known for its involvement in genomic imprinting. It encodes the zinc finger imprinted 2 protein, which functions as a transcription factor characterized by the presence of Kruppel-type (C2H2) zinc-finger domains and a KRAB A domain. These structural features suggest a role in DNA binding and transcriptional repression, implicating ZIM2 in the regulation of gene expression. The protein is predominantly expressed in the adult testis, with additional expression in the fetal kidney and brain, indicating its potential involvement in reproductive and developmental processes. ZIM2 is part of a cluster of imprinted genes and is paternally expressed, highlighting its significance in epigenetic regulation (Kim2000Exon; Hamed2012Cellular).

## Structure
The human ZIM2 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of zinc-finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding. The primary structure of the ZIM2 protein includes an open reading frame of 527 amino acids. It features a central KRAB A domain and five C-terminal zinc-finger (ZNF) units, with two of these being degenerate finger units (Kim2000Exon). The zinc-finger domains are of the Kruppel-type (C2H2), which is a common motif in transcription factors, suggesting a role in gene regulation (Kim2000Exon).

The secondary structure of the ZIM2 protein is likely stabilized by zinc ions, which is typical for zinc-finger proteins, although specific details on the secondary structure are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would involve the folding of these domains to facilitate DNA binding, but detailed information on this aspect is not available. There is no information on the quaternary structure of the ZIM2 protein.

The ZIM2 protein shares its initial seven exons with the PEG3 gene, indicating a complex genomic organization that may involve alternative splicing (Kim2000Exon). This exon sharing suggests potential regulatory interactions between the two genes.

## Function
The ZIM2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor, primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression. It contains KRAB A and Kruppel-type (C2H2) zinc-finger domains, which are indicative of its role in DNA binding and transcriptional repression (Kim2000Exon). In humans, ZIM2 is expressed predominantly in the adult testis, with two transcripts of 2.5 and 9.0 kb in length. The 2.5-kb transcript is highly expressed in the testis, while the 9-kb transcript is present at modest levels in the testis, fetal kidney, and brain (Kim2000Exon).

ZIM2 is part of a cluster of Kruppel-type zinc-finger genes located on chromosome 19q13, a region known for imprinted genes (Kim2000Exon). The gene is paternally expressed in humans, suggesting its involvement in regulatory roles related to transcription and RNA metabolic processes (Hamed2012Cellular). The protein's activity is crucial for normal cellular functions, particularly in the testis, where its expression levels are almost equal to those of the PEG3 gene, with which it shares exons and regulatory elements (Kim2000Exon). The distinct expression patterns of ZIM2 and PEG3, despite shared regulatory elements, may be due to differences in splicing and polyadenylation (Kim2000Exon).
