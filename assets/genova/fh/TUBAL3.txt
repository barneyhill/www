# TUBAL3

## Overview
TUBAL3 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin alpha like 3, which is part of the tubulin family. Tubulins are globular proteins that are key components of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The TUBAL3 gene is expressed in various tissues, and its protein product is involved in the assembly and stability of microtubules. Although the specific functions of tubulin alpha like 3 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in the dynamic regulation of the microtubule network, similar to other tubulin family members. Understanding the precise role of TUBAL3 and its encoded protein could provide insights into its potential implications in cellular physiology and pathology.
