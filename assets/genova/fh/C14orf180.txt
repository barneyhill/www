# C14orf180

## Overview
C14orf180 is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 14 open reading frame 180. This protein is primarily associated with adipogenic pathways and lipid metabolism, playing a crucial role in the regulation of adipose tissue morphology and function. The gene's expression is notably enriched in adipose tissue and the heart, and it is sensitive to nutritional states, with reduced expression observed during fasting and obesity. The protein encoded by C14orf180 is localized to the plasma membrane and is highly induced during adipocyte differentiation, suggesting its involvement in metabolic processes and its potential as a marker for adipocyte differentiation (Zhang2012Nrac). The gene's regulatory influence on key adipogenic and lipid metabolism genes underscores its significance in maintaining normal adipocyte function and lipid storage (Kerr2019Epigenetic).

## Function
C14orf180 is a gene that plays a significant role in adipogenic pathways and lipid metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of adipose morphology, as demonstrated by experiments with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Knockdown of C14orf180 using siRNA significantly affects adipogenesis, leading to the downregulation of key adipogenic regulators such as PPARG and CEBPa, as well as genes essential for lipid metabolism, including LIPE, LPL, FABP4, PLIN2, and DGAT1 (Kerr2019Epigenetic). This suggests that C14orf180 is crucial for maintaining normal adipocyte function and lipid storage.

C14orf180 is also known as Nrac in mice and is nutritionally regulated, with expression enriched in adipose tissue and the heart. Its expression is reduced by fasting and obesity in white adipose tissue, indicating its sensitivity to nutritional states. The gene is localized to the plasma membrane and is highly induced during adipocyte differentiation, suggesting a role in metabolism and potential as an adipocyte marker (Zhang2012Nrac). These findings highlight the importance of C14orf180 in lipid metabolism and its potential impact on metabolic health.
