# ARMC5

## Overview
ARMC5 (Armadillo Repeat Containing 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and cell cycle regulation. The ARMC5 protein is characterized by the presence of an armadillo repeat domain and a BTB (Broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-à-brac) domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, respectively (Huang2021ARMC; Luo2024ARMC5). These complexes are crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, such as RNA polymerase II subunits, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Luo2024ARMC5). ARMC5 is expressed in various endocrine tissues, including the pituitary and adrenal glands, and plays a significant role in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, impacting cell proliferation (Huang2021ARMC). Mutations in the ARMC5 gene have been linked to primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH) and other neoplasias, highlighting its importance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a tumor suppressor (Elbelt2015Molecular; Alencar2014ARMC5Mutations).

## Structure
The ARMC5 protein is characterized by its armadillo repeat domain and a BTB (Broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-à-brac) domain. The armadillo domain consists of seven repeats, each approximately 40 amino acids long, forming a structure with three α-helices per repeat. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Luo2024ARMC5; Gul2016Metazoan). The BTB domain, located at the C-terminus, is involved in protein degradation processes and interacts with Cullin-3 (CUL3) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Huang2021ARMC; Luo2024ARMC5).

The primary structure of ARMC5 includes specific amino acid positions where mutations can occur, such as R334C and R793Q, which affect its binding capabilities (Luo2024ARMC5). The protein does not have enzymatic activity and functions through its interactions with other proteins (Luo2024ARMC5). In humans, ARMC5 has several isoforms, with the dominant one being 935 amino acids long. Variations in the 5′- and 3′-regions lead to different isoforms, including one with two extra exons resulting in a longer protein of 1030 amino acids (Luo2024ARMC5).

## Function
The ARMC5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, ARMC5 is involved in the degradation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunits. It functions as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically the ARMC5-CUL3-RBX1 complex, which targets Pol II subunits for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for maintaining a balanced Pol II pool, preventing the accumulation of misassembled or misfolded Pol II subunits, and ensuring proper transcriptional regulation (Luo2024ARMC5).

ARMC5 also plays a role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting PKA activation, which restrains the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby inhibiting the expression of Axins, Lef1, and Cyclin D1. This action suggests a role in inhibiting cell proliferation (Huang2021ARMC). The protein contains an N-terminal armadillo repeat domain and a C-terminal BTB domain, which serve as docking platforms for various proteins and are involved in protein-protein interactions (Huang2021ARMC). ARMC5 is expressed in most endocrine tissues, including the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, and pancreas, indicating its widespread role in cellular functions (Huang2021ARMC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARMC5 gene are significantly associated with primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH), a condition that can lead to Cushing's syndrome due to excessive cortisol production. These mutations are often germline and can be accompanied by somatic mutations in adrenal nodules, supporting a "two-hit" hypothesis for tumorigenesis (Elbelt2015Molecular; Alencar2014ARMC5Mutations). In a study of patients with PMAH, 44.1% had germline ARMC5 mutations, which were linked to higher cortisol levels and a greater prevalence of Cushing's syndrome (Faucz2014Macronodular).

ARMC5 mutations are also implicated in familial bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH), where they may act as tumor suppressors. These mutations can lead to a slow dedifferentiation of adrenocortical cells and reduced expression of steroidogenic enzymes (Alencar2014ARMC5Mutations). The presence of ARMC5 mutations has been associated with other neoplasias, such as meningiomas, suggesting a broader role in tumorigenesis (Elbelt2015Molecular).

In addition to adrenal disorders, ARMC5 mutations can cause increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases (Huang2021ARMC). The gene's role in various signaling pathways and its interactions with multiple binding partners highlight its clinical significance in endocrine and possibly other systemic disorders (Hu2017Armc5).

## Interactions
ARMC5 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It acts as an adaptor protein between full-length Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBF) and CUL3-based E3 ligase complexes. ARMC5 interacts with CUL3 through its BTB domain, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of SREBF1, a process that is reversed by proteasome inhibitors or CUL3 knockdown (Okuno2022ARMC5CUL3). Mutations in ARMC5, such as R315W, L331P, and R362L, can attenuate its interaction with SREBF1, leading to a loss of function (Okuno2022ARMC5CUL3).

ARMC5 also interacts with POLR2A, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, forming part of a POLR2A-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of POLR2A, impacting its levels and function in cells (Luo2024ARMC5). Mutations such as R334C, G422S, P559L, and R793Q reduce ARMC5's binding affinity with POLR2A, compromising its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Luo2024ARMC5).

ARMC5's interactions with CUL3 and POLR2A highlight its role in protein degradation pathways, influencing cellular processes and potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Huang2021ARMC).
