# PLEKHH2

## Overview
PLEKHH2 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology, MyTH4 and FERM domain containing H2, which is an intracellular protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of kidney function and cancer biology. The protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including pleckstrin homology (PH), MyTH4, and FERM domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and cellular components. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney glomerulus, by regulating matrix adhesion and actin dynamics (Perisic2012Plekhh2; Wang2022PLEKHH2). Additionally, PLEKHH2 plays a role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and migration, which is particularly relevant in the context of non-small cell lung cancer (Wang2022PLEKHH2). The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and cancer.

## Structure
The PLEKHH2 protein is a 1491-residue intracellular protein characterized by a unique domain organization. It contains a coiled-coil domain near the N-terminus, which is predicted to form a dimer and is crucial for the protein's self-association (Perisic2012Plekhh2). The C-terminal half of PLEKHH2 includes two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a MyTH4 domain, and a FERM domain (Perisic2012Plekhh2; Wang2022PLEKHH2). The PH1 domain contains a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate consensus-binding site, which is necessary for the protein's localization to peripheral regions of cell lamellipodia (Perisic2012Plekhh2). The FERM domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as β-arrestin1, and plays a role in cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT pathway (Wang2022PLEKHH2).

The MyTH4 and FERM domains form a functional supramodule, although the MyTH4 domain's independent function remains to be fully elucidated (Wang2022PLEKHH2). PLEKHH2 interacts with focal adhesion proteins like Hic-5 and actin, suggesting its role in matrix adhesion and actin dynamics (Perisic2012Plekhh2). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in podocytes and its involvement in diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Perisic2012Plekhh2).

## Function
The PLEKHH2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney glomerulus. This protein is involved in matrix adhesion and actin dynamics, essential for the stability of podocyte foot processes, which are critical for the kidney's filtration barrier (Perisic2012Plekhh2). PLEKHH2 contains several domains, including pleckstrin homology (PH), MyTH4, and FERM domains, which facilitate its interaction with actin and other cellular components. These interactions help stabilize the cortical actin cytoskeleton by slowing actin depolymerization, thereby maintaining cell shape and motility (Perisic2012Plekhh2).

The protein localizes to lamellipodia and podocyte foot processes, where it interacts with focal adhesion proteins like Hic-5, linking actin filaments to cell-matrix contact sites. This connection is vital for podocyte adhesion and migration, contributing to the structural stability of the glomerular basement membrane (Perisic2012Plekhh2). PLEKHH2's function is influenced by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, as its localization to lamellipodia is disrupted by inhibitors of this pathway (Perisic2012Plekhh2). In healthy cells, PLEKHH2 is essential for maintaining podocyte morphology and function, which are crucial for effective kidney filtration (Perisic2012Plekhh2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLEKHH2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of kidney disease, PLEKHH2 is significantly downregulated in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a condition characterized by scarring in the glomeruli, which are the kidney's filtering units. This downregulation is associated with disruptions in matrix adhesion and actin dynamics, crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney. The reduction in PLEKHH2 expression may contribute to podocyte dysfunction and the progression of FSGS, as well as other glomerular diseases such as diabetic nephropathy (Perisic2012Plekhh2).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PLEKHH2 is overexpressed and acts as a tumor promoter. Its overexpression is linked to more aggressive cancer phenotypes, including poorer differentiation, larger tumor size, and higher metastasis rates. PLEKHH2 promotes cancer cell growth and invasion by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through FAK phosphorylation. This pathway is crucial for the malignant behavior of lung cancer cells, and PLEKHH2's role in this process suggests it may be a target for therapeutic intervention in NSCLC (Wang2022PLEKHH2).

## Interactions
PLEKHH2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It contains a FERM domain that facilitates binding to β-arrestin1, a protein that typically interacts with Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). This interaction is significant in non-small cell lung cancer, where PLEKHH2 competes with FAK for binding to β-arrestin1, reducing the inhibition of FAK autophosphorylation and promoting the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is associated with increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Wang2022PLEKHH2).

In podocytes, PLEKHH2 interacts with Hic-5, a paxillin-related focal adhesion protein, and actin. These interactions are important for the localization of PLEKHH2 to lamellipodia and for its role in matrix adhesion and actin dynamics. The interaction with Hic-5 causes its relocalization from focal adhesions to the cell periphery in cultured podocytes, indicating a role in cell morphology and adhesion (Perisic2012Plekhh2). PLEKHH2 also self-associates through its coiled-coil domain, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and FRET experiments, although this self-association is not influenced by coexpression with Ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein (Perisic2012Plekhh2).
