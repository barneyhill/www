# MAB21L1

## Overview
The MAB21L1 gene encodes the mab-21 like 1 protein, which is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase fold protein family. Despite its structural similarity to cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), MAB21L1 lacks enzymatic activity and is primarily involved in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system and ocular development. The protein is characterized by a two-lobed, globular structure and is known to bind nucleotides such as CTP, ATP, and ADP, although these interactions do not confer enzymatic function (de2016Structural). MAB21L1 plays a crucial role in cell fate determination and is highly conserved across species, with significant expression in the brain, especially the cerebellum, where it influences neural tube development and organogenesis (Merello2004Molecular; Rad2018MAB21L1). Clinically, mutations in MAB21L1 are associated with various ocular disorders, including microphthalmia and aniridia, underscoring its importance in eye development (Seese2021Identification).

## Structure
The MAB21L1 protein is characterized by a two-lobed, globular structure with a mixed α/β topology. The N-terminal lobe contains the NTase subdomain, which features a five-stranded, antiparallel, and highly twisted β-sheet flanked by two long α-helices. The C-terminal lobe is formed by a conical four-helix bundle. The structure is stabilized by a long N-terminal 'spine' helix and a central linker region composed of two helices (de2016Structural).

MAB21L1 shares significant structural conservation with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), particularly in the conserved MAB21-domain fold, although it lacks the zinc-thumb region important for DNA binding and dimerization (de2016Structural). The protein forms a decamer in the crystal lattice, consisting of two back-to-back stacked pentameric rings with D5 symmetry, though it is monomeric in solution (de2016Structural).

The protein binds CTP, ATP, and ADP, with a preference for triphosphate nucleotides, and the CTP binding site is a positively charged pocket on the 'platform' side of the molecule (de2016Structural). Despite these binding interactions, MAB21L1 does not exhibit enzymatic nucleotidyltransferase activity (de2016Structural).

## Function
The MAB21L1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the nucleotidyltransferase fold protein family, although its exact function remains unclear due to the lack of an active conformation structure. MAB21L1 is involved in cell fate determination and is highly conserved across species. It plays a crucial role in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system, eye, midbrain, neural tube, and reproductive organs (Rad2018MAB21L1; de2016Structural). 

In healthy human cells, MAB21L1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum. It is involved in neural tube development and is essential for the differentiation and correct closure of the neural tube (Merello2004Molecular). The protein is active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways, contributing to proper organogenesis and neurodevelopment (Rad2018MAB21L1).

MAB21L1 may function as a transcriptional repressor through interactions with SMAD1, a nuclear transducer of the TGF-β pathway, and is potentially involved in RNA-related processes due to its preference for binding single-stranded RNA (de2016Structural). The gene is also implicated in the regulation of bone metabolism, where it is upregulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) through the JNK1 pathway, affecting osteoblast differentiation (Kim2011PTH).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAB21L1 gene are associated with several ocular disorders, including microphthalmia, aniridia, coloboma, and cataracts. The c.152G>T p.(Arg51Leu) variant has been identified as a likely causative mutation for microphthalmia and aniridia, showing high pathogenic potential and absence in the general population (Seese2021Identification). Other variants, such as p.(Arg62Cys) and p.(Gly220Arg), are linked to coloboma but are considered variants of uncertain significance due to their presence in unaffected individuals (Seese2021Identification).

Monoallelic missense variants, particularly those altering the Arg51 residue, have been linked to severe aniridia and microphthalmia. These variants can lead to additional ocular abnormalities, such as cataracts, lens instability, and optic disc anomalies (Hall2022Monoallelic). Structural analysis suggests that Arg51 substitutions destabilize the protein, potentially affecting its interactions and leading to a loss of function in PAX6-mediated repression of the SPARC gene, which is associated with eye disease (Hall2022Monoallelic).

The MAB21L1 gene is also implicated in cerebellooculo-facio-genital syndrome, which includes ocular abnormalities like corneal dystrophy and nystagmus (Seese2021Identification). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in developmental ocular disorders.

## Interactions
The MAB21L1 protein is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in developmental processes. It interacts with transcription factors such as MEIS1, MEIS2, PBX1, and PBX3, which are known to be co-binding partners of PAX6, a critical regulator in eye development (Hall2022Monoallelic). These interactions are not significantly altered by Arg51 substitutions, although the interaction with TBL1XR1, a component of the NCoR complex, is reduced in mutant forms of MAB21L1 (Hall2022Monoallelic).

MAB21L1 also shows a preference for binding single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) over other nucleic acids, although its affinity is moderate (de2016Structural). The protein binds CTP with high affinity, but this does not activate the protein, suggesting that CTP may mimic a physiological ligand (de2016Structural). Additionally, mutation-specific interactions have been observed with proteins such as GALNT2, MSI2, and LRRFIP1, indicating potential gain-of-function effects (Hall2022Monoallelic). These interactions suggest that MAB21L1 may be involved in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of eye development.
