# IL13

## Overview
Interleukin 13 (IL13) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 13, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by modulating inflammatory responses and influencing the behavior of various immune cells. As a member of the cytokine family, interleukin 13 is characterized by its four-helix bundle structure, typical of short-chain cytokines, and is primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in B cells and macrophages (Ultsch2013Structural; Punnonen1993Interleukin). The protein interacts with specific receptors, including IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2, to mediate its effects, which include promoting immunoglobulin class switching and modulating the Th1/Th2 balance (MartinezNunez2011The; Lupardus2010Molecular). IL13 is implicated in various pathological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and certain cancers, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Song2021Possible; Tsoi2019Atopic).

## Structure
The IL13 protein, interleukin 13, is a cytokine involved in immune response regulation. Its molecular structure is characterized by a four-helix bundle, a common feature among short-chain cytokines (Ultsch2013Structural). The primary structure of IL13 includes specific amino acid sequences that contribute to its function and interactions with receptors. The secondary structure consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a compact, globular tertiary structure. 

IL13 interacts with its receptors, IL-13Ra1 and IL-13Ra2, through distinct binding sites. The IL-13/IL-13Ra2 complex features a 'two-site' binding mode, with interactions involving the A and D helices of IL13 and the D2-D3 'elbow' region of IL-13Ra2 (Lupardus2010Molecular). The quaternary structure involves these interactions, highlighting the high affinity of IL13 for IL-13Ra2, which is attributed to additional peripheral contacts and a more complementary interface (Lupardus2010Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of IL13 include glycosylation, with four predicted Asn-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for its stability and function (Lupardus2010Molecular). These modifications can influence the protein's interaction with its receptors and its role in immune signaling. The presence of splice variant isoforms may result in different functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a cytokine primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in B cells and macrophages. In B cells, IL-13 induces the expression of CD23 and promotes immunoglobulin class switching, leading to the synthesis of IgG4 and IgE antibodies. This process occurs independently of interleukin 4 (IL-4), highlighting IL-13's unique role in immunoglobulin production and isotype switching (Punnonen1993Interleukin). IL-13 also enhances the expression of class II MHC antigens on B cells, stimulating their proliferation and differentiation (Defrance1994Interleukin).

In macrophages, IL-13 modulates the immune response by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and influencing the Th1/Th2 balance. It achieves this by targeting the interleukin 13 receptor α1 (IL13Rα1), which affects the phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor involved in cytokine signaling (MartinezNunez2011The). IL-13 is also involved in the regulation of allergic responses, contributing to airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production in the lungs (Wynn2003IL-13). These functions underscore IL-13's critical role in both promoting and regulating immune responses in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 13 (IL13) is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In atopic dermatitis (AD), IL13 is a dominant cytokine, with its expression correlating with disease severity as measured by the SCORAD index. This suggests IL13's significant role in AD pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Tsoi2019Atopic). In allergic rhinitis (AR), particularly in individuals sensitized to house dust mites, DNA hypomethylation at the IL13 gene is associated with increased susceptibility. This hypomethylation correlates with higher IL13 mRNA expression and serum IgE levels, indicating a role in allergic inflammation (Li2016Association).

IL13 is also involved in eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), where it induces a specific transcriptome in esophageal keratinocytes, contributing to disease pathogenesis. Glucocorticoid treatment can reverse this IL13-induced gene expression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Blanchard2007IL13). In cancer, IL13 and its receptors are implicated in tumor biology, influencing processes like cell proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other malignancies (Song2021Possible; Kang2019Interleukin4Rα). These findings underscore IL13's diverse roles in disease and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a cytokine that interacts with a complex receptor system involving IL-4Rα and two IL-13 binding proteins, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. IL-13Rα1, when paired with IL-4Rα, forms a high-affinity receptor complex known as the type II IL-4/IL-13 receptor, which is crucial for IL-13 signaling and activates the STAT6 transcription factor (Hershey2003IL13; Junttila2018Tuning). IL-13Rα2, traditionally considered a decoy receptor, binds IL-13 with high affinity but does not facilitate signaling. However, it has been shown to mediate signaling in certain contexts, such as the production of TGF-β1 (Junttila2018Tuning).

IL-13 does not directly interact with the common γ chain (γc), which is part of the type I IL-4 receptor complex, but γc is essential for signaling in other cytokine pathways (Hershey2003IL13). The interaction between IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 is species-specific, with human IL-13Rα1 only associating with human IL-4Rα (Hershey2003IL13). IL-13Rα1 is necessary for IL-13-induced signaling, as its intracellular domain is crucial for coupling with IL-4Rα and activating downstream pathways (Hershey2003IL13).
