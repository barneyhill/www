# KLB

## Overview
The KLB gene encodes the protein beta klotho, a transmembrane protein that functions as a coreceptor for fibroblast growth factors, particularly FGF19 and FGF21. This protein plays a pivotal role in metabolic regulation by forming complexes with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), thereby facilitating signaling pathways that influence glucose and lipid metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and energy homeostasis (Aaldijk2023Biological). Structurally, beta klotho is characterized by two tandem glycoside hydrolase-like domains, which, despite their structural similarity to β-glucosidase enzymes, are not catalytically active (Lee2018Structures). The protein's ability to act as a high-affinity receptor for FGF19 and FGF21 underscores its evolutionary adaptation from a sugar-cutting enzyme to a hormone receptor (Lee2018Structures). Clinically, mutations in the KLB gene are linked to congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and have implications in cancer prognosis, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Bi2024Comprehensive; Xu2017KLB).

## Structure
The KLB protein, also known as beta klotho, is composed of 1044 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 120 kDa (Aaldijk2023Biological). Its structure includes two tandem glycoside hydrolase-like domains, D1 and D2, which are structurally similar to human cytosolic β-glucosidase enzymes but are not catalytically active due to the replacement of a conserved glutamate residue (Lee2018Structures; Aaldijk2023Biological). The D1 domain contains a pocket occluded by a short helix, part of the FGF21 binding site, while the D2 domain has an accessible pocket occupied by a MES molecule (Lee2018Structures).

The protein features a signal sequence at residues 1-53, though its function remains unknown (Aaldijk2023Biological). KLB's extracellular region is characterized by reduced cysteines, with a potential disulfide bond involving C976 (Lee2018Structures). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its maturation and cell surface expression (Xu2017KLB).

KLB functions as a high-affinity receptor for FGF19 and FGF21, forming a ternary complex with FGFR1c, crucial for intracellular signaling (Lee2018Structures). The structural adaptation of KLB from a sugar-cutting enzyme to a hormone receptor highlights its evolutionary significance (Lee2018Structures).

## Function
The KLB gene encodes the protein beta klotho, which functions as a coreceptor for fibroblast growth factors FGF19 and FGF21, playing a crucial role in metabolic regulation. In healthy human cells, beta klotho is primarily expressed in the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas, where it modulates various metabolic processes (Aaldijk2023Biological). It forms a complex with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), facilitating the signaling pathways that regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and energy homeostasis (Aaldijk2023Biological).

Beta klotho is involved in the regulation of bile acid metabolism by interacting with FGF15/19 and FGFR4, leading to the repression of CYP7A1, the enzyme responsible for bile acid synthesis (Aaldijk2023Biological). In the pancreas, it influences insulin secretion and protects beta-cells from glucolipotoxicity, thereby playing a protective role against type 2 diabetes (Aaldijk2023Biological). The protein is also implicated in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and regulating bile acid circulation, which protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation (Aaldijk2023Biological). Beta klotho's involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLB gene, which encodes the protein β-klotho, are associated with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), a condition characterized by absent or partial puberty and reproductive issues such as micropenis and cryptorchidism. These mutations impair FGF21 signaling, crucial for reproductive and metabolic regulation, leading to severe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency and metabolic defects like obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia (Xu2017KLB). The p.F777delF mutation is notably prevalent among European descent probands with CHH (Xu2017KLB).

KLB mutations also exhibit variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, with some carriers showing attenuated phenotypes or being asymptomatic. This suggests oligogenicity, where mutations in other CHH-related genes may influence phenotypic severity (Xu2017KLB). 

In cancer, KLB expression is generally lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, affecting progression-free intervals in colorectal cancer and being associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Li2019βKlotho; Bi2024Comprehensive). In NSCLC, KLB downregulation is linked to tumor metastasis and poorer patient outcomes, with its reintroduction inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis (Li2019βKlotho).

## Interactions
The KLB gene encodes the β-Klotho protein, which acts as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factors, particularly FGF19 and FGF21. β-Klotho forms a complex with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), such as FGFR1c and FGFR4, facilitating the binding and activation of these growth factors. This interaction is crucial for the metabolic effects mediated by FGF19 and FGF21, including glucose and lipid metabolism (Yang2012Differential; Aaldijk2023Biological).

β-Klotho specifically enhances the binding affinity of FGF21 to FGFR1c, forming a high-affinity receptor complex that is essential for FGF21 signaling. This interaction involves specific amino acid residues in both β-Klotho and FGF21, which are critical for the binding and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways (Lee2018Structures; Aaldijk2023Biological). The structural analysis of β-Klotho reveals that its glycoside hydrolase-like domains have evolved to specifically recognize FGF21, with the C-terminus of FGF21 mimicking an oligosaccharide structure (Lee2018Structures).

Mutations in KLB can impair the FGF21/FGFR1 signaling pathway, affecting metabolic processes and potentially leading to conditions such as congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Xu2017KLB). The presence of β-Klotho is necessary for the productive complex formation of endocrine FGFs with FGFRs, highlighting its role as a crucial mediator in these interactions (Yang2012Differential).
