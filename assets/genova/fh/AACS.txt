# AACS

## Overview
The AACS gene encodes the enzyme acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, which is integral to ketone body metabolism and the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. This enzyme is classified as a synthetase, a type of ligase that catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA, a critical step in lipid metabolism. Acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase is predominantly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the brain, white adipose tissue, and heart, where it supports lipid biosynthesis and energy homeostasis (Yamasaki2005AcetoacetylCoA; Ohgami2003Expression). The enzyme's activity is regulated by transcription factors like SREBP-2 and PPARγ, which adjust its expression in response to developmental and dietary cues (Hasegawa2012AcetoacetylCoAa; Aguiló2010Transcriptional). Variations in the AACS gene have been linked to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, highlighting its significance in metabolic regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Haydar2019Finescale).

## Structure
The human AACS gene encodes acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, an enzyme involved in ketone body metabolism and cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. The primary structure of AACS includes several splice variants, each with distinct exon compositions. Isoform 2 lacks exon 17, isoform 3 lacks exon 12, and isoform 4 lacks both exons 12 and 17. These structural differences suggest diverse physiological functions beyond ketone body utilization (Hasegawa2020Isolation).

The secondary structure of AACS features an acetyl-CoA synthetase N-terminus motif (amino acids 47-104) and an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-binding motif (amino acids 109-543). The loss of exon 12 in isoforms 3 and 4 affects the AMP-binding motif, impacting ketone body utilization activity. The C-terminal region is crucial for AACS activity, as demonstrated by the loss of activity in variants missing exon 17 (Hasegawa2020Isolation).

AACS isoform 2 retains the AMP-binding motif but lacks exon 17, indicating potential alternative substrate preferences. The N-terminal region is implicated in functions beyond ketone body utilization, such as increasing the expression of caveolin 1 in its cleavage form (1-547) (Hasegawa2020Isolation). The molecular weights of the splice variants are 66.94, 70.51, and 62.41 kDa for isoforms 2, 3, and 4, respectively (Hasegawa2020Isolation).

## Function
The AACS gene encodes acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in ketone body metabolism by converting acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential for the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids, which are vital components of cellular membranes and signaling molecules (Hasegawa2012AcetoacetylCoAa; Aguiló2010Transcriptional). AACS is highly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the brain, white adipose tissue, and the heart, where it contributes to lipid biosynthesis and energy homeostasis (Yamasaki2005AcetoacetylCoA; Ohgami2003Expression).

In the brain, AACS is involved in neuronal development, particularly during neurite outgrowth, by facilitating the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids necessary for neuronal tissue (Hasegawa2012AcetoacetylCoAa). The enzyme's activity is regulated by transcription factors such as SREBP-2 and PPARγ, which modulate its expression in response to physiological conditions like development and dietary changes (Hasegawa2012AcetoacetylCoAa; Aguiló2010Transcriptional). AACS is also implicated in adipogenesis, where it supports fatty acid synthesis during adipocyte differentiation (Aguiló2010Transcriptional). The enzyme's function is critical for maintaining lipid balance and energy production in cells, highlighting its importance in metabolic regulation (Hasegawa2014Degradation).

## Clinical Significance
The AACS gene, encoding acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, has been implicated in several metabolic disorders due to its role in ketone body metabolism. Alterations in the AACS gene, particularly through specific haplotypes, have been associated with insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The study by Haydar et al. identified several haplotypes within the AACS gene that are linked to increased HOMA IR, a measure of insulin resistance, suggesting a potential role in the development of IR (Haydar2019Finescale). Notably, the haplotype B18_H4 was associated with a significantly increased risk of IR, with homozygous carriers showing a higher odds ratio for developing this condition (Haydar2019Finescale).

In addition to IR, variations in the AACS gene have been correlated with altered branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) plasma levels, which are linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. The study found that certain AACS haplotypes influenced both BCAA levels and insulin sensitivity, indicating a broader impact on metabolic health (Haydar2019Finescale). These findings suggest that genetic variations in AACS may contribute to metabolic disorders by affecting ketone body and BCAA metabolism, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Haydar2019Finescale).
