# FYN

## Overview
FYN is a gene that encodes the FYN proto-oncogene, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell growth, survival, adhesion, and motility. The FYN protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including SH2 and SH3 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a catalytic domain responsible for its kinase activity (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). FYN is involved in critical physiological functions, including T-cell receptor signaling and neural development, and is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Andoniou2000The; Peng2023FYN:). Its dysregulation is associated with Alzheimer's disease and various cancers, where it contributes to disease progression through its role in cellular signaling and interaction with other proteins (Schenone2011Fyn).

## Structure
The FYN proto-oncogene encodes a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which are involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The molecular structure of FYN includes several key domains: a unique domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a catalytic domain (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). The SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences, while the SH2 domain interacts with phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, playing crucial roles in protein-protein interactions (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). 

FYN is myristoylated at the N-terminus, which is important for membrane association, and it may also undergo palmitoylation on cysteine residues within the first 10 amino acids (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). These post-translational modifications are critical for its localization and function within the cell. The catalytic domain of FYN is highly conserved among Src family kinases and includes a tyrosine residue in the activation loop, which is a site of autophosphorylation (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). 

FYN's structure is characterized by a compact, globular tertiary structure, typical of protein kinases, with the SH2 and SH3 domains contributing to its regulatory functions. The unique domain of FYN is more conserved than in other Src family members, suggesting additional roles beyond spacing (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function).

## Function
FYN is a member of the Src family kinases, which are non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, FYN plays a crucial role in regulating normal cellular functions such as cell growth, survival, adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, motility, axon guidance, synaptic function, and central nervous system myelination (Peng2023FYN:). It is primarily localized to the cytoplasmic membrane, where it phosphorylates tyrosine residues of key molecules in different signaling pathways. FYN contains an N-terminal region for plasma membrane binding, two Src homology (SH) domains (SH2 and SH3) for protein interactions, and a highly conserved catalytic domain with an ATP binding site. The SH1 domain contains the active site of the kinase, and the C-terminal tail has a negative regulatory tyrosine site. FYN's activity is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, which modulate its kinase activity (Peng2023FYN:).

FYN is also involved in platelet activation and T-cell receptor signaling, playing a critical role in the development and activation of lymphocytes (Andoniou2000The). In neural development, FYN is important for processes such as axon guidance and synaptic function, as evidenced by defects in these processes in Fyn-deficient mice (Andoniou2000The).

## Clinical Significance
The FYN gene is implicated in several diseases, particularly in the central nervous system and various cancers. In neurodegenerative diseases, Fyn kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of Tau protein, contributing to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It also plays a role in synaptic and cognitive impairments associated with AD by interacting with amyloid-beta (Aβ), leading to synaptotoxicity and neurotoxicity (Schenone2011Fyn). Fyn's dysregulation is linked to synaptic deficits and neurodegenerative processes, with aberrant phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits associated with brain injury (Matrone2020Fyn).

In cancer, Fyn acts as a potential oncogene, influencing cellular growth, proliferation, and motility. It is involved in signaling pathways that promote antiapoptotic activity and regulate GTPases and MAPKs, which are often hyperactivated in cancer. Fyn's role in cancer includes affecting cell proliferation, matrix rigidity, and cytoskeletal organization, contributing to cancer development and metastasis (Schenone2011Fyn). Fyn is notably associated with poor survival in breast cancer and is linked to neoangiogenesis and upregulation of c-Met and FAK (Schenone2011Fyn).

Fyn is also implicated in Parkinson's disease, where it interacts with various proteins and pathways, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Angelopoulou2020Pivotal).

## Interactions
FYN, a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in T-cell signaling and activation. FYN specifically associates with the c-Cbl protein in T cells, a relationship enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl, which is induced by TcR/CD3 stimulation. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of FYN binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on c-Cbl, forming a complex that is specific to FYN and not observed with other Src family kinases like Lck (Tsygankov1996Specific).

FYN also forms a complex with several phosphoproteins, including SKAP55, SLAP-130, and Pyk2, in human T cells. These proteins preferentially interact with FYN and are not found in Lck immunoprecipitates, indicating a specific association with FYN (MarieCardine1999Molecular). In transformed T cell lines, such as Jurkat cells, the FYN complex undergoes alterations, with new proteins like §-tubulin interacting with FYN, suggesting a role in T cell proliferation and transformation (MarieCardine1999Molecular).

Cbl acts as a negative regulator of FYN by enhancing its degradation. This interaction involves the SH3 domain of FYN binding to proline-rich sequences in Cbl, and the SH2 domain of FYN binding to phosphorylated tyrosines on Cbl (Andoniou2000The).
