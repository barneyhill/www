# SPRED1

## Overview
SPRED1 is a gene that encodes the protein sprouty-related EVH1 domain containing 1, which is a crucial regulator of the Ras-MAPK-ERK signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a signaling regulator and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The SPRED1 protein is characterized by its tripartite domain structure, which includes an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a central c-Kit binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal Sprouty-related (SPR) domain. These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as neurofibromin and the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, to modulate signaling pathways. SPRED1 plays a significant role in neural development and is highly expressed in the brain during fetal development. Mutations in the SPRED1 gene are associated with Legius syndrome, a condition that shares some clinical features with neurofibromatosis type 1 but does not increase tumor risk (Phoenix2010Spred1; YOSHIMURA2021SOCS; Lorenzo2020SPRED).

## Structure
The SPRED1 protein is characterized by a tripartite domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a central c-Kit binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal Sprouty-related (SPR) domain (Bundschu2007Getting; Gong2020Progress). The EVH1 domain, comprising 110 amino acids, adopts a pleckstrin-homology fold, forming a beta-sandwich structure with a C-terminal alpha-helix. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to neurofibromin, and plays a significant role in inhibiting ERK activation (Führer2017NMR; Bundschu2007Getting).

The KBD domain is essential for binding to the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, which is important in hematopoiesis and cancer (Butler2023Sacylation; Lorenzo2020SPRED). The SPR domain is involved in membrane localization and facilitates the translocation of neurofibromin to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with Ras (Lorenzo2020SPRED). This domain also plays a role in the dimerization of SPRED proteins, which is important for their function (Lorenzo2020SPRED).

SPRED1 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, which may regulate its activity (KING2005Distinct). Additionally, SPRED1 can be palmitoylated, aiding in its membrane localization (Lorenzo2020SPRED). Multiple splice variants of SPRED1 exist, potentially affecting its function and localization (Spurlock2009SPRED1).

## Function
The SPRED1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of the Ras-MAPK-ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, SPRED1 interacts with neurofibromin, the product of the NF1 gene, to inhibit the Ras-ERK pathway. This interaction is facilitated by the EVH1 domain of SPRED1, which binds to specific regions of neurofibromin, recruiting it to the plasma membrane to down-regulate Ras-GTP levels (Hirata2016Interaction; Lorenzo2020SPRED). 

SPRED1 is highly expressed in the brain during fetal development and is enriched in central nervous system germinal zones. It plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, thereby regulating the structure of the ventricular zone and ensuring proper cortical development (Phoenix2010Spred1). 

The protein's function is essential for normal cellular processes, preventing hyperactive Ras signaling that can lead to developmental disorders and certain cancers. Loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1 can result in conditions like Legius syndrome, characterized by symptoms such as café au lait spots and learning disabilities (YOSHIMURA2021SOCS; Lorenzo2020SPRED).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPRED1 gene are primarily associated with Legius syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, macrocephaly, and learning disabilities such as ADHD and developmental delays (Sumner2011The; Lorenzo2020SPRED). The clinical phenotype of LS resembles a mild version of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) but lacks certain features such as neurofibromas and Lisch nodules (Hirata2016Interaction; Denayer2010Legius). 

SPRED1 mutations often result in a truncated protein that cannot properly interact with the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, leading to the LS phenotype (Sumner2011The). These mutations include nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, which can disrupt the interaction with neurofibromin or affect SPRED1's localization to the membrane (Spurlock2009SPRED1; Lorenzo2020SPRED). 

While LS shares some features with NF1, it does not increase the risk of tumor development, which is a significant distinction between the two conditions (Sumner2011The). However, there have been reports of SPRED1 mutations in acute myeloblastic leukemia, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Hirata2016Interaction).

## Interactions
SPRED1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. It binds to neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF1 gene, through its N-terminal EVH1 domain. This interaction is essential for recruiting neurofibromin to the plasma membrane, where it functions as a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP), thereby reducing Ras-GTP levels and inhibiting Ras activation (Stowe2012A; Lorenzo2020SPRED). Mutations in the EVH1 domain can disrupt this interaction, affecting SPRED1's ability to regulate Ras signaling (Stowe2012A).

SPRED1 also interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit via its central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD). This interaction is important for SPRED1's role in signal transduction and its membrane localization (Lorenzo2020SPRED). Additionally, SPRED1 can form a complex with RAS and RAF, inhibiting RAF kinase activation and thus blocking downstream MAPK pathway activation (Gong2020Progress).

The C-terminal Sprouty (SPR) domain of SPRED1 is involved in membrane localization and dimerization with other SPRED proteins, which is necessary for its function in Ras signaling inhibition (Lorenzo2020SPRED). This domain also interacts with caveolin-1, coordinating the inhibition of ERK activation (Gong2020Progress).
