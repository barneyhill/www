# CD79A

## Overview
CD79A is a gene that encodes the Igα protein, a transmembrane component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, which is pivotal for B-cell development and immune function. The Igα protein, in conjunction with CD79B (Igβ), forms a heterodimer that is integral to the BCR's ability to transduce signals upon antigen binding. This signaling is crucial for B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as for the maintenance of B-cell survival. The CD79A protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within its intracellular domain, which undergoes phosphorylation to initiate downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK. These pathways are essential for the immune response and B-cell function (Mason1995CD79a:; Tkachenko2023B-Cell). Additionally, CD79A is involved in processes such as ubiquitination, which are vital for BCR endocytosis and antigen processing (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various B-cell malignancies, where mutations can lead to aberrant BCR signaling and contribute to tumorigenesis (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

## Structure
CD79A, also known as Igα, is a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, forming a heterodimer with CD79B. This heterodimer is essential for BCR signal transduction and consists of three domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). The extracellular domain of CD79A is involved in forming disulfide bonds with CD79B, specifically between Cys119 of CD79A and Cys136 of CD79B, which stabilizes the heterodimer structure (Bhattacharyya2023Combination). The transmembrane domain contributes to the compact bundle formation through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds (Bhattacharyya2023Combination).

The intracellular domain of CD79A contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) with two critical tyrosine residues. These residues are phosphorylated by Src-family kinases, which play a direct role in BCR signal mediation (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are crucial for CD79A's role in BCR signaling, affecting processes like endocytosis and intracellular trafficking (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

CD79A is involved in the formation and stability of the BCR complex, regulating membrane-bound IgM expression and promoting IgM transport to the cell surface (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). The interactions between CD79A and CD79B are isotype-specific, with IgM binding from the side and IgG interacting with the top of the complex, suggesting differences in BCR signaling based on isotype (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

## Function
The CD79A gene encodes the Igα protein, a critical component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, which is essential for B-cell development and function. CD79A, along with CD79B, forms a heterodimer that associates with membrane-bound immunoglobulins, facilitating signal transduction upon antigen binding. This complex is crucial for the assembly, stability, and functionality of the BCR, playing a significant role in B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation (Mason1995CD79a:; Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

The CD79A/CD79B heterodimer contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its intracellular domain, which is phosphorylated by Src-family kinases such as Lyn. This phosphorylation is essential for recruiting SYK and activating downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK, which are vital for B-cell survival and function (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

CD79A is also involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for BCR function, including endocytosis and antigen processing. This process is necessary for PI3K activation and PIP3 accumulation, affecting antigen presentation and maintaining pro-survival signals in B cells (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). The protein is primarily active in the plasma membrane of B-cells, where it plays a pivotal role in the immune response (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD79A gene are implicated in various B-cell malignancies, particularly in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). CD79A mutations are present in approximately 3-4% of NHL cases and are more frequent in the EZB cluster of DLBCL. These mutations contribute to the activation and enhancement of chronic active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, particularly in activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). In ABC DLBCL, CD79A mutations are linked to the activation of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome complex, which is essential for NF-κB activation, a pathway crucial for tumor cell survival and proliferation (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

CD79A mutations are also found in other subtypes of DLBCL, such as primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCLBCL-LT), and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). These mutations are associated with increased surface BCR expression and chronic active BCR signaling enhancement, which modulates NF-κB signaling (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). Although CD79A mutations cannot independently trigger BCR signaling, they amplify and modulate the signal's strength and direction, often in conjunction with other mutations like MYD88 (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

## Interactions
CD79A, also known as Igα, is a critical component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, forming a heterodimer with CD79B (Igβ). This heterodimer is essential for BCR signal transduction. CD79A interacts with the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of CD79B and the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg), specifically binding to the TMDs of the µHC and µHC' of mIgM, which is crucial for the stability and function of the BCR complex (Reth2023Discoveringa; Reth2023Discovering).

The intracellular domains of CD79A contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are phosphorylated by Src-family kinases such as Lyn and SYK. This phosphorylation is vital for recruiting these kinases, which activate downstream signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK (Bhattacharyya2023Combination; Tkachenko2023B-Cell). CD79A also interacts with the B-cell linker (BLNK) protein, which is phosphorylated by SYK, facilitating the assembly of a regulatory complex that further activates NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

CD79A is involved in co-signaling with other receptors such as CD19, BAFFR, and MHC class II, contributing to the modulation of BCR signaling and maintaining pro-survival signals in B cells (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).
