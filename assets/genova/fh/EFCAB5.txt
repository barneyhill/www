# EFCAB5

## Overview
EFCAB5 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 protein, which is involved in calcium ion binding and signaling pathways. The EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 protein is characterized by its EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structural domain that is commonly found in calcium-binding proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by modulating calcium-dependent signaling pathways, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. The precise biological functions and interactions of EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 are still under investigation, but it is known to participate in pathways that influence cellular responses to calcium fluctuations (Qiu2020aarFDC).
