# UBA3

## Overview
UBA3 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 3, which is a crucial component of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) complex. This protein functions as an E1 enzyme, playing a pivotal role in the neddylation pathway, a post-translational modification process that involves the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins. UBA3, in conjunction with APPBP1, facilitates the activation of NEDD8, which is essential for the regulation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), thereby influencing protein ubiquitination and degradation. The activity of UBA3 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, impacting processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Mutations or alterations in UBA3 expression have been implicated in various diseases, including acute promyelocytic leukemia and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting; Soucy2010The; Zhang2023UBA3).

## Function
UBA3 is a critical component of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) complex, which plays a vital role in the neddylation process. This process involves the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins, primarily cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), enhancing their ubiquitination activity. UBA3, as part of the E1 enzyme complex, is essential for the activation of NEDD8, facilitating its transfer to E2 conjugating enzymes, such as Ubc12, through a thioester linkage (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting; Soucy2010The).

In healthy human cells, UBA3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and protein degradation. The neddylation of cullins by UBA3 is crucial for the regulation of protein degradation pathways, as it enhances the activity of CRLs, which are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins that control various cellular processes (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting; Soucy2010The).

The interaction between UBA3 and NEDD8 is critical for NEDD8 activation, and mutations in UBA3 can significantly impact the efficiency of this process, underscoring its essential function in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting).

## Clinical Significance
UBA3, a gene encoding a component of the NEDD8-activating enzyme, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in the neddylation process. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), alterations in UBA3 expression are crucial for the disease's progression and response to treatment. The downregulation of UBA3 by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) leads to the degradation of the protein through the lysosome-autophagy pathway, contributing to the therapeutic effects of ATRA in APL cells (Cao2017Alltransretinoic).

Mutations in the UBA3 gene can confer resistance to the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 in human leukemic cells. Specific mutations, such as I310N and Y352H, alter the enzyme's biochemical properties, reducing the drug's potency while maintaining sufficient NEDD8 system function. These mutations highlight the potential clinical significance of UBA3 in understanding and overcoming drug resistance in leukemia treatment (Xu2014Mutations).

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), UBA3 is identified as a potential diagnostic marker. Its expression is associated with cancer progression, and knockdown experiments show that reducing UBA3 expression significantly inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Zhang2023UBA3).

## Interactions
UBA3, a component of the NEDD8-activating enzyme complex, plays a crucial role in the neddylation pathway by interacting with several proteins. It forms a heterodimer with APPBP1, which is involved in the activation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. This interaction is essential for the neddylation process, although APPBP1 primarily acts as a scaffold to enhance molecular interactions and facilitate the catalytic reaction (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting). UBA3 is critical for NEDD8 activation, as its absence prevents the formation of both covalent and non-covalent intermediates necessary for this process (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting).

The interaction between UBA3 and NEDD8 is particularly important, as demonstrated by the crystal structure of the NEDD8-E1 complex, where the NEDD8 C-terminal tail fits into a groove in UBA3 near the nucleotide-binding pocket. Mutations in UBA3 that disrupt this interaction impair NEDD8 activation (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting). UBA3 also interacts with cullin proteins, facilitating their neddylation, which is crucial for the regulation of protein degradation (Malik-Chaudhry2018Dissecting). These interactions highlight UBA3's essential role in the neddylation pathway and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma (Lin2023The).
