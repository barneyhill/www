# TRDN

## Overview
The TRDN gene encodes the triadin protein, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in muscle physiology by regulating calcium release in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Triadin is a key component of the calcium release complex (CRC) within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with proteins such as the ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin to facilitate excitation-contraction coupling, essential for muscle contraction. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including Trisk 51 and Trisk 95 in skeletal muscle, and Trisk 32 in cardiac muscle. These isoforms contribute to the structural integrity and function of the CRC, with implications for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and muscle function. Mutations in the TRDN gene are linked to severe cardiac conditions, such as Triadin KnockOut Syndrome (TKOS) and Long QT syndrome type 17 (LQT17), highlighting the clinical significance of triadin in cardiovascular health (RouxBuisson2012Absence; Vecchi2021Generation; SarquellaBrugada2021Pediatric).

## Structure
The TRDN gene encodes the triadin protein, which is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a single transmembrane domain, a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and a long C-terminal luminal domain. This structure allows triadin to form multimers and interact with key proteins such as calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) within the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) of skeletal muscle triads (Thevenon2003Human; Sébastien2020Dynamics).

Triadin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing of the TRDN gene. The major isoforms in humans are Trisk 51 and Trisk 95, with Trisk 51 being the predominant form in human skeletal muscle. Trisk 51 is shorter, consisting of 461 amino acids, while Trisk 95 has 729 amino acids. The two isoforms share a similar sequence up to exon 21, after which Trisk 51 has a unique C-terminal end (Thevenon2003Human).

The transmembrane domain of triadin is crucial for its localization and retention in the jSR, suggesting that specific interactions with lipids or other proteins in the jSR membrane are important for its function (Sébastien2020Dynamics).

## Function
The TRDN gene encodes the triadin protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium release in muscle cells, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Triadin is a component of the calcium release complex (CRC) located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of these cells. It interacts with the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and calsequestrin (CSQ), facilitating excitation-contraction coupling, which is essential for muscle contraction (RouxBuisson2012Absence; Rabbani2021Novel).

In cardiac muscle cells, triadin is involved in anchoring calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor at the terminal cisternae of the SR, which is vital for calcium release during cardiac muscle contraction (RouxBuisson2012Absence). This interaction ensures proper calcium fluxes, which are critical for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and muscle function (Rabbani2021Novel).

Triadin is expressed as different isoforms due to alternative splicing of the TRDN gene. The cardiac-specific isoform, Trisk 32, is primarily expressed in cardiac muscle, while other isoforms are found in skeletal muscle (Vecchi2021Generation). The proper functioning of triadin is essential for maintaining the structure of the CRC, which is crucial for normal cardiac rhythm and muscle contraction (Vecchi2021Generation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRDN gene, which encodes the triadin protein, are associated with several severe cardiac conditions. Triadin KnockOut Syndrome (TKOS) is a notable disorder resulting from TRDN mutations, characterized by malignant arrhythmias, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) (Vecchi2021Generation; SarquellaBrugada2021Pediatric). TKOS often presents with aggressive arrhythmogenic phenotypes such as T-wave inversion, transient QT prolongation, and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in pediatric populations (SarquellaBrugada2021Pediatric).

Long QT syndrome type 17 (LQT17), also known as TKOS, is linked to TRDN mutations and is characterized by a poor prognosis, with exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in children aged 0-3 years (MartínezBarrios2022Clinical). Patients with LQT17 often exhibit negative T waves on an electrocardiogram and may experience seizures and neurodevelopmental delays (MartínezBarrios2022Clinical).

The absence or malfunction of triadin due to TRDN mutations can lead to impaired calcium release in cardiac cells, contributing to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (RouxBuisson2012Absence). These mutations can also result in skeletal muscle weakness, indicating a broader impact beyond cardiac symptoms (Altmann2015HomozygousCompound).

## Interactions
Triadin (TRDN) is a key component of the calcium release complex in muscle cells, where it interacts with several proteins to facilitate calcium ion release necessary for muscle contraction. Triadin primarily interacts with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin (CASQ), and junctin within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells. It plays a crucial role in anchoring CASQ to the junctional SR (jSR) membrane, forming a complex that is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the jSR and regulating calcium homeostasis (Boncompagni2012TriadinJunctin).

Triadin forms disulfide-linked oligomers, which are important for its function in anchoring CASQ, while junctin remains monomeric. This oligomerization is crucial for the structural organization of the jSR and the retention of CASQ within the SR (Boncompagni2012TriadinJunctin). Triadin also modulates the function of RyR1 channels, potentially through its interaction with FKBP12, a protein that stabilizes the RyR1 complex (Boncompagni2012TriadinJunctin).

In cardiac muscle, triadin interacts with RyR2 and calsequestrin 2 (CSQ2), playing a role in calcium release and contributing to the regulation of cardiac rhythm. Mutations in the TRDN gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (RouxBuisson2012Absence).
