# SMURF1

## Overview
SMURF1 is a gene that encodes the SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a C2 domain, two WW domains, and a catalytic HECT domain, each contributing to its function in protein ubiquitination and degradation (Xie2013Deubiquitinase; Cao2012A). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, SMURF1 plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways, which are essential for cell growth and differentiation (Cao2012A). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cao2012A). SMURF1's dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Murakami2010Smurf1; Xia2020SMURF1).

## Structure
SMURF1 is a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a modular architecture comprising a C2 domain, two WW domains, and a catalytic HECT domain (Xie2013Deubiquitinase; Cao2012A). The C2 domain is located at the N-terminus and is involved in membrane association and trafficking, playing a crucial role in substrate selection and cellular localization (Tian2011Binding; Lu2011Pivotal). It exhibits a typical anti-parallel β-sandwich fold and contains key lysine residues important for its function (Lu2011Pivotal).

The WW domains, which contain conserved tryptophan residues, facilitate protein-protein interactions by recognizing specific motifs on substrates or adaptors (Koganti2018Smurfs; Sangadala2007Modeling). The WW2 domain, in particular, interacts with proline-rich sequences, contributing to the structural rigidity and surface complementarity necessary for binding (Sangadala2007Modeling).

The HECT domain, located at the C-terminal, is essential for the ubiquitin ligase activity of SMURF1, enabling the transfer of ubiquitin onto substrates (Xie2013Deubiquitinase; Cao2012A). The active site of the HECT domain includes a critical cysteine residue, Cys699, which forms a thioester bond with ubiquitin (Cao2012A).

SMURF1 has multiple splice variants, which may influence its function and interactions (Koganti2018Smurfs). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate its activity, affecting its role in various cellular processes (Cao2012A).

## Function
SMURF1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a significant role in various cellular processes by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. In healthy human cells, SMURF1 is involved in regulating the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell growth, differentiation, and homeostasis (Cao2012A). SMURF1 targets several substrates, including MEKK2, JunB, and RunX2, for degradation, thereby modulating osteoblast activity and bone homeostasis (Zhao2010Smurf1; Yamashita2005Ubiquitin).

SMURF1 also regulates integrin activation by controlling the ubiquitination and degradation of Kindlin-2, a coactivator of integrins. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular adhesion and migration, impacting processes such as cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (Wei2017Smurf1). In the context of immune responses, SMURF1 modulates signaling pathways by targeting members of the TRAF family and MyD88 for degradation (Cao2012A).

SMURF1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with various proteins to maintain cellular and physiological balance. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, which can enhance or inhibit its E3 ligase function (Cao2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SMURF1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In cancer, SMURF1 is often overexpressed and acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. It facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances tumor cell self-renewal and drug resistance. SMURF1's role in cancer is supported by its interactions with proteins like RHOA and TRIB2, which are involved in tumorigenesis (Xia2020SMURF1). 

In PAH, SMURF1 negatively regulates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis. Increased SMURF1 expression leads to the downregulation of BMP receptors, which is associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Genetic ablation of SMURF1 in mice has shown protective effects against PAH, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Murakami2010Smurf1; Rothman2016MicroRNA1405p).

SMURF1 is also linked to bone disorders. A case study involving a microduplication of the SMURF1 gene in a patient with osteoporosis and B-cell lymphoma suggests that SMURF1 may play a role in bone fragility by suppressing osteogenic differentiation (AlRawi2020Fragile).

## Interactions
SMURF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with hPEM-2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42, enhancing its polyubiquitination and degradation through a direct interaction that does not require the PPXY motif (Yamaguchi2008Smurf1). SMURF1 also interacts with Kindlin-2, promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is mediated by the WW2 domain of SMURF1 and the PY motif in Kindlin-2, which is crucial for integrin activation (Wei2017Smurf1).

The C2 domain of SMURF1 is essential for its interaction with RhoA, a process important for regulating cell polarity and protrusive activity. This interaction does not involve the PY motif, highlighting the domain's role in substrate selection (Tian2011Binding). SMURF1 also binds to PIPKIγi2 at the plasma membrane, with the C2 domain being crucial for this interaction, leading to PIPKIγi2 ubiquitination and degradation (Li2017Smurf1).

Additionally, SMURF1 interacts with Axin, affecting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is facilitated by the C2 domain and is independent of the canonical WW-PY motif interaction (Fei2014Smurf1mediated).
