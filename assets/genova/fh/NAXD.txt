# NAXD

## Overview
NAXD is a gene that encodes the enzyme NAD(P)HX dehydratase, which is crucial for the maintenance of cellular metabolic balance. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydratase and is involved in the repair of damaged nicotinamide nucleotide cofactors, specifically NAD(P)HX, within human cells. By converting S-NAD(P)HX back to its functional form, NAD(P)H, in an ATP-dependent manner, NAD(P)HX dehydratase plays a vital role in detoxifying metabolic side-products and preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites that can disrupt cellular processes (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3; Van2020Reply: page 0 of 1). The enzyme operates in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, underscoring its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and supporting cellular health, particularly in energy-demanding tissues such as the brain (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3). Deficiencies in the NAXD gene can lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded enzyme (Van2020Reply:).

## Function
NAXD (NAD(P)HX dehydratase) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the repair of damaged nicotinamide nucleotide cofactors, specifically NAD(P)HX, in human cells. This enzyme is part of a metabolite repair system that detoxifies metabolic side-products, preventing the accumulation of toxic forms of NAD(P)H that cannot function as electron carriers and inhibit key metabolic dehydrogenases (Van2020Reply:). NAXD specifically converts S-NAD(P)HX back to NAD(P)H in an ATP-dependent manner, thus maintaining the functionality of these essential cofactors in cellular metabolism (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3; Van2013Metabolite page 1 of 3).

The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, contributing to metabolic homeostasis and overall cellular health (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3). The proper functioning of NAXD is crucial for sustaining life, particularly in energy-demanding tissues like the brain, where it helps prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolites that can lead to neurodegeneration (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3). Deficiencies in NAXD can result in severe neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by episodes of neurological regression triggered by acute illnesses, often resulting in premature death (Van2020Reply:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAXD gene, which encodes the enzyme NAD(P)HX dehydratase, are associated with a novel neurodegenerative disorder characterized by fever-induced neurological deterioration and early childhood mortality. This condition is exacerbated by febrile illnesses and is linked to the accumulation of damaged nicotinamide nucleotide cofactors, specifically NAD(P)HX, due to impaired repair mechanisms (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3; Borna2020NAD(P)HX page 0 of 2). Patients with NAXD mutations often present with severe multisystem diseases, including neurodegeneration, cardiac failure, and myopathy, which can lead to sudden death following acute illnesses such as gastroenteritis (Borna2020NAD(P)HX page 0 of 2; Borna2020NAD(P)HX page 1 of 2).

The disorder is inherited in a recessive manner, with affected individuals typically having biallelic mutations in the NAXD gene. These mutations result in a loss of protein expression and impaired mitochondrial function, particularly affecting complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation system (Borna2020NAD(P)HX page 1 of 2; Van2018NAD(P)HX page 2 of 3). Clinical features include episodes of regression, skin lesions, and movement abnormalities, often triggered by mild fever or infection (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 1 of 3; Zhou2019NAD(P)HX page 0 of 1). High-dose vitamin B3 therapy has shown potential benefits in stabilizing neurological symptoms and improving skin lesions in some cases (Zhou2019NAD(P)HX page 0 of 1).
