# ZBP1

## Overview
ZBP1, or Z-DNA binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune response, particularly in recognizing and binding to Z-DNA and Z-RNA structures. The protein, categorized as a DNA-binding protein, plays a critical role in the innate immune system by acting as a cytosolic sensor for these nucleic acids, which are often associated with viral infections. Through its Zα and Zβ domains, ZBP1 can detect viral DNA and RNA, triggering signaling pathways that lead to the production of type I interferons and other cytokines, thereby initiating an immune response (Bartas2022Searching; Chiang2021The). Additionally, ZBP1 is implicated in the regulation of cell death pathways, such as necroptosis, and is involved in mRNA localization and stability, which are essential for cellular functions like motility and polarity (Farina2002Two; Muendlein2021ZBP1). The gene's expression and function are significant in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, viral infections, and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chen2022ZBP1Mediated; Körner2023ZBP1).

## Structure
ZBP1, also known as Z-DNA binding protein 1, is characterized by its ability to bind Z-DNA through its two Z-DNA binding domains (ZBDs), Zα and Zβ. These domains are located at the N-terminus of the protein and are crucial for its role in the immune response (Ha2006Biochemical). The Zα domain of ZBP1 has been structurally characterized using NMR spectroscopy, revealing a winged helix-turn-helix fold, which is a common motif in DNA-binding proteins (Yang2014Solution). The Zβ domain, on the other hand, exhibits an unusual binding mode to Z-DNA, involving a kinked recognition helix and a positively charged residue in the β1 strand, which is distinct from other Z-DNA binding proteins (Ha2008The).

The protein's tertiary structure includes a hydrophobic core formed by three helices and three β-strands, contributing to its stability and DNA-binding capability (Yang2014Solution). ZBP1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Kim2011Solution). The presence of splice variant isoforms suggests functional diversity, with the Zβ domain being present in nearly all variants, indicating its significant role in Z-DNA recognition and immune activation (Ha2008The).

## Function
Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells, primarily related to immune response and inflammation. ZBP1 contains Zα domains that recognize and bind to left-handed Z-DNA and Z-RNA structures, acting as a cytosolic sensor for these nucleic acids (Chiang2021The; Bartas2022Searching). This binding capability allows ZBP1 to participate in the innate immune response by detecting viral infections and initiating signaling pathways that lead to the production of type I interferons and other cytokines (Chiang2021The).

In the context of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, ZBP1 plays a crucial role in linking oxidative stress to inflammation. It binds to oxidatively damaged mtDNA, activating the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathway, which results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (Szczesny2018Mitochondrial). This process is significant in epithelial cells, where ZBP1-mediated signaling can contribute to chronic inflammation, particularly in pulmonary diseases (Szczesny2018Mitochondrial). ZBP1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it can trigger these immune and inflammatory responses (Chiang2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZBP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and inflammatory conditions. ZBP1 is a key regulator of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, and its dysregulation can lead to inflammatory skin diseases. In RIPK1-deficient mice, increased ZBP1 expression leads to MLKL-dependent necroptosis, causing skin inflammation (Devos2020Sensing). ZBP1's role in sensing endogenous nucleic acids and triggering necroptosis is also linked to skin and intestinal inflammation, as seen in models with specific genetic modifications (Körner2023ZBP1).

ZBP1 is involved in the pathogenesis of viral infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), where it modulates cell death and inflammation. Its absence can lead to increased viral replication and delayed recovery, highlighting its complex role in infection outcomes (Kuriakose2018ZBP1:; Maelfait2017Sensing). ZBP1 also contributes to chronic airway inflammation by binding to damaged mitochondrial DNA, inducing inflammatory responses (Chen2022ZBP1Mediated).

In cancer, ZBP1-mediated necroptosis can influence tumor progression and metastasis, potentially affecting the efficacy of treatments like radiotherapy (Chen2022ZBP1Mediated). Understanding ZBP1's mechanisms in these pathologies is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ZBP1 (Z-DNA binding protein 1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune responses and cell death pathways. ZBP1 interacts with receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) through RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)-mediated interactions. This interaction is crucial for promoting LPS-induced cell death and IL-1β release, forming a complex known as the TRIFosome, which is essential for inflammasome activation (Muendlein2021ZBP1). ZBP1 also interacts with RIPK3, facilitating the assembly of the PANoptosome complex, which drives pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, particularly in response to viral infections like influenza A virus (Koehler2020Recognizing; Banoth2020ZBP1).

In addition to its role in immune signaling, ZBP1 is involved in mRNA localization and stability. It binds to the zipcode of β-actin mRNA through its KH domains, facilitating mRNA transport and localization to the cell periphery, which is crucial for cell motility and polarity (Farina2002Two). ZBP1 is also a component of stress granules, where it stabilizes mRNAs during cellular stress, preventing their decay (Stöhr2006ZBP1).
