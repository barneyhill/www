# SLIRP

## Overview
The SLIRP gene encodes the SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitochondrial mRNA stability and translation. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM), which facilitates its interaction with RNA molecules. SLIRP is primarily localized in mitochondria, where it forms a complex with the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), essential for maintaining mitochondrial mRNA homeostasis and efficient translation (Sasarman2010LRPPRC; Singh2024Structural). Beyond its mitochondrial functions, SLIRP also interacts with nuclear receptors, acting as a corepressor in androgen receptor signaling pathways (De2019Interaction). Mutations in the SLIRP gene have been linked to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial disorders (Guo2021Pathogenic).

## Structure
SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein) is a 109 amino acid protein that is well conserved across species and primarily localized in mitochondria, as indicated by its amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) (Colley2011Steroid). The core region of SLIRP contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is crucial for its RNA-binding capability. This motif includes submotifs RNP1 and RNP2, with specific residues such as R24, R25, and L62 positioned to interact with mRNA, highlighting its role in mRNA binding (Singh2024Structural).

SLIRP forms a stable complex with LRPPRC, a leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, which is essential for its function in mitochondrial mRNA stability and translation (Sasarman2010LRPPRC). This interaction is facilitated by the structural arrangement of SLIRP, which contributes to the formation of a corridor for mRNA handoff to the mitoribosome (Singh2024Structural). Despite its RNA-binding properties, SLIRP does not show direct affinity for mitochondrial mRNAs in certain experimental conditions, suggesting that its interaction with LRPPRC may be necessary for its function (Baleva2023Mitochondrial). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in mitochondrial translation regulation and mRNA homeostasis.

## Function
SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein) is a versatile protein primarily localized in mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial mRNA stability and translation. It interacts with the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC) to form a complex that stabilizes mitochondrial mRNAs, preventing their degradation and promoting polyadenylation and translation (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP; Li2019SLIRP). This complex is essential for the proper association of mRNAs with the mitochondrial ribosome, facilitating efficient translation and impacting mitochondrial protein synthesis rates (Lagouge2015SLIRP).

SLIRP also acts as a global RNA chaperone, stabilizing RNA structures to facilitate necessary processes like stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation (Li2019SLIRP). It is involved in the regulation of 2′-O-methylation of rRNA, which is crucial for protein translation (Li2019SLIRP). The protein's role extends to the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, contributing to cellular energy production and homeostasis (Sasarman2010LRPPRC). Despite its significant role in mitochondrial function, SLIRP is not essential for survival, as evidenced by studies in knockout mice (Lagouge2015SLIRP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLIRP gene have been identified as a novel cause of autosomal recessive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, characterized by deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I and IV. In a study involving a Dutch patient, two compound heterozygous variants in SLIRP were found to significantly reduce functional SLIRP RNA, leading to decreased expression of mitochondrial genes such as MT-ND1, MT-ND6, and MT-CO1. This reduction in gene expression resulted in impaired mitochondrial function, which was partially restored by introducing wild-type SLIRP cDNA, confirming the pathogenicity of these variants (Guo2021Pathogenic).

Alterations in SLIRP expression levels have also been implicated in autoimmune diseases. SLIRP expression is elevated in patients with conditions like Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. This upregulation is associated with the amplification of antiviral signaling and interferon responses, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Ku2024SLIRP).

In prostate cancer, SLIRP acts as a corepressor of androgen receptor signaling. Loss of SLIRP expression is associated with increased expression of androgen-regulated genes, potentially promoting cancer progression (De2019Interaction).

## Interactions
SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in both nuclear receptor activity and mitochondrial RNA processing. SLIRP interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), where it acts as a corepressor of AR signaling. This interaction is modulated by the Ack1 tyrosine kinase and androgen, with SLIRP's association with AR being disrupted by Ack1 activation or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment (De2019Interaction). SLIRP also interacts with the steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), serving as a scaffold for the AR-SLIRP interaction. Knockdown of SRA disrupts this interaction, similar to the effects of Ack1 or DHT (De2019Interaction).

In mitochondria, SLIRP forms a complex with LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein), which is crucial for the stability and regulation of mitochondrial mRNA. This complex is involved in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, and SLIRP's absence leads to decreased mitochondrial mRNA levels (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP; Sasarman2010LRPPRC). SLIRP also interacts with bcl-2, a protein known for its role in preventing apoptosis. This interaction is mediated by the BH4 domain of bcl-2 and is involved in maintaining mitochondrial mRNA homeostasis (D’Aguanno2016Affinity).
