# DDX47

## Overview
DDX47 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 47, a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. This protein functions as an RNA helicase, playing a critical role in RNA metabolism, particularly in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly within the nucleolus (Abdelhaleem2003The; Wang2022DEADBox). The DEAD-box helicase 47 is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA unwinding, which is essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Linder2011From). It is also a component of the small subunit processome (SSUP) complex, influencing ribosome biogenesis and global translation regulation (Wang2022DEADBox). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids suggest its involvement in apoptosis and potential roles in viral life cycles, such as that of HIV-1 (Rao2022DEADly; welsch2010identification). Mutations in the DDX47 gene have been linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Järvelä2021Exome).

## Structure
DDX47 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is crucial for its function as an RNA helicase. The primary structure of DDX47 includes conserved motifs essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis, typical of DEAD-box proteins (Zhang2021DEAD-Box; Linder2011From). These motifs are organized into two RecA-like domains: RecA domain 1 contains ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs, while RecA domain 2 includes RNA-binding motifs (Zhang2021DEAD-Box).

The secondary structure of DDX47 likely features α-helices and β-sheets, forming a helicase core domain, which is a common characteristic of DEAD-box proteins (Linder2011From). The tertiary structure involves the helicase core, which facilitates the protein's function in RNA metabolism by enabling ATP-dependent RNA unwinding (Linder2011From).

DDX47 may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Dupas2021Predicting). Splice variants of DDX47 could lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions within the cell (Dupas2021Predicting).

## Function
DDX47 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, which is involved in various RNA metabolic processes. In healthy human cells, DDX47 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly. This activity is essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Abdelhaleem2003The; Wang2022DEADBox). The protein is part of the small subunit processome (SSUP) complex, which influences ribosome biogenesis and global translation regulation in pluripotent cells (Wang2022DEADBox).

Although specific functions of DDX47 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, studies on its orthologs in other species, such as the locust Locusta migratoria, suggest that DDX47 may be involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through mechanisms like rRNA synthesis and post-translational modifications, including acetylation and crotonylation (Wang2022DEADBox). These processes are crucial for various cellular functions, indicating that DDX47 could have similar roles in humans, potentially impacting intestinal development and homeostasis (Wang2022DEADBox).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDX47 gene have been implicated in severe neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly when de novo variants are present. A study identified de novo variants in DDX47 in a case characterized by profound intellectual disability, lack of speech, hypnic jerks, and non-ambulatory status from seven years of age. This suggests an alternate inheritance model compared to previously reported autosomal recessive variants in DDX47, highlighting its potential role in severe neurodevelopmental disorders (Järvelä2021Exome).

DDX47 is part of the DDX/DHX family of RNA helicases, which have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The severe clinical phenotype associated with these genes often presents at birth and resembles previously documented cases. Most published variants in the DExD/H-box RNA helicase genes, including DDX47, are de novo. The impact of these variants on protein function is suggested to be related to the loss-of-function tolerance, with autosomal dominant variants potentially having a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect (Järvelä2021Exome).

Additionally, DDX47 has been identified as an interaction partner of GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) in cortical neurons, and its co-transfection with GABARAP cDNA in a tumor cell line was shown to induce apoptosis, suggesting a role in apoptosis signaling pathways (welsch2010identification).

## Interactions
DDX47, a DEAD-box helicase, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis. It is localized to the nucleolus and is a component of the small subunit processome (SSUP) complex, which is crucial for pre-ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Wang2022DEADBox). DDX47 interacts with the GABA A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), and this interaction has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation in a tumor cell line (Wang2022DEADBox; welsch2010identification).

In the context of HIV-1, DDX47 has been identified as a protein that co-immunoprecipitated with the HIV-1 Rev protein, suggesting a potential role in the export of unspliced and spliced viral RNA (vRNA). This interaction indicates that DDX47 may be involved in the HIV-1 life cycle, particularly affecting the release of the virus rather than its initial replication or protein expression (Naji2012Host; Rao2022DEADly). However, the exact nature of this interaction and its impact on HIV-1 replication remains to be fully characterized (Rao2022DEADly).
