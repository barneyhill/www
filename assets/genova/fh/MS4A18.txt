# MS4A18

## Overview
MS4A18 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane spanning 4-domains A18, which is part of the MS4A family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their four transmembrane domains, which suggest a role in cellular signaling or transport processes. The MS4A family is known for its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune response and cancer progression. While the specific function of MS4A18 remains to be fully elucidated, its structural features imply potential roles in membrane-associated activities, possibly influencing cellular communication or interaction with the extracellular environment. Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological functions and clinical implications of MS4A18 (Qiu2020aarFDC).
