protocadherin subclass of the cadherin superfamily.

Mutations in this gene on human chromosome X are associated with sporadic infantile epileptic encephalopathy and to a female-restricted form of epilepsy (EFMR; also known as PCDH19RE). Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
