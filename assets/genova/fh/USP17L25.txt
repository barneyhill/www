# USP17L25

## Overview
USP17L25 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 25, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L25 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
