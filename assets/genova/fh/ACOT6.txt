# ACOT6

## Overview
ACOT6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 6, which is part of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase family. This enzyme is characterized by its role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH) (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The ACOT6 protein is distinguished by its C-terminal esterase-lipase superfamily domain, which includes a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Brocker2010Evolutionary). Unlike other members of its family, ACOT6 lacks the N-terminal acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase domain, resulting in a truncated protein (Brocker2010Evolutionary). In humans, ACOT6 is predicted to be cytosolic due to a missense mutation affecting its peroxisomal targeting signal, which differs from its mouse orthologue that is targeted to peroxisomes (Hunt2006Analysis). The enzyme's precise substrates and functions in human cells are not fully elucidated, but it is hypothesized to play a role in regulating intracellular acyl-CoA and free fatty acid levels, thereby influencing energy production and lipid signaling (Brocker2010Evolutionary).

## Structure
The ACOT6 protein is part of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase family and is characterized by a C-terminal esterase-lipase superfamily domain, known as the α/β-hydrolase fold, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Brocker2010Evolutionary). This domain includes a catalytic triad of conserved serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, essential for its enzymatic activity (Brocker2010Evolutionary). Unlike other type I ACOTs, ACOT6 lacks the N-terminal acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase domain, resulting in a truncated protein (Brocker2010Evolutionary).

ACOT6 is predicted to be cytosolic due to a missense mutation affecting the peroxisomal targeting signal, which contrasts with its mouse orthologue that is targeted to peroxisomes (Hunt2006Analysis). The human ACOT6 protein is translated from a methionine at the end of exon 2, resulting in a putative open reading frame of 207 amino acids (Hunt2006Analysis). Despite the absence of detailed information on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, the presence of the complete C-terminal esterase-lipase domain suggests that ACOT6 functions as an esterase (Brocker2010Evolutionary). There is no specific information available on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for ACOT6.

## Function
ACOT6 (acyl-CoA thioesterase 6) is involved in the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA thioesters, converting them into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH), which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. In humans, ACOT6 is predicted to be cytosolic due to a missense mutation that alters the peroxisomal targeting signal found in its mouse ortholog (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The human ACOT6 gene transcribes a shorter mRNA, resulting in a truncated protein that lacks the N-terminal acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase domain, yet retains residues necessary for catalysis, suggesting it remains an active acyl-CoA thioesterase (Brocker2010Evolutionary).

The specific substrates and detailed functions of ACOT6 in healthy human cells remain to be experimentally verified, but it is suggested that ACOT6 may play a role in regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids, impacting energy production and lipid signaling (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The protein's cytosolic localization in human skin fibroblasts suggests it may influence metabolic pathways and cellular energy homeostasis (Hunt2012The). Despite the lack of a peroxisomal targeting signal, the possibility of partial peroxisomal localization in some species remains open (Hunt2012The).
