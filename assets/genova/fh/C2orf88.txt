# C2orf88

## Overview
C2orf88 is a gene located on human chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 88. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those involving metabolic pathways related to oxidation and reduction, as suggested by its association with copper type II, ascorbate-dependent monooxygenase activity (Selvarajan2016Insilico). C2orf88 is involved in significant protein-protein interactions, notably with components of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, such as PRKAR1A and PRKACA, indicating its role in cellular signaling and regulatory processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein's interactions suggest potential involvement in cancer-related pathways, particularly in brain and testis tissues, and highlight its importance in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite its emerging significance, the precise clinical implications of C2orf88, especially in cancer prognosis and treatment, remain to be fully elucidated (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Function
C2orf88 is a gene located on human chromosome 2, encoding a protein that is involved in several cellular processes. In healthy human cells, C2orf88 is associated with the extracellular region and is involved in metabolic processes, particularly those related to oxidation and reduction. This is suggested by the presence of a domain related to copper type II, ascorbate-dependent monooxygenase activity, indicating a potential role in metabolic pathways involving oxidation and reduction reactions (Selvarajan2016Insilico).

The protein partners of C2orf88 are linked to post-translational modifications mediated through protein kinase A, as well as important cellular functions such as ciliary motility. This suggests that C2orf88 may play a role in these processes, contributing to the regulation of cellular activities and signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C2orf88 interacts with PRKAR1A in brain tissue and PRKACA in testis tissue, which are involved in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and phosphorylation processes, respectively. These interactions may be tissue-specific, indicating that C2orf88 could have diverse roles depending on the cellular context (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C2orf88 has been implicated in cancer through its interactions with known protein partners. It interacts with PRKAR1A in brain tissue and is involved in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). The interaction between C2orf88 and PRKACA, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, is highlighted as a cancer-dependent protein-protein interaction, suggesting a role in cancer through pathways related to phosphorylation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). 

C2orf88 is also identified as a secreted protein in human blood plasma or urine samples, indicating potential as a novel molecular entity in the 'liquid biopsy' paradigm for cancer detection. However, its specific diagnostic significance in cancer remains unexplored (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein partners of C2orf88 are related to post-translational modifications mediated through protein kinase A, which are important for cellular functions such as ciliary motility (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite these findings, the clinical significance of C2orf88 in terms of prognosis or treatment in cancers is not yet detailed, and its specific roles in cancer-associated signaling pathways remain unknown (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Interactions
C2orf88, a protein encoded by the gene located on chromosome 2, has been implicated in various protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer. In brain tissue, C2orf88 interacts with PRKAR1A, a subunit of protein kinase A, suggesting a role in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). In testis tissue, C2orf88 is associated with FBXW8, GPR161, and PRKACA, indicating its involvement in the regulation of Shh signaling and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, which are crucial in testicular germ cell tumors (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The protein is also part of an interaction network with PRKAR1A and PRKCA, both of which are involved in regulating cortisol secretion, potentially influencing inflammatory pathways and the HPA axis in breast cancer patients experiencing fatigue (Flowers2019A). Although specific physical interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed, the protein's involvement in these networks suggests a significant role in cellular signaling and regulatory processes. The interactions of C2orf88 with these proteins highlight its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways and its importance in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
