# CBLN3

## Overview
CBLN3 is a gene that encodes the cerebellin 3 precursor protein, a member of the precerebellin family, which plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly within the cerebellum. The cerebellin 3 precursor is involved in synaptic organization and function, primarily through its ability to form heteromeric complexes with other cerebellin family members, such as CBLN1. These complexes are crucial for maintaining synaptic integrity and function, as CBLN3 relies on interactions with CBLN1 for proper secretion and trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein contains a C1q signature domain, which is essential for the assembly of trimeric complexes that facilitate synaptic recruitment and anchoring at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. The inability of CBLN3 to form homomeric complexes due to a charged arginine residue highlights its dependency on other cerebellin proteins for secretion and function, underscoring its role in synaptic plasticity and organization (Yuzaki2009New; Pang2000Cbln3; Bao2006Cbln1).

## Function
CBLN3, a member of the precerebellin family, plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function within the central nervous system, particularly in the cerebellum. It is involved in forming heteromeric complexes with CBLN1, which are essential for synaptic integrity and function. CBLN3 is co-expressed with CBLN1 in cerebellar granule cells and requires this interaction for proper secretion and trafficking. This interaction is vital for maintaining synaptic structure and function, as CBLN3 is not secreted independently but relies on CBLN1 for its export from the endoplasmic reticulum (Larsen2021The; Bao2006Cbln1).

The protein contains a C1q signature domain, which is important for the assembly of trimeric complexes, potentially involving other precerebellin family members. This domain facilitates the formation of heteromeric complexes that are crucial for synaptic recruitment and anchoring at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (Pang2000Cbln3; miura2009cbln1). CBLN3's function is closely tied to its interactions with other proteins in the CBLN family, and its secretion is contingent upon these interactions, highlighting its role in synaptic plasticity and organization (Yuzaki2009New).

## Interactions
CBLN3 interacts with other members of the cerebellin family, particularly Cbln1, to form heteromeric complexes. Cbln3 cannot form homomeric complexes due to the presence of a charged arginine residue (Arg119) in its C1q domain, which causes electrostatic repulsion and prevents self-association (Bao2006Cbln1). This interaction with Cbln1 is crucial for Cbln3's secretion, as Cbln3 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unless it is bound to Cbln1. In cbln1-null mice, Cbln3 is absent, indicating that Cbln1 is necessary for Cbln3 to exit the ER and be secreted (Bao2006Cbln1; miura2009cbln1).

Cbln3's secretion can also be rescued by Cbln4, another member of the cerebellin family, suggesting that Cbln3 can form functional complexes with Cbln4 as well (Bao2006Cbln1). The interaction between Cbln1 and Cbln3 is described as a "hide-and-run" mechanism, where Cbln1 masks the steric clash caused by Arg119 in Cbln3, allowing it to be secreted (Bao2006Cbln1). These interactions are essential for the synaptic integrity and function in the cerebellum, as Cbln1 and Cbln3 are co-expressed in cerebellar granule cells and contribute to synaptic structure and function (miura2009cbln1).
