# OR4A5

## Overview
The OR4A5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily A member 5, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific ligands and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, OR4A5 spans the cell membrane and interacts with extracellular odorant molecules, triggering intracellular responses through G-protein activation. The olfactory receptors, including OR4A5, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs (Qiu2020aarFDC).
