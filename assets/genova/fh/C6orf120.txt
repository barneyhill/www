# C6orf120

## Overview
C6orf120 is a gene located on chromosome 6 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 120. This protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, and its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes, including potential roles in cell signaling and regulation. The expression of C6orf120 has been observed in multiple tissues, suggesting a broad functional significance across different biological systems. Research into the gene and its encoded protein continues to uncover its involvement in health and disease, with particular interest in its potential interactions and pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
