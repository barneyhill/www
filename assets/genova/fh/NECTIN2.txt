# NECTIN2

## Overview
NECTIN2, also known as CD112, is a gene that encodes the nectin cell adhesion molecule 2, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is a single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell adhesion, playing a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions and tight junctions. Nectin cell adhesion molecule 2 is characterized by its extracellular region, which comprises three immunoglobulin-like domains, facilitating both homophilic and heterophilic interactions essential for cellular communication and tissue integrity (Samanta2012Structure; Miyoshi2007Nectin). Beyond its structural functions, nectin cell adhesion molecule 2 is implicated in immune modulation, interacting with immune cell receptors such as CD226 and TIGIT, thereby influencing immune responses and potentially contributing to tumor immunosurveillance (Takai2008Nectins; Deuss2017Recognition). The gene's expression is notably altered in various cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Li2018Elevated; Klekowski2023Clinical).

## Structure
NECTIN2, also known as CD112, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell-cell adhesion. The protein is a single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains: an N-terminal variable-type Ig (IgV) domain and two constant-type Ig (IgC) domains (Samanta2012Structure; Miyoshi2007Nectin). The IgV domain of NECTIN2 forms a dimer in solution, characterized by a two-layer β-sandwich topology typical of IgV structures (Samanta2012Structure). A unique structural feature of NECTIN2 is a long loop between the D and E strands, which is absent in other nectins (Samanta2012Structure).

The quaternary structure of NECTIN2 involves both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. The homophilic dimer interface is formed by the orthogonal association of C, C′, C′′, and F strands, resulting in a 'kinked' dimer (Samanta2012Structure). The presence of charged residues, such as glutamic acid at position 141, influences the binding affinities at the dimer interface (Samanta2012Structure). NECTIN2 can also form heterophilic interactions with other proteins, such as NECTIN3 and N-cadherin, which are generally stronger than homophilic interactions (Duraivelan2018Molecular; Miyoshi2007Nectin).

## Function
NECTIN2, also known as CD112, is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions, which are essential for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular communication. It is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, contributing to cell-cell adhesion in various tissues (Takai2008The; Samanta2012Structure).

NECTIN2 interacts with afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is vital for the organization of adherens junctions and the recruitment of other cell adhesion molecules like cadherins, which are important for the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Mizoguchi2002Nectin; Miyoshi2007Nectin). NECTIN2 is also involved in the formation of tight junctions by recruiting proteins such as JAM-A, claudin-1, and occludin (Miyoshi2007Nectin).

In addition to its structural roles, NECTIN2 is implicated in immune modulation. It interacts with CD226 on natural killer cells, enhancing their ability to lyse target cells, which suggests a role in immunosurveillance and tumor cell elimination (Takai2008Nectins). NECTIN2 is also involved in host-pathogen interactions, serving as a receptor for certain viruses (Takai2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NECTIN2 gene, also known as CD112, have been implicated in various cancers. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), NECTIN2 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor differentiation. This overexpression promotes cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in aggressive tumor behavior (Li2018Elevated). In colorectal cancer, elevated serum levels of NECTIN2 are associated with worse progression-free survival in non-metastatic patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Karabulut2015Serum). 

In ovarian cancer, NECTIN2 is upregulated in tumors with lymph node metastasis and residual tumors post-surgery. Its expression is modulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), affecting endothelial permeability and potentially facilitating metastasis (Bekes2019Nectin‐2). NECTIN2 is also overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it serves as an independent prognostic factor for shorter overall survival (Klekowski2023Clinical). 

In lung cancer, NECTIN2 shows high sensitivity and specificity as a biomarker, although its prognostic value remains undetermined (Erturk2019Serum). These findings highlight NECTIN2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NECTIN2, also known as CD112, is a cell adhesion molecule that participates in various interactions crucial for cell-cell adhesion and immune responses. It forms both homophilic and heterophilic interactions with other nectins, such as NECTIN1 and NECTIN3, which are essential for its role in adherens junctions (Ebnet2008Organization; Samanta2012Structure). NECTIN2 interacts with the scaffolding protein afadin, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton, which is important for the clustering of nectin at cell-cell contact sites (Miyahara2000Interaction).

In the immune system, NECTIN2 serves as a ligand for the DNAM-1 (CD226) activating molecule on natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, enhancing NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Bottino2003Identification). It also interacts with the inhibitory receptor TIGIT on NK cells, where the binding involves a specific 'lock and key' motif, affecting immune cell interactions (Deuss2017Recognition). NECTIN2's interaction with TIGIT is characterized by a lower affinity compared to its interaction with NECL-5, another ligand for TIGIT (Deuss2017Recognition).

These interactions highlight NECTIN2's role in both cell adhesion and immune regulation, making it a significant molecule in cellular communication and immune response processes.
