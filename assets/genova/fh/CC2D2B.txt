# CC2D2B

## Overview
The CC2D2B gene encodes the protein coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 2B, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains and C2 domains, which are typically involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, suggesting a role in membrane-related functions. Although the specific biological functions of CC2D2B are not fully elucidated, proteins with similar domain structures are often implicated in intracellular signaling and structural organization within the cell. The CC2D2B protein may play a role in cellular pathways that are critical for maintaining normal cellular function and development. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions and pathways involving CC2D2B and its potential implications in human health and disease.
