# MYZAP

## Overview
MYZAP is a gene that encodes the myocardial zonula adherens protein, a crucial component of cardiac muscle cells, particularly at the intercalated discs. This protein is integral to cell-cell adhesion and the structural integrity of cardiac tissue, playing a significant role in the heart's contractile function and response to stress. MYZAP is characterized by an ERM-like domain, which facilitates its involvement in Rho-dependent signaling pathways and serum response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription, essential for muscle-specific gene expression and cardiac contractility (Seeger2010Myozap). The protein interacts with various cellular components, including desmoplakin and zonula occludens-1, linking the actin cytoskeleton to adherens and tight junctions, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of cardiac cells (Seeger2010Myozap). Mutations in the MYZAP gene have been associated with cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation and dilated cardiomyopathy, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining cardiac health (Thorolfsdottir2017Mutations; Maver2022A).

## Structure
The MYZAP protein, encoded by the MYZAP gene, is a 54 kDa protein primarily expressed in cardiac tissue, particularly at the intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes. It consists of 466 amino acids and contains an ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin)-like domain between amino acids 181 and 348, which is common in proteins that link the cell membrane and cytoskeleton (Seeger2010Myozap). This domain is crucial for its role in activating serum response factor (SRF)-dependent signaling, which is important for muscle-specific gene expression (Seeger2010Myozap).

MYZAP interacts with several proteins, including desmoplakin and zonula occludens-1, and is involved in Rho-dependent signaling pathways (Seeger2010Myozap). It binds to myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein (MRIP), which negatively regulates Rho activity, highlighting its role in cardiac signal transduction (Seeger2010Myozap). The protein is also found in adherens junctions in various epithelial tissues, where it colocalizes with proteins such as α- and β-catenin and ZO-1 (Rickelt2011Protein).

MYZAP has been identified in multiple tissue types, including the heart, lung, and skin, and is involved in maintaining cardiac structure and function (Abreu2020MYZAP). The presence of splice variants or post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context.

## Function
MYZAP, also known as myocardial zonula adherens protein, is a critical component of the intercalated discs in cardiac muscle cells, where it plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and the structural integrity of cardiac tissue. It is highly expressed in the myocardium and colocalizes with proteins such as N-cadherin, plakoglobin, and plakophilin-2, indicating its involvement in cell junctions (Seeger2010Myozap). MYZAP interacts with desmoplakin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), linking the actin cytoskeleton to adherens and tight junctions, which suggests its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cardiac cells (Seeger2010Myozap).

MYZAP is involved in Rho-dependent signaling pathways, particularly activating serum response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription, which is crucial for cardiac contractility and response to stress (Seeger2010Myozap). It interacts with myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein (MRIP), which negatively regulates Rho activity, adding complexity to the regulation of SRF signaling (Seeger2010Myozap). Knockdown studies in zebrafish have shown that MYZAP deficiency leads to severe contractile dysfunction, highlighting its essential role in maintaining cardiac function (Seeger2010Myozap). Additionally, MYZAP is expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells, where it may influence signaling pathways involving SRF and NF-κB, potentially affecting immune responses (1 page 15 of 18).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYZAP gene have been associated with several cardiac conditions, most notably atrial fibrillation (AF) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). A missense mutation, p.Gln254Pro, in MYZAP has been linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, with studies reporting an odds ratio of 1.37 to 1.38, indicating a significant association with this arrhythmia (Thorolfsdottir2017Mutations; Thorolfsdottir2018Coding). This mutation is also associated with sick sinus syndrome (SSS), with an odds ratio of 1.65, suggesting a 65% increased risk compared to non-carriers (Thorolfsdottir2018Coding).

In addition to arrhythmias, MYZAP mutations are implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy. A biallelic loss-of-function variant in MYZAP has been identified in a recessive form of severe DCM, characterized by significant contractile dysfunction and the need for heart transplantation in affected individuals (Maver2022A). This variant leads to a complete loss of functional MYZAP protein, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cardiac structure and function (Maver2022A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MYZAP in cardiac diseases, particularly those affecting the heart's electrical and mechanical functions.
