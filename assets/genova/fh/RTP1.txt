# RTP1

## Overview
RTP1 (receptor transporter protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport and functional expression of olfactory receptors (ORs), which are a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The RTP1 protein acts as an accessory protein, facilitating the trafficking of ORs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), a process essential for olfactory function (Inoue2023Identification; Fukutani2019The). RTP1 is known to form homodimers, which are crucial for its role in OR trafficking, and interacts with various proteins to assist in OR folding and stabilization (Inoue2023Identification; Fukutani2019The). Beyond its role in olfactory systems, RTP1 also interacts with ion channels and is involved in chemosensory signal transduction, as well as modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in plants, highlighting its diverse functional roles (Mast2010The; Qiang2021Susceptibility).

## Function
RTP1 (receptor transporter protein 1) plays a crucial role in the transport and functional expression of olfactory receptors (ORs), which are a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), to the plasma membrane in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). RTP1 acts as an accessory protein that facilitates the trafficking of ORs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, a process essential for the proper functioning of the olfactory system (Inoue2023Identification; Fukutani2019The). 

RTP1, along with its variant RTP1S, forms homodimers, which are necessary for its function in OR trafficking. The N-terminal region of RTP1S, particularly the second cysteine residue, is critical for dimerization and efficient OR transport (Fukutani2019The). RTP1S also interacts with other proteins, such as heat shock protein A6 (HSPA6) and Staufen homolog 2 (STAU2), which may assist in OR folding and stabilization, indicating a complex network of interactions required for OR trafficking (Inoue2023Identification).

In RTP1 and RTP2 double-knockout mice, most ORs are underrepresented, highlighting the necessity of RTP1 for the functional expression of these receptors, although some ORs can function without RTP1, suggesting alternative mechanisms for surface expression (Inoue2023Identification).

## Interactions
RTP1 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in the transport and functional expression of olfactory receptors (ORs). In the rat vomeronasal organ, RTP1 forms protein-protein interactions with the TRPC2 channel, enhancing its surface expression and modulating its activity. This interaction is crucial for chemosignal transduction, as RTP1 assists in the expression of TRPC2 in the microvillar membrane of vomeronasal sensory neurons (Mast2010The).

RTP1 also interacts with Homer proteins, forming a complex with TRPC2 and IP3R3, which may be involved in chemosensory signal transduction (Mast2010The). These interactions suggest that RTP1 is not limited to GPCRs but also associates with ion channels, contributing to its role in sensory functions (Mast2010The).

In plants, RTP1 is involved in modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway by interacting with ER membrane-associated transcription factors such as bZIP28. RTP1 stabilizes bZIP28, enhancing its protein accumulation, which is crucial for plant defense mechanisms against pathogens like Phytophthora parasitica (Qiang2021Susceptibility). RTP1 also influences the phosphorylation and stability of IRE1 proteins, although direct interactions with IRE1a or IRE1b were not detected (Qiang2021Susceptibility).
