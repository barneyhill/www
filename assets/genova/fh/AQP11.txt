# AQP11

## Overview
Aquaporin 11 (AQP11) is a gene that encodes the protein aquaporin 11, a member of the aquaporin family of transmembrane proteins. Unlike typical aquaporins, which primarily facilitate water transport, aquaporin 11 functions as a peroxiporin, mediating the transport of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, thereby playing a crucial role in cellular redox homeostasis and signaling (Bestetti2020Human). The protein is characterized by a unique structural motif, the NPC motif, which distinguishes it from other aquaporins that typically possess an NPA motif (Kreida2015Structural; Calvanese2013In). AQP11 is also involved in the transport of water and glycerol in human adipocytes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Madeira2014Human). Mutations in the AQP11 gene, such as Cys227Ser, have been linked to kidney-related diseases, highlighting its importance in renal function and development (Morishita2005Disruption; AtochinaVasserman2013Aquaporin).

## Structure
Aquaporin 11 (AQP11) is a unique member of the aquaporin family, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of AQP11 includes several unique amino acid residues, such as Gln106, Phe177, Tyr83, and Ile200, which are conserved within the AQP11 subfamily and contribute to its distinct electrostatic and steric properties (Calvanese2013In). AQP11 features a modified NPA motif, specifically an NPC motif, which is crucial for its function and differs from the typical NPA sequence found in other aquaporins (Kreida2015Structural; Calvanese2013In).

The secondary structure of AQP11 includes six transmembrane helices, typical of aquaporins, forming a narrow water-conducting channel (Kreida2015Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a specific three-dimensional shape, with aromatic residues like Tyr83 and Phe215 contributing to the narrowing of the pore (Calvanese2013In). AQP11 may form a quaternary structure as a tetramer, similar to other aquaporins, with oligomerization potentially affected by mutations such as Cys227Ser (AtochinaVasserman2013Aquaporin).

AQP11 is rich in cysteine residues, with Cys101 being part of the NPC motif and Cys58 and Cys155 lining the pore, which may influence its sensitivity to mercurial compounds (Calvanese2013In). The presence of these cysteines and their roles in oligomerization and function highlight the unique structural features of AQP11.

## Function
Aquaporin 11 (AQP11) is a unique member of the aquaporin family, primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. It functions as a peroxiporin, facilitating the transport of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) across the ER membrane. This transport is crucial for maintaining redox homeostasis and signaling within the cell, as H2O2 acts as an essential intracellular messenger (Bestetti2020Human). AQP11's role in H2O2 transport is particularly important in the context of oxidative protein folding, where it helps manage the oxidative environment of the ER, thereby influencing cellular signaling circuits and potentially interacting with redox-modulated phosphatases (Bestetti2020Human).

In addition to its role in redox balance, AQP11 also functions as a water and glycerol channel in human adipocytes, contributing to the regulation of cell volume and the transport of these molecules near lipid droplets (Madeira2014Human). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its absence can lead to severe physiological consequences, such as a lethal polycystic kidney-like disease in mice, highlighting its importance in kidney development and function (Ishibashi2009Aquaporin; Bestetti2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AQP11 gene have been linked to several kidney-related diseases and conditions. AQP11 insufficiency, particularly due to a Cys227Ser mutation, is associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress in the kidneys, leading to conditions such as hyperglycemia-induced kidney injury and diabetic kidney disease. This mutation results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased reactive oxygen species production, which contribute to proximal tubule injury (AtochinaVasserman2013Aquaporin).

AQP11-null mice exhibit polycystic kidney disease characterized by vacuolization and cyst formation in the proximal tubules. This condition is linked to defects in endosomal acidification and ER stress, which may lead to protein misfolding and accumulation, contributing to cystogenesis (Morishita2005Disruption). The absence of AQP11 also results in sustained ER stress and apoptosis via a caspase-12-mediated pathway, distinct from other forms of polycystic kidney disease (Okada2008Aquaporin‐11).

Temporal deletion of AQP11 in mice is associated with the severity of cyst-like disease, indicating its critical role in maintaining normal kidney morphology and function (Rützler2017Temporal). These findings suggest that AQP11 is essential for kidney health, and its dysfunction can lead to significant renal pathologies.
