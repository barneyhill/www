# ITGAE

## Overview
The ITGAE gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha E, a component of the integrin αEβ7 complex, which is a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on intraepithelial lymphocytes. This integrin plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance and mucosal immunity by mediating the retention of lymphocytes in epithelial tissues through its interaction with E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule (Shannon2021Natural). The αEβ7 integrin is involved in various immune functions, including the localization of T cells to epithelial tissues and the modulation of tissue-resident natural killer (trNK) cells' functional capacity (Shannon2021Natural). The expression of ITGAE is regulated by factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), particularly in CD8+ cells, highlighting its role in immune responses within tumor microenvironments (Hoffmann2021Integrin). Additionally, ITGAE has clinical significance in cancer, where its expression levels and genetic variants are associated with prognosis and susceptibility in various cancers, including ovarian and colorectal cancer (Wu2020Integrated; Hu2018ITGAE).

## Structure
The ITGAE gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha E, which forms part of the heterodimeric integrin αE(CD103)β7. The αE chain is composed of several distinct domains, including an X (extra) domain with a proteolytic cleavage site, an I (inserted) domain, a 'thigh' domain, two 'calf' domains, and a propeller domain (Hoffmann2021Integrin). The I-domain is crucial for ligand binding, specifically interacting with the BC loop of the extracellular EC1 domain of E-cadherin through its MIDAS motif (Hoffmann2021Integrin).

The quaternary structure of ITGAE involves pairing with the β7 subunit to form a functional integrin heterodimer. The β7 subunit contains four EGF-like domains, two hybrid domains separated by the β-I-domain, and a plexin/semaphorin/integrin domain, which facilitates intracellular signaling (Hoffmann2021Integrin).

Post-translational modifications of ITGAE include glycosylation, which can influence protein function and localization. The integrin αE chain is involved in heterophilic binding, distinguishing it from the homophilic interactions typical of E-cadherin (Hoffmann2021Integrin). The expression of ITGAE is upregulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), particularly in CD8+ cells, indicating its role in immune responses within tumor microenvironments (Hoffmann2021Integrin).

## Function
The ITGAE gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha E, which pairs with the beta 7 subunit to form the integrin αEβ7. This integrin is primarily expressed on intraepithelial lymphocytes and plays a crucial role in mediating the retention of lymphocytes in epithelial tissues, contributing to immune surveillance and mucosal immunity (Shannon2021Natural). The αEβ7 integrin binds to E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, facilitating the localization of T cells to epithelial tissues, such as the alveolar epithelium in the lung (Shannon2021Natural).

In tissue-resident natural killer (trNK) cells, αE integrin is associated with a tissue-specific phenotype, influencing the cells' functional capacity by potentially reducing their cytotoxicity while maintaining cytokine production, such as TNF (Shannon2021Natural). The expression of αE integrin is also linked to the plasticity of NK cells, allowing them to adapt to different tissue environments and respond to local cues, such as TGF-β, which can induce αE expression in mucosal tissues (Shannon2021Natural).

Overall, ITGAE plays a significant role in the localization and function of immune cells within epithelial tissues, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens (Shannon2021Natural).

## Clinical Significance
The ITGAE gene, encoding the integrin subunit alpha E, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic variants. In ovarian cancer, decreased expression of ITGAE is significantly associated with poor overall survival, suggesting its role as a protective factor, particularly in patients who have undergone chemotherapy (Wu2020Integrated). In colorectal cancer, high levels of ITGAE expression in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlate with improved overall and disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Hu2018ITGAE).

In melanoma, specific polymorphisms in the ITGAE gene, such as the rs2272606 variant, have been associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. The CA haplotype of ITGAE also shows evidence of increased susceptibility to melanoma, although these genetic variations do not appear to influence survival outcomes in melanoma patients (Lenci2011Integrin). These findings suggest that ITGAE plays a role in cancer susceptibility and prognosis, potentially through its involvement in immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment.

## Interactions
The ITGAE gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha E, which forms a heterodimer with integrin beta 7 (ITGB7) to create the integrin αEβ7 complex. This complex is known for its specific interaction with E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule. The interaction between αEβ7 and E-cadherin is direct and specific, as demonstrated by binding assays where soluble αEβ7 was shown to bind to E-cadherin-Fc but not to other proteins like P-cadherin-Fc or ICAM-1-Fc (Higgins1998Direct). This binding is crucial for the adhesion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) to epithelial cells, mediated through E-cadherin (Higgins1998Direct).

The interaction is regulated by divalent cations such as manganese, which can enhance the binding affinity of αEβ7 to E-cadherin. This regulation is distinct from other integrins and is influenced by intracellular signaling pathways, including those activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Higgins1998Direct). The αEβ7 integrin's interaction with E-cadherin is also modulated by the presence of calcium and magnesium, which affect the adhesion properties of the complex (Higgins1998Direct). This specific interaction plays a role in the retention of lymphocytes within epithelial tissues, contributing to immune responses and tissue homeostasis.
