# SOX17

## Overview
SOX17 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 17, a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) domain, which facilitates DNA binding and bending, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and cell differentiation. SOX17 is crucial for the development of the definitive endoderm and the maintenance of arterial identity in endothelial cells, acting through pathways such as Notch and Wnt. It also functions as a tumor suppressor in certain cellular contexts. Mutations in the SOX17 gene have been implicated in various congenital disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, underscoring its importance in normal physiological processes and disease (GallegoZazo2023Seven; MerinoAzpitarte2017SOX17; Corada2013Sox17).

## Structure
SOX17 is a transcription factor characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding. The HMG domain is an L-shaped structure composed of three alpha helices, facilitating a significant DNA bend of approximately 90° upon binding. This bending is aided by the FM wedge, consisting of phenylalanine and methionine residues, and the C-terminal arms of SOX17 wrap around the DNA during this interaction (Kolatkar2016Threedimensional). 

SOX17 binds to a specific DNA motif (AATT-GTT) and has a unique charge surface area compared to other SOX proteins like SOX2. A notable structural feature is the presence of a negatively charged glutamic acid residue, which contrasts with the positively charged lysine found in SOX2. This difference influences SOX17's binding properties and its interaction with cofactors such as OCT4. Mutagenesis studies have shown that altering this residue can transform SOX17's function to resemble that of SOX2, enabling it to bind canonical motifs and participate in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) formation (Kolatkar2016Threedimensional).

SOX17 may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability. It also exists in different splice variant isoforms, potentially influencing its functional roles and interactions.

## Function
SOX17 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various developmental processes and cell differentiation in healthy human cells. It is essential for the acquisition and maintenance of arterial identity in endothelial cells, acting upstream of the Notch signaling pathway and downstream of the canonical Wnt pathway. SOX17 directly interacts with the promoters of Notch4, Notch1, and Dll4, which are involved in arterial specification, and its expression is crucial for proper vascular development and arterial endothelial cell specification (Corada2013Sox17).

In the context of cholangiocytes, SOX17 maintains the biliary phenotype by regulating the expression of differentiation markers such as CK7 and CK19. Its downregulation leads to decreased expression of these markers and an increase in genes associated with tumorigenesis, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor (MerinoAzpitarte2017SOX17).

SOX17 is also involved in the development of the definitive endoderm, a primary germ layer that gives rise to the epithelial compartments of various internal organs. It serves as a marker for isolating endodermal cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, highlighting its importance in the differentiation and development of endodermal progeny (Wang2011Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOX17 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its critical role in various biological pathways. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), SOX17 mutations are linked to both idiopathic and congenital heart disease-associated forms of the condition. These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and are associated with a younger age of onset and severe disease phenotype, often requiring lung transplantation (Aman2022TheSOX17phenotype; GallegoZazo2023Seven). SOX17 variants contribute to endothelial dysfunction and are implicated in the structural remodeling of pulmonary arteries, a hallmark of PAH (Montani2022An; Wu2021The).

SOX17 mutations are also linked to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). The p.Y259N mutation, for example, leads to increased SOX17 protein levels, which suppress the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in urinary tract malformations (Gimelli2010Mutations). Additionally, SOX17 is involved in congenital heart disease (CHD), with loss-of-function mutations disrupting interactions with other transcription factors like NOTCH1 and GATA4, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Zhao2021SOX17). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in cardiovascular and renal development, with mutations leading to various developmental disorders.

## Interactions
SOX17 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in developmental processes. It forms heterodimers with OCT4, a crucial interaction for directing transcriptional programs necessary for primitive endoderm specification. This interaction is DNA-dependent, with SOX17 binding to compressed SOXOCT DNA elements, a specificity determined by the amino acid at position 57 of its HMG box domain (Aksoy2013Oct4; Tan2020SOX17).

SOX17 also interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly through its association with β-catenin. It co-occupies Wnt-responsive enhancers with β-catenin, influencing the expression of endodermal genes. This interaction can be either synergistic or repressive, depending on the context, and is crucial for regulating spatial gene expression and maintaining endodermal identity (Mukherjee2020Sox17a; Mukherjee2020Sox17). SOX17 can antagonize Wnt signaling by binding to the ARM region of β-catenin, redirecting it from TCF/LEF target genes and inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling (Tan2020SOX17).

These interactions highlight SOX17's role in modulating transcriptional activity and influencing cell fate decisions during development.
