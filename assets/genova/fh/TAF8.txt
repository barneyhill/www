# TAF8

## Overview
TAF8 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 8, which is a crucial component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a significant role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. TAF8 is involved in forming a heterotrimeric subcomplex with TAF2 and TAF10, which is essential for the assembly and stability of the holo-TFIID complex. The protein's structure includes histone fold domains that facilitate interactions with other TAF proteins, particularly TAF10, contributing to the functional remodeling of the TFIID complex. TAF8 is vital for early embryonic development and normal brain development, with mutations in the TAF8 gene linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic; Nadav2024Novel; Wong2022Mutations).

## Structure
TAF8 is a component of the TFIID complex, characterized by its involvement in forming the TAF2-8-10 complex. The molecular structure of TAF8 includes atypical histone fold domains (HFDs), which consist of three central alpha helices flanked by additional N- and C-terminal alpha helices. These domains facilitate the interaction with TAF10, where TAF8 wraps around the alpha2 helix of TAF10, forming a complex with predominantly hydrophobic intermolecular contacts (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The interaction is further characterized by hydrophobic stacking interactions between aromatic residues Y68 of TAF8 and F162 of TAF10, placing the complex within the H3/H4 family of HFD-containing proteins (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

TAF8 contains a classical short monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is recognized by Importin a1, facilitating its nuclear import. This NLS is crucial for the translocation of the TAF8-10 complex into the nucleus (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The C-terminal region of TAF8 is essential for binding to TAF2, indicating its role in the assembly of the TAF2-8-10 complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). Phosphorylation of serine residues near the NLS may regulate TAF8's affinity for Importin a1, modulating its nuclear import (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

## Function
TAF8 is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. TAF8 forms a heterotrimeric subcomplex with TAF2 and TAF10, which assembles in the cytoplasm and is crucial for the integrity of the holo-TFIID complex. This subcomplex is transported into the nucleus via an Importin a1-dependent pathway, facilitated by the nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminal end of TAF8 (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

In the nucleus, TAF8 plays a central role in nucleating the TAF2-8-10 complex, which associates with the core-TFIID to form intermediates that eventually lead to the assembly of the functional nuclear holo-TFIID. This process is crucial for the transcription of all mRNA genes, as TFIID is the first general transcription factor recruited at promoters to assemble the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic; Wong2022Mutations).

TAF8's interaction with TAF10 through their histone fold domains (HFDs) is vital for the functional remodeling of core-TFIID, transitioning it from symmetry to asymmetry, which primes the recruitment of other TAFs and TBP to complete the holo-TFIID (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). This cooperative activity is essential for early embryonic development and normal brain development, as evidenced by the severe neurodevelopmental disorders associated with TAF8 deficiency (Nadav2024Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TAF8 gene are associated with severe neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. TAF8 is a component of the TFIID complex, essential for RNA polymerase II transcription. Deficiencies in TAF8 can lead to significant brain malformations and restricted fetal growth, as observed in fetuses with a homozygous splicing variant of TAF8. These malformations include microcephaly, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, severe hypoplasia of the cerebellum, and abnormal development of the gyri and sulci. The study highlights the importance of TAF8 in normal brain development and suggests that its deficiency can lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders (Nadav2024Novel).

In another study, mutations in TAF8 were linked to a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, poor growth, and feeding difficulties. Patients exhibit severe delays in neuromotor development, with MRI findings showing hypomyelination, a thin corpus callosum, enlarged ventricles, and generalized brain atrophy. These mutations lead to decreased production of functional TAF8 protein, confirmed by a significant reduction in TAF8 mRNA and protein levels in patient fibroblasts (Wong2022Mutations). The clinical significance of TAF8 mutations underscores the gene's critical role in brain development and function.

## Interactions
TAF8 is a component of the TFIID complex, playing a crucial role in its assembly and function. It interacts with several other TAF proteins, including TAF2, TAF6, TAF9, and TAF10, as well as the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Scheer2021TAF8; Demény2007Identification). TAF8 forms a histone fold pair with TAF10, which is essential for the integrity of the holo-TFIID complex and is involved in early embryonic development (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The interaction between TAF8 and TAF10 is mediated by their histone fold domains (HFDs) (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

TAF8 also interacts with TAF2, with multiple motifs in the TAF8 C-terminal region mediating this interaction. These interactions are crucial for the formation of the cytoplasmic TAF2-8-10 complex, which is a precursor to the nuclear holo-TFIID complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The ID region of TAF8 is necessary for interactions with the 5TAF core complex, which includes TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, TAF4, and TAF12 (Scheer2021TAF8).

TAF8 is also part of a smaller complex known as SMAT, which includes TAF10 and SPT7L. This complex is distinct from TFIID and may play a role in transcription regulation (Demény2007Identification). The interactions of TAF8 are vital for the assembly and stability of the TFIID complex, impacting transcription regulation and embryonic stem cell survival (Scheer2021TAF8).
