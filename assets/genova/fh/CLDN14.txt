# CLDN14

## Overview
The CLDN14 gene encodes claudin 14, a tetraspan-transmembrane protein that is a member of the claudin family, which plays a pivotal role in the formation of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are crucial for maintaining the selective permeability of paracellular pathways, particularly in the kidney and inner ear. Claudin 14 is involved in regulating ion transport, specifically calcium and magnesium, by modulating the permeability of the claudin-16 and claudin-19 complex in the nephron's thick ascending limb (Gong2012Claudin14; Jo2022Claudins). The expression of claudin 14 is influenced by dietary calcium levels and the calcium-sensing receptor, which impacts calcium homeostasis and prevents hypercalciuria (Frische2021Localization; Gong2012Claudin14). Mutations in CLDN14 are linked to autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (DFNB29) and kidney-related conditions such as hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis (Gong2012Claudin14; Corre2016Common).

## Structure
Claudin 14 (CLDN14) is a tetraspan-transmembrane protein involved in forming tight junctions. It consists of four transmembrane domains, with both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions located intracellularly (Katoh2024Claudin). The protein features two extracellular loops, with the first extracellular loop (ECL1) playing a critical role in stabilizing the paracellular interface and maintaining cation permeability (Katoh2024Claudin; Zhao2018Multiple). The C-terminal region interacts with the zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) scaffold protein, linking claudins to actin filaments and recruiting other tight junction proteins (Katoh2024Claudin).

Mutations in CLDN14, such as p.Arg81His, affect the protein's structure and function, particularly in the first extracellular loop, which is crucial for maintaining the cation pore (Zhao2018Multiple; Lee2012Novel). The protein's molecular structure includes a non-charged residue, glutamine at position 65, which influences the charge density and cation permeation (Gong2012Claudin14). CLDN14 can form homo- and heterotypical complexes, interacting with other claudins like CLDN16 and CLDN19, affecting their permeability and playing a role in calcium transport (Gong2012Claudin14; Katoh2024Claudin).

## Function
The CLDN14 gene encodes claudin-14, a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport, particularly calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+), in the kidney. Claudin-14 is part of the claudin family of tight junction proteins, which are essential for maintaining the selective permeability of the paracellular pathway in epithelial cells. In the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the nephron, claudin-14 modulates the permeability of the claudin-16 and claudin-19 complex, which is responsible for the reabsorption of divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Gong2012Claudin14; Jo2022Claudins).

Claudin-14 expression is regulated by dietary calcium levels and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which influences the microRNA-claudin-14 axis. Under high calcium conditions, claudin-14 expression increases, leading to reduced paracellular cation uptake and increased urinary calcium excretion, thus maintaining calcium homeostasis and preventing hypercalciuria (Frische2021Localization; Gong2012Claudin14). This regulation is crucial for preventing conditions such as hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis and maintaining mineral balance in the body (Gong2012Claudin14; Corre2016Common). Claudin-14 also plays a role in the inner ear, where it is important for cochlear hair cell function, with mutations linked to autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness (DFNB29) (Gong2012Claudin14).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLDN14 gene are associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL), particularly the DFNB29 type. These mutations disrupt the formation of tight junctions in the cochlea, leading to impaired ion permeability and subsequent hearing loss. Several mutations, such as p.Arg68Ter, p.Val85Asp, and p.Ala163Val, have been identified in various populations, with some acting as founder mutations in specific regions like Newfoundland and Pakistan (Pater2016A; Tlili2024The; Lee2012Novel). The severity of hearing loss varies, ranging from moderate to profound, and is often prelingual, affecting high frequencies more significantly (Pater2016A; Lee2012Novel).

Alterations in CLDN14 expression levels are linked to kidney-related conditions. Overexpression in the kidney's thick ascending limb (TAL) can lead to hypercalciuria and hypermagnesuria, contributing to kidney stone formation. This is due to increased urinary calcium excretion mediated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and influenced by parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling (Plain2018Claudins; Seker2019Mouse). Genetic studies have identified noncoding and intronic variations in CLDN14 that enhance its expression, further associating it with an increased risk of kidney stones (Ure2017A).

## Interactions
CLDN14 interacts with other claudin proteins, particularly CLDN16 and CLDN19, in the kidney. It forms an oligomeric complex with these proteins, where CLDN16 acts as a central anchor. CLDN14 can interact with itself and with CLDN16, but not directly with CLDN19 unless all three claudins are present, suggesting that CLDN19 interacts with CLDN14 through CLDN16 (Gong2012Claudin14). This interaction is crucial for regulating calcium reabsorption in the kidney, as CLDN14 integrates into the CLDN16-CLDN19 channel to form a higher oligomeric complex, affecting their permeability (Gong2012Claudin14).

The interaction between CLDN14 and CLDN16 has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, where antibodies against one protein could coprecipitate the other, demonstrating a strong physical interaction (Gong2012Claudin14). CLDN14's interaction with CLDN16 also blocks the cation permeability of the CLDN16-CLDN19 channel, which is significant for calcium transport in the kidney (Gong2012Claudin14). These interactions highlight the role of CLDN14 in forming tight junctions and regulating paracellular transport in renal physiology.
