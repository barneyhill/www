# DDX28

## Overview
DDX28 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 28, a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. This protein functions as an RNA helicase and plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial translation by facilitating the assembly of mitoribosomes, which are essential for synthesizing proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. DEAD-box helicase 28 is primarily localized in the mitochondria and the nucleus, where it contributes to mitochondrial RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, thereby supporting efficient cellular energy production. The protein's interactions with various mitochondrial components, including mitoribosome proteins and RNA metabolism factors, underscore its importance in mitochondrial function and RNA metabolism. Additionally, altered expression of DDX28 has been associated with colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance in cancer biology (Loo2012cisExpression; Cheng2021A; Heerma2017Targeting; Maiti2018Human; Abdelhaleem2003The; Rao2022DEADly).

## Structure
DDX28 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). This motif is part of the primary structure of DDX28, which is typical for proteins in this family (Suthar2016Identification). The secondary structure of DDX28 includes a DEAD box helicase fold, a feature common to DEAD-box helicases, which consists of α-helices and β-sheets (Cheng2021A). This fold is crucial for its function in ribosomal assembly, as it facilitates the protein's role in the maturation of the 39S mitoribosomal intermediates (Cheng2021A).

The tertiary structure of DDX28 involves the formation of a helicase core domain, which is essential for its helicase activity. This structure allows DDX28 to interact with the 16S rRNA, particularly affecting the central protuberance during mitoribosome assembly (Cheng2021A). The quaternary structure of DDX28 may involve interactions with other proteins, such as the methyltransferase MRM3, which stabilizes the PTC region in an immature state (Cheng2021A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and potential splice variant isoforms may exist, altering functional domains, although specific details are not provided in the context (Suthar2016Identification).

## Function
DDX28 is an RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation by facilitating the assembly of mitoribosomes in the mitochondriolus, the mitochondrial equivalent of the nucleolus. It primarily interacts with the 16S rRNA and the large mitoribosomal unit, which are essential components of the mitoribosome assembly process. This process is vital for synthesizing proteins that are part of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, which are necessary for ATP generation in cells (Heerma2017Targeting).

DDX28 is localized to both the mitochondria and the nucleus, and it is present in a mitochondrial RNA granule that drives the biogenesis of mitochondrial ribosomes. This localization underscores its role in mitochondrial RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, contributing to efficient cellular energy production and overall cellular function (Rao2022DEADly).

The DEAD-box family, to which DDX28 belongs, is involved in various steps of RNA metabolism, including ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation. These proteins are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting a conserved function across species (Abdelhaleem2003The).

## Clinical Significance
DDX28, a gene encoding a DEAD box RNA helicase, has been implicated in colorectal cancer through its altered expression levels. Although specific mutations in DDX28 have not been directly linked to diseases, its expression is significantly higher in colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal colon tissue, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Loo2012cisExpression). The gene's expression is also influenced by genetic variants; for instance, the A allele of the SNP rs9929218 is associated with decreased expression of DDX28 in normal colon tissue, which correlates with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. This suggests that DDX28 may play a role in inhibiting early events of colorectal carcinogenesis (Loo2012cisExpression).

DDX28 is involved in mitochondrial function and ribosome biogenesis, and its interactions with other proteins, such as DHX30, are crucial for mitoribosome assembly (Maiti2018Human). While the specific diseases directly caused by DDX28 mutations are not detailed, its involvement in cancer-related processes, such as cellular metabolism and proliferation, highlights its potential clinical significance in cancer biology (Loo2012cisExpression).

## Interactions
DDX28, a component of the mitochondrial RNA granule, interacts with a variety of proteins involved in mitochondrial function. Coimmunoprecipitation studies using HEK293T mitochondrial extracts have identified several categories of proteins that interact with DDX28. These include mitoribosome proteins, mitoribosome assembly factors, mitochondrial translational factors, RNA metabolism factors, and proteins previously identified as components of the mitochondrial DNA nucleoid (Maiti2018Human).

A notable interaction is with the RNA helicase DHX30, which associates with DDX28 even under high salt conditions, indicating a strong interaction. This suggests a significant role for DDX28 in RNA processing within the mitochondria (Maiti2018Human). Additionally, several GTPases, including GTPBP10, are part of the DDX28 interactome, suggesting that DDX28 may play a role in mitoribosome assembly (Maiti2018Human).

These interactions highlight the role of DDX28 in the compartmentalization and assembly of mitoribosomes, emphasizing its importance in mitochondrial RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis. The interactions of DDX28 with these proteins suggest its involvement in the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial RNA and protein complexes (Maiti2018Human).
