# RTKN

## Overview
The RTKN gene encodes the Rhotekin protein, which is a cytoplasmic protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. Rhotekin is categorized as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between different signaling molecules. It plays a crucial role in modulating pathways related to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cellular dynamics, particularly in the context of cancer. The protein's interactions with key molecules such as p53 and HDAC1, as well as its regulation by microRNAs like miR-145 and miR-152, underscore its significance in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Expression; Cho2023miR145; Sun2019&lt; Zhou2016MicroRNA152). The dysregulation of RTKN expression and function is associated with various malignancies, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RTKN gene, which encodes the Rhotekin protein, have been implicated in the progression of various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RTKN is overexpressed, and its expression is inversely correlated with the levels of miR-145, a microRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor. The downregulation of miR-145 in NSCLC leads to increased RTKN expression, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Targeting the miR-145/RTKN axis has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC (Cho2023miR145).

In breast cancer, particularly in the MCF-7 cell line, RTKN is also identified as a direct target of miR-145. The overexpression of miR-145 results in decreased RTKN levels, inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. This suggests that the loss of miR-145 expression may provide a growth advantage to breast cancer cells by allowing increased RTKN expression, which promotes cell survival and proliferation (Zhao2009miR145).

Overall, the dysregulation of RTKN, through either overexpression or altered interactions with regulatory microRNAs like miR-145, is associated with enhanced cancer cell growth and survival, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Rhotekin (RTKN) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In gastric cancer, RTKN interacts with the p53 signaling pathway. It influences the acetylation of p53, a crucial post-translational modification, by interacting with HDAC1, a histone deacetylase. This interaction affects cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as RTKN overexpression increases HDAC1 expression, leading to decreased p53 acetylation (Expression; Sun2019&lt; p&gt).

RTKN also interacts with vinexin, a vinculin-binding protein, which is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and cell polarity. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as vinexin is one of the proteins that RTKN associates with to influence cellular dynamics (Expression; Sun2019&lt; p&gt).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RTKN is targeted by microRNA-152 (miR-152), which binds to the 3'UTR of RTKN mRNA, leading to its downregulation. This interaction is crucial for miR-152's role as a tumor suppressor, as it inhibits RTKN-induced cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis (Zhou2016MicroRNA152).

These interactions highlight RTKN's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
