# C2orf92

## Overview
C2orf92 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 92. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological function remains under investigation. The gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including reproductive health and neurological conditions. Notably, C2orf92 is associated with spermatogenic failure due to its hypermethylated promoter in cryptozoospermic men, which leads to reduced expression levels (Di2021Wholegenome). Additionally, it is involved in a copy number variation linked to autism spectrum disorder and language impairments (Alibutud2023Structural). The gene's expression is specific to the male reproductive tract, highlighting its potential as a target for contraceptive drug development (Robertson2020Largescale).

## Clinical Significance
C2orf92 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its precise role remains under investigation. In cryptozoospermic men, C2orf92 is noted for having a hypermethylated promoter, which correlates with lower expression levels. This aberrant methylation pattern is associated with spermatogenic failure, suggesting that C2orf92 may play a role in the premature abortion of spermatogenesis (Di2021Wholegenome). 

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and language impairments, C2orf92 is part of a copy number variation (CNV) associated with family FAM88. This CNV has a StrVCTVRE score of 0.627, indicating a potential functional impact, although the specific clinical significance of C2orf92 in this context is not detailed (Alibutud2023Structural).

Additionally, C2orf92 has been identified as a reproductive tract-specific gene, which suggests its potential as a target for contraceptive drug development. Its specificity to the male reproductive tract could minimize side effects in humans, although its exact clinical applications are still being explored (Robertson2020Largescale).
