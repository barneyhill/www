# ABTB1

## Overview
ABTB1 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and BTB domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and a BTB domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, making it a crucial component in cellular signaling pathways. Notably, ABTB1 is implicated in the PTEN growth-suppressive signaling pathway, playing a role in tumor suppression by inhibiting cell growth and progression at the G1/S phase transition (Wang2012Dietary; Nätkin2023Adaptive). Additionally, ABTB1 is associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting its involvement in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Skugor2019Effects). The gene's expression is linked to growth-suppressive signaling and proteolysis, indicating its potential role in muscle growth and development (Skugor2019Effects). ABTB1's interactions and regulatory mechanisms have significant implications in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and inflammatory myopathies.

## Function
The ABTB1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. This protein contains ankyrin repeats and a BTB domain, which are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, ABTB1 is involved in the PTEN growth-suppressive signaling pathway, which is important for inhibiting cell growth and progression of the cell cycle, particularly at the G1/S phase transition (Wang2012Dietary; Nätkin2023Adaptive). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular signaling pathways that can impact tumor suppression (Wang2012Dietary).

ABTB1 is also associated with protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting a role in regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Skugor2019Effects). The gene's expression is linked to growth-suppressive signaling and proteolysis, indicating its potential involvement in muscle growth and development by suppressing cell proliferation and promoting protein degradation (Skugor2019Effects). These functions highlight ABTB1's importance in maintaining cellular balance and its potential implications in various physiological and pathological contexts.

## Clinical Significance
ABTB1 (ankyrin repeat and BTB domain containing 1) has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through its interaction with miR-4319. In CRC, miR-4319 acts as a tumor suppressor and targets ABTB1, leading to reduced expression of ABTB1 at both mRNA and protein levels. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. The suppression of ABTB1 by miR-4319 is associated with better patient prognosis, as reduced miR-4319 expression correlates with poor outcomes, advanced clinical stages, and lymph node metastasis in CRC patients (Huang2019MiR‐4319).

The study suggests that ABTB1 could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment, as knocking down ABTB1 mimics the effects of miR-4319 overexpression, indicating its role in CRC progression. The regulation of miR-4319, and consequently ABTB1, is mediated by the tumor suppressor gene PLZF, which binds to the promoter of miR-4319 (Huang2019MiR‐4319). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ABTB1 in CRC and its potential as a target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ABTB1 is a gene that encodes a protein containing ankyrin repeat and BTB domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), ABTB1 is a direct target of miR-4319, a microRNA that suppresses its expression at both mRNA and protein levels. This interaction was demonstrated using luciferase reporter assays and immunoprecipitation assays, which showed enrichment of both miR-4319 and ABTB1 by Ago2 immunoprecipitates, indicating a physical interaction in CRC cells (Huang2019MiR‐4319). The study suggests that miR-4319, by targeting ABTB1, plays a role in inhibiting CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Huang2019MiR‐4319).

In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), ABTB1 is associated with the anti-Fer autoantibody, as identified in a systematic protein-protein interaction and pathway analysis. The study utilized significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from an IIM Immunochip association study, including SNP rs4702698 linked to ABTB1, which is relevant to dermatomyositis/juvenile dermatomyositis (DM/JDM) (Parkes2016Systematic). However, specific details on the physical interactions of the ABTB1 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these contexts are not provided.
