# PRR3

## Overview
The PRR3 gene encodes the proline-rich protein 3, which is a member of the proline-rich protein family. This protein is characterized by its abundance of proline residues, which are thought to play a role in protein-protein interactions. Although the precise biological functions of proline-rich protein 3 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication. The protein's structure suggests potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional dynamics and clinical implications of PRR3 and its encoded protein.
