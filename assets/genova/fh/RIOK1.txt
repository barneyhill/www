# RIOK1

## Overview
RIOK1 is a gene that encodes the RIO kinase 1 protein, a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. The RIO kinase 1 protein is characterized by its kinase/ATPase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and it plays a pivotal role in the maturation of the pre-40S small ribosomal subunit, a key step in protein synthesis (Berto2018The; Damizia2023The). As a component of the PRMT5 complex, RIO kinase 1 acts as an adapter protein, facilitating the recruitment and methylation of nucleolin, thereby promoting rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA maturation (Guderian2011RioK1). The protein's activity is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, which are crucial for its function in cellular growth and proliferation (Damizia2023The). RIOK1 has been implicated in oncogenesis, with its overexpression linked to several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Hong2018Targeting).

## Structure
The RIOK1 protein is characterized by a kinase/ATPase domain, which includes specific structural features such as the catalytic aspartate, phospho-aspartate, and magnesium-binding residues. These elements are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Berto2018The). The protein also contains a phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) and an unstructured flexible loop (F-loop), which are important for its function (Berto2018The). The RIOK1 promoter region includes eight E-boxes, which are binding sites for transcription factors like c-MYC, influencing its expression levels (Berto2018The).

In terms of secondary structure, RIOK1 features conserved kinase loops, including the P-loop, catalytic-loop, and metal-binding loop, which are essential for its function (Breugelmans2014Bioinformatic). The protein lacks an activation loop, which is replaced by a flexible loop involved in ribosomal biogenesis (Breugelmans2014Bioinformatic). The N- and C-terminal domains of RIOK1 do not show sequence-based homology with known proteins, but they are suggested to have potential functions such as actin binding and kinase regulator activity (Breugelmans2014Bioinformatic).

RIOK1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its degradation and may play a role in cancer development (Berto2018The). The protein exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its regulatory roles (Breugelmans2014Bioinformatic).

## Function
RIOK1 (RIO kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of the pre-40S small ribosomal subunit. It functions as an ATPase, releasing biogenesis factors during this maturation process, which is crucial for protein synthesis in healthy human cells (Berto2018The; Damizia2023The). RIOK1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and is involved in the processing of SSU rRNA to generate mature 16S/18S rRNA, preventing premature entry of the nascent SSU into the translation process (Berto2018The).

RIOK1 is also a component of the PRMT5 complex, where it acts as an adapter protein, recruiting nucleolin for symmetrical methylation. This interaction enhances nucleolin's recruitment to the PRMT5 complex, promoting rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA maturation (Guderian2011RioK1; Damizia2023The). Additionally, RIOK1 influences cell cycle progression by activating the mTORC2 kinase complex, which subsequently activates protein kinase Akt. This pathway is involved in regulating cell growth, division, and genomic stability (Berto2018The; Damizia2023The). RIOK1's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, ensuring its optimal function in cellular growth and proliferation (Damizia2023The).

## Clinical Significance
RIOK1 (RIO kinase 1) is implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), due to its role in cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. In CRC and GC, RIOK1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced cancer stages and poor prognosis. High RIOK1 levels are associated with aggressive cancer behavior and reduced overall and disease-free survival (Hong2018Targeting). The gene's oncogenic effects are linked to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, with inhibitors of this pathway reducing the proliferation and invasion of RIOK1-transfected cells (Hong2018Targeting).

Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of RIOK1, such as phosphorylation and methylation, play a critical role in its stability and function. Phosphorylation by CK2 and methylation by SETD7 regulate RIOK1's degradation, with implications for cancer progression. High levels of LSD1 and CK2, which affect these PTMs, correlate with poor survival in CRC patients (Hong2018Targeting). In GBM, co-overexpression of RIOK1 and AKT1 is linked to poor prognosis, with RIOK1 promoting glioma cell proliferation and invasion (Wang2021Cooverexpression).

RIOK1 also interacts with the tumor-suppressing transcription factor p53, where its overexpression can lead to p53 degradation, contributing to cancer cell resistance to treatment (Damizia2023The). These findings suggest that RIOK1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
RIOK1 is a component of the PRMT5 complex, where it interacts directly with PRMT5 via its N-terminal region, specifically through amino acids 1-242. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of specific substrate proteins to the methylosome, such as nucleolin, which RIOK1 helps to methylate by the PRMT5 complex (Guderian2011RioK1). RIOK1 competes with pICln for binding to PRMT5, affecting the composition and substrate specificity of the PRMT5 complex (Guderian2011RioK1).

RIOK1 also interacts with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and FBXO6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. LSD1 demethylates RIOK1, increasing its stability, while FBXO6 mediates its ubiquitination and degradation, a process influenced by SETD7-induced methylation (Hong2018Targeting). RIOK1 is involved in the regulation of p53 activity, interacting with the mTORC2 kinase complex and promoting Akt phosphorylation, which leads to p53 degradation (Damizia2023The).

RIOK1 also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis by interacting with the pre-40S small ribosomal subunit and supporting ribosome production (Damizia2023The). It is part of a feedback loop with c-Myc, where it supports c-Myc protein translation, which in turn activates RIOK1 transcription (Damizia2023The).
