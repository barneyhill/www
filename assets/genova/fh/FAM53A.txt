# FAM53A

## Overview
FAM53A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 53 member A, which is a vertebrate-specific protein involved in crucial developmental processes. The FAM53A protein is primarily known for its role in neurodevelopment, particularly in the specification of dorsal cell fate within the neural tube. It functions as a nuclear protein that interacts with transcriptional regulators to influence gene expression, thereby playing a significant role in cell proliferation and differentiation. FAM53A is also implicated in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is vital for various biological processes, including cell growth and development. The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development. Additionally, FAM53A has been associated with clinical conditions such as breast cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (PlazaFlorido2020Distinct; Palumbo2015Report; Zhang2019FAM53A).

## Function
FAM53A, also known as dorsal neural tube nuclear protein, is a member of a vertebrate-specific family of proteins that play a crucial role in neurodevelopment by specifying the fate of dorsal cells within the neural tube (Zhang2019FAM53A). It is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, primarily through its interaction with transcriptional regulators (Zhang2019FAM53A). FAM53A is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression, suggesting its involvement in early developmental processes (Zhang2019FAM53A).

In healthy cells, FAM53A is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth and development (PlazaFlorido2020Distinct). This pathway is crucial for various biological processes, including type 2 diabetes, macrophage phospholipid metabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular growth through exercise (PlazaFlorido2020Distinct). The protein's role in these pathways indicates its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal outcomes. Although specific molecular activities of FAM53A in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these critical pathways highlights its significance in cellular and developmental biology.

## Clinical Significance
FAM53A has been implicated in breast cancer, where its expression levels and interactions are influenced by the p53 gene status. In p53-wild-type breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7, FAM53A overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. Conversely, in p53-mutant cells like MDA-MB-231, FAM53A overexpression enhances these processes, indicating a potential oncogenic role in the absence of functional p53. This dual role highlights FAM53A as a potential therapeutic target, particularly in breast cancers with p53 mutations (Zhang2019FAM53A).

FAM53A is also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. A case report identified a duplication in chromosome band 4p16.3, which includes FAM53A, in a patient with clinical features such as ADHD, learning difficulties, and speech delays. This suggests that alterations in FAM53A may contribute to a novel microduplication syndrome with neurodevelopmental implications (Palumbo2015Report).

In the context of paternal aging, FAM53A was identified among differentially expressed genes in embryonic tissues, although it was not directly linked to specific neurodevelopmental disorders in this study (Denomme2024Paternal).
