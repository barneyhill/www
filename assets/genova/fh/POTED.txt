# POTED

## Overview
POTED is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member D, which is part of the POTE gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular signaling and structural functions. The POTED protein is distinguished by its unique domain structure, including ankyrin repeats, coiled-coil domains, and cysteine repeats, but notably lacks a β-actin retrogene insertion found in some other POTE family members. This absence may indicate a divergence in functional roles or interaction capabilities. The protein's structural features imply potential involvement in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Structure
The POTED protein, a member of the POTE gene family, is characterized by its specific domain structure and exon composition. It contains 11 exons, with a half-sized long inverted repeat (LIR) sequence, three cysteine repeats, seven ankyrin repeats, and two coiled-coil domains (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The ankyrin repeats are common motifs involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular signaling or structural functions. The coiled-coil domains may facilitate the formation of protein complexes or contribute to the structural stability of the protein.

Unlike some other POTE family members, POTED does not contain a β-actin retrogene insertion, which is present in eight out of the 14 POTE genes and contributes to an actin module in those proteins (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The absence of this retrogene in POTED indicates a divergence in function or interaction capabilities compared to other POTE proteins.

The POTED protein's molecular structure, including its ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, suggests it may be involved in protein-protein and cell membrane interactions, although specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature. The presence of cysteine repeats may also imply potential post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation, which could influence its stability and function.

## Function
POTED, a member of the POTE gene family, is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and cell cycle regulation. The expression of POTED in multiple tissues suggests its involvement in maintaining normal cellular functions. The ankyrin repeat domains in POTED likely contribute to its role in cellular structure and signaling pathways, potentially influencing the stability and dynamics of the cytoskeleton. This structural role may be essential for the proper organization of cellular components and the transmission of signals within the cell, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. The specific molecular activities of POTED, while not fully elucidated, are likely integral to these processes, ensuring that cells respond appropriately to internal and external cues. The widespread expression of POTED across different tissues indicates its importance in various physiological contexts, possibly contributing to the overall structural integrity and signaling efficiency of cells.
