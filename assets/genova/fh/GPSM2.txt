# GPSM2

## Overview
The GPSM2 gene encodes the G protein signaling modulator 2, a crucial protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. This protein, also known as LGN, is characterized by its seven N-terminal tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs and four C-terminal GoLoco motifs, which facilitate its interaction with Gαi proteins and the nuclear protein NuMA. These interactions are essential for mitotic spindle orientation and planar cell polarity, impacting cell division and tissue organization (Walsh2010Whole; Bhonker2015The). GPSM2 plays a significant role in the development and function of the auditory system by influencing the organization of stereocilia, which are critical for hearing and balance (Tadenev2019GPSM2-GNAI). Mutations in GPSM2 are associated with disorders such as Chudley-McCullough syndrome and nonsyndromic hearing loss, underscoring its clinical significance (Blauen2020ChudleyMcCullough; Mauriac2017Defective). Additionally, GPSM2's expression levels have been linked to cancer prognosis, highlighting its broader biological importance (Hu2022A).

## Structure
The GPSM2 protein, also known as LGN or Pins, is a 677 amino acid G protein signaling modulator. It is composed of seven N-terminal tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, a linker domain, and four C-terminal GoLoco motifs. These motifs are crucial for its interaction with Gαi proteins, which are anchored to the cortical membrane via myristoyl groups (Walsh2010Whole; Bhonker2015The). The TPR motifs interact with the nuclear protein NuMA during mitosis, facilitating the orientation of the mitotic spindle (Bhonker2015The). The GoLoco motifs are essential for the protein's apical localization in the inner ear and play a role in hearing (Bhonker2015The).

The GPSM2 protein is involved in forming a conserved core ternary complex with Gαi and NuMA, which is necessary for proper spindle orientation and planar cell polarity (Bhonker2015The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with other proteins like aPKC, which are necessary for its localization and function (Bhonker2015The). While the context does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, the presence of these motifs and domains suggests a complex structure facilitating multiple protein-protein interactions.

## Function
The GPSM2 gene encodes a protein known as LGN, which is crucial for the development and function of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. These cells are responsible for detecting sound and balance through their apical hair bundle, which consists of actin-based stereocilia. The GPSM2 protein, in complex with GNAI, plays a significant role in defining the identity and height of the tallest row of stereocilia, essential for proper hair bundle function (Tadenev2019GPSM2-GNAI). This complex is involved in the planar polarization of hair cells during embryogenesis, influencing cytoskeleton organization and establishing the 'bare zone,' a region devoid of protrusions (Tadenev2019GPSM2-GNAI).

GPSM2 is also involved in maintaining cellular polarity, which is vital for the function of hair cells in the organ of Corti. It is localized at the apical surfaces of hair and supporting cells in the cochlea, utricle, saccule, and cristae (Walsh2010Whole). The protein is essential for planar spindle orientation during cell division, contributing to the proper orientation and polarization of cochlear hair cells (Bhonker2015The). GPSM2 interacts with proteins like MYO15A, WHRN, and EPS8, forming a complex necessary for actin regulation and stereocilia development (Tadenev2019GPSM2-GNAI).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPSM2 gene are linked to several disorders, most notably Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMCS) and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. CMCS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by early-onset sensorineural deafness and various brain anomalies, including hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, cerebellar dysplasia, and ventriculomegaly. These mutations disrupt the elongation of actin-rich stereocilia in auditory and vestibular hair cells, leading to hearing and balance defects (Blauen2020ChudleyMcCullough; Mauriac2017Defective).

In the context of hearing loss, GPSM2 mutations can cause severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, as demonstrated by a truncating variant identified in a Palestinian family. This mutation leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in a reduced transcript due to nonsense-mediated decay (Bhonker2015The). Another study identified a frameshift mutation in an Iranian woman with prelingual hearing loss, highlighting the gene's role in hearing development (Ebrahimi2021A).

Alterations in GPSM2 expression are also implicated in various cancers. Increased GPSM2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, while its downregulation in non-small cell lung cancer is linked to metastasis (Hu2022A).

## Interactions
GPSM2, also known as G protein signaling modulator 2, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the G-protein subunit Gαi3, forming a complex that is essential for regulating actin and tubulin dynamics, particularly in polarized tissue growth and stereocilia elongation (Mauriac2017Defective). GPSM2 also interacts with whirlin and myosin 15, which are crucial for the localization and maintenance of GPSM2 and Gαi3 at the tips of stereocilia, facilitating actin polymerization necessary for proper stereocilia development (Mauriac2017Defective).

In the context of mitotic spindle orientation, GPSM2 binds to NuMA through its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs and to myristoylated Gαi through its C-terminal GoLoco domains, anchoring the complex to the cell cortex (Schiller2021Interaction). This interaction is crucial for the orientation of the mitotic spindle, which affects cell division direction and tissue shape. GPSM2's interaction with Discs large (Dlg) is mediated by the Dlg GUK domain, and this interaction is important for spindle orientation in neural tissue (Schiller2021Interaction). These interactions highlight GPSM2's role in cellular polarity and orientation, particularly in the inner ear and neural tissues (Bhonker2015The).
