# SRARP

## Overview
The SRARP gene encodes the steroid receptor associated and regulated protein, which functions primarily as a corepressor in steroid hormone receptor signaling pathways. This protein is involved in the regulation of androgen and estrogen receptors, playing a crucial role in modulating their transcriptional activities. SRARP is categorized as a regulatory protein, interacting with various cellular components, including the 14-3-3 protein, to influence key signaling pathways such as Akt and ERK. These interactions are significant in the context of cancer biology, where SRARP acts as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in its expression, often due to epigenetic changes, are linked to poor outcomes in cancers such as breast and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Naderi2018SRARP; Naderi2020Genomic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The SRARP gene, located on chromosome 1p36.13, plays a significant role in cancer biology as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in SRARP expression, such as reduced expression due to DNA hypermethylation or deletions, are associated with poor cancer outcomes. These changes are observed in various malignancies, including breast and prostate cancers, where SRARP acts as a corepressor of the androgen receptor (AR) and is involved in inhibiting AR-mediated induction of proteins necessary for cell cycle progression (Naderi2018SRARP; Naderi2020Genomic).

In breast cancer, SRARP is highly co-expressed with AR in AR-positive cell lines, but its expression is suppressed by AR activation. This suppression is linked to worse survival outcomes, highlighting SRARP's role in cancer progression (Naderi2018SRARP). The gene's inactivation, often through epigenetic silencing or deletions, is an early event in carcinogenesis, even in normal adjacent tissues, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Naderi2020Genomic).

SRARP's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and its involvement in signaling pathways like Akt and ERK further underscore its tumor suppressor function. Overexpression of SRARP in cancer cell lines reduces cell viability and colony formation, supporting its role in inhibiting cancer cell growth (Naderi2018SRARP).

## Interactions
SRARP (steroid receptor associated and regulated protein) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It functions as a corepressor of the androgen receptor (AR), inhibiting AR-mediated induction of proteins such as PIP, which is crucial for cell cycle progression in breast cancer (Naderi2018SRARP). SRARP is also involved in the regulation of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, where its expression is repressed upon ER activation (Naderi2018SRARP).

SRARP interacts with the 14-3-3 protein, a chaperone and scaffolding protein that regulates various cellular processes and signal transduction pathways, including the Akt and ERK pathways. This interaction suggests a mechanism for SRARP's function as a tumor suppressor, as overexpression of SRARP leads to reduced phosphorylation and/or expression of Akt and ERK in certain cancer cell lines (Naderi2018SRARP). The interaction with 14-3-3 and regulation of these pathways indicate a complex network of interactions contributing to SRARP's role in cancer suppression (Naderi2018SRARP).

SRARP is also necessary for the expression of the progesterone receptor (PGR) and is involved in the transcriptional activities of ER, further highlighting its role in modulating steroid hormone receptor activity (Naderi2018SRARP).
