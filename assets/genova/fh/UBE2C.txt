# UBE2C

## Overview
UBE2C is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C, a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. UBE2C is particularly involved in cell cycle regulation, interacting with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of mitotic cyclins, thereby ensuring proper mitosis and cell division (Wijk2009The; van2009A). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Domentean2023Role; Bavi2011Bortezomib). As a result, UBE2C is considered a potential therapeutic target in oncology.

## Structure
UBE2C, also known as ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 C, is a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. The primary structure of UBE2C consists of 197 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 19,652 Da (Hao2011Ubiquitinconjugating). The protein contains a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and is characterized by an α/β-fold with an N-terminal helix, a four-stranded β-meander, a short 3_10-helix, and two C-terminal helices (Gundogdu2019Structural).

The active site of UBE2C includes a cysteine residue that forms a thiol ester linkage with ubiquitin, crucial for the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Hao2011Ubiquitinconjugating). The protein's tertiary structure is maintained by conserved secondary structural elements, such as β strands and helices, which are important for its stability and function (Lin2002Structural).

UBE2C is involved in the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and plays a significant role in cell cycle progression and mitotic spindle checkpoint control (Hao2011Ubiquitinconjugating). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. Additionally, there are seven known transcription variants of UBE2C, generated through alternative splicing, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Hao2011Ubiquitinconjugating).

## Function
UBE2C, also known as UbcH10, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly in cell cycle regulation. It is essential for the degradation of mitotic cyclins, which are crucial for cell-cycle progression and proper mitosis. UBE2C interacts with the Anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 ligase, to facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins involved in mitosis, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell division (Wijk2009The; van2009A).

The enzyme contains a conserved N-terminal extension that regulates its ubiquitination activity and the modification of substrate lysines by the E3 complex. This extension allows UBE2C to ubiquitinate substrates that may lack a clear degron, indicating a coadaptation of the E2-E3 interface and the N-terminal stretch (Wijk2009The). UBE2C is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of protein turnover and cell cycle dynamics. Its activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of protein degradation and synthesis, which is vital for cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
UBE2C is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In breast cancer, UBE2C overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, high tumor grade, and metastasis, and its knockdown inhibits proliferation and invasion (Kariri2022Ubiquitinconjugating; Mo2017The). In prostate cancer, UBE2C expression is linked to higher Gleason scores and pathological T stages, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wu2022Overexpression). UBE2C is also overexpressed in lung cancer, where it is associated with tumor size, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Domentean2023Role).

In brain tumors, such as gliomas and meningiomas, high UBE2C expression correlates with tumor grade and poor prognosis, contributing to increased proliferation and invasion (Domentean2023Role). In colorectal carcinoma, UBE2C overexpression is an independent prognostic marker in early-stage disease, with its suppression leading to inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis (Bavi2011Bortezomib). UBE2C is also upregulated in endometrial cancer, where it is associated with higher pathologic grade and reduced survival (Liu2020UBE2C).

UBE2C's role in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, affecting cell cycle regulation and promoting chromosomal instability, which contributes to tumorigenesis and therapy resistance (Domentean2023Role; Bavi2011Bortezomib).

## Interactions
UBE2C, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cell cycle progression and cancer development. It interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a key E3 ligase, to facilitate the assembly of Lys 11-linked ubiquitin chains on substrates, marking them for degradation during the cell cycle (Komander2009The). This interaction underscores UBE2C's role in maintaining proper cell cycle control.

In the context of cancer, UBE2C is upregulated and interacts with various proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. It shows strong positive correlations with genes such as MYBL2, TROAP, CDC20, CENPA, and CDK1, which are crucial for cell cycle processes (Dastsooz2019A). UBE2C also interacts with transcription factors like FOXM1 and E2F1, which have binding sites on its promoter, influencing its expression in cancer cells (Dastsooz2019A).

In bladder cancer, UBE2C mediates the monoubiquitination of SNAT2 at lysine 59, inhibiting K63-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 33. This interaction affects SNAT2's membrane expression and endocytosis, promoting glutamine uptake and metabolism, which are linked to cancer metastasis (Li2024UBE2Cinduced). These interactions highlight UBE2C's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
