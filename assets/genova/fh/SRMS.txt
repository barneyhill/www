# SRMS

## Overview
The SRMS gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the breast tumor kinase (BRK) family, which is evolutionarily related to the Src family kinases. Unlike typical Src family kinases, the protein encoded by SRMS lacks the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristoylation sites, which influences its regulatory mechanisms and functional dynamics (Goel2018Global). The SRMS protein is characterized by the presence of Src-homology 3 (SH3) and Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains, as well as a catalytic kinase domain, which are essential for its role in mediating protein interactions and signal transduction (Zhang2021The). Functionally, SRMS is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in regulating autophagy and cell growth through its interaction with the scaffolding protein FKBP51 and the AKT signaling pathway (Park2021The). The kinase is expressed in various tissues, suggesting its involvement in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair and apoptosis (Goel2018Global).

## Structure
The SRMS protein is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the BRK family kinases, which are evolutionarily related to the Src family kinases. It lacks the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristoylation sites typical of Src family kinases, which influences its regulatory mechanisms (Goel2018Global). The primary structure of SRMS includes a unique 50 amino acid-long N-terminal region that regulates its enzymatic activity, as well as a kinase domain essential for its function (Goel2018Global). 

SRMS contains several key domains: an Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, an Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a catalytic kinase domain. These domains are crucial for mediating intra-molecular or inter-molecular interactions and downstream signal transductions (Zhang2021The). The kinase domain includes conserved residues such as an ATP-contacting lysine (K258) and an autophosphorylation site in the activation loop (Y380), both essential for enzymatic activation (Park2021The).

Post-translational modifications of SRMS include phosphorylation, which plays a role in its regulatory functions. The phosphorylation of specific sites, such as tyrosine 54 on FKBP51, is critical for its role in signaling pathways (Park2021The). The quaternary structure or specific splice variant isoforms of SRMS are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The SRMS gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, SRMS functions as a nutrient-responsive kinase, primarily involved in regulating autophagy and cell growth. It achieves this by phosphorylating the scaffolding protein FKBP51, which disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, leading to sustained activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This activation promotes cell growth and inhibits autophagy, contributing to cellular homeostasis under nutrient-rich conditions (Park2021The).

SRMS is part of the breast tumor kinase (BRK) family and is structurally similar to other kinases in this group, containing SH3 and SH2 domains along with a catalytic kinase domain. It is expressed in multiple tissues and developmental stages, indicating its potential involvement in various cellular processes (Park2021The; Goel2018Global).

The kinase is active in the cytoplasm and influences serine/threonine phosphorylation dynamics, which are crucial for secondary signaling events. These phosphorylation events have implications for processes such as DNA repair and apoptosis, suggesting that SRMS may have broader roles in cellular signaling beyond direct substrate phosphorylation (Goel2018Global).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SRMS, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. One of the key interactions of SRMS is with the scaffolding protein FKBP51. SRMS phosphorylates FKBP51 on tyrosine 54, which disrupts its interaction with the PHLPP phosphatase complex. This disruption prevents the dephosphorylation of AKT, leading to sustained activation of the AKT signaling pathway, which promotes cell growth and inhibits autophagy (Park2021The). The interaction between SRMS and FKBP51 has been confirmed through various assays, including co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Park2021The).

In addition to FKBP51, SRMS has been implicated in the regulation of CK2α, a catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2. SRMS phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on CK2α, potentially modulating its activity and influencing downstream signaling pathways such as DNA repair and apoptosis (Goel2018Global). These interactions highlight SRMS's role in modulating key cellular processes through its kinase activity, affecting pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation.
