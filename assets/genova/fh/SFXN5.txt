# SFXN5

## Overview
SFXN5 is a gene that encodes the protein sideroflexin 5, which is a member of the sideroflexin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized as transmembrane proteins that are primarily involved in mitochondrial function and iron metabolism. Sideroflexin 5 is implicated in the transport of specific substrates across the mitochondrial membrane, contributing to cellular iron homeostasis and metabolic processes. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of SFXN5 and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research, with potential implications for understanding mitochondrial-related disorders and iron metabolism dysregulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
