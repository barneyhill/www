# KRTAP9-1

## Overview
KRTAP9-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 9-1, a member of the ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. This protein is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, thereby enhancing its structural stability and functional role in hair fiber formation. The keratin-associated protein 9-1 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and structural integrity of hair. The gene's expression and the protein's structural features, such as pentameric repeat structures, are crucial for its function in hair biology (Rogers2006Human).

## Structure
The KRTAP9-1 gene encodes a keratin-associated protein that is part of the ultrahigh sulfur KAP family, characterized by a high cysteine content, which ranges from 31.3% to 32.7% mol % (Rogers2006Human). This high cysteine content facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's structural stability. The primary structure of KRTAP9-1 includes pentameric repeat structures containing monocysteine and dicysteine, which are crucial for its function (Rogers2006Human). These repeat structures are a defining feature of the KAP9 family, contributing to the protein's heterogeneity in size.

The secondary structure of KRTAP9-1 likely involves alpha-helices, a common feature in keratin-associated proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein also contains two domains with family-specific amino acid sequence motifs, distinguishing it from other KAP families (Rogers2006Human). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications for KRTAP9-1 are not detailed in the context.

Overall, the structural properties of KRTAP9-1 are integral to its role in interacting with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and shape of hair fibers.
