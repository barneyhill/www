# SMYD4

## Overview
SMYD4 is a gene that encodes the protein SET and MYND domain containing 4, which is a member of the SMYD family of lysine methyltransferases. This protein is primarily involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation through its function as a histone methyltransferase, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) (Xiao2018The). The SMYD4 protein is characterized by the presence of a SET domain, which confers its methyltransferase activity, and a MYND domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, notably with histone deacetylase complexes such as HDAC1 (Xiao2018The; Thompson2008A). These interactions are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modification. SMYD4 is implicated in various biological processes, including cardiac development and muscle-specific transcriptional modulation, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as cancers and congenital heart defects (Olivera2024Genetic; Xiao2018The).

## Structure
The SMYD4 protein is characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function as a lysine-histone methyltransferase. It contains a SET domain, which is responsible for its methyltransferase activity, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) (Xiao2018The). The MYND domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, notably recruiting histone deacetylase complexes such as HDAC1, which is crucial for regulating gene expression (Xiao2018The; Thompson2008A). SMYD4 also features two tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, with the C-terminal TPR2 domain being essential for its methyltransferase activity and interactions (Xiao2018The).

The protein's structure includes a unique N-terminal extension of 240 amino acids, distinguishing it from other SMYD family members (AbuFarha2011Proteomic). This structural composition supports its role in transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modification. Post-translational modifications, such as methylation, are integral to its function, influencing its activity and interactions with other proteins (Xiao2018The). The presence of these domains and modifications underscores SMYD4's involvement in cardiac development and muscle-specific transcriptional modulation (Xiao2018The; Thompson2008A).

## Function
SMYD4 is a member of the SMYD family of lysine methyltransferases, which are involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It functions primarily as a histone methyltransferase, specifically targeting H3K4 methylation, which is crucial for transcriptional activation (Xiao2018The). SMYD4 interacts with HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, through its MYND domain, suggesting a role in modulating histone acetylation as well (Xiao2018The). This interaction indicates that SMYD4 acts as a negative regulator of HDAC1, impacting epigenetic regulation by influencing histone acetylation and methylation patterns (Xiao2018The).

In cellular biology, SMYD4 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a role in regulating gene expression through its methyltransferase activity (Xiao2018The). The gene is particularly important in cardiac development, as demonstrated in zebrafish models, where its deficiency leads to significant cardiac defects (Xiao2018The). SMYD4 is also implicated in broader metabolic processes and signaling pathways, such as those related to cardiac muscle contraction and cellular metabolism (Xiao2018The). These functions highlight its critical role in maintaining normal heart structure and function, as well as its potential involvement in other cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SMYD4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and congenital heart defects. In solid tumors, SMYD4 is frequently downregulated and exhibits heterozygous loss, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Its low expression is associated with poorer overall survival in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Olivera2024Genetic). In breast cancer, SMYD4 downregulation correlates with reduced recurrence-free survival and is linked to copy number alterations (Olivera2024Genetic).

In congenital heart defects (CHDs), rare missense variants of SMYD4, such as G345D, have been identified in patients. These variants are associated with significant cardiac defects in zebrafish models, including abnormal left-right patterning and reduced trabeculation, suggesting a pathogenic role in heart development (Xiao2018The). SMYD4's interaction with HDAC1 and its involvement in histone methylation are crucial for its function in cardiac development, with mutations disrupting these interactions and contributing to CHDs (Xiao2018The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SMYD4 in both cancer and cardiac development.

## Interactions
SMYD4 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), a major histone modification enzyme, through its MYND domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting analyses in various cell types, including HL-1 and HEK293T cells (Xiao2018The). The MYND domain of SMYD4 is essential for binding to HDAC1, and mutations in this domain, such as the G345D variant, can disrupt this interaction, leading to significant functional consequences (Xiao2018The).

In zebrafish, SMYD4 acts as a negative regulator of HDAC1-mediated histone 3 modification, affecting histone acetylation and methylation patterns. Specifically, SMYD4 influences H3K4 methylation, with mutants showing altered di- and tri-methylation levels at this site (Xiao2018The). These interactions suggest that SMYD4 is a critical component of the HDAC1 functional complex, playing a significant role in epigenetic regulation through histone modification (Xiao2018The).

In Drosophila, the homologue dSmyd4 also interacts with HDACs, specifically dHDAC1 and dHDAC3, through its MYND domain, indicating a conserved mechanism across species (Thompson2008A).
