# ATPSCKMT

## Overview
The ATPSCKMT gene encodes the ATP synthase c subunit lysine N-methyltransferase, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of the ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc) by methylating lysine-43. This methyltransferase is integral to the proper assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex, a critical component of oxidative phosphorylation responsible for ATP production in mitochondria (Małecki2019Lysine). The enzyme's activity ensures the stability and efficient assembly of the ATP synthase complex, thereby maintaining mitochondrial respiration and energy homeostasis (Małecki2019Lysine). Dysregulation of ATPSCKMT has been linked to chronic pain conditions, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Willemen2022Inflammationinduced).

## Function
The ATPSCKMT gene encodes the ATP synthase c subunit lysine N-methyltransferase, a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the methylation of the ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc) at lysine 43 (Lys-43). This post-translational modification is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex, which is essential for efficient ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (Małecki2019Lysine). The methylation of ATPSc by ATPSCKMT enhances the stability and assembly of the ATP synthase complex, preventing the accumulation of low-molecular-weight intermediates and ensuring optimal ATP synthesis (Małecki2019Lysine).

In healthy human cells, ATPSCKMT is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, with its transmembrane domain inserted into the inner membrane, positioning it near its substrate ATPSc (Małecki2019Lysine). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial respiration and energy homeostasis, as evidenced by reduced ATP synthesis and mitochondrial respiration in cells lacking ATPSCKMT-mediated methylation (Małecki2019Lysine). This function is conserved across species, as demonstrated by a homologous protein in C. elegans that can methylate human ATPSc (Małecki2019Lysine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ATPSCKMT gene, also known as ATPSc-KMT, have been implicated in the development of chronic pain conditions. The gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the methylation of the ATP synthase c-subunit, which is essential for efficient mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Dysregulation of ATPSCKMT expression has been associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) formation, contributing to chronic inflammatory pain by promoting mitochondrial hyperactivity and impairing pain resolution (Willemen2022Inflammationinduced).

In sensory neurons, increased expression of ATPSCKMT following inflammatory stimuli is linked to persistent pain states, as it enhances oxidative phosphorylation and affects energy homeostasis. This suggests that ATPSCKMT may contribute to the maintenance of a 'primed' neuronal state, which is a key factor in the transition from acute to chronic pain (Willemen2022Inflammationinduced). Knockdown studies in mice have shown that reducing ATPSCKMT expression can restore the resolution of hyperalgesia, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for chronic pain management (Willemen2022Inflammationinduced). The gene's role in pain modulation underscores its clinical significance and potential implications for developing treatments targeting mitochondrial function in sensory neurons.

## Interactions
ATPSCKMT, previously known as FAM173B, is a mitochondrial methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of the ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc) by methylating lysine-43. This modification is essential for the proper assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex, a multiprotein complex responsible for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Małecki2019Lysine). 

ATPSCKMT interacts with ATPSc to facilitate its proper incorporation into the ATP synthase complex, influencing the complex's overall function and efficiency (Małecki2019Lysine). The methylation of ATPSc by ATPSCKMT promotes the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes, specifically the ATPS F1FO complex, which includes the ATP5A subunit. In the absence of ATPSCKMT-mediated methylation, there is an increased presence of low-molecular-weight intermediates, suggesting issues with the assembly or stability of the ATP synthase complex (Małecki2019Lysine). 

The interaction of ATPSCKMT with ATPSc is critical for maintaining efficient energy production in cells, as the absence of lysine-43 methylation leads to aberrant incorporation of ATPSc into the complex, resulting in decreased ATP-generating ability and reduced mitochondrial respiration (Małecki2019Lysine).
