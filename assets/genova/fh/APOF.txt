# APOF

## Overview
APOF is a gene located on human chromosome 12 that encodes the protein apolipoprotein F, a minor apolipoprotein involved in lipid metabolism. Apolipoprotein F is primarily associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and functions as a natural inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, particularly with low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This inhibition is crucial for reducing cholesterol transfer from HDL to LDL, thereby lowering LDL cholesterol levels and potentially reducing cardiovascular disease risk (Liu2020Apolipoprotein). The protein is synthesized as a 308 amino acid proprotein and is cleaved to produce a mature, heavily glycosylated 162 amino acid protein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa (Liu2020Apolipoprotein). Apolipoprotein F is also implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Shi2023A).

## Structure
Apolipoprotein F (APOF) is a protein involved in lipid metabolism, primarily associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL). The primary structure of APOF consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interaction with lipids. The secondary structure of APOF may include elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its role in lipid metabolism. The quaternary structure involves APOF's interaction with other protein molecules, which can influence its activity and function within the lipid transport system.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, can significantly affect the function of APOF. These modifications may alter the protein's stability, localization, and interaction with other molecules, thereby impacting its role in lipid metabolism. Understanding the structural aspects of APOF, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as its post-translational modifications, is essential for comprehending its function in lipid metabolism and its potential implications in related disorders.

## Function
Apolipoprotein F (APOF) is a minor apolipoprotein in human plasma that functions primarily as a natural inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. It is particularly effective in inhibiting CETP activity with low-density lipoprotein (LDL), thereby reducing the transfer of cholesterol from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to LDL. This selective inhibition is beneficial as it results in lower LDL cholesterol levels, which are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (Liu2020Apolipoprotein).

APOF is primarily associated with LDL and has been shown to exhibit CETP inhibitory activity in various assays using isolated lipoproteins, synthetic liposomes, and unfractionated plasma. The inhibitory activity of APOF is specific to LDL and is suppressed by fatty acids, similar to the lipid transfer inhibitor protein (LTIP) (Wang1999Molecular). APOF is encoded by a gene on human chromosome 12 and is synthesized as a 308 amino acid proprotein, which is cleaved to produce the mature 162 amino acid protein. This mature protein is heavily glycosylated, giving it an apparent molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa (Liu2020Apolipoprotein).

APOF's role in lipid metabolism is significant as it modulates CETP activity, which is crucial for cholesterol clearance in the body (Liu2020Apolipoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Apolipoprotein F (APOF) plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and is implicated in various cancers. Altered expression of APOF is associated with changes in lipid metabolism, a hallmark of cancer progression. In breast cancer (BRCA), high APOF expression correlates with elevated cholesterol levels, larger tumors, and more aggressive cancer phenotypes. Similarly, in prostate cancer (PRAD), increased APOF expression is linked to high cholesterol and aggressive disease progression, with a negative correlation to patient age (Shi2023A).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), APOF expression is downregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. The study also highlights APOF's role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), where its expression correlates with prognostic indicators (Shi2023A). Additionally, APOF has been identified as a biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) screening, and it predicts prognosis in LIHC and HPV status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Shi2023A).

These findings suggest that targeting APOF and cholesterol metabolism could be a therapeutic strategy for these cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Shi2023A).

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein F (ApoF) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the context of lipoprotein metabolism. ApoF is known to form complex lipoprotein particles with apolipoproteins A-I (ApoA-I) and A-II (ApoA-II), suggesting a functional link between these apolipoproteins. These complexes are distinct particles involved in cholesterol transport and esterification, and they are primarily found within the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) density class (Koren1982Isolation).

ApoF also acts as a natural inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), specifically inhibiting CETP activity with low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This selective inhibition reduces the transfer of cholesterol from HDL to LDL, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health (Liu2020Apolipoprotein). The interaction of ApoF with CETP involves modifying the molecular organization of lipoproteins, potentially by binding to their surface and affecting CETP's ability to bind and transfer lipids (Liu2020Apolipoprotein).

In addition, ApoF overexpression has been shown to enhance the capacity of HDL particles to accept cholesterol from macrophages, indicating that ApoF may improve the interaction of HDL particles with liver receptors, possibly including scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) (Lagor2009Overexpression).
