# DNAJB8

## Overview
DNAJB8 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B8, which is a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding and stress response. As a member of the Hsp40 family, DNAJB8 plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Hsp70 chaperones by facilitating ATP hydrolysis and substrate capture, thereby assisting in the folding or refolding of proteins (Ryder2021Regulatory). The protein is characterized by its J-domain (JD), C-terminal domain (CTD), and regions rich in glycine/phenylalanine (G/F) and serine/threonine (S/T), which contribute to its structural and functional properties (Ryder2021Regulatory). DNAJB8 is known for its ability to form oligomers and interact with various cytosolic Hsp70-associated proteins, highlighting its role as a co-chaperone (Montoya2024Factors). Additionally, DNAJB8 has been implicated in preventing polyglutamine deposition, which is relevant in the context of certain neurodegenerative diseases (Ryder2021Regulatory).

## Structure
The DNAJB8 protein is composed of several domains, including a J-domain (JD), a C-terminal domain (CTD), and regions rich in glycine/phenylalanine (G/F) and serine/threonine (S/T) (Ryder2021Regulatory). The JD, consisting of residues 1-82, and the CTD, consisting of residues 170-232, are both monomeric and folded, with the JD having a molecular weight of 10,220 ± 220 g/mol and the CTD 8376 ± 14 g/mol (Ryder2021Regulatory). The CTD forms a low contact order 5-stranded β-sheet topology, stabilized by conserved asparagine/aspartate-glycine sequences (N/DG) (Ryder2021Regulatory).

The JD and CTD interact through complementary electrostatic surfaces, with a binding affinity of 4.4 ± 0.5 μM, which is crucial for the oligomerization of DnaJB8, ranging from monomers to octamers, with dimers being predominant (Ryder2021Regulatory). The JD-CTD interaction acts as a reversible switch controlling Hsp70 binding, which is essential for the regulatory mechanism of chaperone activity (Ryder2021Regulatory). The protein can assemble into soluble oligomers, with aromatic amino acids in the central G/F and S/T domains mediating self-assembly (Ryder2021Regulatory). The CTD is involved in regulatory roles, potentially influenced by post-translational modifications such as acetylation and deacetylation of lysine residues (Ryder2021Regulatory).

## Interactions
DNAJB8, a member of the Hsp40 chaperone family, interacts with a variety of proteins, primarily through its J-domain (JD), which binds to Hsp70 chaperones to facilitate ATP hydrolysis and substrate capture for folding or refolding processes (Ryder2021Regulatory). DNAJB8 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with several cytosolic Hsp70-associated proteins, including HSPA8, HSPA1A, HSPA6, STUB1, HSPA4, DNAJB1, DNAJB6, and DNAJA2, indicating its role as a co-chaperone of Hsp70 (Montoya2024Factors). 

The JD of DNAJB8 interacts with its C-terminal domain (CTD), which sequesters the JD surface and prevents Hsp70 interaction, acting as a reversible switch controlling Hsp70 binding (Ryder2021Regulatory). This JD-CTD interaction is characterized by electrostatic interactions, with the JD having a basic surface that interacts with an acidic surface on HspA1A, a member of the Hsp70 family (Ryder2021Regulatory). 

DNAJB8 is also effective at preventing polyglutamine (polyQ) deposition, suggesting it binds directly to polyQ elements, which is significant in the context of polyQ diseases (Ryder2021Regulatory). The protein can form oligomers, with its oligomerization mediated by aromatic residues in the G/F and S/T domains (Ryder2020Autoregulatory).
