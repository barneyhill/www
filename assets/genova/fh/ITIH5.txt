# ITIH5

## Overview
ITIH5, or inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family, which is involved in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ITIH5 protein is characterized by several structural domains, including the vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin (VIT) domain and the von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, which contribute to its role in ECM integrity and cellular processes such as adhesion and migration (Zhuo2008Structure; Rose2022ITIH5Derived). Predominantly expressed in dermal fibroblasts and adipose tissue, ITIH5 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including metabolic regulation and cancer progression (Huth2015Inter‐α‐trypsin; Anveden2012ITIH‐5). Its interactions with hyaluronic acid (HA) and involvement in signaling pathways underscore its significance in tissue homeostasis and disease, particularly as a tumor suppressor in cancers such as breast cancer and melanoma (Rose2017ITIH5; Liu2021ITIH5).

## Structure
The ITIH5 protein is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family and features several structural domains, including the vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin (VIT) domain and the von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain (Zhuo2008Structure; Rose2022ITIH5Derived). The VIT domain is approximately 125 amino acids long and is secreted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Rose2022ITIH5Derived). The ITIH5 protein also includes a multicopper oxidase domain (MCOD) and a secretion signal peptide (SP) (Young2020Suppression).

The ITIH5 protein does not contain the conserved cleavage site necessary for hyaluronic acid (HA) binding, indicating its growth inhibitory impact is independent of HA-binding (Rose2022ITIH5Derived). Post-translational modifications are suggested to achieve full biological activity, although specific details are not provided (Rose2022ITIH5Derived). The protein is expressed in various epithelial tissues and is rarely found in the liver (Rose2022ITIH5Derived).

Alternative splicing and point mutations contribute to the diversity of ITIH5, though the functional significance of these variants is not fully understood (Zhuo2008Structure). The ITIH5 gene is part of a cluster on chromosome 10, sharing structural similarities with other heavy chains in the family (Zhuo2008Structure).

## Function
The ITIH5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix (ECM) by forming complexes with hyaluronic acid (HA) (Huth2015Inter‐α‐trypsin). This interaction helps maintain ECM integrity, which is essential for various biological processes, including cell adhesion and migration (Rose2017ITIH5). In healthy human cells, ITIH5 is predominantly expressed in dermal fibroblasts, the main cell type in the dermis, suggesting its significant role in maintaining dermal structure and function (Huth2015Inter‐α‐trypsin).

ITIH5 is also highly expressed in human adipose tissue, particularly in adipocytes, where it may function as a secreted protein with potential endocrine roles (Anveden2012ITIH‐5). The protein's expression is associated with metabolic variables, indicating a possible involvement in metabolic regulation and obesity-related processes (Anveden2012ITIH‐5). ITIH5's role in ECM stabilization and its expression pattern in tissues linked to insulin resistance suggest it could be a novel adipokine involved in obesity and related metabolic disorders (Anveden2012ITIH‐5).

## Clinical Significance
The ITIH5 gene is implicated in various diseases, primarily due to alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, ITIH5 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and malignant progression. In breast cancer, ITIH5 expression is often reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, particularly in aggressive subtypes like basal-like tumors, leading to increased metastatic potential and shorter overall survival (Rose2017ITIH5). In triple-negative breast cancer, ITIH5 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rose2022ITIH5Derived).

In melanoma, ITIH5 is a p53-responsive gene that inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis. Its expression is lower in melanoma tissues compared to normal skin, correlating with advanced disease stages and reduced patient survival (Liu2021ITIH5). ITIH5 also plays a role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its loss is linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis (Young2020Suppression; Sasaki2017Genomewide).

Beyond cancer, ITIH5 is associated with congenital uterovaginal aplasia, or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, due to its role in female genital tract development (MORCEL2013Involvement).

## Interactions
ITIH5 (inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 5) is known for its interactions with hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). ITIH5 is covalently linked to HA, which allows it to stabilize ECM structures and modulate biological processes in the skin. This interaction is facilitated by the catalytic factor TSG-6, leading to the formation of cable-like structures that promote leukocyte adhesion during inflammatory events (Huth2015Inter‐α‐trypsin; Huth2020InterαTrypsin).

In the context of cancer, ITIH5 has been shown to interact with the HA receptor CD44, influencing cell adhesion and motility. This interaction is particularly significant in bladder cancer cells, where ITIH5 expression enhances adhesion on HA and reduces cell migration, suggesting a role in ECM remodeling and signaling transduction (Rose2021The).

ITIH5 also interacts with intracellular pathways, such as the TGF-β signaling cascade, by regulating the expression of the co-receptor endoglin, which affects the inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1). This interaction is thought to drive TGF-β1-driven differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (Rose2022ITIH5Derived). However, specific details of ITIH5 binding sites for intracellular interactions remain to be elucidated (Rose2022ITIH5Derived).
