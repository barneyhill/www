# IFT70B

## Overview
IFT70B is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 70B protein, which is a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. This system is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that play vital roles in cell signaling and motility. The IFT70B protein is categorized as part of the IFT complex, which facilitates the bidirectional movement of molecular cargo along the ciliary axoneme. This transport is crucial for the proper functioning and formation of cilia, and disruptions in the IFT70B gene can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by ciliary dysfunction (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation in the IFT70B gene can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction. These conditions may include Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which is characterized by symptoms such as retinal degeneration, obesity, and kidney abnormalities. Altered expression of IFT70B can disrupt normal cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the development of these disorders. The role of IFT70B in intraflagellar transport is crucial for maintaining proper cilia function, and any disruption in this process can have significant clinical implications. Ciliopathies associated with IFT70B mutations highlight the importance of this gene in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis.
