# TLCD4

## Overview
TLCD4, or TLC domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by TLCD4 is characterized by the presence of a TLC domain, which suggests a role in lipid metabolism or membrane-associated functions, although its precise biological functions are still being elucidated. Research indicates that TLCD4 is involved in critical pathways such as erythropoiesis, where it is regulated by the transcription factor GATA1, and it may also play a role in cancer biology, as evidenced by its interactions and expression changes in glioblastoma and other malignancies (Li2023Multidimensional; Wu2023Ferroptosisrelated; Lin2023Prognostic). Despite ongoing research, the full spectrum of TLCD4's functions and its potential as a therapeutic target remain areas of active investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The TLCD4 gene is implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression and interactions. During erythropoiesis, GATA1, a transcription factor, regulates TLCD4 expression by binding to its distal enhancer regions. Knockdown of GATA1 or disruption of its binding sites leads to decreased TLCD4 expression, indicating its role in erythropoiesis through chromatin interactions (Li2023Multidimensional).

In glioblastoma, TLCD4 is negatively correlated with the FBXL6 gene. While the specific role of TLCD4 in glioblastoma is not detailed, its negative correlation with FBXL6 suggests a potential involvement in the disease's progression (Lin2023Prognostic).

The TLCD4 gene is also mentioned in the context of genetic alterations co-occurring with HIC1 alterations in cancer, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with TLCD4 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Wu2023Ferroptosisrelated).

Overall, while TLCD4's exact clinical significance remains under investigation, its expression and interaction changes are linked to important cellular processes and disease states, particularly in erythropoiesis and potentially in cancer.
