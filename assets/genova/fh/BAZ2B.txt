# BAZ2B

## Overview
BAZ2B is a human gene that encodes the protein bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 2B, which is a member of the bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger (BAZ) gene family. This protein is categorized as a chromatin remodeling factor and plays a crucial role in the regulation of transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. BAZ2B contains a bromodomain that specifically binds to acetylated lysine residues on histones, such as H3K14ac, facilitating transcriptional activation and gene regulation, particularly during embryonic development. The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin structure to influence DNA accessibility. BAZ2B is considered loss-of-function intolerant, underscoring its significance in cellular processes and its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders (Scott2020BAZ2B; Xia2021lncBAZ2B).

## Function
The BAZ2B gene encodes a protein that is part of the bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger (BAZ) gene family, which includes BAZ1A, BAZ1B, and BAZ2A. These proteins are integral components of chromatin remodeling complexes, involved in the modulation of transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair (Scott2020BAZ2B). BAZ2B contains a bromodomain that binds to acetylated lysine residues, specifically recognizing and binding to H3K14ac, a histone marker associated with gene activation (Scott2020BAZ2B; Xia2021lncBAZ2B). This interaction suggests a role in transcriptional activation, particularly in the regulation of genes necessary for embryonic development (Xia2021lncBAZ2B).

In healthy human cells, BAZ2B is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin to modulate DNA accessibility to transcriptional machinery (Scott2020BAZ2B). It is postulated to function similarly to the Drosophila Acf1 protein, regulating nucleosome mobilization through the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor ISWI (Scott2020BAZ2B). BAZ2B is also considered loss-of-function intolerant, indicating its importance in cellular function and its potential role in neurodevelopmental processes (Scott2020BAZ2B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BAZ2B gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). BAZ2B is considered loss-of-function intolerant, and studies have identified de novo and mosaic variants in individuals with these conditions. In a cohort of 10,927 individuals with ASD, intellectual disability, or developmental disorders, five individuals were found with de novo germline mutations in BAZ2B, including loss-of-function and conserved missense variants. Additionally, two individuals were identified with small deletions affecting the BAZ2B coding region. Further evidence from exome/genome sequencing studies identified six individuals with rare BAZ2B stop-gain or conserved missense variants, all exhibiting developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or ASD (Scott2020BAZ2B).

Alterations in BAZ2B expression have also been associated with certain health conditions. High expression levels of BAZ2B have been correlated with poor outcomes in pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (Chen2015Discovery). Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BAZ2B gene locus have been linked to sudden cardiac death, although the exact gene responsible for this association is not definitively identified (Arking2011Identification).
