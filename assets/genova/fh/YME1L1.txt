# YME1L1

## Overview
YME1L1 is a gene that encodes the YME1 like 1 ATPase, a mitochondrial ATP-dependent metalloprotease belonging to the i-AAA protease family. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial protein quality control. It is involved in the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, particularly those associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and is essential for the proteolytic processing of proteins like OPA1, which are crucial for mitochondrial fusion and cristae morphology (Cesnekova2018Loss; Stiburek2012YME1L). The YME1 like 1 ATPase is characterized by its AAA+ ATPase domain and metallopeptidase domain, which facilitate substrate translocation and proteolysis. Its activity is regulated by ATP hydrolysis, and it forms hexameric complexes that are vital for its function in mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion and fission processes (Ohba2020Regulation). Mutations in YME1L1 have been linked to various mitochondrial disorders and are implicated in certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Xia2023The; ElHattab2018Mitochondrial).

## Structure
YME1L1 is a mitochondrial ATP-dependent metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in protein quality control within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The primary structure of YME1L1 includes a conserved AAA+ ATPase domain and a metallopeptidase domain of the M48 family, which are essential for its function in substrate translocation and proteolysis (Ohba2020Regulation). The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the formation of its functional domains.

The tertiary structure of YME1L1 involves the folding of these domains, allowing for the formation of a functional protease. The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of YME1L1 into hexameric, cylinder-shaped complexes, which facilitate proteolysis within a sequestered cavity (Ohba2020Regulation). This hexameric arrangement is crucial for its role in mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion and fission processes.

YME1L1 is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane through its aminoterminal transmembrane regions, with its carboxy-terminal domain exposed within the intermembrane space (Stiburek2012YME1L). The protein's activity is regulated by ATP hydrolysis, which drives substrate translocation into the proteolytic chamber (Ohba2020Regulation).

## Function
The YME1L1 gene encodes a mitochondrial i-AAA protease that is integral to maintaining mitochondrial function and morphology in human cells. This protease is part of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the quality control of mitochondrial proteins, playing a crucial role in the degradation of nonassembled or damaged subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly those of complex I and complex IV (Cesnekova2018Loss; Stiburek2012YME1L). YME1L1 is essential for the proteolytic processing of several mitochondrial proteins, including OPA1, which is important for mitochondrial fusion and cristae morphology (Cesnekova2018Loss; Stiburek2012YME1L).

In healthy cells, YME1L1 contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics by regulating the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, which is crucial for cellular energy metabolism and apoptotic resistance (Stiburek2012YME1L; Ruan2013Loss). The gene's activity is particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, where it helps maintain mitochondrial integrity and function (Stiburek2012YME1L). Loss of YME1L1 function can lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, impaired respiratory chain function, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, highlighting its role in protecting cells from programmed cell death (Hartmann2016Homozygous; Stiburek2012YME1L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the YME1L1 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders. A homozygous pathogenic variant in YME1L1 has been identified in individuals with infantile-onset encephalopathy, characterized by intellectual disability, motor developmental delay, expressive speech delay, hearing impairment, optic nerve atrophy, and lactic acidemia. Neuroimaging often reveals leukoencephalopathy and brain atrophy, while cultured fibroblasts from affected individuals show increased mitochondrial network fragmentation (ElHattab2018Mitochondrial).

A specific homozygous missense mutation, c.616C>T (p.R149W), in the YME1L1 gene disrupts the mitochondrial targeting sequence, leading to impaired maturation of the YME1L1 protein. This mutation results in reduced protein levels, causing mitochondriopathy with optic atrophy and mitochondrial network fragmentation. The mutation affects the processing of the OPA1 protein, crucial for mitochondrial dynamics, and is linked to severe intellectual disability and muscular impairments (Hartmann2016Homozygous).

Alterations in YME1L1 expression levels have also been implicated in cancer. Elevated YME1L1 expression is observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth and motility (Xia2023The; Liao2022Identifying).

## Interactions
YME1L1, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, is involved in several critical interactions that influence mitochondrial function and dynamics. It interacts with KIF1Bβ, a tumor suppressor protein, to regulate mitochondrial apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for the proteolytic activity of YME1L1 on OPA1, a protein associated with mitochondrial membrane dynamics, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis (Ando2019Tumor).

YME1L1 is also part of a complex known as the 'SPY complex' in human cells, which includes stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) and PARL. This complex is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and anti-apoptotic functions (Serricchio2021A). YME1L1's role in protein quality control is highlighted by its involvement in the degradation and stabilization of various mitochondrial proteins, including respiratory chain subunits and OPA1 (Stiburek2012YME1L).

Additionally, YME1L1 interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, forming large complexes that are essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. These interactions are vital for the assembly and stability of respiratory chain complexes, impacting mitochondrial morphology and function (Stiburek2012YME1L).
