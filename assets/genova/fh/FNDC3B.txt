# FNDC3B

## Overview
The FNDC3B gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 3B, which is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in cellular adhesion, migration, and signaling, facilitating interactions with other proteins and components of the extracellular matrix (Zhu2023A). FNDC3B is involved in various physiological processes, including adipogenesis and craniofacial development, and is expressed in multiple tissues with low RNA tissue specificity, indicating its broad functional significance (Cao2016Two; Zhu2023A). The protein is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels and interactions influence disease progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2022Integrated; Huang2021FNDC3B).

## Structure
The FNDC3B gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III domains, which are integral to its role in cellular processes. These domains are commonly associated with cell adhesion and receptor binding, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure. The fibronectin type III domains facilitate interactions with other cellular components, influencing the protein's function and localization. 

Post-translational modifications of the FNDC3B protein may alter its activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context. The existence of splice variant isoforms suggests that the FNDC3B protein may have diverse functional roles depending on the variant expressed. These isoforms could potentially affect the protein's structural conformation and its interaction with other molecules within the cell. 

The tertiary structure of FNDC3B, shaped by its fibronectin type III domains, is crucial for its biological function, although detailed information on its quaternary structure is not provided. The structural features of FNDC3B underscore its importance in cellular adhesion and signaling pathways, highlighting the significance of its fibronectin type III domains in maintaining cellular integrity and communication.

## Function
The FNDC3B gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. The protein contains fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to its involvement in cell adhesion and migration (Zhu2023A). FNDC3B is active in multiple cellular locations, including the cytoplasm and cell membrane, and is implicated in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Zhu2023A).

In healthy human cells, FNDC3B is associated with adipogenesis, acting as a positive regulator of adipocyte differentiation and a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. This dual role suggests its involvement in balancing fat and bone cell development (Cao2016Two). The gene is also linked to craniofacial development, with deficiencies leading to skeletal malformations, indicating its importance in normal bone formation and development (Cao2016Two).

FNDC3B's expression is observed in various tissues, including the placenta, adipose tissue, and liver, with low RNA tissue specificity, suggesting a broad role in physiological processes across different tissues (Zhu2023A). Its involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue functions.

## Clinical Significance
The FNDC3B gene is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations playing significant roles in disease progression and prognosis. In glioma, FNDC3B acts as an oncogene, with higher expression levels correlating with worse overall survival and serving as an independent prognostic indicator. Its expression is linked to immune infiltrates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic and immunotherapeutic biomarker in glioma (Wang2022Integrated; Huang2021FNDC3B). In cervical cancer, FNDC3B expression increases during the progression from normal tissue to cancerous states, indicating its role in HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis (Zhang2021FNDC3B).

In pancreatic cancer, high FNDC3B expression is associated with poorer outcomes, including shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival. Knockdown of FNDC3B in pancreatic cancer cell lines reduces cell proliferation and migration, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Wang2024Identification). FNDC3B is also highly expressed in several other cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is linked to poor prognosis (Zhu2023A). These findings suggest that FNDC3B plays a carcinogenic role in different tumors and is associated with various cancer-related processes (Zhu2023A).

## Interactions
FNDC3B, also known as fibronectin type III domain containing 3B, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In gastric cancer, the novel protein FNDC3B-267aa, encoded by circ0003692, interacts with the c-Myc protein. This interaction primarily occurs in the nucleus and is facilitated by nuclear localization sequences (NLS) present in both proteins. The interaction between FNDC3B-267aa and c-Myc leads to the proteasomal degradation of c-Myc, which is a key mechanism in inhibiting gastric cancer metastasis (Liu2024A).

FNDC3B has also been implicated in interactions related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cervical cancer. It is associated with stress granule formation, suggesting interactions with mRNAs and signaling proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Han2019FNDC3B). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, FNDC3B's involvement in these pathways indicates its role in complex interaction networks (Han2019FNDC3B).

In pancreatic cancer, FNDC3B is suggested to interact with extracellular matrix components and integrin receptors, potentially influencing tumor progression through pathways like ECM receptor interaction and integrin cell surface interactions (Wang2024Identification).
