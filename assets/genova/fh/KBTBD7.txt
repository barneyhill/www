# KBTBD7

## Overview
KBTBD7 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 7, which is a member of the BTB-kelch protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal BTB domain, a BACK domain, and C-terminal kelch repeats, which facilitate its role as an adaptor in the CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex. KBTBD7 is involved in various cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation, protein degradation, and signaling pathways, including the MAPK and Wnt/PCP pathways. It plays a significant role in cellular growth, differentiation, and inflammatory responses. Clinically, KBTBD7 has been implicated in conditions such as pituitary adenomas, myocardial infarction, uterine fibroids, and non-small cell lung cancer, where it influences disease progression and treatment responses (Liu2020The; Hu2010KBTBD7; Feng2021Regulation).

## Structure
The KBTBD7 protein is a member of the BTB-kelch protein family, characterized by distinct structural domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of KBTBD7 consists of 684 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 77.2 kDa (Hu2010KBTBD7). The protein includes an N-terminal BTB domain, a BACK domain, and five C-terminal kelch repeats (Hu2010KBTBD7; Feng2021Regulation). The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and dimerization, playing a role in transcriptional regulation (Hu2010KBTBD7). The kelch repeats form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for substrate interaction and protein-protein interactions (Feng2021Regulation).

KBTBD7 functions as an adaptor for the CUL3-RING ligase complex, facilitating the recruitment of target proteins for ubiquitination and degradation (Feng2021Regulation). The protein can form a heterodimeric complex with its homolog KBTBD6, which shares about 90% sequence identity (Feng2021Regulation). The BTB domain mediates interactions with CUL3, while the kelch domain interacts with substrates, highlighting the importance of these domains in its function (Feng2021Regulation). The precise secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of KBTBD7 have not been detailed in the available literature.

## Function
KBTBD7 is a protein that functions as a transcriptional activator and is involved in the regulation of several cellular processes. It contains an N-terminal BTB domain and C-terminal kelch repeats, which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (Hu2010KBTBD7). In healthy human cells, KBTBD7 acts as an adaptor for the CUL3-RING ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Feng2021Regulation).

KBTBD7 is involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, where it activates transcriptional activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and serum response element (SRE), suggesting a role in cellular growth and differentiation (Hu2010KBTBD7). It also plays a role in the regulation of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of Vangl proteins, which are crucial for polarized cell behaviors (Feng2021Regulation).

The protein is localized in the cytoplasm and may interact with other transcription factors to integrate signals from multiple extracellular sources, thereby inducing necessary cellular changes for tissue specification and morphogenesis (Hu2010KBTBD7).

## Clinical Significance
KBTBD7 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in protein degradation and signaling pathways. In pituitary adenomas, particularly prolactinomas, KBTBD7 is involved in the degradation of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), affecting the tumor's sensitivity to dopamine agonist treatments like cabergoline. Overexpression of KBTBD7 leads to reduced DRD2 levels and increased resistance to these treatments, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for dopamine agonist resistance in prolactinomas (Liu2020The).

In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), KBTBD7 promotes inflammatory responses in macrophages by enhancing the activation of p38 and NF-κB signaling pathways. This process is counteracted by microRNA-21 (miR-21), which targets KBTBD7 to prevent excessive inflammation and cardiac dysfunction post-MI (Yang2018MicroRNA21).

KBTBD7 has also been identified as a potential susceptibility gene for uterine fibroids, where it regulates the degradation of neurofibromin, impacting the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (Kim2022A). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low expression levels of KBTBD7 are associated with reduced overall survival, highlighting its role in disease progression (Giannos2021Identification).

## Interactions
KBTBD7 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role as a substrate adaptor in the CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with MKK3 and MKK6 in macrophages, facilitating their activation and enhancing downstream p38 and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are crucial for inflammatory responses (Yang2018MicroRNA21). KBTBD7 also interacts with the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This interaction is mediated through the Kelch domain of KBTBD7, which binds to specific lysine residues on DRD2, affecting the receptor's internalization and recycling (Liu2020The). 

KBTBD7 forms part of a heterodimeric Cullin-RING ligase complex with CUL3, which is involved in the ubiquitylation and degradation of proteins such as TIAM1 (Yang2018MicroRNA21). In the context of pituitary adenomas, KBTBD7's interaction with DRD2 is significant, as it contributes to dopamine agonist resistance by reducing DRD2 expression (Liu2020The). Additionally, KBTBD7 has been shown to form heterodimers with KBTBD8, which is important for neural crest differentiation (Mena2018Dimerization). These interactions highlight KBTBD7's role in various cellular processes, including inflammation, receptor regulation, and protein degradation.
