# CCL8

## Overview
CCL8, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 8, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine sub-family, which plays a pivotal role in immune response modulation. The protein product of CCL8 is a chemokine involved in the recruitment and activation of various immune cells, such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, to sites of inflammation or infection. It functions primarily in the extracellular space, where it binds to specific chemokine receptors, including CCR3 and CCR5, influencing cell migration and activation (Ge2017Functional; Kim2021CCL8). CCL8 is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer, where it can enhance tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis by interacting with the tumor microenvironment (Barbai2015The; Lou2022CCL8). The gene's expression levels and interactions with receptors make it a significant focus of research in understanding immune responses and disease progression.

## Structure
The CCL8 protein, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 8, has a mature form with a molecular weight of approximately 8.9 kDa, which aligns with its theoretical molecular weight (Hori2008CCL8; Ge2017Functional). The primary structure of CCL8 consists of a sequence of 78 amino acids following a signal peptide of 19 amino acids, resulting in a mature protein mass of 8972.65 Da (Hori2008CCL8). 

The secondary structure of CCL8 includes a mixture of α helices and β-sheets, with circular dichroism analysis estimating 22% α helix and 18% β-sheets. This is consistent with crystal structure analysis, which shows 25% α helix and 20% β-sheets, indicating that the protein is well-folded (Ge2017Functional). 

There is no specific information provided on the tertiary or quaternary structure of CCL8 in the available context. The protein is known to interact with the chemokine receptor CCR3, suggesting its role as a potential agonist (Ge2017Functional). The context does not mention any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for CCL8.

## Function
CCL8, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 8, is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune responses by attracting various immune cells, including monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, to sites of inflammation or infection. In healthy human cells, CCL8 functions primarily in the extracellular space, where it binds to chemokine receptors on target cells, influencing their migration and activation (Lee2017Gene; Ge2017Functional).

CCL8 is part of the CC chemokine sub-family and acts as an agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR3. This interaction is significant for leukocyte chemotaxis, which is crucial for immune surveillance and response to inflammatory stimuli (Ge2017Functional). The binding of CCL8 to CCR3 has been shown to induce internalization and chemotactic migration of CCR3-expressing cells, although it exhibits a slower binding and dissociation rate compared to other CCR3 ligands like CCL11 and CCL24 (Ge2017Functional).

In addition to its role in chemotaxis, CCL8 is involved in various biological processes and pathways, including receptor binding and chemokine activity, which are essential for its function in immune response modulation (Lee2017Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL8 gene have been implicated in various cancers and are associated with differing prognoses depending on the cancer type. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), higher expression levels of CCL8 are linked to poorer overall survival rates, particularly in non-germinal center B cell (non-GCB) type DLBCL, which is associated with a worse prognosis compared to the germinal center B cell (GCB) type (Lou2022CCL8). In breast cancer, CCL8 is negatively associated with patient prognosis, enhancing tumor cell activity and metastasis by regulating the tumor microenvironment. Its pro-cancer effects are mitigated when macrophages are depleted, indicating its role in recruiting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that contribute to tumor progression (Tang2019Weighted; Lou2022CCL8).

In melanoma, CCL8 is implicated in metastasis formation, particularly in lung metastases. It acts as a chemoattractant, influencing the migration potential of melanoma cells. The expression of CCL8 is higher in circulating tumor cells and metastases compared to primary tumors, suggesting its role in the metastatic cascade (Barbai2015The). These findings highlight the complex role of CCL8 in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic biomarker.

## Interactions
CCL8, also known as monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2), is involved in various interactions with chemokine receptors. It binds to the chemokine receptor CCR3, acting as a potential agonist with a dissociation constant (K_D) of 1.2 × 10^-7 M, which is comparable to native agonists like CCL11 and CCL24. However, the association and dissociation rates for CCL8 are slower than those of CCL11 and CCL24, suggesting a similar binding affinity but with slower kinetic binding rates (Ge2017Functional).

In the context of cancer, CCL8 mediates interactions between endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, specifically MDA-MB-231 cells. It is crucial for the upregulation of IL-8 expression in these cancer cells, enhancing their invasive capacity. CCL8 interacts with the CCR5 receptor on MDA-MB-231 cells, and the use of maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, reduces IL-8 expression and invasiveness (Kim2021CCL8).

In mouse models, CCL8 acts as a specific agonist for the CCR8 receptor, promoting the migration of T helper 2 (TH2) cells, which is relevant in the context of atopic dermatitis (Islam2011Mouse).
