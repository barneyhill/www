# RGS14

## Overview
RGS14 is a gene that encodes the protein Regulator of G protein Signaling 14, which is a multifunctional signaling protein involved in various cellular processes. The RGS14 protein is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is known for its role in modulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. It contains several conserved domains, including an RGS domain, tandem Ras binding domains, and a GoLoco/G protein regulatory motif, which contribute to its diverse functional capabilities (Shu2010RGS14; Harbin2021RGS14). RGS14 is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it regulates synaptic plasticity and is highly expressed in the hippocampus, influencing learning and memory processes (Squires2020Human; Harbin2021RGS14). Additionally, RGS14 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including psychiatric disorders and cardiac dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Harbin2021RGS14).

## Structure
RGS14 is a multifunctional protein with a molecular weight of approximately 62 kDa, comprising several conserved domains and motifs that contribute to its role in signal transduction. The primary structure of RGS14 includes an RGS domain, tandem Ras binding domains (R1/R2), and a GoLoco/G protein regulatory motif (GPR) (Shu2010RGS14; Harbin2021RGS14). The RGS domain functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gαi/o proteins, while the GPR motif acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for inactive Gαi1/3 proteins (Mittal2004The; Shu2010RGS14).

The secondary and tertiary structures of RGS14 are characterized by distinct conformational changes upon binding to G protein subunits. The RGS domain and Ras binding domains exhibit stability, while the GPR motif is more dynamic (Brown2015Integration). The protein also contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and a nuclear export sequence (NES), facilitating its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Harbin2021RGS14).

RGS14 interacts with various proteins, including 14-3-3 at phospho-Ser218, calcium/calmodulin, and Ca2+/CaM kinase II, indicating potential post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Harbin2021RGS14). The presence of a PDZ-recognition motif at the C-terminus in humans and primates suggests additional protein-protein interactions (Harbin2021RGS14).

## Function
RGS14 is a multifunctional signaling protein that plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus. It acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gαi/o proteins, accelerating the termination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. This activity is crucial for maintaining homeostatic control over cAMP and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways, such as PKA activation, in postsynaptic neurons (Hollinger2001RGS14; Harbin2021RGS14).

RGS14 is highly expressed in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus, where it naturally suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity linked to learning and memory. The protein's ability to inhibit LTP is partly due to its interactions with calcium signaling pathways, including the modulation of calcium transients from NMDAR and L-type VGCCs, which are essential for activating calcium-dependent signaling pathways (Harbin2021RGS14; Squires2020Human).

RGS14 also functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, with its localization between the nucleus and dendritic spines being crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity. Genetic variants that disrupt this shuttling can impair RGS14's ability to suppress synaptic plasticity, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neuronal function (Harbin2021RGS14; Squires2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RGS14 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the brain, RGS14 is associated with psychiatric disorders characterized by high emotional reactivity, such as PTSD and anxiety disorders. Its manipulation could be beneficial in substance use disorder, particularly during withdrawal and relapse phases (Harbin2021RGS14). Genetic variants of RGS14, such as L505R and R507Q, affect its function in hippocampal neurons, impacting learning and memory processes by altering its interaction with Gαi1, which influences its ability to inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) (Harbin2021RGS14).

In the context of cardiac health, RGS14 is downregulated in failing human hearts and murine hypertrophic hearts. Its overexpression has been shown to alleviate cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, suggesting a role in cardiac remodeling (Harbin2021RGS14). In the kidney, SNPs within the RGS14 gene locus are associated with kidney dysfunction, including nephrolithiasis and reduced glomerular filtration rates (Harbin2021RGS14).

RGS14 also plays a neuroprotective role against seizure-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Loss of RGS14 leads to increased susceptibility to seizures and oxidative stress, highlighting its potential relevance in conditions like temporal lobe epilepsy (Harbin2023RGS14).

## Interactions
RGS14 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in integrating multiple signaling pathways. It forms stable complexes with inactive Giα1/3-GDP through its GPR/GoLoco domain and binds to activated Gi/oα-GTP via its RGS domain, regulating G protein signaling by acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gαi1 and Gαo subunits (Brown2015Integration; Shu2010RGS14; Hollinger2001RGS14). RGS14 also serves as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Giα subunits, inhibiting GDP dissociation (Hollinger2001RGS14).

RGS14 interacts with the Ras/Raf MAP kinase signaling pathway by binding to H-Ras and Raf kinases. It binds strongly to constitutively active H-Ras and co-localizes with Raf kinases, facilitating the assembly of a multiprotein complex involved in ERK MAPK signaling (Willard2009Regulator; Shu2010RGS14). The RBD region of RGS14 enhances its interactions with these proteins, suggesting a role in modulating their activities (Zhao2013The).

In the brain, RGS14 is part of a high molecular weight complex that includes proteins involved in AMPA receptor trafficking and actin dynamics, such as myosins and actin-binding proteins, indicating its role in synaptic plasticity (Harbin2021RGS14).
