# VSIG1

## Overview
VSIG1, or V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family, characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion processes. The VSIG1 protein is primarily expressed in the stomach and testis, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and facilitating tight junction assembly. Structurally, the protein comprises two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with a PDZ-binding motif, which is essential for interactions with ZO-1, a key structural protein of tight junctions (Gurzu2021Interaction; Kim2010Extracellular). These interactions are vital for maintaining the permeability barrier and epithelial cell polarization. In addition to its physiological roles, VSIG1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and cellular localization can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Inoue2017Characterization; Zhou2022VSet).

## Structure
The VSIG1 protein, encoded by the human VSIG1 gene, is a member of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family and is characterized by its unique structural components. It comprises two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Kim2010Extracellular). The Ig-like domains are involved in cell-cell interactions, contributing to the protein's role in adhesion processes (Kim2010Extracellular). These domains likely form beta-sheets and loops, typical of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures.

The cytoplasmic domain of VSIG1 contains a PDZ-binding motif, which is crucial for tight junction assembly by interacting with ZO-1, a central structural protein of tight junctions (Kim2010Extracellular). This interaction highlights the importance of the cytoplasmic domain in cellular signaling and structural integrity. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function, although specific modifications for VSIG1 are not detailed in the provided context.

Overall, the structural features of VSIG1, including its Ig-like domains and PDZ-binding motif, underscore its role in cell adhesion and signaling within the testis and potentially in various cancers (Kim2010Extracellular).

## Function
VSIG1 (V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion processes, primarily expressed in the stomach and testis. It is a member of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family and is characterized by two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a transmembrane domain. In healthy human cells, VSIG1 is involved in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and is crucial for tight junction assembly and epithelial cell polarization (Gurzu2021Interaction). The cytoplasmic C-terminal region of VSIG1 interacts with ZO-1, a central structural protein of tight junctions, which is essential for maintaining the permeability barrier between cells and their environment (Gurzu2021Interaction; Kim2010Extracellular).

VSIG1 is predominantly expressed in the gastric mucosa, where it is localized in the adherens junctions of glandular epithelia. It plays a critical role in the differentiation of glandular gastric epithelium, ensuring proper tissue architecture and function (Oidovsambuu2011Adhesion; Zhou2022VSet). The protein's role in cell-cell interactions and tight junction assembly suggests its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Kim2010Extracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VSIG1 gene have been associated with various cancers, impacting clinical outcomes. In gastric cancer, VSIG1 expression is significantly reduced, correlating with poor survival and clinical outcomes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of VSIG1 in gastric cancer cells has been shown to reduce proliferation and migration, indicating its potential protective role against tumor progression (Inoue2017Characterization; Zhou2022VSet). Conversely, in lung adenocarcinoma, high VSIG1 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, although it is not an independent prognostic factor (Inoue2017Characterization).

VSIG1 is also implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis. In some non-gastric carcinomas, such as colon and lung adenocarcinomas, VSIG1 is upregulated and associated with EMT genes, indicating a role in tumor metastasis (Zhou2022VSet). In gastric cancer, cytoplasmic translocation of VSIG1 is linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor overall survival, suggesting its involvement in EMT through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Satala2022Vset).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, VSIG1 expression is associated with the gastric-type subtype, and its loss, along with TTF1, correlates with shorter overall survival (Gurzu2021Interaction). These findings highlight the complex role of VSIG1 in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
VSIG1 (V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In mouse testicular germ cells, VSIG1 interacts with Sertoli cell membrane proteins through its Ig-like domains, with the first Ig-like domain being essential for this interaction. This interaction facilitates adhesion between spermatogenic and Sertoli cells, which is important for spermatogenesis (Kim2010Extracellular).

VSIG1 also associates with ZO-1, a central structural protein of tight junctions, through a PDZ-binding motif located in its cytoplasmic tail domain. This interaction is critical for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, which are important for maintaining cell polarity and barrier functions (Kim2010Extracellular).

In the context of cancer, VSIG1 has been shown to form homodimers through homophilic cis-interactions, which may contribute to its tumor suppressor functions by influencing cell adhesion and signaling pathways. However, it does not form trans-homodimers, indicating a specific mode of interaction (Inoue2017Characterization). These interactions suggest that VSIG1 plays a role in modulating cellular adhesion and signaling, potentially impacting cancer progression and metastasis.
