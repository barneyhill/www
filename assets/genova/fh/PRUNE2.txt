# PRUNE2

## Overview
PRUNE2 is a gene located on chromosome 9 (9q21.2) that encodes the protein prune homolog 2 with BCH domain, a large protein composed of 3,062 amino acids. This protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a PRUNE homology domain and a BNIP2 homology C-terminal region with a BCH domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and nucleotide binding (Iwama2011CancerRelated; Li2021PRUNE2). The PRUNE2 protein is predominantly expressed in mature nerve tissues, such as the brain and spinal cord, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining neural function and synaptic processes (Iwama2011CancerRelated). It is involved in various cellular processes, including morphogenesis, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis, and interacts with small GTPases and ERK, suggesting its involvement in cellular transformation and apoptosis (Li2012Olfaxin). PRUNE2 has clinical significance, as mutations and alterations in this gene are associated with several cancers, including prostate cancer and parathyroid carcinoma, and it has been identified as a susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (Marini2022Genetics; Yu2015WholeExome; Li2011The).

## Structure
The PRUNE2 protein is a large protein composed of 3,062 amino acid residues, encoded by a gene located on chromosome 9 (9q21.2) (Iwama2011CancerRelated). The protein structure includes several distinct domains: the N-terminal region shares homology with the PRUNE protein, while the C-terminal region corresponds to BMCC1, starting at the 360th methionine residue (Iwama2011CancerRelated). This C-terminal region contains a coiled-coil sequence, a proline-rich region, a P-loop, and a BNIP2 homology C-terminal region with a BCH domain (Iwama2011CancerRelated). The BCH domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is implicated in regulating morphogenesis, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis (Li2021PRUNE2).

PRUNE2 is transcribed into a single mRNA that covers two previously identified genes, C9orf65 and BMCC1, with the first five exons corresponding to C9orf65 and the last 11 exons to BMCC1 (Iwama2011CancerRelated). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, which may result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Iwama2011CancerRelated). The protein is known to bind to nucleotides such as 8-oxo-GTP and GTP, suggesting a role in nucleotide metabolism (Iwama2011CancerRelated).

## Function
The PRUNE2 gene encodes a protein that is highly expressed in mature nerve tissues and is involved in various cellular processes. PRUNE2 is associated with nucleotide binding, particularly with 8-oxo-GTP, an oxidized form of GTP, suggesting a role in cellular signaling or protection against oxidative damage (Iwama2011CancerRelated). The protein is composed of 3,062 residues and includes a PRUNE homology domain and a BMCC1 sequence, which are involved in its interaction with nucleotides (Iwama2011CancerRelated).

PRUNE2 is predominantly expressed in adult nerve tissues, such as the dorsal root ganglia, whole brain, and spinal cord, indicating its role in the maintenance and function of mature nervous systems (Iwama2011CancerRelated). Immunohistochemistry studies have shown strong expression of PRUNE2 in DRG neurons, suggesting its involvement in neural function (Iwama2011CancerRelated).

The protein is also implicated in synaptic functions, particularly in the olfactory system, where a novel isoform, Olfaxin, is expressed. Olfaxin is involved in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, potentially contributing to olfactory learning and perception (Li2012Olfaxin). PRUNE2's interaction with the Rho family of small GTPases and ERK suggests its involvement in cellular transformation and apoptosis (Li2012Olfaxin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRUNE2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In parathyroid carcinoma (PC), PRUNE2 mutations are found in approximately 18% of cases, suggesting a role in malignant carcinogenesis. These mutations, both germline and somatic, are often located in exon 8, indicating a potential mutational hotspot. The presence of PRUNE2 mutations in PC samples, both with and without CDC73 mutations, suggests a possible synergistic effect in cancer development (Marini2022Genetics; Yu2015WholeExome).

In prostate cancer, PRUNE2 acts as a tumor suppressor and is regulated by the long noncoding RNA PCA3. PCA3 down-regulates PRUNE2, promoting malignant cell growth. Alterations in PRUNE2 expression, regulated by PCA3, are associated with prostate cancer progression (Salameh2015PRUNE2).

PRUNE2 is also linked to neuroblastoma, leiomyosarcoma, and colorectal cancer, where its expression levels correlate with tumorigenic activity. Increased PRUNE2 protein levels are associated with a favorable prognosis in neuroblastoma and leiomyosarcoma, while lower levels are linked to higher tumorigenic activity in colorectal cancer (Storvall2023Novel). Additionally, PRUNE2 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease and a marker for leiomyosarcomas (Li2011The).

## Interactions
PRUNE2, a protein encoded by the PRUNE2 gene, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with nucleotides, specifically binding to 8-oxo-GTP, an oxidized form of GTP, as well as GTP itself (Iwama2011CancerRelated). This interaction was confirmed through pull-down assays using GTP-Sepharoses and 8-oxo-GTP-Sepharoses, where PRUNE2 was shown to bind these nucleotides (Iwama2011CancerRelated).

PRUNE2 also interacts with PCA3, a long noncoding RNA, in the context of prostate cancer. PCA3 regulates PRUNE2 through a mechanism involving RNA editing mediated by ADAR proteins. This interaction forms a double-stranded RNA complex that influences PRUNE2 levels, impacting prostate cancer progression (Salameh2015PRUNE2).

In terms of protein interactions, PRUNE2 is known to coimmunoprecipitate with RhoA and Nm23-H1. The BCH domain of PRUNE2 inhibits RhoA, affecting cell adhesion and migration, while the DHHA2 domain interacts with Nm23-H1, a metastasis suppressor (Salameh2015PRUNE2). These interactions suggest that PRUNE2 plays a role in inhibiting RhoA signaling and influencing cellular dynamics.
