# MYO5B

## Overview
The MYO5B gene encodes the myosin Vb protein, a class V myosin motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in polarized epithelial cells. Myosin Vb is involved in the trafficking of organelles and vesicles along actin filaments, facilitating the transport of specific apical cargo proteins to the plasma membrane. This protein is characterized by its interaction with small GTPases, such as Rab11a and Rab8a, which are essential for its function in recycling endosomes and maintaining epithelial cell polarity (Knowles2014Myosin; Vogel2015Cargoselective). Mutations in MYO5B are linked to microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) and cholestatic liver disease, underscoring its importance in cellular organization and function (Ruemmele2010Lossoffunction; Aldrian2021Congenital).

## Structure
The MYO5B gene encodes the myosin Vb protein, a motor protein involved in intracellular transport. Myosin Vb is a homodimer, meaning it consists of two identical subunits, and functions as a highly processive motor protein activated by calmodulin binding (Knowles2014Myosin). The protein is composed of several distinct domains: an N-terminal motor domain, a central light chain binding domain, and a C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain (Knowles2014Myosin). The motor domain is responsible for generating force and contains ATP- and actin-binding sites (Yao2016Identification). The central domain acts as a lever arm, facilitated by calmodulin binding, which is crucial for the protein's movement along actin filaments (Knowles2014Myosin).

The tail domain of myosin Vb is variable and interacts with specific cellular partners, including small GTPases like Rab11a, Rab8a, and Rab10, which are important for its role in recycling endosomes (van2013An). The predominant splice variant of MYO5B in enterocytes lacks exon D, affecting its interaction with RAB10 (Knowles2014Myosin). Mutations in MYO5B can lead to microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper cellular function (van2013An).

## Function
The MYO5B gene encodes the motor protein myosin Vb, which is crucial for intracellular transport processes in healthy human cells. Myosin Vb is involved in the trafficking of organelles and vesicles along actin filaments, particularly in polarized epithelial cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and facilitating selective apical exocytosis by interacting with Rab small GTPases, such as Rab8 and Rab11. These interactions are essential for the transport of specific apical cargo proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3), to the apical plasma membrane (Vogel2015Cargoselective; SwiateckaUrban2007Myosin).

Myosin Vb forms a ternary complex with Rab11a and the Rab11 family interacting protein 2 (FIP2), which is critical for the recycling of endosomes to the plasma membrane. This process is mediated by the actin-filament-dependent transport of recycling endosomes, where Rab11a binds to the globular tail domain of myosin Vb, activating its motor function (Ji2019Regulation). The proper functioning of myosin Vb is essential for the homeostasis of polarized epithelial cells, impacting physiological roles such as nutrient absorption and cellular signaling (Vogel2015Cargoselective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO5B gene are primarily associated with microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), a severe congenital enteropathy characterized by intractable diarrhea and malabsorption, often requiring long-term parenteral nutrition or small bowel transplantation (Ruemmele2010Lossoffunction; Knowles2014Myosin). MVID is marked by the absence of microvilli on enterocytes and the presence of intracellular vacuoles lined by microvilli (Ruemmele2010Lossoffunction). MYO5B mutations disrupt the normal trafficking and localization of apical proteins in enterocytes, leading to the characteristic microvillus inclusions (Knowles2014Myosin).

In addition to MVID, MYO5B mutations can cause cholestatic liver disease, clinically similar to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), characterized by jaundice, pruritus, and hepatomegaly, often with normal gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (Gonzales2016MYO5B; Aldrian2021Congenital). The MYO5B-PFIC phenotype is associated with missense mutations that preserve some intestinal function but disrupt bile canalicular transporter localization in hepatocytes (Aldrian2021Congenital).

The MYO5B-MIXED phenotype involves both intestinal and hepatic symptoms, often due to a combination of missense or late-truncating mutations with a loss-of-function mutation (Aldrian2021Congenital). These findings highlight the critical role of MYO5B in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and intracellular protein trafficking, with mutations leading to significant clinical consequences.

## Interactions
MYO5B, a class V myosin, interacts with several Rab GTPases, which are crucial for its role in intracellular transport. It specifically binds to Rab11a, enhancing its ATPase activity, which is essential for its motor function. This interaction is unique to Rab11a, as other Rabs like Rab7, Rab8a, Rab10, and Rab14 do not significantly affect MYO5B's ATPase activity (Ji2019Regulation). MYO5B also interacts with Rab11b, particularly in its active GTP-bound form, which enhances MYO5B's motor function and facilitates the transport of fibronectin (FN1)-containing vesicles in human pleural mesothelial cells (HPMCs) (Sakai2022Myo5b).

MYO5B's interaction with Rab11a and Rab11b is critical for the recycling of apical membranes and the secretion of FN1, respectively. In the context of microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), MYO5B's interaction with Rab11a is disrupted, leading to defects in apical membrane recycling (Knowles2014Myosin). Additionally, MYO5B interacts with Rab8a, which is essential for the correct delivery of apical vesicles and epithelial polarization (Roland2011Rab). These interactions highlight MYO5B's role in vesicle transport and cellular organization.
