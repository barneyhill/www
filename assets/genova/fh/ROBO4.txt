# ROBO4

## Overview
ROBO4 is a gene that encodes the roundabout guidance receptor 4, a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in endothelial cells. This receptor is a member of the Roundabout receptor family, which is known for its role in guiding cell migration and angiogenesis. Unlike other Robo family members, ROBO4 is not involved in neuronal processes but is crucial for vascular development and function. The protein encoded by ROBO4 is characterized by a unique structure, featuring a shorter extracellular region with two immunoglobulin (Ig) and two fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, and a cytoplasmic region containing CC0 and CC2 motifs. These structural features facilitate its interactions with various proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell motility, such as Mena, WASP, and NWASP (Sheldon2008Active; Bisiak2019Structure). ROBO4's function is vital for maintaining vascular integrity and stability, playing a significant role in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Sheldon2008Active; Park2003Robo4).

## Structure
ROBO4, a member of the Roundabout receptor family, is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and plays a role in angiogenesis and cell migration. Its structure is distinct from other Robo receptors, featuring a shorter extracellular region with two immunoglobulin (Ig) and two fibronectin type III (FN3) domains (Bisiak2019Structure). Unlike other Robo proteins, ROBO4 lacks the third and fourth Ig domains, which are important for homophilic interactions, and is monomeric (Bisiak2019Structure). The cytoplasmic region of ROBO4 contains CC0 and CC2 motifs, with the CC2 motif mediating interaction with Mena, a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration (Bisiak2019Structure).

The interaction network of ROBO4 is not well-mapped, and its interaction with Slit2 is debated. Some studies suggest that Slit functions on ROBO4 are mediated through receptor heterodimers, such as Robo1/Robo4, which promote cell migration by sequestering Robo1 in intracellular vesicles (Bisiak2019Structure). ROBO4 can recruit proteins like WASP and NWASP, which are involved in filopodia formation, and Paxillin, which increases vascular stability by regulating GTPase Arf6 activity (Bisiak2019Structure). The specific binding partners for ROBO4 remain unclear, and its structural details are less understood compared to other Robo family members (Morlot2007Structural).

## Function
ROBO4, also known as roundabout guidance receptor 4, is a vascular-specific receptor that plays a critical role in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. It is primarily expressed in the vascular endothelium during embryonic development and continues to be active in adult tissues, particularly in the vasculature of the heart, lung, and brain (Park2003Robo4). Unlike other members of the Robo family, ROBO4 is not involved in neuronal processes but is essential for vascular development and function.

ROBO4 interacts with Slit proteins, which are known ligands for Robo receptors, to inhibit endothelial cell migration. This interaction provides a chemorepulsive cue to sprouting endothelial cells, thereby regulating angiogenesis and maintaining vascular patterning (Park2003Robo4). The protein is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through its association with actin-modifying proteins such as Mena, WASP, and NWASP, which are crucial for cell motility and structure (Sheldon2008Active).

ROBO4's function is vital for the formation of organized vascular networks, ensuring proper organogenesis and efficient nutrient and waste transport in the body (Park2003Robo4). Its role in endothelial cell motility and angiogenesis highlights its importance in maintaining vascular integrity and stability (Sheldon2008Active).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ROBO4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cardiovascular health, ROBO4 variants are associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (AscAA). These conditions often present together and are linked to impaired endothelial barrier function, which may lead to pathological remodeling of the aortic media (Gould2018ROBO4). The study of ROBO4 in mouse models has shown that mutations can result in aortic valve defects and dysfunction, suggesting a genetic predisposition to these cardiovascular anomalies (Gould2018ROBO4).

In oncology, ROBO4 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor endothelia compared to normal tissues, playing a role in tumor angiogenesis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high ROBO4 expression correlates with increased microvessel density and is associated with poorer prognostic outcomes, including shorter disease-free and overall survival (Gołos2019The; Chen2015Clinical).

ROBO4 is also involved in angiogenesis-related diseases, with its expression linked to conditions such as systemic sclerosis and preeclampsia, where altered ROBO4 levels contribute to abnormal vascular development and function (Dai2019Regulatory). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ROBO4 in various pathological contexts.

## Interactions
ROBO4, a member of the Roundabout receptor family, is involved in several key protein interactions that influence endothelial cell behavior and vascular integrity. ROBO4 interacts with UNC5B, a vascular-specific Netrin receptor, to maintain vessel integrity and inhibit angiogenesis. This interaction is crucial for counteracting VEGF-mediated signaling, which can lead to increased vascular permeability (Koch2011Robo4). The binding between ROBO4 and UNC5B is characterized by high affinity, with a dissociation constant of 12 nM, indicating a strong and specific interaction (Koch2011Robo4).

ROBO4 also interacts with proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, such as WASP, NWASP, and Mena. These interactions suggest a role for ROBO4 in cytoskeletal rearrangement and endothelial cell motility. The binding occurs through the proline-rich domains of WASP and NWASP, facilitating filopodia formation and cell movement (Sheldon2008Active).

ROBO4 forms heterodimers with ROBO1, another Roundabout receptor, which is essential for its signaling function in endothelial cells. This interaction is significant for angiogenesis and cell motility, as ROBO1 is necessary for ROBO4-induced filopodia formation (Sheldon2008Active).
