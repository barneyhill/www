# IRAK4

## Overview
IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein, which plays a critical role in the innate immune system. The IRAK4 protein is involved in the signaling pathways of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are essential for initiating inflammatory responses. As a kinase, IRAK4 facilitates the phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, leading to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), thereby promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (KuboMurai2007IRAK4dependent; Flannery2010The). The protein's structure includes a kinase domain and a death domain, which are crucial for its function in forming the Myddosome complex, a key component in TLR/IL-1R signaling (Gosu2012Molecular; Lin2010Helical). Mutations in the IRAK4 gene can lead to immunodeficiencies and autoinflammatory conditions, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Cooray2023Neuroinflammation; Gobin2017IRAK4).

## Structure
IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase with a primary structure that includes a kinase domain (KD) and a death domain (DD) (Gosu2012Molecular). The secondary structure of IRAK4 features an N-terminal lobe with antiparallel β-strands and an α-helix, and a C-terminal lobe composed exclusively of α-helices (Gosu2014Structural). The kinase domain adopts a classical protein kinase fold, with a 5-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet and a helix in the N-terminal lobe, and an alpha-helical C-terminal lobe (Gosu2012Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase, with key motifs such as the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) and His-Arg-Asp (HRD) motifs playing crucial roles in its catalytic mechanism (Gosu2014Structural). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation at residues T342, T345, and S346, are essential for IRAK4 activation (Gosu2014Structural).

IRAK4 can form quaternary structures by assembling into complexes with other proteins, such as the MyD88:IRAK4:IRAK2 death domain complex, which is a critical component in TLR/IL-1R signaling (Lin2010Helical). This complex forms a left-handed helical oligomer, demonstrating the versatile assembly and regulation of DD complexes in signal transduction.

## Function
IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by participating in signaling pathways initiated by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In healthy human cells, IRAK4 is essential for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are crucial for inflammatory responses (KuboMurai2007IRAK4dependent; Flannery2010The). 

IRAK4 is involved in the formation of the Myddosome complex through its interaction with MyD88, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways that result in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Yamamoto2014Functional). The kinase activity of IRAK4 is necessary for the phosphorylation and activation of downstream molecules like TAK1 and IKKβ, which in turn activate transcription factors such as IRF5, promoting the expression of inflammatory cytokines (Cushing2017IRAK4). 

IRAK4's kinase activity is also crucial for maintaining the stability of cytokine mRNA, particularly in response to viral infections, and for the production of type I interferons (Kim2007A). Despite its critical role in these pathways, some aspects of immune response, such as NF-κB activation, can occur independently of IRAK4 kinase activity (Koziczak‐Holbro2008IRAK‐4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IRAK4 gene are associated with a primary immunodeficiency known as IRAK4 deficiency. This condition is characterized by an increased susceptibility to severe pyogenic bacterial infections, particularly from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These infections often manifest as meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, abscesses, sepsis, and cellulitis, primarily affecting children under the age of two (Verma2023Case; Nishimura2020IRAK4; Gobin2017IRAK4). Despite normal antibody levels, patients with IRAK4 deficiency may have defective glycan-specific antibody responses, and the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (Gobin2017IRAK4).

In addition to immunodeficiency, recent studies have linked IRAK4 mutations to autoinflammatory conditions. Bi-allelic mutations in IRAK4 have been associated with a novel syndrome characterized by neuroinflammation, systemic autoinflammation, splenomegaly, and anemia (Cooray2023Neuroinflammation). These mutations can lead to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to significant immune dysregulation (Cooray2023Neuroinflammation).

IRAK4 mutations can also result in hyporesponsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), impairing the signaling pathways crucial for an effective inflammatory response (Medvedev2003Distinct). This defect in immune signaling can lead to recurrent bacterial infections and broader immune system dysfunction (Medvedev2003Distinct).

## Interactions
IRAK4 is a key component in the formation of the Myddosome complex, which is crucial for signal transduction in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) pathways. The Myddosome is an oligomeric assembly consisting of MyD88 and IRAK4, with stoichiometries of 7:4 or 8:4, where MyD88 forms a ring structure stabilized by IRAK4 molecules (Motshwene2009An). IRAK4 interacts with MyD88 through its death domain, facilitating the recruitment of IRAK1 into the complex, which is essential for downstream signaling (Lin2010Helical).

IRAK4 also interacts with IRAK2, forming a stable complex with MyD88 before IRAK2 recruitment. This interaction is mediated by specific residues that ensure molecular complementarity and surface electrostatics, crucial for the hierarchical assembly of the Myddosome (Lin2010Helical).

In addition to its role in the Myddosome, IRAK4 interacts with p47 phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, in granulocytes. This interaction is constitutive and independent of LPS stimulation, suggesting a role for IRAK4 in the regulation of oxidative responses (Pacquelet2007Crosstalk).
