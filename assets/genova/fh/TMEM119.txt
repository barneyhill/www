# TMEM119

## Overview
TMEM119 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 119, which is predominantly expressed in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). This protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which anchor it to the cell membrane, playing a crucial role in microglial activation and homeostasis. TMEM119 is involved in various cellular processes, including the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and the regulation of microglial activity, thereby maintaining CNS homeostasis (Ruan2020A; Satoh2019Microglia). The protein's expression is specific to the CNS, distinguishing microglia from other myeloid cells, and is implicated in several signaling pathways that influence cancer progression and cellular behavior (Sun2021TMEM119; Yang2021Transmembrane). TMEM119's expression is altered in various neurological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases (Bonham2019The; Satoh2019Microglia).

## Structure
TMEM119 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its transmembrane domains, which anchor it to the cell membrane, facilitating its role in microglial activation and homeostasis. The protein's structure is integral to its function within the central nervous system, where it is predominantly expressed in microglia. These transmembrane domains are crucial for maintaining the protein's position and function within the cellular membrane.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are known to occur in TMEM119. These modifications can influence the protein's function and stability, potentially affecting its role in microglial activation. Glycosylation, in particular, may play a role in the protein's structural integrity and its interactions with other cellular components.

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMEM119 are not provided, the presence of transmembrane domains and post-translational modifications suggests a complex structure that supports its functional roles in the immune response of the central nervous system. The exact nature of these structural features and their implications for TMEM119's function in microglial cells remain areas of interest for further research.

## Function
TMEM119 is a transmembrane protein specifically expressed in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). It plays a crucial role in maintaining the unique identity of microglia, distinguishing them from other myeloid cells such as circulating macrophages (Ruan2020A). TMEM119 is involved in the regulation of microglial activity, particularly in maintaining homeostasis within the CNS. Under healthy conditions, TMEM119 is highly expressed in microglia, indicating its role in steady-state brain maintenance (Satoh2019Microglia).

The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, cell debris, and abnormal protein aggregates. This function is crucial for the clearance of potentially harmful materials and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Ruan2022A). TMEM119 is also implicated in the activation of microglia, although its expression is downregulated in reactive microglia during neuroinflammatory responses (Ruan2022A).

TMEM119 is structurally similar to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch proteins, suggesting it may undergo cleavage into extracellular and intracellular domain fragments, which could be involved in its function (Ruan2022A). This protein is not detected in peripheral lymphoid organs or blood, highlighting its specific role within the CNS (Ruan2020A).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM119 is a gene encoding a transmembrane protein that serves as a specific marker for microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. Alterations in TMEM119 expression have been associated with various neurological conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), TMEM119 expression is upregulated in affected brain regions, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Bonham2019The). The expression of TMEM119 is also reduced in disease-associated microglia (DAM) that accumulate at sites of neurodegeneration, indicating its involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Satoh2019Microglia).

In the context of glioma, TMEM119 expression is enriched in glioma-associated microglia compared to monocytes/macrophages, although its expression decreases in glioma-associated microglia compared to healthy microglia, suggesting altered microglial function in tumor environments (Haage2019Comprehensive). TMEM119 expression is also affected in cerebrovascular conditions such as stroke and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), where its expression decreases, indicating a shift in microglial phenotype under inflammatory conditions (Honarpisheh2020Potential).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of TMEM119 in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, although the exact mechanisms and implications of its altered expression remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
TMEM119 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways, influencing cancer progression and cellular behavior. In ovarian cancer, TMEM119 regulates the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), a protein involved in cancer progression. The downregulation of TMEM119 leads to decreased PDGFRB expression, which in turn reduces the viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration of ovarian cancer cells. TMEM119 overexpression activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, which are key components in cancer progression (Sun2021TMEM119).

In breast cancer, TMEM119 interacts with β-catenin, a central player in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction enhances β-catenin's stability and transcriptional activity, forming a positive feedback loop that increases TMEM119 expression. This loop is crucial for maintaining the stemness of breast cancer cells, as β-catenin directly binds to the TMEM119 promoter (Yang2021Transmembrane).

In osteosarcoma, TMEM119 is associated with the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway, influencing cell migration and invasion. TMEM119 overexpression promotes these processes, which can be reversed by TGF-β or BMP inhibitors, indicating an interaction with components of this pathway (Jiang2017Upregulation).
