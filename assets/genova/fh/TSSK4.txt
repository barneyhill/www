# TSSK4

## Overview
TSSK4, or testis-specific serine kinase 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the serine/threonine kinase family, which is characterized by its role in phosphorylating serine and threonine residues on target proteins. The TSSK4 protein is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a critical role in spermatogenesis by contributing to the formation and function of the sperm tail. This kinase is involved in key cellular processes through its interactions with proteins such as outer dense fiber protein 2 (Odf2) and HSP90β, impacting sperm motility and cellular signaling pathways. Beyond its reproductive functions, TSSK4 has been implicated in non-reproductive tissues, such as in the regulation of apoptosis in pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting its broader biological significance (Chen2021TSSK4; Wang2016Testisspecific).

## Structure
The TSSK4 protein, encoded by the TSSK4 gene, is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain known as S_TKc. This domain is typical for the serine/threonine protein kinase family and is located at positions 25-303 in variant X1 and 25-293 in variant X2 of the protein in tree shrews (Li2021cDNA). The tertiary structure of TSSK4 has been predicted using protein kinase templates, indicating a spatial structure similar to other proteins in the kinase group, with high reliability and coverage rates of 83% and 86% for variants X1 and X2, respectively (Li2021cDNA).

TSSK4 is a hydrophilic protein without transmembrane regions or signal peptides, suggesting it is not secreted and is localized in the cytoplasm (Li2021cDNA). The protein undergoes phosphorylation, with variant X1 having 38 phosphorylation sites and variant X2 having 35, including serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Li2021cDNA). The protein is considered unstable, with a stability coefficient of around 43 for both variants (Li2021cDNA). Information on specific primary, secondary, or quaternary structures, as well as prominent folds or splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
TSSK4 (testis-specific serine kinase 4) is a protein kinase predominantly expressed in the testes, playing a crucial role in spermatogenesis. It is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins, a key posttranslational modification that regulates various cellular processes. TSSK4 is specifically expressed in the testis and is located in the acrosome of the spermatid, where it participates in the formation of the normal structure of the sperm tail (Wang2015Cloning; Chen2021TSSK4). 

TSSK4 phosphorylates the outer dense fiber protein 2 (Odf2) at serine 76, a modification important for sperm motility and structure. This phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining the autophosphorylation activity of TSSK4 at threonine 197, which is essential for its kinase activity and affects sperm motility and flagellum structure (Wang2016Testisspecific). 

In addition to its role in the testes, TSSK4 has been implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways in other tissues. It interacts with HSP90β, affecting the AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular survival. This interaction suggests that TSSK4 may have broader roles in cell biology beyond its function in spermatogenesis (Chen2021TSSK4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TSSK4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in male fertility and pulmonary fibrosis. In the context of male fertility, TSSK4 is crucial for spermatogenesis and sperm motility. Alterations in TSSK4 expression or function can lead to impaired sperm structure and reduced motility, contributing to conditions such as subfertility, azoospermia, and severe oligospermia (Wang2016Testisspecific; Zhang2023Broad). TSSK4 phosphorylates the ODF2 protein at serine 76, which is essential for maintaining sperm tail structure and function. Deficiency in TSSK4 results in decreased sperm motility and impaired sperm structure, highlighting its role in male reproductive health (Wang2016Testisspecific).

In pulmonary fibrosis, TSSK4 is upregulated in alveolar epithelial type-II cells, where it facilitates fibrosis by restricting HSP90-AKT signaling and inducing apoptosis. This upregulation is associated with lung tissue damage and fibrotic responses, suggesting that TSSK4 plays a crucial role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting TSSK4 could offer therapeutic potential in treating pulmonary injury and fibrosis (Chen2021TSSK4).

## Interactions
TSSK4, a testis-specific serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in spermatogenesis and other cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of TSSK4 is with the outer dense fiber protein 2 (Odf2), where TSSK4 phosphorylates Odf2 at serine 76. This phosphorylation is essential for maintaining sperm motility and structure, as well as for the autophosphorylation activity of TSSK4 at threonine 197 (Wang2016Testisspecific).

In the context of pulmonary fibrosis, TSSK4 interacts with the HSP90-AKT signaling pathway. TSSK4 phosphorylates HSP90β at serine 255, which inhibits its ATPase activity and reduces its chaperone function on AKT. This interaction leads to diminished AKT kinase activity, promoting apoptosis in alveolar epithelial type-II cells (Chen2021TSSK4). The interaction between TSSK4 and HSP90β is significant in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular survival pathways, highlighting TSSK4's role in both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues (Chen2021TSSK4).
