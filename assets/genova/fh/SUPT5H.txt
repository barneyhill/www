# SUPT5H

## Overview
SUPT5H is a gene that encodes the SPT5 protein, a key component of the DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor (DSIF) complex, which is integral to the process of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The SPT5 protein, categorized as an elongation factor, plays a pivotal role in regulating transcriptional pausing and resumption, thereby influencing gene expression and ensuring proper mRNA synthesis and processing. This regulation is crucial for cellular growth and differentiation. SUPT5H interacts with the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor-b (P-TEFb) complex to facilitate transcription elongation and overcome transcriptional pausing, which is essential for the phosphorylation of the RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain (RNAPII-CTD) (Pirngruber2009Insights; Wen2019The). The gene's involvement in chromatin modifications and its potential implications in diseases such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and pathology (Zou2021PIWIL4).

## Function
SUPT5H encodes the SPT5 protein, a component of the DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor (DSIF) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, SUPT5H is involved in regulating transcriptional pausing and resumption, influencing gene expression. This regulation is essential for proper mRNA synthesis and processing, impacting cellular growth and differentiation (Pirngruber2009Insights; Wen2019The).

SUPT5H, as part of the DSIF complex, interacts with the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor-b (P-TEFb) complex to facilitate transcription elongation and overcome transcriptional pausing. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of the RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain (RNAPII-CTD), which is necessary for transcriptional regulation and co-transcriptional mRNA processing (Pirngruber2009Insights; Wen2019The).

The phosphorylation of SUPT5H by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-9 (CDK9) is significant for regulating histone modifications, particularly H3K36me3, which is important for transcription and possibly other nuclear processes (Pirngruber2009Insights). SUPT5H is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of chromatin modifications and the processing of replication-dependent histone mRNAs (Pirngruber2009Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SUPT5H gene have been associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a type of liver cancer. SUPT5H, along with PIWIL4, was identified as a survival-related differentially expressed RNA-binding protein in ICC. Both genes were found to be protective factors in tumor progression, with their expression levels significantly upregulated in ICC tissues (Zou2021PIWIL4). The study validated the expression of SUPT5H using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, showing its nuclear localization and significant upregulation in ICC. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that SUPT5H is involved in pathways such as the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial in tumorigenesis and progression (Zou2021PIWIL4).

The clinical relevance of SUPT5H was further demonstrated through a risk score that includes SUPT5H, which had independent predictive value for patient survival. Nomograms were constructed to predict 1, 2, and 3-year survival rates, suggesting that alterations in SUPT5H expression are associated with ICC and may have prognostic implications (Zou2021PIWIL4). The study highlights the potential of SUPT5H as a novel prognostic biomarker for ICC, providing insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic targets (Zou2021PIWIL4).

## Interactions
SUPT5H, also known as SPT5, is a component of the DSIF (DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. SUPT5H forms a complex with SPT4, and this Spt4/Spt5 complex is essential for stabilizing the transcription elongation machinery. The interaction between Spt4 and Spt5 is strong, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, while Spt6 shows only a weak association with Spt5 and no detectable association with Spt4 (Hartzog1998Evidence).

SUPT5H also interacts with RNA polymerase II, and this interaction is supported by genetic interactions and copurification experiments. The Spt4/Spt5 complex is tightly associated with RNA polymerase II, suggesting a role in transcription elongation (Hartzog1998Evidence). Additionally, SUPT5H is involved in the recruitment of other proteins to chromatin, such as the SWI/SNF complex, as it is specifically enriched on chromatin containing ubiquitylated H2B (H2Bub1) (ShemaYaacoby2013Systematic).

The phosphorylation of SUPT5H by P-TEFb is critical for transcription elongation, highlighting its regulatory role in gene expression (Yamada2006P-TEFb-Mediated). These interactions underscore the importance of SUPT5H in transcription regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
