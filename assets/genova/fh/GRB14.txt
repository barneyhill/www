# GRB14

## Overview
GRB14 is a gene that encodes the growth factor receptor-bound protein 14, an adaptor protein involved in the regulation of insulin signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a Ras-associating (RA) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, among others. GRB14 primarily functions as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by interacting with the insulin receptor, thereby modulating glucose metabolism and impacting cellular growth and proliferation (Depetris2009Structural; Perdereau2015Insulininduced). The protein's role extends to interactions with other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor, influencing various signaling pathways (BrowaeysPoly2010Grb14). Alterations in GRB14 expression have been linked to metabolic disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Balogh2011The; Ding2020Inhibition).

## Structure
GRB14 is an adaptor protein characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes an N-terminal proline-rich region, a Ras-associating (RA) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a BPS (between PH and SH2) region, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (Qamra2013Structural; Scharf2004Solution). The RA and PH domains form an integrated structural unit, which is crucial for binding to small GTPases and phosphoinositide lipids, respectively (Qamra2013Structural; Depetris2009Structural). The SH2 domain is unique due to a four-residue insertion at the βE strand and EF loop junction, which may influence binding specificity (Scharf2004Solution).

The BPS region acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor in the insulin receptor's kinase active site, playing a significant role in the negative regulation of insulin signaling (Depetris2009Structural). The RA-PH unit is involved in membrane recruitment and interaction with activated Ras, contributing to the protein's inhibitory potency on insulin signaling (Depetris2009Structural).

GRB14 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity (Daly1996Cloning). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
GRB14 is an adaptor protein that plays a significant role in insulin signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by binding to the insulin receptor (IR) through its BPS-SH2 domain. This interaction inhibits the receptor's catalytic activity, thereby modulating insulin signaling and impacting glucose metabolism (Depetris2009Structural; Perdereau2015Insulininduced). GRB14's inhibitory effect is more potent than that of its homolog GRB10, and it acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor in the IR's tyrosine kinase domain (Depetris2009Structural).

GRB14 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and growth by interacting with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Chfr, forming a negative feedback loop that controls insulin-induced cell division (Perdereau2015Insulininduced). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it translocates upon recruitment to activated insulin receptors (Desbuquois2013Regulation). GRB14's expression levels are associated with conditions like type 2 diabetes, as increased GRB14 mRNA levels have been observed in diabetic patients, indicating its role in maintaining glucose homeostasis (Depetris2009Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GRB14 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly thyroid cancer and metabolic disorders. In thyroid cancer, GRB14 expression correlates with increased invasiveness and metastasis. The protein interacts with tyrosine kinase receptors, such as the insulin receptor and RET, modulating pathways that control cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of GRB14 reduces these oncogenic behaviors, while overexpression enhances them, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in thyroid cancer (Balogh2011The).

In metabolic disorders, GRB14 is a negative modulator of insulin signaling, and its expression is associated with insulin resistance and glucose metabolism risk factors. Knockdown of GRB14 in mice improves glucose homeostasis without adverse cardiac effects, indicating its role in insulin resistance and potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases (Ding2020Inhibition). GRB14 expression in adipose tissue is linked to body fat distribution and metabolic outcomes, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with metabolic risks such as triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose levels (Sun2022Metabolic).

## Interactions
GRB14 is an adaptor protein that interacts with various receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor (IR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). GRB14 binds to the IR through its phosphorylated insulin receptor-interacting region (PIR) domain, inhibiting the receptor's catalytic activity by maintaining it in an inactive form. This interaction prevents dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases like PTP1B, keeping the IR in a phosphorylated state and affecting downstream signaling pathways such as Akt and ERK phosphorylation (Béréziat2002Inhibition).

GRB14 also interacts with FGFR, forming a complex with phospholipase C gamma (PLCc). This interaction involves the SH2 domain of GRB14 and the FGFR pY766 residue, which is crucial for PLCc recruitment. GRB14's binding to FGFR alters PLCc phosphorylation and activation, suggesting a role in modulating FGFR signaling (BrowaeysPoly2010Grb14).

In the retina, GRB14 acts as an inhibitor of PTP1B, with its BPS domain playing a critical role. The phosphorylation of GRB14 enhances its inhibitory effect on PTP1B, indicating a regulatory mechanism where GRB14 modulates signaling pathways by inhibiting PTP1B and activating IR signaling (Basavarajappa2011Phosphorylated).
