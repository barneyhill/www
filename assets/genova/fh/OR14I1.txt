# OR14I1

## Overview
The OR14I1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 14 subfamily I member 1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in olfactory perception and viral interactions. As a member of the olfactory receptor family, OR14I1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a role in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (E2019OR14I1). Beyond its olfactory function, OR14I1 is implicated in the infection process of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in epithelial cells, acting as a receptor for the virus's pentameric complex. This interaction is crucial for HCMV's ability to bind and enter host cells, highlighting OR14I1's role in viral pathogenesis (E2019OR14I1). The protein's involvement in the adenylate cyclase, protein kinase A, and AKT signaling pathways further underscores its significance in cellular processes related to viral entry and infection (E2019OR14I1).

## Structure
The OR14I1 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs and facilitates signal transduction across the cell membrane (E2019OR14I1). The protein is a multipass membrane protein, indicating that it spans the cell membrane multiple times, which is consistent with its role as a receptor (E2019OR14I1).

The N-terminal region of OR14I1 is significant for its function, particularly in the context of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) binding. This region can block HCMV binding and infection when represented as a synthetic peptide, highlighting its importance in the protein's interaction with viral components (E2019OR14I1). The protein's structure has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, with the crystal structure of another GPCR serving as a template. This modeling has identified regions of OR14I1 that are predicted to be exposed on the cell surface, which are critical for its receptor function (E2019OR14I1).

OR14I1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization, although specific details on these modifications for OR14I1 are not provided in the context. The protein is an orphan receptor, meaning its natural ligand is unknown, which limits detailed study of its signaling processes (E2019OR14I1).

## Function
The OR14I1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). These receptors are traditionally associated with the detection of odor molecules, initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR14I1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation (E2019OR14I1).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR14I1 is also widely distributed in various organs and systems, indicating a significant biological function beyond smell (E2019OR14I1). In epithelial cells, OR14I1 functions as a receptor for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pentameric complex, playing a crucial role in the virus's ability to bind to and infect these cells. This interaction is essential for defining the viral epithelial cell tropism, as OR14I1 facilitates HCMV binding and entry through endocytosis, a process that is pH-dependent (E2019OR14I1).

The protein is involved in the activation of the adenylate cyclase (AC), protein kinase A (PKA), and AKT signaling pathways, which are necessary for HCMV infection in epithelial cells (E2019OR14I1). This highlights OR14I1's role in mediating cellular processes that are critical for viral entry and infection, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing HCMV transmission and associated diseases (E2019OR14I1).

## Clinical Significance
The OR14I1 gene, a member of the olfactory receptor family, has been identified as a receptor for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pentameric complex, playing a crucial role in the virus's infection of epithelial cells. Alterations in the expression or function of OR14I1 can significantly impact HCMV's ability to infect these cells, which is associated with various diseases. The interaction between OR14I1 and HCMV is essential for the virus's epithelial cell tropism, and disruptions in this interaction can influence the transmission and pathogenesis of HCMV-related diseases such as retinitis, gastroenteritis, and encephalitis (E2019OR14I1).

Research has shown that a peptide representing the N terminus of OR14I1 can block HCMV infection, suggesting that targeting OR14I1 interactions could be a therapeutic strategy (E2019OR14I1). The gene's involvement in the adenylate cyclase/PKA/AKT signaling pathway is also crucial for HCMV entry and infection, and alterations in this pathway can affect viral infectivity (E2019OR14I1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OR14I1 in HCMV infections and suggest potential avenues for developing antiviral therapies.

## Interactions
OR14I1, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in interactions with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pentameric complex (PC), which is crucial for the virus's infection of epithelial cells. This interaction facilitates HCMV binding and entry into epithelial cells, highlighting OR14I1's role in viral epithelial cell tropism (E2019OR14I1). The binding of HCMV to OR14I1 is mediated by the PC, and this interaction can be inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against PC subunits or by a synthetic peptide representing the N-terminal sequence of OR14I1, indicating a specific interaction site (E2019OR14I1).

OR14I1 also participates in the activation of the adenylate cyclase (AC)/protein kinase A (PKA)/AKT signaling pathway, which is necessary for HCMV entry and infection. This signaling cascade is initiated by OR14I1 and involves adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A activities (Lee2020Systems; E2019OR14I1). OR14I1's engagement in these pathways enhances HCMV infection, while its depletion reduces AKT and PKA activation (E2019OR14I1). OR14I1 also mediates endocytosis of HCMV, as evidenced by increased endocytosis activity and colocalization of virion-derived proteins with transferrin in infected cells (E2019OR14I1).
