# MBTPS2

## Overview
The MBTPS2 gene encodes a membrane-bound protease known as membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase, site 2 (S2P), which is integral to the process of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). This protease is characterized by its zinc metalloprotease activity, facilitated by conserved motifs such as HExxH and LDG, and is primarily located within the Golgi membrane (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). MBTPS2 plays a crucial role in cellular signal transduction, particularly in the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which are vital for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2; Tibbo2023MBTPS2). Mutations in the MBTPS2 gene are associated with several X-linked disorders, including Ichthyosis Follicularis, Atrichia, and Photophobia (IFAP) syndrome, Keratosis Follicularis Spinulosa Decalvans (KFSD), and Olmsted syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Aten2010Keratosis; Caengprasath2021MBTPS2).

## Structure
The MBTPS2 protein is a membrane-bound protease encoded by the MBTPS2 gene, located on the X chromosome. It consists of 519 amino acids and features eight transmembrane helices, four luminal loops, and two cytoplasmic domains (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). The protein's catalytic activity is centered around two conserved motifs, HExxH and LDG, located in the fourth and seventh transmembrane domains, respectively. These motifs are characteristic of zinc metalloproteases, with the HExxH motif chelating a zinc ion and activating a water molecule for peptide bond hydrolysis, while the LDG motif facilitates zinc ion coordination (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2).

The luminal loops contain charged amino acids and a PDZ domain, which may play a role in substrate recognition and binding (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). Structural studies, including sequence-based topology predictions and X-ray crystallography, have provided insights into the protein's architecture. The crystal structure of an archaeal homolog, MjS2P, has revealed a polar channel that allows water to access the active sites, addressing the challenge of conducting water-requiring reactions within a lipid membrane (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). The spatial arrangement of the catalytic dyad, His-His and Asp, is similar to other HExxH-containing metalloproteases (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2).

## Function
The MBTPS2 gene encodes a membrane-bound protease known as site-2 protease (S2P), which is integral to the process of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). This process is crucial for cellular signal transduction and the regulation of various cellular processes, including cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). MBTPS2 is ubiquitously expressed within the Golgi membrane, where it works in conjunction with site-1 protease (S1P) to activate membrane-tethered latent transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2; Tibbo2023MBTPS2).

In healthy human cells, MBTPS2 plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by activating SREBPs, which then enter the nucleus to regulate genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (Tao2022Reduced; Tibbo2023MBTPS2). The protease activity of MBTPS2 is essential for the cleavage of substrates like SREBPs, ATF6, and CREB3, which are involved in lipid metabolism and stress response pathways (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). This function is vital for normal cellular function and homeostasis, ensuring proper lipid metabolism and cellular response to sterol levels (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MBTPS2 gene are linked to several X-linked disorders, primarily affecting the skin and bones. One of the most notable conditions is Ichthyosis Follicularis, Atrichia, and Photophobia (IFAP) syndrome, characterized by a triad of symptoms: follicular ichthyosis, non-scarring alopecia, and photophobia. This syndrome can also present with additional symptoms such as intellectual disability and seizures (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2). Mutations like p.Arg429His are associated with severe phenotypes of IFAP syndrome and can lead to early death (Naiki2011MBTPS2).

Keratosis Follicularis Spinulosa Decalvans (KFSD) is another disorder caused by MBTPS2 mutations, presenting with hyperkeratotic follicular papules and progressive alopecia. The p.Asn508Ser mutation is specifically linked to KFSD and affects sterol responsiveness, disrupting normal protein function (Aten2010Keratosis).

Olmsted syndrome, characterized by skin and bone abnormalities, is also associated with MBTPS2 mutations. Symptoms include palmoplantar keratoderma and periorificial hyperkeratotic plaques, with some cases overlapping with IFAP syndrome features (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2).

BRESHECK syndrome, a multiple congenital malformation disorder, is linked to MBTPS2 mutations and shares some clinical features with IFAP syndrome, including brain anomalies and skeletal deformities (Naiki2011MBTPS2).

## Interactions
MBTPS2, a membrane-bound protease, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the cleavage and activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which are essential for cholesterol homeostasis and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2; Naiki2011MBTPS2). The protease is characterized by catalytic motifs HExxH and LDG, which are essential for its proteolytic activity, and a PDZ domain that may be involved in substrate recognition and binding (Caengprasath2021MBTPS2).

MBTPS2 interacts with TRPV3, a gene implicated in skin disorders, where it has been shown to regulate the TRPV3 promoter activity. A specific mutation in MBTPS2, p.F475S, results in a loss of function, failing to activate the TRPV3 promoter, which is associated with increased cell death in certain cell types (Nemer2017Understanding). This interaction highlights the role of MBTPS2 in the phenotypic manifestations of conditions like IFAP syndrome and Olmsted syndrome, suggesting a regulatory effect on TRPV3 that contributes to overlapping clinical features (Nemer2017Understanding).
