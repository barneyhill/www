# SIRT2

## Overview
SIRT2 is a gene that encodes the protein sirtuin 2, a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Sirtuin 2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, microtubule stability, and protein acetylation. As a deacetylase, sirtuin 2 plays a critical role in modulating the acetylation status of various substrates, influencing cellular functions such as mitotic progression and signal transduction pathways (North2003The; Dryden2003Role). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as 14-3-3 isoforms and p300, which affect its enzymatic function and cellular localization (Jin2008Sirt2; Zhang2022Quantitative). SIRT2 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Chen2021Sirtuin; Zhang2020The).

## Structure
SIRT2 is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, characterized by a conserved catalytic core domain (CC) that includes a Rossmann fold, a zinc-binding pocket, and a hydrophobic pocket (Li2015Insight; Chuang2015Molecular). The primary structure of SIRT2 consists of two major isoforms, 1 and 2, with 389 and 352 amino acids, respectively (Li2015Insight). The secondary structure features a large Rossmann fold domain and a smaller domain with a zinc-binding module, where the zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteine residues (Li2015Insight; Chuang2015Molecular).

The tertiary structure of SIRT2 involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, with the NAD+ binding pocket divided into three regions crucial for enzymatic activity (Li2015Insight). The C-terminal region is intrinsically disordered and includes a short helical region, contributing to the regulation of SIRT2's activity by potentially occluding the NAD+ binding site (Li2015Insight).

SIRT2 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Li2015Insight). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, particularly at S331, play a significant role in modulating SIRT2's function and catalytic activity (Li2015Insight; Blasl2021Posttranslational). SIRT2 also exists in several splice variant isoforms, which affect its localization and function (Blasl2021Posttranslational; Eldridge2020Active).

## Function
SIRT2 (sirtuin 2) is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. SIRT2 abundance increases during mitosis, and it becomes phosphorylated, which is essential for its function in controlling mitotic exit. Overexpression of SIRT2 can prolong the mitotic phase, indicating its role in delaying cell cycle progression (Dryden2003Role). SIRT2 is also targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome, a process facilitated by the phosphatase CDC14B, which dephosphorylates SIRT2, promoting its degradation and facilitating mitotic exit (Dryden2003Role).

In addition to its role in the cell cycle, SIRT2 is involved in the regulation of intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation. It negatively regulates the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. SIRT2 deficiency leads to increased proliferation and impaired differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, contributing to altered cell lineage distribution (Li2020SIRT2). SIRT2 also plays a role in maintaining the structure and function of the microtubule network by deacetylating α-tubulin, which is important for cellular stability (North2003The).

## Clinical Significance
SIRT2 plays a complex role in various diseases, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. In cancer, SIRT2's expression and localization influence tumor progression and treatment responses. In breast cancer, SIRT2 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating APC/C activity and preventing centrosome amplification, but its overexpression in basal-like breast cancer promotes aggressive phenotypes (Zhang2020The). In colorectal cancer, SIRT2's role is debated, with some studies showing downregulation associated with poor prognosis, while others report upregulation correlating with advanced disease stages (Zhang2020The). In non-small cell lung cancer, SIRT2 overexpression can suppress cell growth, yet its inhibition sensitizes cells to chemotherapy (Zhang2020The).

In neurological disorders, SIRT2 is implicated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Inhibition of SIRT2 has been shown to reduce α-synuclein toxicity in Parkinson's models and improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's models by affecting amyloid precursor protein processing and tau phosphorylation (Kaitsuka2021Regulation; Chen2021Sirtuin). SIRT2's involvement in these conditions suggests that alterations in its expression or function could be relevant to their pathophysiology (Chen2021Sirtuin).

## Interactions
SIRT2, a member of the sirtuin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. SIRT2 interacts with 14-3-3 β and γ isoforms, enhancing the deacetylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of wild-type AKT, suggesting that SIRT2 may be phosphorylated by AKT, which promotes its binding to 14-3-3 β/γ. This interaction leads to a decrease in the transcriptional activity of p53, highlighting a mechanism for the negative regulation of p53 activity (Jin2008Sirt2).

SIRT2 also plays a role in the regulation of protein acetylation. It interacts with p300, a central hub in its interaction network, where SIRT2 deacetylates p300, impairing its autoacetylation. Conversely, p300 acetylates SIRT2, affecting its deacetylase activity. This interaction underscores the complex regulatory role of SIRT2 in acetylation processes (Zhang2022Quantitative).

In the context of protein aggregation in neuronal cells, SIRT2 overexpression disrupts the interaction between p62 and ubiquitin, which is crucial for the formation of perinuclear aggresomes. This disruption leads to impaired autophagy-mediated degradation of protein aggregates, contributing to cytotoxicity in neuronal cells (Gal2012SIRT2).
