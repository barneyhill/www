# FBXO27

## Overview
FBXO27 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 27, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein is characterized by its role in the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, where it facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins, particularly those modified with high-mannose N-glycans. F-box protein 27 is involved in cellular processes such as autophagy and the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, contributing to cellular homeostasis. It is notably active in the degradation of lysosomal glycoproteins following lysosomal damage, thereby regulating autophagy. The expression of FBXO27 is prominent in cardiac and skeletal muscles, indicating its potential involvement in muscle-related cellular processes, although its specific functions in these tissues are not fully understood (Yoshida2018Cytosolic; Liu2023The; Blondelle2020The).

## Function
FBXO27 is an F-box protein that plays a significant role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in recognizing and binding glycoproteins modified with high-mannose N-glycans. It is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which tags proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. FBXO27 interacts with the common core pentasaccharide motif of N-glycans, allowing it to bind a wide range of N-glycans, with a preference for high-mannose glycans (Yoshida2018Cytosolic).

In healthy cells, FBXO27 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by participating in the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathways. It is particularly active in ubiquitinating lysosomal glycoproteins following lysosomal damage, which induces autophagy (Yoshida2018Cytosolic). This process is crucial for the regulation of autophagy, as FBXO27 directs damaged glycoproteins on the surface of lysosomes, such as Lamp1 and Lamp2, towards autophagy-mediated degradation (Blondelle2020The).

FBXO27 is highly expressed in various tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscles, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to protein degradation and autophagy, although its specific roles in muscle development or function remain poorly characterized (Blondelle2020The).

## Interactions
FBXO27, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in various protein interactions primarily related to the ubiquitination process. It is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. FBXO27 interacts with high-mannose glycans of glycoproteins and is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it ubiquitinates misfolded glycoproteins. This allows FBXO27 to target glycoproteins that have moved beyond the ER to other organelles or the cell surface (Yoshida2018Cytosolic).

In the context of cardiomyocyte autophagy, FBXO27 interacts with LAMP2, a lysosomal glycoprotein. Immunoprecipitation results have shown that FBXO27 directly interacts with LAMP2, influencing its degradation. Overexpression of FBXO27 inhibits autophagy in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes by increasing LC3II and P62 expression and decreasing LAMP2 expression. This suggests that FBXO27 plays a role in the proteasome-mediated degradation of LAMP2 under pathological conditions (Liu2023The).

FBXO27 is also noted for directing damaged glycoproteins on the surface of lysosomes, such as LAMP1 and LAMP2, towards autophagy-mediated degradation, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Blondelle2020The).
