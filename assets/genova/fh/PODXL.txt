# PODXL

## Overview
Podocalyxin-like protein (PODXL) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane sialomucin protein, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, particularly in the kidney. The protein product, podocalyxin-like, is integral to the structure and function of podocytes, specialized cells that are crucial for the kidney's filtration barrier. This protein is characterized by its negatively charged extracellular domain, which is essential for maintaining the filtration slits between podocyte foot processes, thereby facilitating efficient kidney filtration (Dekan1991Sulfate; Refaeli2020Distinct). Beyond its renal functions, podocalyxin-like is involved in cell surface interactions and signaling pathways that influence cell morphology and motility, with implications in cancer cell behavior and metastasis (Taniuchi2016Podocalyxin‐like; Sizemore2007Podocalyxin). The gene's expression is not limited to the kidney but extends to other tissues such as the pancreas and heart, indicating its diverse roles across different organ systems (Kershaw1997Molecular). Mutations in PODXL have been linked to various diseases, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Sudhaman2016Discovery; Refaeli2020Distinct).

## Structure


## Function
Podocalyxin-like protein (PODXL) is a critical component in maintaining the structure and function of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney that are essential for the filtration process. PODXL is a single-pass transmembrane sialomucin that contributes to the formation and maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. It is characterized by a negatively charged extracellular mucin domain, which is crucial for maintaining the open state of the filtration slits between podocyte foot processes, thereby facilitating efficient kidney filtration (Dekan1991Sulfate; Refaeli2020Distinct).

In healthy podocytes, PODXL plays a vital role in maintaining the architecture of foot processes and slit diaphragms, which are essential for kidney filtration. It ensures the proper localization of slit diaphragm proteins and maintains the structural integrity necessary for ultrafiltration (Refaeli2020Distinct). The protein's anionic glycocalyx, of which podocalyxin is a major component, is important for kidney function, as its reduction is associated with diseases like minimal change disease and proteinuria (Kershaw1997Molecular).

PODXL is also involved in cell surface interactions and signaling pathways, influencing cell morphology and motility. It is expressed in the kidney, pancreas, and heart, with lower levels in other tissues, indicating its role in various cellular processes across different organ systems (Kershaw1997Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PODXL gene are associated with several kidney diseases, particularly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Deletion of PODXL during nephrogenesis can lead to congenital nephrotic syndrome, characterized by FSGS and proteinuria, distinct from the anuria and perinatal lethality seen in germline Podxl -/- mice (Refaeli2020Distinct). A specific mutation, p.L442R, in the PODXL gene's transmembrane domain, has been linked to familial autosomal dominant FSGS, affecting protein interactions necessary for maintaining podocyte morphology (Refaeli2020Distinct). Nonsense mutations in PODXL have been identified in families with autosomal dominant FSGS, leading to podocalyxin deficiency and affecting podocyte function (Lin2019First).

PODXL mutations are also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. A frameshift mutation in PODXL has been associated with autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism, suggesting a role in neural development and synaptogenesis (Sudhaman2016Discovery). This mutation leads to a loss of protein function, potentially contributing to the pathology of juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (Sudhaman2016Discovery).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PODXL in both renal and neurological disorders, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
Podocalyxin-like protein (PODXL) is known to interact with several proteins that play crucial roles in cancer cell behavior. One significant interaction is with ezrin, a member of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family, which links PODXL to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction enhances the activity of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, leading to increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP9, which are associated with cellular invasion (Sizemore2007Podocalyxin). PODXL also interacts with gelsolin, an actin-severing protein, which is crucial for the localization of gelsolin to actin filaments in cell protrusions, thereby promoting cell motility and invasion (Taniuchi2016Podocalyxin‐like).

In renal cell carcinoma, PODXL forms a complex with ezrin and EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50), which is essential for the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase involved in cell migration. This complex recruits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARHGEF7 to activate Rac1, facilitating cell migration and metastasis (Hsu2010Podocalyxin). These interactions highlight PODXL's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling pathways that contribute to cancer cell aggressiveness.
