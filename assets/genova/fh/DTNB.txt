# DTNB

## Overview
The DTNB gene encodes the protein dystrobrevin beta, which is a cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). This complex is integral to maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and synaptic function. Dystrobrevin beta is predominantly expressed in non-muscle tissues such as the brain, kidney, lung, and liver, with a notable presence in the postsynaptic densities of neurons. This localization suggests its involvement in synaptic signaling and structural integrity, particularly in the brain, where it may facilitate the transport of GABA receptors to synapses. The protein's interactions within the DAPC, including associations with dystrophin, utrophin, and syntrophins, underscore its role in cellular architecture and signaling pathways. Recent studies have also implicated DTNB in neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential impact on neuronal injury and inflammation (Rees2007Dystrobrevins; Neumann2022Rare; Prokopenko2022Regionbased).

## Function
The DTNB gene encodes β-dystrobrevin, a protein that is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). This complex is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells and is involved in various cellular processes. β-Dystrobrevin is primarily expressed in non-muscle tissues, including the brain, kidney, lung, and liver, and is particularly abundant in the postsynaptic densities of neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. This localization suggests a role in synaptic function, potentially contributing to synaptic signaling and structural integrity (Rees2007Dystrobrevins).

In the brain, β-dystrobrevin is implicated in the transport of GABA receptors to synapses, possibly through interactions with kinesin proteins Kif5A and Kif5B. This function is supported by observations in β-dystrobrevin-deficient mice, which show altered GABA A α1 receptor distribution in Purkinje cells (Rees2007Dystrobrevins). The protein's interactions within the DAPC, including binding with dystrophin, utrophin, and syntrophins, suggest its involvement in cellular architecture and signaling pathways (Gawor2017The). These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the DAPC, which plays a role in signal transduction and maintaining cellular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and rare variants in the DTNB gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). DTNB encodes a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, which is involved in linking actin to the extracellular matrix and plays a role in cell signaling. While DTNB has traditionally been studied in the context of muscle diseases, recent research suggests its involvement in neurodegenerative processes, particularly AD. Studies have identified rare variants in DTNB that are associated with increased levels of neuronal injury and inflammation, which are key features of AD pathology (Neumann2022Rare; Neumann2021Rare).

The expression of DTNB is significantly decreased in the brains of AD patients compared to controls, and it interacts with proteins involved in synaptic functions, suggesting a potential role in synaptic dysfunction observed in AD (Prokopenko2022Regionbased). These findings indicate that DTNB may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD through its impact on neuronal injury, inflammation, and synaptic function. The identification of DTNB as a gene associated with AD highlights the importance of understanding its role in neurodegenerative diseases and suggests that it may be a target for future therapeutic interventions (Neumann2022Rare; Prokopenko2022Regionbased).

## Interactions
DTNB (dystrobrevin beta) is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which plays a crucial role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. This complex is essential for maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating signal transduction. DTNB interacts with a network of 33 proteins that are enriched for neuronal synaptic functions, highlighting its involvement in neuronal processes (Prokopenko2022Regionbased). These interactions suggest that DTNB may play a role in synaptic stability and signaling pathways, which are critical for proper neuronal function.

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, DTNB has been associated with neuronal injury and inflammation. The protein's interactions within the DAPC are thought to influence neurodegenerative processes, potentially through pathways related to cytoskeleton structure and immune activity disinhibition (Neumann2022Rare). Although specific protein partners within the DAPC are not detailed in the provided context, the complex typically includes proteins such as dystrophin, syntrophins, and dystroglycans, which are known to stabilize the sarcolemma and participate in signaling pathways. These interactions underscore the potential role of DTNB in both muscle and neuronal tissue integrity and function.
