# CCDC91

## Overview
CCDC91 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 91 protein, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the Golgi apparatus. The protein is characterized by a central coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates its involvement in the transport of carrier vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular organization and function, as well as for the proper sorting and transport of proteins and lipids. CCDC91 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including brain structure integrity and neurological disorders. The gene's expression levels are genetically correlated with white matter microstructure, suggesting a potential influence on brain health and pathology (Zhu2024A; Sprooten2014Common). Additionally, CCDC91 has been associated with conditions such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance (Sethi2023Genetics; Wei2023Identification; Das2022A).

## Structure
The CCDC91 protein is encoded by the CCDC91 gene located on chromosome 12 (12p11.22) and consists of 441 amino acids. It features a central coiled-coil domain, a structural motif characterized by alpha-helices wrapped around each other in a superhelical fashion. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in vesicle transport between the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes (Zhu2024A; Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

A splice mutation in the CCDC91 gene results in the deletion of exon 11, leading to a 59-amino-acid-residue loss (L309-Q367del). This mutation affects the protein's structure by removing a stable motif comprising two alpha-helices opposing antiparallel beta-sheets, resulting in a narrower and more concave structure compared to the wild-type protein. Bioinformatics predictions indicate that this structural change is deleterious, as evidenced by a PROVEAN score of -115.041 (Zhu2024A).

The CCDC91 protein is involved in the transport of carrier vesicles and colocalizes with accessory proteins GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3, which are essential for this process (Zhu2024A). The protein's function is linked to the structure of elastic fibers, as mutations can lead to abnormal tropoelastin deposition (Zhu2024A).

## Function
CCDC91 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the Golgi apparatus. This protein plays a crucial role in the sorting and transport of proteins and lipids, contributing to the maintenance of cellular organization and function. CCDC91 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in sub-cellular trafficking and localization of proteins to the Golgi complex (Sprooten2014Common). The protein's function is linked to the organization of the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for the proper secretion and membrane dynamics within cells.

The gene is also associated with white matter microstructure in the human brain, as its expression levels are genetically correlated with fractional anisotropy, a measure of white matter integrity (Sprooten2014Common). This suggests that CCDC91 may influence brain structure and pathology, potentially playing a role in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The interaction partners of CCDC91, such as GGA1 and GGA2, have been linked to Alzheimer's pathophysiology, indicating a broader impact on brain health (Sprooten2014Common). Despite its significant roles, the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving CCDC91 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC91 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. Genetic studies have identified CCDC91 as a significant factor in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), a condition characterized by the fusion of vertebrae. Variants affecting CCDC91 expression are associated with musculoskeletal traits such as bone mineral density, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and osteoarthritis (Sethi2023Genetics). The gene's upregulation is thought to contribute to OPLL progression by inducing ossification under mechanical stress (Sethi2023Genetics).

CCDC91 is also linked to treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). A proteome-wide association study identified CCDC91 as one of the genes potentially involved in TRS pathogenesis, with high expression in the central nervous system (Wei2023Identification). Additionally, CCDC91 has been associated with male infertility conditions such as teratozoospermia and azoospermia, where it is down-regulated, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions (Das2022A).

In osteoarthritis, particularly of the hand, CCDC91 has been identified as a locus of interest, with genetic studies suggesting its involvement in the disease's development (den2017Genomewide).

## Interactions
CCDC91 is known to interact with several proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and cellular organization. It colocalizes with GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3, which are accessory proteins that facilitate the transport of carrier vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes. This interaction suggests a role for CCDC91 in vesicle transport within the Golgi apparatus (Zhu2024A). CCDC91 is also involved in sub-cellular trafficking and localization of proteins to the Golgi complex, and it interacts with GGA1 and GGA2, which have been linked to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology through their interaction with beta-amyloid precursors (Wei2023Identification; Sprooten2014Common).

The protein is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is implicated in the transport and localization of proteins within the Golgi complex. Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its association with GGA1 and GGA2 indicates its involvement in critical cellular processes (Wei2023Identification). CCDC91's role in these interactions highlights its potential importance in maintaining cellular organization and function, particularly in the context of diseases such as Alzheimer's and treatment-resistant schizophrenia (Wei2023Identification).
