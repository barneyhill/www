# H2BC26

## Overview
H2BC26 is a gene that encodes the H2B clustered histone 26 protein, which is a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are essential nuclear proteins that play a critical role in the organization and regulation of chromatin structure, thereby influencing gene expression and DNA replication processes. The H2B clustered histone 26 protein is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, by facilitating the wrapping of DNA around histone octamers. This process is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating access to genetic information. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of interest due to their potential implications in various cellular processes and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
