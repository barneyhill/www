# UNC5B

## Overview
UNC5B is a gene that encodes the unc-5 netrin receptor B, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and apoptosis. As a member of the dependence receptor family, UNC5B is involved in various biological processes, including neural development, angiogenesis, and the maintenance of intestinal epithelium homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin-like and thrombospondin type I domains, which facilitate interactions with ligands such as netrin-1, and its intracellular domains, which are essential for apoptotic signaling. UNC5B's function is modulated by alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms with distinct roles in apoptosis and angiogenesis. The receptor's activity is influenced by its interactions with other proteins, such as DCC and PIKE-A, and its involvement in pathways like Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Alterations in UNC5B expression are implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Zhu2021UNC5; Pradella2021A; Bhat2018A).

## Structure
The UNC5B protein, also known as the Unc-5 Netrin Receptor B, is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its extracellular region contains two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and two thrombospondin type I (TSP) domains, which are crucial for its interaction with ligands such as netrin-1 (Pradella2021A). The cytoplasmic portion of UNC5B includes a ZU5 domain, a DCC-binding motif-containing domain, and a death domain (DD), which are essential for its role in apoptosis and signal transduction (Pradella2021A; Hata2009Unc5B).

UNC5B is involved in axon guidance and is expressed in endothelial cells, where it regulates angiogenesis. In the absence of netrin-1, UNC5B can induce apoptosis, a process that is inhibited upon netrin-1 binding (Pradella2021A). An alternative splicing variant, UNC5B-Δ8, lacks exon 8 and is pro-apoptotic, playing a significant role in blood vessel development and tumor angiogenesis (Pradella2021A). This isoform is insensitive to netrin-1, suggesting a distinct functional role compared to the full-length protein (Pradella2021A).

## Function
UNC5B, a member of the dependence receptor family, plays a significant role in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in neural development, developmental angiogenesis, and the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. The receptor can induce two opposite intracellular signaling cascades depending on the presence or absence of its ligand, Netrin-1. In the absence of Netrin-1, UNC5B promotes apoptosis, while its presence triggers a PI3K cascade that suppresses apoptosis, providing a survival cue during nervous system development (Bhat2018A).

UNC5B is crucial in angiogenesis, where it regulates endothelial cell apoptosis to maintain blood vessel integrity and stability. The receptor's function is modulated by alternative splicing, particularly by the splicing factor NOVA2, which influences the skipping of exon 8. This splicing event results in a variant, UNC5B-Δ8, which is insensitive to the prosurvival activity mediated by Netrin-1, thus promoting apoptosis during blood vessel morphogenesis (Pradella2021A).

UNC5B is also involved in inhibiting sprouting angiogenesis. Activation by Netrin-1 inhibits endothelial cell sprouting, suggesting its role as a negative regulator to prevent excessive or abnormal blood vessel growth (Larrivée2007Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UNC5B gene have significant implications in various diseases, particularly cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), UNC5B is often downregulated due to genetic and epigenetic changes, such as loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation, which are associated with tumor progression (Zhu2021UNC5). The expression of netrin-1, a ligand for UNC5B, can inhibit its pro-apoptotic activity, potentially aiding in tumor development (Zhu2021UNC5). In bladder cancer, UNC5B is generally underexpressed, and its overexpression has been shown to induce apoptosis and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity (Zhu2021UNC5).

The UNC5B-Δ8 splicing isoform, which is insensitive to netrin-1, plays a role in angiogenesis and is upregulated in the vasculature of colon cancer, correlating with poor patient outcomes (Pradella2021A). This isoform is associated with increased tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, particularly in colorectal and ovarian cancers (Pradella2021A).

In Parkinson's disease, UNC5B phosphorylation is linked to dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis, contributing to neuronal loss (Ahn2020Netrin1). In gestational diabetes mellitus, decreased UNC5B expression may lead to increased placental angiogenesis (Prieto2019Downregulation). These findings highlight the diverse roles of UNC5B in disease pathology.

## Interactions
UNC5B interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in apoptosis and cellular signaling. It forms a complex with DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) in the presence of netrin-1, which enhances their colocalization and receptor complex formation, crucial for cellular responses (Gopal2016Netrin1Regulated). UNC5B also interacts with DAP-kinase through their death domains, contributing to its apoptotic activity. This interaction is part of a protein complex involving PR65b and PP2A, which is essential for UNC5B-induced apoptosis by activating DAP-kinase through dephosphorylation (Guenebeaud2010The).

UNC5B's interaction with PIKE-A, a GTPase phosphorylated by Akt, inhibits UNC5B-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. PIKE-A binds to UNC5B in an Akt phosphorylation-dependent manner, suppressing its apoptotic action (He2011Aktphosphorylated). The interaction between UNC5B and PIKE-A is enhanced by netrin-1, which prevents UNC5B's apoptotic cleavage (He2011Aktphosphorylated).

UNC5B also interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, particularly through its interaction with the Wnt coreceptor LRP6. This interaction is enhanced by netrin-1, which is crucial for maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity (Boyé2022Endothelial).
