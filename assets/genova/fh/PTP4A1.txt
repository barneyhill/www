# PTP4A1

## Overview
PTP4A1 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A1, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling and regulation. The protein is characterized by its α+β structure and is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, motility, and magnesium homeostasis (Hardy2018Physiological; WeiYa2019Exploring). PTP4A1 functions as a phosphatase, although some of its activities are independent of its enzymatic function, such as its role in enhancing TGFβ signaling through interactions with proteins like SMAD3 and SRC (Sacchetti2017PTP4A1). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and prenylation, are critical for its localization and function in signaling pathways. PTP4A1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and fibrotic diseases, where its expression levels and interactions with other molecules can influence disease progression and prognosis (Li2017MicroRNA1271; Sacchetti2017PTP4A1).

## Structure
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A1 (PTP4A1) is characterized by a compact α+β structure, which includes a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by two α-helices on one side and four α-helices on the other (WeiYa2019Exploring). The primary structure of PTP4A1 includes a catalytic domain with a conserved cysteine residue essential for its phosphatase activity. This domain is typical of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, which is involved in cell signaling. The tertiary structure of PTP4A1 often features a PTP domain fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic function.

PTP4A1 is known to form a trimer, which is important for its biological activity, particularly in cell proliferation and motility (WeiYa2019Exploring). The quaternary structure involves interactions between subunits, with the inhibitor 4AX binding at the trimer interface, potentially disrupting trimerization (WeiYa2019Exploring). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and prenylation are important for the localization and function of PTP4A1. These modifications may influence its interaction with other proteins and its role in signaling pathways. Splice variants of PTP4A1 can result in different isoforms, which may have distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
PTP4A1, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A1, plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular magnesium accumulation, which is crucial for the function of magnesium-dependent enzymes and overall cellular homeostasis (Hardy2018Physiological). PTP4A1 enhances TGFβ signaling by promoting the expression and nuclear translocation of SMAD3, a key mediator in this pathway, through the activation of ERK1/2. This process is important for maintaining basal levels of TGFβ signaling in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) (Sacchetti2017PTP4A1).

PTP4A1 also interacts with the SRC protein, forming a complex that affects SRC's autophosphorylation and stability, thereby enhancing its basal activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the ERK-SMAD3 pathway, which influences TGFβ signaling (Sacchetti2017PTP4A1). The protein's activity is not dependent on its phosphatase function, as demonstrated by experiments using a catalytically inactive mutant of PTP4A1 (Sacchetti2017PTP4A1). These molecular activities highlight PTP4A1's role in modulating key signaling pathways that are essential for cellular function and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTP4A1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and fibrotic conditions. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low expression of miR-1271, which targets PTP4A1, is associated with increased metastasis and advanced tumor stages. Overexpression of PTP4A1 in HCC is linked to larger tumor size, metastasis, and poor survival rates, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Li2017MicroRNA1271).

In systemic sclerosis (SSc), PTP4A1 is overexpressed in fibroblasts and promotes TGFβ signaling, contributing to fibrosis. This overexpression enhances ERK activity and SMAD3 expression, which are crucial for the fibrotic phenotype. PTP4A1's interaction with SRC, inhibiting its basal activation, is significant for the SRC-ERK-SMAD3 pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in TGFβ-dependent fibrosis (Sacchetti2017PTP4A1).

In cervical cancer, PTP4A1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis. The long non-coding RNA USP30-AS1 sequesters miR-299-3p, leading to increased PTP4A1 expression, which promotes cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Chen2021Long).

## Interactions
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A1 (PTP4A1) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various cellular processes. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PTP4A1 interacts with pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) to promote its expression, enhancing the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of OSCC cells. It also interacts with aconitase 2 (ACO2) to promote its degradation, contributing to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells (Liu2023PTP4A1).

In cervical cancer, PTP4A1 is regulated by miR-629-3p, which binds to PTP4A1 and reduces its expression, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and migration. This interaction is modulated by circNRIP1, which acts as a sponge for miR-629-3p, leading to increased PTP4A1 expression and activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (Li2020Circular).

In colon cancer, PTP4A1 interacts with GINS2, a protein involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. GINS2 promotes PTP4A1 expression, and their interaction influences cell proliferation and apoptosis through the p53 pathway (Hu2022GINS2).

PTP4A1 also interacts with the inhibitor 4AX, which binds to the PTP4A1 trimer, potentially disrupting its trimerization (WeiYa2019Exploring).
