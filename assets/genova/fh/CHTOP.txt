# CHTOP

## Overview
CHTOP, or chromatin target of PRMT1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and mRNA export. The CHTOP protein is characterized by its glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) region, which undergoes methylation by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), influencing its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Fanis2012Five). As a component of the TREX mRNA export complex, CHTOP plays a critical role in posttranscriptional modifications and the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Izumikawa2018Modulating). It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression in cancer, particularly in breast cancer and glioblastoma, where it modulates the expression of estrogen-responsive and glioblastoma-related genes (Izumikawa2018Modulating). Additionally, CHTOP's interactions with arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT5 highlight its role in transcriptional activation and repression, making it a significant player in cellular homeostasis and a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various diseases (Izumikawa2018Modulating).

## Structure
The CHTOP protein, encoded by the human C1orf77 gene, is characterized by several structural features and post-translational modifications. It contains a central glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) region, which includes 26 RG/GR repeats and is recognized and methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). This methylation is crucial for controlling protein-protein interactions (Fanis2012Five). The GAR domain shows 70% conservation, while the N- and C-termini are 80% conserved (Fanis2012Five).

CHTOP also contains multiple repeats of the sequence RG and RGG, known as the RGG box, which serves as an RNA binding and protein interaction motif. Methylation of arginines within these motifs can reduce RNA binding activity (Chang2013Chtop). The protein includes two repeats of a short peptide motif named the UBM, which is involved in binding to Uap56, a component of the TREX mRNA export complex (Chang2013Chtop).

CHTOP exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, one of which lacks the RGG/RG motif, contributing to its functional diversity (Thandapani2013Defining). The protein is part of the nuclear complex Five Friends of Methylated Chtop (5FMC), indicating its involvement in higher-order protein assemblies (Fanis2012Five).

## Function
CHTOP, also known as chromatin target of PRMT1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in gene-specific transcription and mRNA export in healthy human cells. It is a component of the TREX complex, which is involved in posttranscriptional events such as 5'-cap formation, co-transcriptional splicing, and 3'-end processing of mRNAs. CHTOP, along with Alyref, is recruited to the 5'-end region of mRNA, promoting the ATPase and RNA helicase activities of Uap56, which are essential for mRNA export (Izumikawa2018Modulating).

CHTOP interacts with arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT5, promoting asymmetric or symmetric methylation of arginine residues, respectively. This methylation is crucial for transcriptional regulation, with PRMT1-associated methylation activating transcription and PRMT5-associated methylation repressing it (Izumikawa2018Modulating). CHTOP is also involved in the regulation of estrogen-inducible genes in breast cancer cells and genes involved in glioblastomagenesis (Izumikawa2018Modulating).

CHTOP is part of the nuclear SMN complex, influencing the assembly of heterogeneous nuclear RNPs and ATP-binding proteins on nascent pre-mRNAs (Izumikawa2018Modulating). It localizes in the nucleolus and nucleus, associating with RNA and playing a role in ribosome biogenesis (Izumikawa2018Modulating). The expression of CHTOP is autoregulated through intron retention and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, ensuring its levels are tightly controlled to maintain cellular homeostasis (Izumikawa2018Modulating).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHTOP gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. CHTOP is upregulated in various cancers, including breast cancer and glioblastoma, where it plays a role in maintaining tumor growth and progression. In breast cancer cells, CHTOP is recruited to the pS2 promoter, facilitating the expression of estrogen target genes, which is crucial for tumor maintenance (Heath2016The; Izumikawa2018Modulating). In glioblastoma, CHTOP is involved in the expression of genes modified by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, such as EGFR and BRAF, which are critical for glioblastoma development (Izumikawa2018Modulating).

CHTOP also plays a role in the repression of the fetal γ-globin gene, which is significant in the context of hemoglobinopathies like β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Its depletion can lead to increased γ-globin levels, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for these conditions (Izumikawa2018Modulating).

The TREX complex, of which CHTOP is a component, is essential for mRNA export and is implicated in neurodegenerative processes. CHTOP acts as an enhancer in neurodegeneration models, indicating its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (Heath2016The).

## Interactions
The CHTOP protein, also known as chromatin target of PRMT1, is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and mRNA export. CHTOP is a component of the TREX mRNA export complex, where it interacts with Uap56 and Nxf1, competing with Alyref for binding to Uap56. This interaction is essential for the ATPase and helicase activities of Uap56, facilitating the loading of TREX components onto mRNA (Chang2013Chtop). 

CHTOP also interacts with PRMT1 and PRMT5, promoting methylation of arginine residues, which is vital for its role in transcriptional activation and repression (Izumikawa2018Modulating). It is part of the 5FMC complex, which includes proteins such as Pelp1, Las1L, Tex10, Senp3, and Wdr18, linking arginine methylation to desumoylation processes (Fanis2012Five). 

CHTOP binds to chromatin and is involved in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes and glioblastoma-related gene expression by recruiting methylosome complexes to chromatin (Izumikawa2018Modulating). These interactions highlight CHTOP's versatile role in gene-specific transcription and mRNA export.
