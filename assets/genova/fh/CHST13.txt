# CHST13

## Overview
CHST13, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 13, is a gene that encodes an enzyme of the same name, which belongs to the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate chains, a critical process for the structural and functional integrity of cartilage and other tissues. The CHST13 enzyme specifically catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the carbon-4 position of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in chondroitin sulfate, influencing various biological functions such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and tissue repair (Guo2019Decreased; Yorifuji2018CHST3). The activity of CHST13 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteoglycans, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining the extracellular matrix's resilience and repair capabilities (Mikami2013Biosynthesis). Alterations in the expression or function of CHST13 have been linked to degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis and Kashin-Beck disease, as well as drug-induced liver toxicity, highlighting its clinical significance (Han2017Altered; Lei2019Abnormal; Yorifuji2018CHST3).

## Structure
CHST13, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 13, is an enzyme involved in the sulfation of carbohydrates. The primary structure of CHST13 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of CHST13 is characterized by the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes specific domains such as the sulfotransferase domain. This domain is crucial for the enzyme's activity in transferring sulfate groups to carbohydrate substrates.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur in CHST13, potentially affecting its function and activity. These modifications may play a role in regulating the enzyme's activity and interactions with other molecules. Additionally, there may be splice variant isoforms of CHST13, resulting in different protein forms with potentially distinct functions. These isoforms could contribute to the enzyme's versatility in various biological processes.

The quaternary structure of CHST13, if present, is not detailed in the available information. However, the presence of different isoforms suggests that the protein may have the ability to form complexes with other proteins or molecules, influencing its functional capabilities.

## Function
CHST13, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 13, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the carbon-4 position of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in chondroitin sulfate, a process essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage and other tissues (Guo2019Decreased). The sulfation of CS chains by CHST13 is crucial for various biological functions, including cell adhesion, proliferation, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurite outgrowth (Yorifuji2018CHST3).

CHST13 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteoglycans, influencing cell communication, proliferation, and tissue repair. The enzyme's activity is vital for the proper sulfation of CS, which impacts the structural and functional properties of the extracellular matrix, contributing to tissue resilience and repair processes (Mikami2013Biosynthesis). The proper function of CHST13 is essential for maintaining healthy cartilage and preventing degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis, as evidenced by its decreased expression in conditions like Kashin-Beck disease (Guo2019Decreased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CHST13 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In osteoarthritis (OA) and Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), the expression of CHST13 is significantly reduced in articular cartilage, contributing to cartilage damage and disease progression. This reduction is more pronounced in KBD than in OA, suggesting a critical role in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Han2017Altered; Lei2019Abnormal). The dysfunction of CHST13 and other sulfotransferases in KBD is associated with chondrocyte necrosis and joint deformities, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lei2019Abnormal).

In the context of drug-induced liver toxicity, polymorphisms in CHST13 have been studied as predictors of liver injury in patients treated with bosentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CHST13, such as rs6783962, have been linked to an increased risk of liver toxicity, suggesting that genetic variations in CHST13 may influence individual susceptibility to drug-induced liver damage (Yorifuji2018CHST3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CHST13 in both cartilage-related disorders and pharmacogenomics.
