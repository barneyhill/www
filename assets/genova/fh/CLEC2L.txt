# CLEC2L

## Overview
CLEC2L is a gene that encodes a C-type lectin-like receptor (CTLR), specifically known as C-type lectin domain family 2 member L, or BACL. This protein is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) at its carboxyterminus, which includes a central hydrophobic WIGL motif and six conserved cysteines forming three intramolecular disulfide bonds. These structural features stabilize the C-type lectin fold, allowing the protein to form disulfide-linked homodimers at the cell surface. Predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, the CLEC2L-encoded protein does not appear to have an immune-related function, as it does not interact with human NK cell lines or lymphocytes, nor does it affect tumor growth in immunocompetent mice. The precise role of CLEC2L in neuronal tissues remains to be fully understood, with current research suggesting a unique signaling mechanism due to the absence of known tyrosine-based signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic domain (Lysenko2013BACL).

## Structure
The CLEC2L gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein with a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) at the carboxyterminus. This domain is characterized by a central hydrophobic WIGL motif and six conserved cysteines that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds, stabilizing the C-type lectin fold (Lysenko2013BACL). The human CLEC2L protein is 214 amino acids long with a predicted molecular mass of 23.9 kDa. Its cytoplasmic domain is approximately 70 amino acids long and contains proline-rich regions and serine residues, but lacks known tyrosine-based signaling motifs (Lysenko2013BACL).

The transmembrane domain of CLEC2L lacks charged amino acids, suggesting no association with signaling adaptors, and is followed by a short stalk region with two cysteines involved in homodimerization (Lysenko2013BACL). CLEC2L forms disulfide-linked homodimers at the cell surface, with the stalk region cysteines (C93 and C96) responsible for dimerization (Lysenko2013BACL). The ectodomain lacks obvious glycosylation sites, indicating it is expressed as a non-glycosylated protein (Lysenko2013BACL). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Lysenko2013BACL).

## Function
The CLEC2L gene encodes a C-type lectin-like receptor (CTLR) that is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons within the central nervous system, including the cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellar Purkinje cells (Lysenko2013BACL). The CLEC2L protein is a type II transmembrane protein with a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) characterized by hallmark residues such as a central hydrophobic WIGL motif and six conserved cysteines, which form three intramolecular disulfide bonds to stabilize the C-type lectin fold (Lysenko2013BACL). This protein forms disulfide-linked homodimers at the cell surface, with dimerization involving cysteines in the stalk region (Lysenko2013BACL).

Despite its expression in the brain, the CLEC2L-encoded protein, also known as BACL, does not appear to have an immune-related function, as studies have shown no interaction with human NK cell lines or lymphocytes, nor any effect on tumor growth in immunocompetent mice (Lysenko2013BACL). The functional significance of CLEC2L in neuronal expression remains to be elucidated, suggesting a unique signaling mechanism due to the absence of known tyrosine-based signaling motifs in its extended cytoplasmic domain (Lysenko2013BACL).

## Interactions
The CLEC2L gene encodes a C-type lectin-like receptor (CTLR) that is predominantly expressed in the brain. Despite its structural characteristics, the CLEC2L-encoded protein, known as BACL, does not appear to engage in significant interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in the context of immune function. Studies have shown that BACL is expressed as non-glycosylated, disulfide-linked homodimers on the cell surface, but it does not interact with the ectodomain of the orphan CTLR gene KLRG2 or with human NK cell lines or lymphocytes (Lysenko2013BACL). Experiments using BWZ.36 reporter cells also did not demonstrate any interaction between BACL and KLRG2, suggesting that if such interactions exist, they may require specific conditions not present in the experimental setup (Lysenko2013BACL). Furthermore, BACL expression in tumor cell lines did not affect tumor growth in immunocompetent mice, indicating a lack of immune-related function (Lysenko2013BACL). The study of BACL's interactions remains limited, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential roles in neuronal contexts (Lysenko2013BACL).
