# PSAT1

## Overview
Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoserine aminotransferase 1, which is a key component of the serine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase and functions as a homodimer, facilitating the conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to phosphoserine. The PSAT1 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in cellular metabolism and development (Sirr2020A; Marchesani2023Phosphoserine). The enzyme is particularly important in the central nervous system, where it supports neurotransmitter synthesis and membrane formation. PSAT1 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including congenital disorders like Neu-Laxova syndrome and certain cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (AcunaHidalgo2014NeuLaxova; Jiang2023Targeting).

## Structure
The PSAT1 gene encodes the phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the serine biosynthesis pathway. The primary structure of PSAT1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure of PSAT1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Marchesani2023Phosphoserine).

The tertiary structure of PSAT1 forms a three-dimensional shape essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure is characterized by the presence of a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding domain, which is critical for its aminotransferase function. The enzyme's active sites are associated with PLP cofactors, and the binding of PLP is crucial for maintaining the enzyme's structural integrity and catalytic activity (Xie2023Constructing; Marchesani2023Phosphoserine).

PSAT1 functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits associate to form the active enzyme. This dimeric form is necessary for its biological activity and stability (Marchesani2023Phosphoserine). The enzyme also exhibits splice variant isoforms, such as PSAT alpha, which lacks 46 amino acids and is partially active, although it is not soluble or functional in its recombinant form (Marchesani2023Phosphoserine).

## Function
The PSAT1 gene encodes phosphoserine aminotransferase 1, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the serine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to phosphoserine, which is subsequently converted to serine, an amino acid essential for various cellular functions (Sirr2020A; Marchesani2023Phosphoserine). Serine is vital for protein synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and cellular metabolism, contributing to cellular proliferation and survival (BAEK2003Characterization).

PSAT1 is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent homodimer and is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Sirr2020A). In healthy human cells, PSAT1 is crucial for maintaining adequate serine levels, which are necessary for proper central nervous system development and function (Sirr2020A). The enzyme is particularly important in the brain, where it supports the synthesis of neurotransmitters and the formation of membrane components like phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids (Marchesani2023Phosphoserine).

PSAT1 activity is upregulated during the S-phase of the cell cycle, reflecting the increased demand for serine in nucleotide precursor formation and DNA replication (BAEK2003Characterization). The enzyme is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is expressed at high levels in tissues such as the brain, liver, kidney, and pancreas, which are major sites for serine biosynthesis (BAEK2003Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSAT1 gene are associated with several severe autosomal recessive disorders, primarily affecting the serine biosynthesis pathway. Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS) is one of the most severe conditions linked to PSAT1 mutations. It is characterized by severe congenital malformations, often resulting in prenatal or early postnatal lethality. Mutations in PSAT1, such as missense and frameshift mutations, disrupt the enzyme's function, leading to the severe phenotype observed in NLS (AcunaHidalgo2014NeuLaxova). 

PSAT1 deficiency (PSATD) is another condition resulting from mutations in this gene. It presents with neurological symptoms like microcephaly, seizures, and intellectual disability. The severity of these symptoms correlates with the degree of functional impairment of the PSAT1 enzyme (Sirr2020A; Xie2023Constructing).

Altered expression of PSAT1 has also been implicated in cancer progression. Overexpression of PSAT1 is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is linked to high-grade tumors and metastasis. This suggests a role for PSAT1 in metabolic reprogramming and tumor cell migration (Jiang2023Targeting).

## Interactions
Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression, particularly in lung cancer. PSAT1 interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization of PKM2 in response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which is important for cell migration and tumor progression (BiyikSit2021Nuclear; BiyikSit2024Investigating). The interaction between PSAT1 and PKM2 does not affect PKM2's pyruvate kinase activity but is essential for its nuclear translocation (BiyikSit2021Nuclear).

PSAT1 also interacts with IQGAP1, a scaffold protein, to activate the STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting cell migration in lung adenocarcinoma. This interaction is independent of PSAT1's metabolic activity and is crucial for metastasis and resistance to EGFR inhibitors (Luo2022Metabolic). The PSAT1-IQGAP1 interaction enhances STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation, contributing to tumor malignancy (Luo2022Metabolic). These interactions highlight PSAT1's role in both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways, influencing cancer cell behavior and treatment resistance.
