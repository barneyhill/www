# ONECUT3

## Overview
ONECUT3 is a gene that encodes the one cut homeobox 3 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the ONECUT family. This protein is characterized by its homeobox domain, which facilitates DNA binding, and a cut domain, both of which are integral to its function in regulating gene expression (Matthews2007Transcription; Zupančič2024Concerted). As a transcription factor, ONECUT3 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including chromosomal stability and neuronal differentiation (Zupančič2024Concerted; Luo2024Ectopic). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids are vital for its regulatory functions, influencing pathways involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and metabolic reprogramming. Dysregulation of ONECUT3 has been implicated in several diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and colorectal cancer, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Xue2024Transcription; Luo2024Ectopic).

## Structure
The ONECUT3 protein is a transcription factor belonging to the ONECUT family, characterized by a homeobox domain that binds DNA. Its primary structure includes a conserved homeodomain and a cut domain, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities (Matthews2007Transcription; Zupančič2024Concerted). The secondary structure of ONECUT3 typically involves alpha helices within these domains, contributing to its ability to interact with DNA and other proteins (Matthews2007Transcription). 

The tertiary structure of ONECUT3 is stabilized by interactions between the homeodomain and cut domain, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Matthews2007Transcription). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the activity and stability of ONECUT3, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Matthews2007Transcription). 

Splice variants of ONECUT3 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in distinct functional roles within the cell (Matthews2007Transcription). The protein's structure and modifications allow it to play a significant role in various biological processes, including chromosomal stability and neuronal differentiation (Zupančič2024Concerted; Luo2024Ectopic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ONECUT3 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating gene expression. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), high levels of ONECUT3 are associated with complex karyotypes (CK) and poor prognosis, particularly in patients with wild-type TP53. Overexpression of ONECUT3 leads to mitotic defects, multinucleation, and chromosomal instability, contributing to the development of CK in MDS. This overexpression is linked to the upregulation of mitosis-related genes such as INCENP and CDCA8, which are part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) (Luo2024Ectopic). ONECUT3 overexpression also results in multidrug resistance in MDS, but targeting the ONECUT3/CPC axis with specific compounds can resensitize cells to treatment (Luo2024Ectopic).

In colorectal cancer, ONECUT3 regulates the activity of HDAC6 and HIF-1α, promoting the Warburg effect and tumor growth. This metabolic reprogramming enhances glycolysis, contributing to tumor progression. Knockdown of ONECUT3 reduces glycolytic metabolism and tumor proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. The gene's expression is associated with larger tumor diameters and higher Ki-67 levels, although it does not directly affect overall survival or disease-free survival (Xue2024Transcription).

## Interactions
ONECUT3, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its regulatory functions. In the context of hypothalamic neuron development, ONECUT3 interacts with neuron navigator-2 (NAV2), a protein involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. This interaction is part of a signaling pathway that includes TRIO and RhoA, which are crucial for cytoskeletal remodeling and neurite outgrowth (Zupančič2024Concerted). 

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), ONECUT3 interacts with components of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), such as INCENP and CDCA8 (Borealin). These interactions lead to mitotic defects and chromosomal instability, contributing to the development of a complex karyotype (Luo2024Ectopic). The transcription factor also binds directly to the promoter regions of genes like INCENP and CDCA8, promoting their transcription (Luo2024Ectopic).

In colorectal cancer, ONECUT3 regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α through HDAC6-mediated deacetylation, enhancing glycolytic gene transcription and promoting the Warburg effect (Xue2024Transcription). These interactions highlight ONECUT3's role in various cellular processes through its dynamic interactions with other proteins and DNA.
