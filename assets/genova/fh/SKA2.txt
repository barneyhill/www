# SKA2

## Overview
The SKA2 gene encodes the spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 2 protein, which is a crucial component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (SKA) complex. This protein plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis, thereby ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Sivakumar2016The; Xie2019SKA2FAM33A:). The SKA2 protein is characterized as a scaffold protein within the SKA complex, interacting with other subunits such as SKA1 and SKA3 to form a stable structure essential for mitotic progression (Xie2019SKA2FAM33A:). Beyond its mitotic functions, SKA2 is involved in regulating secretory autophagy in the brain and modulating stress response pathways through its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (Hartmann2024SKA2). The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to psychiatric disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ren2018SKA2; Kaminsky2015Epigenetic).

## Structure
The SKA2 protein is a component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (SKA) complex, which is crucial for stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis. The human SKA2 gene is located on chromosome 17q22 and produces two splice variant isoforms: NM_182620.3 and NM_001100595.1. The longer isoform, NM_182620.3, consists of 121 amino acids with a molecular weight of 14,188 Da and is primarily composed of three helices. The shorter isoform, NM_001100595.1, has 75 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 8.2 kDa. These isoforms differ at the C-terminal due to an open reading frame (ORF) frame shift (Xie2019SKA2FAM33A:).

The SKA2 protein acts as a scaffold within the SKA complex, which forms a W-shaped dimer. This structure is mainly composed of full-length SKA2, along with specific regions of SKA1 and SKA3. The N-terminal helix of SKA2 interacts with SKA1 and SKA3 to form a short bundle, while the C-terminal helix of SKA2 interacts with a long bundle formed by helices from SKA1 and SKA3. These bundles are connected by a ring structure formed by amino acids from SKA2, SKA1, and SKA3, stabilizing the overall complex (Xie2019SKA2FAM33A:).

## Function
The SKA2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the spindle and kinetochore associated (SKA) complex, which includes SKA1 and SKA3. This complex is essential for proper cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. SKA2 is primarily localized at the kinetochore-microtubule interface, where it plays a vital role in ensuring stable attachment of spindle microtubules to the kinetochore. This stability is crucial for chromosome alignment and segregation, facilitating the timely onset of anaphase and promoting the metaphase-anaphase transition (Sivakumar2016The; Xie2019SKA2FAM33A:).

In addition to its role in mitosis, SKA2 is involved in the regulation of secretory autophagy (SA) in the brain. It acts as a molecular roadblock by inhibiting the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, thus regulating the release of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β. This function is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration (Hartmann2024SKA2).

SKA2 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), enhancing its translocation to the nucleus, which is important for the regulation of genes responsive to glucocorticoids. This interaction plays a role in stress response pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hartmann2024SKA2).

## Clinical Significance
The SKA2 gene has been implicated in various psychiatric disorders, including depression and suicidal behavior. Alterations in SKA2 expression and DNA methylation have been associated with stress response dysregulation, potentially influencing glucocorticoid receptor function and impacting mental health conditions (Kaminsky2015Epigenetic). Studies have shown that SKA2 methylation levels interact with trauma exposure, particularly emotional abuse, to predict suicidal ideation and attempts, suggesting its role as a biomarker for suicidal behavior (Kaminsky2015Epigenetic).

In cancer, SKA2 is overexpressed in several types, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, SKA2 upregulation is linked to increased migration and invasion through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix metalloproteinase pathways (Ren2018SKA2). In HCC, SKA2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and invasion (Jiang2020Spindle; Yu2021Transcript). SKA2's role in tumorigenesis is further supported by its association with poor prognosis in various cancers, where its expression levels are linked to aggressive tumor behavior (Li2023Immunological). These findings highlight SKA2's potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in both psychiatric and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
SKA2 is a component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex, which includes SKA1 and SKA3. This complex is crucial for maintaining stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments during cell division, facilitating proper chromosome segregation. SKA2, as part of the Ska complex, interacts with microtubules and the Ndc80 complex, forming an integrated microtubule-binding assembly that is essential for mitotic progression (Abad2014Structural).

In the context of cancer, SKA2 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer, affecting cell migration and invasion. SKA2 knockdown reduces the expression of mesenchymal markers and matrix metalloproteinases, suggesting its role in modulating EMT-associated proteins (Ren2018SKA2). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SKA2 influences the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where its overexpression enhances oncogenic features by modulating the activity of GSK-3β and β-catenin (Jiang2020Spindle).

While specific physical interactions of SKA2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, its role within the Ska complex and its regulatory impact on signaling pathways highlight its importance in cellular processes and cancer progression.
