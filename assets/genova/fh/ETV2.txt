# ETV2

## Overview
ETV2, or ETS variant transcription factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ETS family of transcription factors, which are characterized by their role in regulating gene expression. The ETV2 protein is a pivotal transcription factor involved in the development of endothelial and hematopoietic lineages, acting as a master regulator during embryogenesis. It is essential for the specification of hemato-endothelial progenitors and is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of blood and vessel structures. The absence of ETV2 results in the complete loss of these lineages, while its overexpression can induce the conversion of non-endothelial cells into endothelial cells (Koyano-Nakagawa2017Etv2; Singh2019Etv2). ETV2's function is mediated through its interactions with other transcription factors and its ability to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby activating target genes involved in critical signaling pathways. Its transient expression during early embryonic stages underscores its role in vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis, and its potential in regenerative medicine is highlighted by its ability to convert human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells (Morita2014ETS).

## Function
ETV2, also known as ETS variant transcription factor 2, is a critical regulator in the development of endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. It functions as a master transcription factor, essential for the specification of hemato-endothelial progenitors during embryogenesis. ETV2 is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of blood and vessel structures, as its absence results in a complete loss of these lineages, while its overexpression can convert non-endothelial cells into endothelial cells (Koyano-Nakagawa2017Etv2; Singh2019Etv2).

ETV2 operates within a complex regulatory network, interacting with other transcription factors such as Gata2, FoxC2, and Sox17 to regulate gene expression crucial for endothelial and hematopoietic development (Koyano-Nakagawa2017Etv2). It binds to specific DNA sequences, including the core binding site GGAA/T, to activate target genes involved in signaling pathways like VEGF, Notch/MAPK, and RHO GTPase activity (Koyano-Nakagawa2017Etv2). ETV2 is transiently expressed in early embryonic stages, particularly in the yolk sac and early embryo, where it promotes vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis (Kataoka2011Etv2/ER71).

In addition to its role in embryogenesis, ETV2 can directly convert human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells, highlighting its potential in regenerative medicine (Morita2014ETS). This conversion involves the induction of key endothelial development factors and the expression of endothelial functional molecules (Morita2014ETS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ETV2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In a study involving a family with congenital heart defects, vertebral abnormalities, and preaxial polydactyly, compound heterozygous variants in the ETV2 gene were identified. These variants were associated with significant developmental anomalies, suggesting a potential novel gene-phenotype association involving ETV2, particularly in relation to congenital heart defects (BaselSalmon2021Biallelic).

ETV2 is also crucial for tumor angiogenesis. Studies have shown that ETV2 is upregulated in tumor-associated endothelial cells, and its deletion impairs tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Inhibition of ETV2 function in tumor models leads to a reduction in tumor volume and blood vessel formation, indicating its essential role in tumor growth and vascularization (Baltrunaite2017ETS).

In the context of ischemic injuries, ETV2 is reactivated in endothelial cells, promoting vascular regeneration. Its absence leads to compromised vascular repair, while overexpression aids recovery by enhancing new vessel formation. This highlights ETV2's potential as a therapeutic target for diseases involving dysfunctional vessel formation, such as myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease (Lee2019ETV2ER71; Park2016InjuryMediated).

## Interactions
ETV2, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in endothelial and hematopoietic development. ETV2 interacts with VEZF1, a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor, through both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. This interaction has been confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, and it plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of the Flt1 gene, a known downstream target of ETV2 (Das2023ETV2).

ETV2 also interacts with other transcription factors such as FoxC2 and Gata2. The interaction with FoxC2 involves binding to a Fox-Ets enhancer motif found in a significant portion of endothelial genes, suggesting a regulatory role in endothelial gene expression (Koyano-Nakagawa2017Etv2). The interaction with Gata2 occurs between the conserved Ets domain of ETV2 and the Gata domain of Gata2, co-activating endothelial and hematopoietic promoters (Koyano-Nakagawa2017Etv2).

ETV2 is also involved in the regulation of Parpbp, a gene associated with ER stress and cell death pathways, particularly in Tsc2-deficient cells. ETV2 binds to the Parpbp promoter, influencing its expression and linking ETV2 to stress response pathways (Shrestha2022ETV2).
