# CCDC127

## Overview
CCDC127 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 127, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. CCDC127 has been identified as a potential regulator of the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) gene expression through its interaction with Hsp105b, a molecular chaperone. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and prevents Hsp105b from translocating to the nucleus, thereby suppressing the activation of the hsp70 promoter (Saito2016Yeast). The protein's role in modulating stress response pathways highlights its potential significance in cellular homeostasis and stress adaptation mechanisms. Further research is needed to fully understand the broader implications of CCDC127's function and its interactions within the cell.

## Structure


## Interactions
CCDC127 is a protein that has been identified as a potential regulator of hsp70 gene expression through its interaction with Hsp105b. It is known to suppress Hsp105b-induced activation of the hsp70 promoter. This suppression is thought to occur through the interaction of CCDC127 with Hsp105b in the cytoplasm, which prevents Hsp105b from localizing to the nucleus, a necessary step for the activation of hsp70 expression (Saito2016Yeast). The interaction between CCDC127 and Hsp105b was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid screening, which identified CCDC127 as one of the proteins binding to the Hsp105b region between amino acids 642 and 662, crucial for hsp70 gene expression (Saito2016Yeast).

CCDC127 is localized in the cytoplasm, contrasting with other proteins like AF9, which localize to the nucleus. Overexpression of CCDC127 significantly suppresses Hsp105b-mediated activation of the hsp70 promoter, as demonstrated in COS-7 cells using a luciferase reporter gene assay (Saito2016Yeast). Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms and additional interactions of CCDC127 remain to be fully elucidated.
