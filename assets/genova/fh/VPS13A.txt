# VPS13A

## Overview
VPS13A is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog A, a large protein involved in lipid transport and cellular homeostasis. This protein is a member of the VPS13 family, which is characterized by its role in lipid transfer at intracellular membrane contact sites, particularly between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (Yeshaw2019Human; Ugur2020Role). The VPS13A protein, also known as chorein, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as for regulating lipid droplets and lysosomal degradation (MuñozBraceras2019VPS13A; Leonzino2021Insights). Mutations in the VPS13A gene are linked to chorea-acanthocytosis, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Dobson‐Stone2004Chorein; Tomiyasu2011Novel). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the XK scramblase and the ER protein VAP-A, underscore its critical role in cellular lipid dynamics and organelle interactions (Park2022Interaction; Yeshaw2019Human).

## Structure
The VPS13A protein is a large, high molecular weight protein composed of 3174 amino acids, encoded by the VPS13A gene. It is part of the VPS13 family, which is characterized by its role in lipid transport at intracellular membrane contact sites (Yeshaw2019Human; Ugur2020Role). The protein has a rod-like structure with a hydrophobic groove that facilitates the direct transfer of lipids between bilayers, similar to the autophagy protein ATG2 (Ugur2020Role).

VPS13A contains several domains, including the N-terminal chorein domain, which is conserved and shares similarities with ATG2, and a C-terminal Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (Park2022Interaction; Leonzino2021Insights). The PH domain is crucial for forming a complex with the XK scramblase, which is necessary for preventing VPS13A-related diseases (Park2022Interaction). The protein also features a Vps13 adaptor binding (VAB) domain and an ATG2 C-terminal domain, which are important for its localization and function (Park2022Interaction).

VPS13A undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including two main transcripts: variant A and variant B, which differ in their exon composition (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). The protein's structure and function are conserved across species, highlighting its essential role in cellular processes (Yeshaw2019Human).

## Function
The VPS13A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating lipid transport and influencing mitochondrial morphology. In healthy human cells, VPS13A is primarily localized to the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), particularly at membrane contact sites (MCS) between these organelles. This localization is mediated by its C-terminal region and an FFAT motif, which allows interaction with the ER protein VAP-A (Yeshaw2019Human; Ugur2020Role).

VPS13A is involved in lipid transport, potentially affecting the protein/lipid ratio in membranes, which is essential for vesicle traffic and protein sorting. This function is critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, as well as for the regulation of lipid droplets, which are important for cellular energy homeostasis and metabolism (Yeshaw2019Human; Leonzino2021Insights).

The protein also plays a role in lysosomal degradation, with its absence leading to impaired autophagy and the accumulation of non-degraded material. This function is particularly significant in brain neurons, where VPS13A helps in autophagic clearance, reducing the accumulation of protein aggregates (MuñozBraceras2019VPS13A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS13A gene are primarily associated with chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. ChAc is characterized by adult-onset chorea, involuntary movements, peripheral acanthocytes, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Nishida2019Novel; Tomiyasu2011Novel). The disorder is caused by loss of function mutations in the VPS13A gene, which encodes the protein chorein. These mutations lead to the absence or significant reduction of chorein, as confirmed by Western blotting in patient cells (Dobson‐Stone2004Chorein; Spieler2020Identification).

The clinical presentation of ChAc includes hyperkinetic movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms, with significant variability in symptoms even among individuals with the same mutation (Shen2017Novel; Tomiyasu2011Novel). The disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although rare cases of autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported (Tomiyasu2011Novel).

Genetic testing for ChAc involves sequencing the VPS13A gene and analyzing copy number variations, as conventional methods may miss small deletions or rearrangements (Spieler2020Identification). The identification of novel mutations and CNVs in VPS13A has expanded the understanding of its mutation diversity and the genetic basis of ChAc (Chaudhari2023Exome; Ouchkat2020Novel).

## Interactions
The VPS13A protein interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the XK scramblase, which is essential for preventing VPS13A-related diseases. This interaction is mediated by the PH domain at the C-terminal end of VPS13A, rather than the VAB domain as previously thought. The interaction is disrupted in patients with a specific truncation mutation that removes the last 31 amino acids of VPS13A, leading to disease (Park2022Interaction). 

VPS13A also interacts with the ER-resident protein VAP-A through a FFAT motif, which is crucial for its localization at ER-mitochondria contact sites. This interaction is influenced by cellular calcium levels, suggesting a role in organelle contact site regulation (Yeshaw2019Human). 

Additionally, VPS13A interacts with RAB7A, a GTPase involved in endosomal and autophagosomal trafficking. This interaction suggests a role for VPS13A in the endolysosomal pathway, particularly in lysosomal degradation (MuñozBraceras2019VPS13A). These interactions highlight VPS13A's involvement in lipid transfer and organelle dynamics, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis.
