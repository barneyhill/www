# KCNJ14

## Overview
KCNJ14 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 14, also known as Kir2.4. This protein is a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family, which is characterized by its ability to allow potassium ions to flow more easily into rather than out of the cell. Kir2.4 is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating electrical signaling in various cell types, including neurons and muscle cells (Hibino2010Inwardly). The gene's expression and function are implicated in several physiological processes, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle function, as well as inner ear homeostasis (Kim2011Expression; Kim2015Electrogenic). Additionally, alterations in KCNJ14 expression have been associated with clinical conditions, including colorectal cancer, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Li2022KCNJ14).

## Structure
The KCNJ14 gene encodes the Kir2.4 inwardly rectifying potassium channel, which is part of the Kir2.x subfamily. The primary structure of the Kir2.4 protein consists of 436 amino acids, with notable sequence variations in the NH2 and COOH-terminal regions compared to its rat and guinea pig orthologs (Töpert2000Cloning). The secondary structure includes two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) flanking a pore-forming region (H5), which is a common feature among Kir channels (Hibino2010Inwardly). The H5 region acts as the ion-selectivity filter, sharing a signature sequence with other K+-selective ion channels (Hibino2010Inwardly).

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains to form a functional channel, with the cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini contributing to the stability of the cytoplasmic region (Hibino2010Inwardly). The quaternary structure of Kir2.4 involves the formation of tetrameric complexes, which can be homomeric or heteromeric, as seen in Kir2.1/2.4 channels found in the brain (Hibino2010Inwardly). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can modulate the activity of Kir2.x channels, including Kir2.4 (Hibino2010Inwardly).

## Function
KCNJ14 encodes the Kir2.4 protein, a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family, which plays a crucial role in regulating potassium ion flow across the cell membrane. These channels are essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells (Hibino2010Inwardly). Kir2.4 channels are involved in various physiological processes, including heart rate regulation, neurotransmitter release, and epithelial electrolyte transport (Li2022KCNJ14).

In cardiac muscle, Kir2.4 contributes to the inward rectifier current (I K1), which is vital for the final repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. This function is crucial for maintaining the cellular resting membrane potential and ensuring proper cardiac function (Szuts2013Altered). In skeletal muscle, Kir2.4 channels help regulate membrane potential, playing a central role in muscle contraction and relaxation (Kim2011Expression).

Kir2.4 is also expressed in the human endolymphatic sac epithelium, where it contributes to maintaining ionic balance and electrogenic transport, crucial for inner ear homeostasis and fluid regulation (Kim2015Electrogenic). The protein's activity is primarily localized to the cell membrane, influencing cellular excitability and signal transduction (Hibino2010Inwardly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KCNJ14 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression of KCNJ14 is notably higher in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and this elevated expression is associated with shorter overall survival in patients. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for CRC, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Li2022KCNJ14). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are crucial components of the immune microenvironment in CRC (Li2022KCNJ14).

KCNJ14 is involved in several cancer-related signaling pathways, including mTOR, NOD-like receptor, and VEGF pathways, which are associated with tumor progression. Knockdown experiments have demonstrated that reducing KCNJ14 expression can decrease cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in CRC pathogenesis (Li2022KCNJ14). The regulation of KCNJ14 expression by DNA methylation, particularly at the cg17660703 site, has also been identified, with high methylation status correlating with poor prognosis in CRC (Li2022KCNJ14). These findings highlight the potential of KCNJ14 as a therapeutic target and biomarker for CRC prognosis.
