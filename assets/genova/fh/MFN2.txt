# MFN2

## Overview
Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) is a gene that encodes the mitofusin 2 protein, a mitochondrial transmembrane GTPase crucial for mitochondrial fusion and cellular homeostasis. The protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, including the fusion and fission processes that are essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy (Zorzano2015Mitofusin). Mitofusin 2 also plays a significant role in the transport of axonal mitochondria, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial distribution and function within neurons (Misko2010Mitofusin). Additionally, MFN2 is involved in the formation of mitochondria-ER contacts, influencing cellular processes such as calcium signaling and lipid exchange (Filadi2018Mitofusin). Mutations in the MFN2 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A, highlighting its importance in neurological health (Baloh2007Altered).

## Structure
Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) is a mitochondrial transmembrane GTPase protein involved in mitochondrial fusion. The primary structure of MFN2 consists of 757 amino acids and includes several distinct domains: a large N-terminal GTPase domain, a spacer, a first coiled-coil heptad-repeat (HR1) domain, a proline-rich (PR) domain unique to MFN2, two transmembrane (TM) domains, another spacer, and a second C-terminal heptad-repeat domain (HR2) (Filadi2018Mitofusin). The secondary structure features alpha-helices and a central nine-stranded β-sheet within the GTPase domain (Li2019Structural).

The tertiary structure involves interactions between the coiled-coil regions, with the HR2 domains forming antiparallel dimers that tether adjacent mitochondria (Filadi2018Mitofusin). The quaternary structure is characterized by dimerization, which is crucial for its function in mitochondrial fusion. MFN2 forms stable dimers during GTP hydrolysis, which remain associated post-reaction, contributing to its high membrane-tethering efficiency (Li2019Structural).

Post-translational modifications of MFN2 include phosphorylation, which can inactivate the protein by blocking the GTP binding groove (Li2019Structural). Mutations in MFN2 are linked to diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A, affecting its GTPase activity and dimerization abilities (Li2019Structural).

## Function
Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) is a mitochondrial transmembrane GTPase that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial fusion, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular health. MFN2, along with its homolog MFN1, facilitates the tethering of adjacent mitochondria by forming antiparallel dimers between their HR2 domains, which is critical for the initial tethering of mitochondria. The GTPase domain is likely essential for the completion of fusion (Filadi2018Mitofusin). MFN2 is also involved in the transport of axonal mitochondria, interacting with the miro/milton complex to link mitochondria to kinesin motors, facilitating their movement along axons (Misko2010Mitofusin). This transport is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial distribution and function within neurons (Misko2010Mitofusin).

MFN2 regulates mitochondrial dynamics by balancing fusion and fission processes, which are crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and the elimination of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy (Zorzano2015Mitofusin). It also plays a role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria association, acting as a negative modulator of ER-mitochondria juxtaposition (Filadi2018Mitofusin). MFN2's role in mitochondrial transport and fusion is distinct, as it does not affect the transport of other organelles like endosomes and peroxisomes (Misko2010Mitofusin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MFN2 gene are primarily associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A), a hereditary neuropathy characterized by the degeneration of peripheral sensory and motor axons. These mutations account for a significant proportion of CMT2 cases, with estimates ranging from 19% to 33% of patients (Baloh2007Altered). The clinical manifestations of CMT2A due to MFN2 mutations vary widely, from severe, early-onset neuropathy to milder, late-onset forms. Common symptoms include walking difficulties, sensory deficits, and in some cases, optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing defects (Abati2022Clinical; Ma2021The).

MFN2 mutations often lead to impaired mitochondrial fusion and trafficking, resulting in mitochondrial clustering and defective axonal transport. This disruption is linked to the degeneration of distal axons, which are highly dependent on proper mitochondrial distribution (Baloh2007Altered; McCray2021Axonal). Additionally, MFN2 mutations can affect mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) function, although they do not impair bioenergetic function (Larrea2019MFN2).

Alterations in MFN2 expression or function are also implicated in other conditions, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular conditions, due to its critical role in mitochondrial dynamics (Dorn2020Mitofusin).

## Interactions
Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence mitochondrial dynamics and cellular processes. MFN2 interacts with Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) to mediate the fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane, forming both homotypic and heterotypic complexes (Zaman2022The; Chen2021Mitochondrial). It also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a role in tethering mitochondria to the ER, forming mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) (Zaman2022The; McLelland2018Mfn2).

MFN2 is a key player in mitophagy, interacting with the PINK1/Parkin pathway. It is ubiquitinated by Parkin, which is crucial for the separation of mitochondria from the ER during mitophagy (McLelland2018Mfn2). This interaction is regulated by the p97 protein complex, which extracts ubiquitinated MFN2, facilitating the release of ER from mitochondria (McLelland2018Mfn2).

In the context of sperm flagellar structure, MFN2 interacts with meiosis-specific nuclear structural 1 (MNS1), a protein essential for flagellar biogenesis. This interaction is important for the communication between the mitochondrial sheath and the fibrous sheath in sperm cells (Vadnais2014Mitochondrial). These interactions highlight MFN2's multifaceted role in cellular function and its involvement in various physiological processes.
