# RANBP17

## Overview
RANBP17 is a gene that encodes the RAN binding protein 17, a member of the importin-β superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. This protein functions as a nuclear transport receptor, facilitating the movement of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression. RAN binding protein 17 is characterized by its importin β N-terminal domain and HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs that contribute to its function in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The protein is also involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as a co-activator for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E12, thereby influencing the transcription of E-box dependent genes. RANBP17 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, liver, kidney, and brain, underscoring its widespread biological significance (Akter2024RANBP17; Lee2010Identification).

## Structure
RANBP17 is a member of the importin-β superfamily, characterized by its involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The protein contains an importin β N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its function as a nuclear transport receptor (Nelson2013Characterization). RANBP17 shares high sequence homology with CRM1, another member of the importin β superfamily, suggesting similar structural features and functional roles in nuclear export pathways (Nelson2013Characterization). The CRM1 homology region of RANBP17 spans amino acids 2-167 and is essential for its interaction with the E12 transcription factor, enhancing E-box mediated transcriptional activity (Lee2010Identification).

RANBP17 is expressed in multiple transcript sizes, with a 4.5 kb transcript encoding the full-length protein. A shorter form, sRANBP17, is produced through alternative splicing, resulting in a truncated protein (Lee2010Identification). The protein's structure includes HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs forming solenoid-like structures, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures. These repeats are typical of the importin β superfamily and facilitate the protein's role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence RANBP17's function and interactions, although specific modifications have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
RANBP17 is a member of the importin-β superfamily and plays a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT), which is essential for the movement of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In healthy human cells, RANBP17 facilitates the nuclear import and export of proteins and mRNA, maintaining proper cellular function and gene expression (Akter2024RANBP17). It is particularly important for the nuclear transport of cargos containing nuclear localization signals (NLS) through the nuclear pore complex by interacting with FG-repeat-containing nucleoporins (Mertens2015Directly).

RANBP17 is also involved in transcriptional regulation. It acts as a co-activator for the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor E12, enhancing E12-mediated transcriptional activity when E12 forms a heterodimer with MyoD, a key regulator of muscle development (Lee2010Identification). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of E-box dependent genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Waf1/Cip1, which plays a role in cell cycle regulation (Lee2010Identification).

RANBP17's expression is observed in various tissues, including the heart, liver, kidney, and brain, indicating its widespread importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Lee2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RANBP17 gene have been implicated in several age-related and neurological conditions. In the context of aging, RANBP17 is significantly downregulated in various human tissues, including fibroblasts, induced neurons, and the cortex. This downregulation is associated with impaired nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization, potentially leading to age-related cellular dysfunctions and phenotypes across different organs (Mertens2015Directly).

In glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, RANBP17 is downregulated due to DNA methylation, which may contribute to the disease's progression (Bhargava2016Elucidation). The gene's expression is also reduced in DYT1 dystonia, a hereditary neurological movement disorder. This reduction disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport and neurodevelopment in motor neurons. Overexpression of RANBP17 in these neurons can restore nucleocytoplasmic transport and ameliorate neurodevelopmental deficits, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for DYT1 dystonia (Akter2024RANBP17).

The expression of RANBP17 is also influenced by DNA methylation, as demonstrated in a study involving a discordant infant monozygotic twin pair, where changes in methylation status significantly impacted its expression (Russo2021Genetic).

## Interactions
RANBP17, a member of the importin-β superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in nucleocytoplasmic transport. It has been identified as a novel interaction partner for the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor E12, a product of the E2A/TCF3 gene. This interaction was discovered through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that the CRM1 homology region of RANBP17 is sufficient for mediating this interaction (Lee2010Identification).

RANBP17 enhances E2A/MyoD-mediated transactivation of an E-box regulated luciferase reporter gene, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation. It also increases the level of endogenous transcripts for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Waf1/Cip1, a known E2A target gene (Lee2010Identification). RANBP17 interacts with E47 and MyoD, proteins closely related to E12, enhancing E-box regulated gene transcription mediated by these factors (Lee2010Identification).

In the context of nucleocytoplasmic transport, RANBP17 is involved in the nuclear import of factors like the transcription factor E12, which is linked to lymphocyte development (Mandic2022The). It also plays a crucial role in maintaining proper nucleocytoplasmic transport activities, as evidenced by its involvement in protein and mRNA transport in motor neurons (Akter2024RANBP17).
