# LAMTOR5

## Overview
LAMTOR5, or late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 5, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the Ragulator complex, which is pivotal in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in facilitating the localization and activation of mTORC1 on lysosomal membranes, thereby influencing cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and autophagy (Zhang2019The; Mu2017Structural). LAMTOR5 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses and is essential for embryogenesis and stem cell differentiation, underscoring its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Zhang2019The; Qin2022Hbxip). Alterations in LAMTOR5 expression have been linked to cancer progression and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2019The; Fang2019LAMTOR5).

## Structure
The LAMTOR5 protein is a component of the Ragulator complex, which plays a crucial role in mTORC1 signaling by anchoring it to the lysosomal membrane. The Ragulator complex is composed of five subunits: Lamtor1, Lamtor2, Lamtor3, Lamtor4, and Lamtor5. Within this complex, Lamtor5 forms a heterodimer with Lamtor4, stabilized by interactions with Lamtor1, which wraps around the other subunits to provide structural integrity through extensive hydrophobic interactions (Mu2017Structural).

Lamtor5 interacts with Lamtor1 through hydrophobic interactions and charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds, involving specific residues on the α3-helix of Lamtor1 and various strands of Lamtor5 (Mu2017Structural). The structural role of Lamtor5 is further highlighted by its comparison to the yeast Ego-TC complex, where it is suggested to be equivalent to Ego2, indicating a conserved structural function (Mu2017Structural).

Although specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of Lamtor5 are not provided, its involvement in the quaternary structure of the Ragulator complex is well-documented. The protein's role in stabilizing the complex is essential for the localization and function of mTORC1 (Mu2017Structural; BarPeled2014Regulation).

## Function
LAMTOR5, also known as late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 5, is a crucial component of the Ragulator complex, which is essential for the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) on lysosomal membranes. This protein plays a significant role in cellular growth, metabolism, and autophagy by facilitating amino acid signaling to mTORC1, impacting cell proliferation and survival (Zhang2019The; Qin2022Hbxip).

In healthy human cells, LAMTOR5 is involved in modulating inflammatory signaling through its interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). It promotes the autophagic degradation of TLR4, thereby controlling the magnitude and duration of inflammatory responses. This process is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing sustained inflammation (Zhang2019The). LAMTOR5 also regulates the mTOR/TFEB axis, influencing lysosomal biogenesis and function, which is vital for cellular homeostasis (Zhang2019The).

LAMTOR5's role extends to embryogenesis and embryonic stem cell differentiation, where it is essential for mTORC1 activation. Its absence leads to significant differentiation defects and embryonic lethality, highlighting its importance in development and cell differentiation (Qin2022Hbxip).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LAMTOR5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory conditions. In breast cancer, LAMTOR5 is associated with metastasis through its role in abnormal O-glycosylation. It modulates the activity of GALNT1, leading to the accumulation of the Tn antigen, a marker of cancer progression. This process is linked to increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Fang2019LAMTOR5). LAMTOR5 also influences the expression and activation of c-Src, contributing to the invasive properties of cancer cells (Fang2019LAMTOR5).

In liver cancer, LAMTOR5 is identified as an oncogenic factor that upregulates GLUT1 expression via the activation of NF-κB, contributing to abnormal glucose metabolism characteristic of cancer cells (Zhou2019Oncoprotein).

LAMTOR5 also plays a role in regulating inflammatory signaling. It suppresses TLR4-induced inflammatory responses by promoting TLR4 degradation through the autophagic pathway. Alterations in LAMTOR5 expression can lead to dysregulated TLR4 signaling, which is implicated in various inflammatory and metabolic disorders (Zhang2019The). These findings suggest that LAMTOR5 could be a potential therapeutic target for treating cancer metastasis and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
LAMTOR5, also known as late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 5, is a component of the Ragulator complex, which plays a crucial role in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Within the Ragulator complex, LAMTOR5 interacts with other subunits such as Lamtor1, Lamtor2, Lamtor3, and Lamtor4. These interactions are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds, particularly between Lamtor1 and Lamtor5, involving specific residues on their α-helices and β strands (Mu2017Structural). LAMTOR5 also forms a subcomplex with Lamtor4, which is stabilized by Lamtor1 (Mu2017Structural).

LAMTOR5 interacts with TLR4, a key receptor in inflammatory signaling. This interaction is mediated through the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of LAMTOR5 and the Toll/IL-1 receptor homology (TIR) domain of TLR4, facilitating their colocalization at autolysosomes. This association is crucial for promoting TLR4 degradation via the autophagic pathway, thereby suppressing inflammatory signaling (Zhang2019The). LAMTOR5's interaction with TLR4 is pH-sensitive and lysosome-dependent, serving as a feedback mechanism to control inflammation (Zhang2019The). Additionally, LAMTOR5 is involved in the regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and mTORC1 activation, impacting cellular nutrient sensing and growth regulation (Zhang2019The).
