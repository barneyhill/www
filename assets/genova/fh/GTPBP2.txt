# GTPBP2

## Overview
GTPBP2 is a gene that encodes the GTP binding protein 2, a member of the GTPase family involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and ribosome function. The protein plays a significant role as a regulatory component in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it influences the stability of β-catenin by modulating the levels of Axin, a key negative regulator of the pathway (Gillis2016Gtpbp2; Jie2021GTPBP2). Additionally, GTP binding protein 2 is implicated in mRNA surveillance and ribosome-associated quality control, interacting with proteins such as Pelota to maintain ribosome function and mRNA stability (Zinoviev2018Functions). The gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, testis, and lung, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jie2021GTPBP2). Mutations in GTPBP2 have been associated with neuro-ectodermal syndromes and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Carter2019Clinical; Jie2021GTPBP2).

## Function
GTPBP2 is a GTP-binding protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of Wnt signaling and ribosome function. In the context of Wnt signaling, GTPBP2 acts as a positive regulator by maintaining low levels of Axin, a negative regulator of the pathway. This regulation is crucial for the inactivation of the β-catenin destruction complex, thereby facilitating Wnt signaling, which is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation (Gillis2016Gtpbp2; Jie2021GTPBP2). GTPBP2's role in Wnt signaling is particularly evident in Xenopus embryos, where its knockdown leads to defects in axial patterning and reduced expression of organizer genes (Gillis2016Gtpbp2).

In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, GTPBP2 is implicated in mRNA surveillance and ribosome-associated quality control mechanisms. It is suggested to interact with Pelota and may be involved in the disassembly of ribosomes stalled due to nonfunctional tRNA, which is important for maintaining ribosome function and mRNA stability (Zinoviev2018Functions). GTPBP2 is highly expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, testis, and lung, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and homeostasis (Jie2021GTPBP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GTPBP2 gene have been linked to a neuro-ectodermal syndrome characterized by a range of clinical features, including prenatal onset microcephaly, tone abnormalities, movement disorders, epilepsy, dysmorphic features, retinal dysfunction, ectodermal dysplasia, and brain iron accumulation. This condition has been observed in individuals from multiple unrelated families, with some features, such as brain iron accumulation, appearing only after childhood (Carter2019Clinical). 

In a specific study, a splice site mutation in GTPBP2, c.1237-1G>T, was identified in a family with neurodegeneration and iron deposition in the brain. This mutation leads to the deletion of exon 9, resulting in a truncated protein and is associated with symptoms such as cerebellar vermian atrophy, dystonia, ataxia, and reduced muscle tone (Jaberi2016Identification).

Altered expression of GTPBP2 has also been implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression levels of GTPBP2 are associated with increased invasion, migration, and proliferation of NSCLC cells, correlating with advanced TNM stages and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of GTPBP2 in NSCLC cells results in reduced cancer cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Jie2021GTPBP2).

## Interactions
GTPBP2 is involved in several interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. It has been identified as a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, where it interacts with components of the β-catenin destruction complex, including Axin and Gsk3b. GTPBP2 co-immunoprecipitates with these proteins, suggesting a physical interaction that is crucial for maintaining low levels of Axin, thereby facilitating Wnt signaling (Gillis2016Gtpbp2). In Xenopus embryos, GTPBP2 is required for the normal regulation of Smad1/BMP target genes, indicating its role in the BMP signaling pathway as well (Gillis2016Gtpbp2).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GTPBP2 is implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where its knockdown results in decreased β-catenin and increased Axin protein levels, highlighting its role in regulating β-catenin stability (Jie2021GTPBP2). GTPBP2 also interacts with the MH1 domain of Smad1, which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor cell transformation (Jie2021GTPBP2).

Despite these interactions, GTPBP2 does not interact with RNA-binding proteins or exosome components, distinguishing its physiological roles from those of GTPBP1 (Woo2011Modulation).
