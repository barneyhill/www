# NOL3

## Overview
NOL3, also known as nucleolar protein 3, is a gene that encodes the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), a protein primarily involved in inhibiting apoptosis. ARC is characterized by its caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which is crucial for its role as an apoptosis repressor, and a C-terminal domain that binds calcium ions and tumor protein p53. This protein is predominantly expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, where it plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspase-8, caspase-2, PUMA, and Bax (SOHN2016TatNOL3; Yu2019Role). NOL3's involvement in cellular stress responses and its interactions with various signaling pathways underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential therapeutic applications in diseases such as ischemic brain injury and certain cancers (SOHN2016TatNOL3; Stanley2017A).

## Structure
The NOL3 gene encodes the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), a protein involved in inhibiting apoptosis. The protein is composed of 208 amino acids and has a relative molecular mass of approximately 22,629 Da. It contains two main domains: the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) and the C-terminal domain. The CARD, which is part of the death domain superfamily, consists of 95 amino acids and forms a dimer structure with a five-helix bundle. This structure is crucial for its anti-apoptotic function, as it interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspase-8, caspase-2, PUMA, and Bax (Yu2019Role). The C-terminal domain, comprising 113 amino acids, is responsible for binding calcium ions and tumor protein p53, contributing to the suppression of apoptosis (Yu2019Role).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2), influence ARC's stability and localization, affecting its anti-apoptotic function (Yu2019Role). The molecular weight of ARC varies across different cell types, suggesting the presence of post-translational modifications (Yu2019Role). The NOL3 gene may also have splice variant isoforms that can impact the protein's function and localization.

## Function
NOL3, also known as nucleolar protein 3 or ARC, is involved in inhibiting apoptosis and regulating cell survival. It is highly expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, where it plays a significant role in inhibiting physiological apoptotic pathways (SOHN2016TatNOL3). NOL3 contains two functional domains: the CARD domain and the proline/glutamic acid (P/E) domain. The CARD domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and can downregulate the activity of caspase-2 and -8 through CARD-CARD interactions, thereby protecting against oxidative stress-induced cell death, particularly in neuronal cells (SOHN2016TatNOL3).

In the context of cellular stress, NOL3 helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and prevents DNA fragmentation, which are critical for cell survival under oxidative conditions (SOHN2016TatNOL3). The protein is also noted for its role in protecting hippocampal neuronal cells from oxidative stress-induced damage by modulating apoptotic pathways, including the regulation of proteins such as Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and caspase-8 (SOHN2016TatNOL3). These functions highlight NOL3's importance in cellular homeostasis and stress responses, contributing to its potential therapeutic applications in conditions like ischemic brain injury (SOHN2016TatNOL3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOL3 gene, also known as nucleolar protein 3, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, NOL3 is upregulated, promoting tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance. High levels of the protein encoded by NOL3, known as ARC, are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Studies have shown that reducing ARC levels can decrease tumor volume and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (MedinaRamirez2011Apoptosis).

In contrast, NOL3 appears to function as a tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies, such as primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and other myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The gene is frequently down-regulated in these conditions, and its deletion is associated with increased activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to enhanced cell cycling and myelomonocytic differentiation. This suggests that NOL3 plays a critical role in regulating these pathways and maintaining normal hematopoietic cell function (Stanley2017A).

In glioblastoma, NOL3 is part of a four RNA binding protein signature that serves as a poor prognostic indicator. Silencing NOL3 in glioma stem-like cells inhibits their maintenance, indicating its role in glioma progression (Bhargava2016Elucidation).

## Interactions
NOL3, also known as nucleolar protein 3 or ARC, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in regulating apoptosis. It is characterized by its caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitates interactions with other proteins, particularly caspases. NOL3 can downregulate the activity of caspase-2 and caspase-8 through CARD-CARD interactions, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (SOHN2016TatNOL3). 

In the context of myeloid malignancies, NOL3 has been shown to interact with components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The loss of NOL3 leads to increased activation of this pathway, which is associated with the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). This suggests that NOL3 may act as a negative modulator of JAK-STAT signaling, potentially functioning as a scaffolding protein that inhibits these signaling pathways (Stanley2017A). 

NOL3's interactions extend to its role in cellular stress responses, where it is involved in multiprotein complexes that influence cell survival pathways. These interactions highlight NOL3's function as an apoptosis repressor and its potential involvement in broader cellular processes related to stress and survival (SOHN2016TatNOL3).
