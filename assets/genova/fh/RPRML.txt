# RPRML

## Overview
RPRML is a gene that encodes the reprimo-like protein, which is part of the reprimo family of proteins. This family is known for its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The reprimo-like protein is characterized as a regulatory protein involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of cell proliferation and response to DNA damage. It is implicated in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for its potential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of the reprimo-like protein may provide insights into its contributions to cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.
