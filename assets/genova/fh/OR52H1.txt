# OR52H1

## Overview
OR52H1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily H member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory epithelium (Geithe2015A). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR52H1 has been implicated in neurological contexts, particularly in the brain's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where its expression is notably down-regulated in individuals with chronic schizophrenia (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). This suggests a potential involvement in brain function and psychiatric conditions. Additionally, OR52H1 has been associated with survival outcomes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Diviney2019An).

## Function
OR52H1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR52H1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Geithe2015A).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR52H1 has been studied in the context of its expression in the brain, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Research has shown that OR52H1 is significantly down-regulated in individuals with chronic schizophrenia, suggesting a potential role in brain function beyond olfaction (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). The expression of OR52H1 in the brain may be influenced by antipsychotic treatments, indicating that it could be involved in the molecular processes related to psychiatric conditions (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

OR52H1 has also been shown to respond to specific chemical stimuli, such as diacetyl, in experimental settings, although its precise function in healthy cells outside the olfactory system remains less clear (Geithe2015A).

## Clinical Significance
The OR52H1 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to neurological disorders. In chronic schizophrenia, the expression of OR52H1 is significantly down-regulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This down-regulation is not correlated with factors such as antipsychotic dose, age of onset, or duration of illness, suggesting a direct association with the condition itself (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). The study highlights that the down-regulation of olfactory receptors, including OR52H1, may be linked to cognitive alterations observed in schizophrenia and could be involved in the mechanisms or side effects of antipsychotic treatments (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

In the context of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), OR52H1 has been identified as a high survival marker when upregulated in the youngest patients, indicating its potential role in influencing survival outcomes in this demographic (Diviney2019An).

Additionally, OR52H1 has shown evidence of positive selection along the human lineage, which may suggest its functional importance in olfactory processes. However, there is a cautionary note that this evidence might be an artifact of the statistical methods used (Harris2006The).
