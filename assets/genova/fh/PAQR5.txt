# PAQR5

## Overview
PAQR5 is a gene that encodes the protein progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 5, also known as membrane progestin receptor gamma (mPRγ). This protein is a member of the PAQR family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) pass motif typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Tang2005PAQR). As a transmembrane receptor, PAQR5 is primarily located in the cell membrane, where it plays a crucial role in rapid extranuclear signaling and various cellular processes, including metabolic regulation and immune response (Lu2022Expression; Petersen2013Nonclassical). The protein's involvement in essential metabolic pathways and its potential interactions with immune checkpoint molecules underscore its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Additionally, PAQR5 has been implicated in clinical contexts, particularly in kidney-related diseases, where its expression levels serve as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets (Lu2022Expression; Abramicheva2023Decreased).

## Structure
PAQR5 is a member of the PAQR protein family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) pass motif, which is a common feature of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Tang2005PAQR). The protein structure of PAQR5 is predicted to include a predominant alpha-helical conformation for the transmembrane domains, with invariant amino acids at specific positions within the UPF0073 motif. These invariant residues are located at the start of the first TM domain (NXXS/TH), the end of the second TM domain (SXXXH), and the start of the seventh TM domain (HXXXH) (Tang2005PAQR).

PAQR5 is also known as membrane progestin receptor gamma (mPRγ) and is part of the Class II clade of the PAQR family, which includes an eighth predicted hydrophobic motif that is C-terminal to the conserved PAQR core (Smith2008Heterologous). The protein is primarily located in the cell membrane, where it is involved in rapid extranuclear signaling (Petersen2013Nonclassical). The PAQR5 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is common among proteins with similar structures (Smith2008Heterologous). However, specific details about the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of PAQR5 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PAQR5, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, functions as a membrane-bound receptor primarily active in the cell membrane. It is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and metabolic regulation. In healthy human cells, PAQR5 plays a role in the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, branched-chain amino acid metabolic processes, and steroid binding, indicating its involvement in essential metabolic pathways (Lu2022Expression). The protein is implicated in the regulation of the citrate cycle, propanoate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, highlighting its role in energy production and metabolic homeostasis (Lu2022Expression).

PAQR5 is also associated with immune regulation, as its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, including B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Lu2022Expression). This suggests that PAQR5 may influence immune responses and potentially modulate immune checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4, PD-1, and LAG3, which are critical in immune regulation (Lu2022Expression). The protein's activity in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, impacting both metabolic and immune functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAQR5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in kidney-related diseases. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), high expression of PAQR5 is associated with better overall survival and relapse-free survival, making it a positive prognostic marker. Conversely, low PAQR5 expression correlates with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval, indicating its potential as an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcomes in KIRC patients (Lu2022Expression).

In the context of renal fibrosis, decreased expression of PAQR5 is linked to the absence of nephroprotective effects of progesterone in a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). This downregulation is associated with increased fibrosis markers and proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that PAQR5 plays a crucial role in renal physiology and potentially in chronic kidney disease progression (Abramicheva2023Decreased). The study also highlights that decreased PAQR5 expression may lead to increased inflammation and fibrosis, contributing to the progression of obstructive nephropathy (Abramicheva2023Decreased).

These findings underscore the importance of PAQR5 expression levels in kidney health and disease, suggesting that it could serve as a potential therapeutic target in renal pathologies.

## Interactions
PAQR5, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. PAQR5 interacts with several proteins, including GNA1, HRAS, and GNAS, as identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses using tools like GeneMANIA and STRING. These interactions suggest that PAQR5 is involved in tumor development and metabolic processes (Lu2022Expression).

PAQR5 is also part of a group of progestin-binding proteins that contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions, which are associated with protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. These LRRs, along with transmembrane domains, suggest a potential role in signaling through ion channel-linked cell surface receptors (Morrill2013A). The presence of caveolin binding motifs in PAQR5 indicates its association with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which may facilitate its interactions with other cellular components (Morrill2013A).

In the context of kidney cancer, PAQR5 expression correlates with the infiltration of immune cells such as B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, which is relevant for immune response and prognosis (Lu2022Expression). These interactions highlight the potential of PAQR5 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.
