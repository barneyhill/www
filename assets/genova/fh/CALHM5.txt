# CALHM5

## Overview
CALHM5 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium homeostasis modulator family member 5, which is part of the calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family. This protein functions as a large-pore ATP-releasing channel and is characterized by its unique structural features, including an undecameric assembly with four transmembrane helices. CALHM5 plays a significant role in neuronal activities, particularly in gustatory signaling and neuronal excitability, by facilitating ATP release, which is crucial for neurotransmission. The protein's activity is modulated by membrane depolarization and extracellular calcium levels, as well as lipid interactions that influence its gating mechanism. While the specific physiological roles of CALHM5 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its structural and functional properties suggest potential implications in neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, and other pathologies (Bhat2021Human; Liu2020CryoEM).

## Structure
The CALHM5 protein is a member of the calcium homeostasis modulator family, characterized by its unique structural features. It assembles as an undecamer, forming a large pore ATP-releasing channel with a truncated cone-shaped architecture. The structure spans the cell membrane with dimensions of approximately 95 Å in height, 125 Å in extracellular width, and 145 Å in intracellular width (Bhat2021Human; Liu2020CryoEM).

Each subunit of CALHM5 consists of four transmembrane helices (TM1-TM4), an N-terminal helix (NTH), an intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) with three α-helices (CH1-3), and an extracellular loop region. The TM1 and NTH regions are well-defined, with TM1 positioned parallel to the central axis of symmetry and NTH projecting towards the constricting axis, contributing to the channel's pore structure (Bhat2021Human; Liu2020CryoEM).

The pore of CALHM5 has a broad diameter of approximately 60 Å, narrowing at the constriction with a minimum diameter of 34 Å. Lipid molecules play a crucial role in the gating mechanism, with tightly bound lipids stabilizing the structure and influencing conformational changes and pore sizes (Bhat2021Human; Liu2020CryoEM). The structural analysis of CALHM5 provides insights into its function and potential therapeutic implications in neurological pathologies (Bhat2021Human).

## Function
CALHM5 is a member of the calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family, which functions as large-pore ATP-releasing channels involved in neuronal activities such as gustatory signaling and neuronal excitability (Bhat2021Human). The protein is characterized by an undecameric structure with four transmembrane helices, an N-terminal helix, an extracellular loop region, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Bhat2021Human). This structural configuration suggests that CALHM5 plays a role in ATP release, which is crucial for neurotransmission and other neurological functions (Bhat2021Human).

CALHM5 is activated by membrane depolarization and a reduction in extracellular calcium, indicating its involvement in neural gustatory signaling pathways (Bhat2021Human). The protein's function is influenced by lipid interactions, which are thought to regulate conformational changes during channel gating, suggesting that lipids act as modulators controlling the assembly of the channel (Bhat2021Human). While the specific function of CALHM5 in healthy human cells remains less clear, its structural analysis implies a significant role in pathological conditions, particularly in relation to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (Bhat2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
CALHM5, a member of the calcium homeostasis modulator family, is implicated in various neurological functions and pathologies. While specific diseases directly linked to CALHM5 mutations are not detailed, its role in neurological conditions is suggested by its involvement in calcium signaling and neuronal excitability. CALHM5 has been structurally characterized, revealing a large pore channel structure that may influence its pathophysiological roles, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (Bhat2021Human). The channel's function in ATP release and neurotransmitter signaling further underscores its potential impact on neurological health (Bhat2021Human).

Alterations in CALHM5 expression have been observed in different contexts. For instance, in ovarian granulosa cells, downregulation of CALHM5 was noted in cells with reduced epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity, suggesting a role in calcium mobilization and potentially impacting female fertility and estrogen regulation (Ma2024The). In breast cancer, CALHM5 expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating a possible involvement in cancer biology, although specific conditions related to its mutations remain unspecified (Yun2023Oncogenic). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise clinical implications of CALHM5 alterations.
