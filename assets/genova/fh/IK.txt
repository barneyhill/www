# IK

## Overview
The IK gene encodes the IK cytokine, a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system. As a cytokine, IK is involved in cell signaling and can influence the behavior of cells, particularly in the context of immune responses. The protein is categorized as a signaling molecule, which is essential for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The IK cytokine is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and it may interact with other proteins to modulate these pathways. Understanding the function and interactions of the IK cytokine is vital for elucidating its role in health and disease, particularly in immune-related conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
