responses. These receptors recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are expressed on infectious agents. The protein encoded by this gene recognizes bacterial flagellin, the principal component of bacterial flagella and a virulence factor. The activation of this receptor mobilizes the nuclear factor NF-kappaB, which in turn activates a host of inflammatory-related target genes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with both resistance and susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and susceptibility to Legionnaire disease.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2009].", "symbol": "TLR5", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1336637"}, "unigene": "Hs.604542", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O60602", "TrEMBL": ["B1AZ06", "A0A2R8Y7Z4", "A0A2R8Y4Q2"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "TLR 5"}}
