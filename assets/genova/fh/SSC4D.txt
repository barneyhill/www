# SSC4D

## Overview
SSC4D is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, specifically characterized by four SRCR domains. The protein, known as scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family member with 4 domains, functions as a broad-spectrum pattern recognition receptor (PRR) within the immune system. It plays a crucial role in recognizing and binding to a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and protozoan parasites, thereby enhancing the phagocytic capacity of immune cells such as monocytes. SSC4D is a highly glycosylated, secreted protein that is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and lungs, and is produced by epithelial cells and phagocytic leukocytes. Despite its secretion, SSC4D does not bind to a receptor on human cell surfaces, suggesting its immune function is mediated through pathogen interaction rather than direct receptor engagement (Cardoso2021Physical).

## Structure
The SSC4D protein is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily and is characterized by the presence of four SRCR domains. These domains are interspaced with sequences rich in O-linked sugars, contributing to the protein's high glycosylation, typical of mucins (Cardoso2021Physical). The protein is composed of 575 amino acids and includes an N-terminal signal peptide, indicating it is a circulating protein without a transmembrane sequence (Cardoso2021Physical).

The molecular structure of SSC4D features a heart-shaped fold with a six/seven-stranded beta sheet cradling a core alpha1-helix, which is typical of SRCR domains (Cardoso2021Physical). The protein is highly conserved, with eight cysteine residues forming intra-domain disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity (Cardoso2021Physical).

SSC4D undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily O-linked glycosylation, which is evident from the difference in molecular mass between the intracellular form (70.8 kDa) and the mature extracellular form (90.6 kDa) (Cardoso2021Physical). Unlike some other SRCR group B members, SSC4D does not contain N-linked sugars (Cardoso2021Physical).

## Function
The SSC4D gene encodes a protein that is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, functioning as a broad-spectrum pattern recognition receptor (PRR) in the immune system. SSC4D is involved in recognizing and binding to a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and protozoan parasites, which enhances the phagocytic capacity of monocytes and contributes to the immune response by neutralizing invasive microbes (Cardoso2021Physical). 

SSC4D is expressed in various human tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, thyroid, lung, and placenta, and is produced by epithelial cells and phagocytic leukocytes such as monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells (Cardoso2021Physical). Despite being a secreted protein, SSC4D does not appear to bind to a receptor on the surface of human cells, suggesting its role in immune functions may not involve direct receptor interaction (Cardoso2021Physical).

The protein is highly glycosylated and contains four SRCR domains, which are crucial for its function as a PRR. SSC4D's ability to bind to conserved structures on bacterial surfaces, such as endotoxins LPS and LTA, indicates its role in pathogen recognition and immune response in healthy human cells (Cardoso2021Physical).

## Interactions
The SSC4D protein, a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, is involved in various interactions with microbial cells, including bacteria and protozoan parasites. SSC4D physically binds to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, acting as a broad-spectrum pattern recognition receptor. This binding is particularly strong in the presence of calcium, which is crucial for many SRCR protein-mediated interactions (Cardoso2021Physical). SSC4D also interacts with bacterial endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), with the SSC4D-d1d2 form showing a stronger affinity for LPS (Cardoso2021Physical).

In addition to bacterial interactions, SSC4D binds to protozoan parasites, including Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania major, and Neospora caninum, in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction was visualized using confocal microscopy, highlighting SSC4D's role in recognizing conserved structural components across different pathogens (Cardoso2021Physical). Unlike some other SRCR proteins, SSC4D does not influence macrophage polarization but enhances bacterial phagocytosis by macrophages, suggesting a role in immune response modulation without directly interacting with monocytes (Cardoso2021Physical). These interactions underscore SSC4D's function as a versatile receptor in pathogen recognition and immune response.
