# FBLN2

## Overview
FBLN2 is a gene that encodes the protein fibulin-2, a member of the fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. Fibulin-2 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains such as calcium-binding EGF-like domains and a fibulin-like domain, contributing to its role in the assembly and stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane (BM) (Ma2021Fibulin; Cal2017FBLN2). As a secreted glycoprotein, fibulin-2 interacts with various ECM components and cell adhesion molecules, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and function (WalyEldeen2024FBLN2). It is highly expressed in several tissues, including the heart and placenta, and is involved in processes such as cell adhesion, motility, and growth (Ma2021Fibulin). Alterations in FBLN2 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhu2021Rare; Tsuda2018Extracellular).

## Structure
Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) is a glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of FBLN2 consists of 1231 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 131.9 kDa (Cal2017FBLN2). The protein features a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain, a cysteine-free domain, three anaphylotoxin domains, an EGF-like domain, ten calcium-binding EGF (cbEGF) domains, and a fibulin-like domain at the carboxyterminus (Ma2021Fibulin; Cal2017FBLN2). 

Alternative splicing of FBLN2 mRNA results in a shorter isoform, FBLN2S, which lacks the third EGF-like domain, reducing the total amino acid count to 1184 (Ma2021Fibulin; Cal2017FBLN2). The secondary structure includes cbEGF domains that are involved in calcium binding, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Timpl2003Fibulins:).

In terms of quaternary structure, fibulin-2 forms antiparallel homodimers stabilized by disulfide bonds, creating star-like structures (Timpl2003Fibulins:; Cal2017FBLN2). These dimers are formed through interactions between the central globular domains and aligned domains, resulting in a flexible structure that can change to a three- or four-arm configuration (Timpl2003Fibulins:).

## Function
Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues in healthy human cells. It is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the integrity of the basement membrane (BM) (Ma2021Fibulin). FBLN2 interacts with multiple ECM components, including integrins, laminin, fibronectin, aggrecan, versican, nidogen, perlecan, and tropoelastin, to form stable ECM networks (WalyEldeen2024FBLN2). This interaction is essential for elastic fiber assembly and maintaining ECM stiffness, which are critical for tissue morphogenesis and function (Ma2021Fibulin).

In healthy cells, FBLN2 is highly expressed in tissues such as the heart, placenta, ovary, and during embryonic development, particularly in the heart and neuronal structures (Cal2017FBLN2). It is also expressed in bronchial epithelial cells and stroma, indicating its involvement in normal lung development (Ma2021Fibulin). FBLN2 contributes to the structural integrity of tissues and organs by maintaining ECM and BM stability, supporting tissue architecture and function (Ma2021Fibulin). Its role in cell adhesion, motility, and growth is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis (Ma2021Fibulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBLN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), rare deleterious missense variants in FBLN2 have been identified as potential risk factors. These variants, such as the recurrent p.(Asp982Tyr) mutation, disrupt calcium-binding sites in the protein's EGF domain, potentially affecting its function and contributing to the pathogenesis of PAH (Zhu2021Rare). 

In the context of cardiovascular diseases, fibulin-2 is involved in myocardial infarction and heart failure. In fibulin-2 deficient mice, the absence of this protein prevents progressive ventricular dysfunction and improves survival by attenuating extracellular matrix protein synthesis and TGF-β signaling, suggesting its role in cardiac fibrosis and myocardial hypertrophy (Tsuda2018Extracellular).

In breast cancer, FBLN2 expression varies across molecular subtypes and is associated with different prognostic outcomes. Higher expression is linked to better survival in less advanced cases, particularly in Her2+ and triple-negative subtypes, while lower expression correlates with better outcomes in more advanced cases (WalyEldeen2024FBLN2). These findings highlight the gene's complex role in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker.

## Interactions
Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, contributing to its role in maintaining tissue integrity and function. FBLN2 interacts with several extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin, nidogen-1, fibrillin-1, and perlecan, which are crucial for maintaining connective tissue properties (Cal2017FBLN2). It also binds to cell adhesion molecules such as integrin subunits, which enhances extracellular matrix stability and modulates signaling pathways (Ma2021Fibulin).

In the context of cancer, FBLN2 interacts with MUC4 in pancreatic cancer, leading to basement membrane breaches and promoting invasion (Ma2021Fibulin). It also interacts with microRNAs, such as miR-9, miR-21, miR-29, miR-199, miR-200, and miR-155, which regulate cell adhesion and extracellular matrix composition (Ma2021Fibulin). In breast cancer, FBLN2 is associated with basement membrane integrity, interacting with collagen IV and integrins, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the basement membrane (Ibrahim2018Fibulin2).

In the central nervous system, FBLN2 interacts with the Notch signaling pathway, inhibiting the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which is relevant in conditions like multiple sclerosis (Ghorbani2024Fibulin2). These interactions highlight FBLN2's multifaceted role in tissue development, cancer progression, and neurological conditions.
