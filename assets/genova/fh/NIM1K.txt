# NIM1K

## Overview
NIM1K is a gene that encodes the NIM1 serine/threonine protein kinase, a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. As a serine/threonine kinase, NIM1K plays a significant role in the progression of cells from the G2 phase to the M phase by interacting with key regulators such as CDK1. This kinase is also implicated in cellular signaling and necrosis, with a novel localization at the plasma membrane suggesting additional roles in cellular interactions and signaling pathways (Moret2020A; Zhang2021A). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, NIM1K remains relatively understudied, with no selective inhibitors currently available, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its functions and potential clinical significance (Moret2020A; Soltysova2024Gold).

## Function
NIM1K, or NIM1 serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly through its interaction with CDK1, a central regulator of cell cycle progression from the G2 phase into the M phase (Moret2020A). NIM1K functions as a positive regulator of mitosis and is associated with necrosis, indicating its role in cell cycle regulation and potential involvement in cell death processes (Mervin2016Understanding). 

In terms of cellular localization, NIM1K has been identified to have a novel plasma membrane localization, suggesting it may play roles in cellular signaling or interactions at the plasma membrane (Zhang2021A). This localization is significant as it implies potential new functions and regulatory mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. 

Despite its involvement in these critical cellular processes, NIM1K remains relatively understudied, with no selective small molecule inhibitors described in the public literature (Moret2020A). The kinase's activity in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, but its upregulation in response to certain stimuli, such as nanoparticle exposure, suggests it may be involved in stress response pathways (Soltysova2024Gold).

## Clinical Significance
NIM1K, a serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a role in cell cycle regulation and has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and potential mutations. Despite its involvement in critical cellular processes, NIM1K remains relatively understudied in humans. It is frequently upregulated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, suggesting a potential clinical significance, although specific mutations or interaction changes are not well-documented (Moret2020A).

In the context of hereditary breast cancer, a study identified a missense variant in the NIM1K gene with a CADD score of 22.3, indicating a possible link to the disease in families without BRCA mutations (Liu2022WholeExome). This suggests that NIM1K may contribute to hereditary breast cancer, although further research is needed to confirm its role.

The lack of selective small molecule inhibitors for NIM1K, unlike other kinases such as WEE1, highlights the need for more research to understand its clinical implications fully (Moret2020A). Overall, while NIM1K is associated with essential cellular processes, its precise role in disease remains to be elucidated.

## Interactions
NIM1K, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in regulating the cell cycle through its interactions with other kinases. It functions upstream of WEE1, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits CDK1, a central regulator of cell cycle progression (Moret2020A). NIM1K is part of a network that includes kinases such as PKMYT1, WEE2, and BRSK1, all of which interact with CDK1 (Moret2020A). Despite its involvement in these critical pathways, NIM1K does not have selective small molecule inhibitors described in the public literature, unlike WEE1, which has several inhibitors in clinical development (Moret2020A).

NIM1K has also been identified as a prenyl-binding protein (PrBP/d) interactor, suggesting a role in the intracellular trafficking of prenylated proteins, particularly in photoreceptor cells. It is associated with ciliogenesis factors and other proteins involved in photoreceptor integrity, although specific interactions involving NIM1K are not detailed (Ashok2024Updates). Additionally, NIM1K has been identified with a novel plasma membrane localization, which may suggest new functions and regulatory mechanisms (Zhang2021A). However, specific protein interactions involving NIM1K in this context are not provided.
