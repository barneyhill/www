# ALAS1

## Overview
The ALAS1 gene encodes the enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase 1, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the heme biosynthetic pathway. As a key enzyme, it catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the production of heme, a critical component of hemoproteins involved in various cellular functions, including electron transport and drug metabolism (Kubota2016Novel; Furuyama2007Heme). ALAS1 is ubiquitously expressed in non-erythroid cells and is subject to intricate regulation by heme itself, which modulates its expression to maintain heme homeostasis and prevent oxidative stress (Furuyama2007Heme). The enzyme's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins suggest its involvement in a heme biosynthetic supercomplex, enhancing the efficiency of heme production and trafficking (MartinezGuzman2019The). Clinically, dysregulation of ALAS1 is implicated in conditions such as acute hepatic porphyrias and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and neurological contexts (Chan2015Preclinical; Dwyer2009Downregulation).

## Function
The human gene ALAS1 encodes the enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase 1, which is crucial for the heme biosynthetic pathway. ALAS1 catalyzes the condensation of glycine and succinyl CoA to produce 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the mitochondrial matrix, marking the first and rate-limiting step in heme production (Kubota2016Novel; Furuyama2007Heme). This process is essential for the synthesis of heme, a vital component of various hemoproteins, including those involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and cytochrome P450 enzymes (Saitoh20185aminolevulinic; Degenhardt2009RETRACTED:).

ALAS1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, except for erythroid cells, where ALAS2 is expressed instead (Furuyama2007Heme). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by heme through a negative feedback mechanism, which suppresses ALAS1 expression at multiple levels to prevent excess heme accumulation and oxidative stress (Kubota2016Novel; Furuyama2007Heme). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular heme homeostasis and ensuring proper mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Saitoh20185aminolevulinic). In the liver, ALAS1 is particularly important for producing heme required by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism and other biochemical pathways (Degenhardt2009RETRACTED:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ALAS1 gene are clinically significant in the context of acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP), particularly acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is characterized by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks triggered by factors such as cytochrome P450-inducing drugs, dieting, and hormonal fluctuations. These triggers lead to increased expression of hepatic ALAS1, resulting in the accumulation of neurotoxic porphyrin precursors, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and porphobilinogen (PBG), which cause symptoms like severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypertension, motor weakness, and psychiatric symptoms (Chan2015Preclinical).

The RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic ALN-AS1 has been developed to target ALAS1, aiming to prevent and treat these attacks by reducing ALAS1 expression and subsequently lowering ALA and PBG levels. This therapeutic approach has shown promise in preclinical models, effectively reducing elevated levels of ALA and PBG (Chan2015Preclinical). Additionally, Givosiran, a synthetic siRNA targeting ALAS1 mRNA, has been approved for treating AIP by reducing neurotoxic intermediates (Balogun2023The).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), ALAS1 mRNA expression is significantly reduced, suggesting altered heme biosynthesis, which may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis by affecting cell metabolism and iron homeostasis (Dwyer2009Downregulation).

## Interactions
ALAS1, a mitochondrial enzyme, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the measles virus V (MeV-V) protein. This interaction leads to the relocation of ALAS1 outside the mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial network damage and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. The release of mtDNA triggers a type I interferon response and the production of APOBEC3A through the RNA polymerase III/RIG-I pathways (Khalfi2023Antagonism). The interaction between ALAS1 and MeV-V was validated through yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity purification, highlighting its role in altering mitochondrial metabolism and promoting an immune response (Khalfi2023Antagonism).

ALAS1 is also part of a proposed heme biosynthetic supercomplex, or 'heme metabolon,' which includes ferrochelatase (FECH) and other mitochondrial proteins. This complex is thought to facilitate efficient heme production and trafficking by channeling reactive substrates and mitigating their diffusion throughout the cell (MartinezGuzman2019The). The interaction between ALAS1 and FECH may be functionally significant, potentially regulating the flow of heme from the mitochondria to the nucleus (MartinezGuzman2019The).
