# TDRD7

## Overview
TDRD7 is a gene that encodes the tudor domain containing 7 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in RNA metabolism and chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by its multiple tudor domains, which facilitate interactions with methylated residues, and LOTUS domains, which are involved in RNA binding and interaction with DEAD-box helicases (Anand2021Genome-Wide; Skorokhod2013Identification). TDRD7 plays a crucial role in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes and is localized in structures such as chromatoid bodies and nuage, which are associated with the piRNA pathway (Barnum2020The; Patil2014The). Functionally, TDRD7 is essential for post-transcriptional gene expression control, particularly in the development and maintenance of the ocular lens, where it regulates RNA granule formation and interacts with other RNA-binding proteins to maintain lens transparency and prevent cataract formation (Lachke2011Mutations). Mutations in the TDRD7 gene are linked to congenital cataracts and nonobstructive azoospermia, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Tan2019Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The TDRD7 protein is characterized by its multiple tudor domains, which are specialized in recognizing methylated arginine or lysine residues. These domains are crucial for the protein's function in RNA processing and chromatin remodeling (Anand2021Genome-Wide; Skorokhod2013Identification). TDRD7 contains three tudor domains: Tudor 1 (460-582aa), Tudor 2 (649-776aa), and Tudor 3 (909-1027aa) (Skorokhod2013Identification). These domains contribute to the protein's tertiary structure by facilitating interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules.

In addition to the tudor domains, TDRD7 includes three LOTUS domains, which are predicted to bind RNA and interact with DEAD-box helicases, playing a role in RNA metabolic processes (Anand2021Genome-Wide; Barnum2020The). The protein is involved in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes and is localized in structures such as chromatoid bodies and nuage, which are associated with the piRNA pathway (Barnum2020The; Patil2014The).

TDRD7 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by ribosomal protein S6 kinases at multiple sites, which may influence its function and interactions (Skorokhod2013Identification). The gene can produce different splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its structure and function, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The TDRD7 gene encodes a tudor domain protein that plays a critical role in post-transcriptional gene expression control, particularly in the development and maintenance of the ocular lens. In healthy human cells, TDRD7 is involved in the formation of RNA granules, which are essential for RNA processing and regulation. These granules interact with other RNA-binding proteins, such as STAU1, to facilitate mRNA transport and decay, crucial for maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataract formation (Lachke2011Mutations).

TDRD7 is highly expressed in lens fiber cells during embryogenesis, where it regulates the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small RNAs, including piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), although it is not essential for piRNA production. This regulation is vital for maintaining the proper abundance of lens-enriched mRNAs, ensuring normal lens development (Anand2021Genome-Wide).

The protein also plays a role in maintaining the morphology and organization of lens fiber cells by regulating the expression of heat shock protein HSPB1, which is involved in cytoskeletal maintenance. TDRD7's interaction with Hspb1 mRNA is crucial for the stability of F-actin, a component of the cytoskeleton, thereby supporting lens transparency and preventing cataracts (Barnum2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TDRD7 gene are associated with a rare syndrome that combines congenital cataract (CC) and nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) in humans. These mutations lead to a complete loss of TDRD7 function, resulting in reduced transcript levels and absence of the protein in affected individuals. In men, this results in both CC and NOA, while in women, it leads to CC alone (Tan2019Lossoffunction). The gene is crucial for the assembly of chromatoid bodies in male germ cells, and its dysfunction causes a block in spermatogenesis at the round spermatid cell phase, leading to azoospermia (Tan2019Lossoffunction).

TDRD7 mutations are also linked to cataract and glaucoma. In mice, Tdrd7 nullizygosity causes cataracts, glaucoma, and an arrest in spermatogenesis (Lachke2011Mutations). The gene's role in RNA granule formation is critical for maintaining normal lens structure, and its deficiency leads to cataract formation due to disrupted gene regulation (Lachke2011Mutations). Additionally, altered expression of TDRD7 is associated with age-related cortico-nuclear cataracts, with significant upregulation observed in patients compared to healthy controls (Yildiz2023Relationship).

## Interactions
TDRD7 (tudor domain containing 7) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with ribosomal protein S6 kinases, specifically S6K1 and S6K2, acting as a substrate for these kinases. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that TDRD7 is phosphorylated by S6K1 and S6K2 at multiple sites (Skorokhod2013Identification).

TDRD7 also forms complexes with TBC1D20 transcripts, suggesting a regulatory interaction that is crucial for autophagosome maturation. This interaction is important for maintaining autophagic flux and preventing the accumulation of autophagic cargo, which is essential for lens development and spermiogenesis (Tu2021TDRD7).

In lens fiber cells, TDRD7 associates with HSPB1 mRNA, playing a role in maintaining proper levels of the heat shock protein HSPB1. This interaction is necessary for stabilizing the F-actin cytoskeleton and ensuring proper cell morphology during lens development (Barnum2020The). These interactions highlight TDRD7's involvement in critical cellular pathways and its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
