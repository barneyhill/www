# MT1B

## Overview
MT1B is a gene that encodes the protein metallothionein 1B, which is part of the metallothionein family known for its high cysteine content and ability to bind heavy metals. The MT1B gene is involved in the regulation of metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, primarily through the protein's capacity to bind essential metal ions such as zinc and copper. Metallothionein 1B functions as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress and metal toxicity by sequestering metal ions. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular metal balance and responding to environmental changes. MT1B expression is tissue-specific and can be modulated by various stimuli, reflecting its dynamic role in cellular processes (Laukens2009Human; Li2008Human; Krężel2017The).

## Structure
Metallothionein 1B (MT1B) is a cysteine-rich protein characterized by its ability to bind heavy metals through thiolate bonds. The primary structure of MT1B consists of 61 amino acids, with a significant portion being cysteine residues, which account for 33% of the total amino acids. These cysteine residues are organized into specific motifs such as Cys-X-Cys, Cys-Cys, and Cys-X-X-Cys, where X represents other amino acids, facilitating metal ion binding (Kägi1984Structure; Kojima1976Aminoacid).

The secondary structure of MT1B lacks extensive alpha-helices or beta-sheets, instead forming unique metal-thiolate clusters. These clusters are stabilized by the binding of metal ions, which introduce crosslinks and increase the beta-structure content, as observed in spectroscopic studies (Kägi1984Structure).

The tertiary structure of MT1B involves a compact, folded conformation stabilized by metal ions, which are bound in a tetrahedral geometry with thiolate ligands. This structure is crucial for the protein's stability and resistance to proteolysis (Kägi1984Structure).

MT1B does not typically form quaternary structures. Post-translational modifications, such as the acetylation of the amino-terminus, and potential splice variants may influence its metal-binding properties and cellular localization (Kojima1976Aminoacid).

## Function
MT1B, a member of the metallothionein family, plays a crucial role in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification in healthy human cells. The protein encoded by MT1B is involved in binding metal ions, particularly zinc and copper, which are essential for various cellular processes. This binding capability is attributed to the high cysteine content of metallothioneins, allowing them to form metal/thiolate clusters that are vital for their function (Li2008Human; Krężel2017The).

MT1B is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of metal ions and acts as an antioxidant. By sequestering metal ions, MT1B helps maintain cellular metal homeostasis and protects cells from oxidative stress and metal toxicity (Laukens2009Human; Krężel2017The). The protein's role in zinc and copper metabolism is particularly significant, as it buffers these ions, ensuring their availability for essential cellular functions while preventing their accumulation to toxic levels (Krężel2017The).

MT1B expression is tissue-specific and can be induced by various stimuli, reflecting its dynamic role in responding to changes in the cellular environment (Li2008Human; Laukens2009Human).

## Clinical Significance
The MT1B gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its genetic polymorphisms and altered expression levels. One significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MT1B gene, rs964372, is associated with decreased fatty acid utilization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by hyperlipidemia and neuropathy. This SNP also shows a protective trend against oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in carriers of the C allele (Raudenska2014Metallothionein). Another SNP, rs8052334, located in the MT1B intron 2, is part of a haplotype that increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in smokers, due to the gene's role in managing oxidative stress (Raudenska2014Metallothionein).

Alterations in MT1B expression have been linked to cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma, MT1B is significantly downregulated, and its reduced expression correlates with poor overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and progression-free survival (Zhang2021Integrative). In the context of lung cancer, exposure to polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) upregulates MT1B expression, which may contribute to cancer development by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cancer cell survival (Jeong2021MTF1). These findings suggest that MT1B plays a role in cancer susceptibility and progression through its involvement in oxidative stress response and metal ion homeostasis.
