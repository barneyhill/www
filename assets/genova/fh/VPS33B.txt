# VPS33B

## Overview
VPS33B is a gene that encodes the VPS33B protein, a member of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular protein trafficking and membrane dynamics. The VPS33B protein is primarily involved in the regulation of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion, particularly within the late endosome and lysosome pathways, facilitating vesicle-to-target SNARE complex assembly (Gissen2004Mutations). It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, including the structural and functional polarity of hepatocytes and the biogenesis of platelet α-granules (Lo2005Requirement; Hanley2017Vps33b). Mutations in the VPS33B gene are linked to significant clinical conditions such as arthrogryposis–renal dysfunction–cholestasis (ARC) syndrome and autosomal recessive keratoderma-ichthyosis-deafness (ARKID) syndrome, highlighting its critical role in normal cellular function and development (Gissen2004Mutations; Gruber2017Autosomal).

## Function
The VPS33B gene encodes a protein that is a key regulator of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion, which is essential for intracellular protein trafficking and membrane dynamics in healthy human cells (Gissen2004Mutations). VPS33B is part of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein family and is involved in the late endosome and lysosome pathways, playing a crucial role in vesicle-to-target SNARE complex assembly (Gissen2004Mutations). This protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicular fusion events, particularly in the context of late endosomal and lysosomal pathways (Gissen2004Mutations).

In hepatocytes, VPS33B is crucial for maintaining structural and functional polarity, which is vital for the correct localization of canalicular proteins and the biogenesis of the apical membrane domain (Hanley2017Vps33b). It interacts with Rab11a, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, to facilitate protein trafficking via the apical recycling endosome (ARE) (Hanley2017Vps33b). Additionally, VPS33B is involved in the biogenesis of platelet α-granules, which are essential for normal platelet function and hemostasis (Lo2005Requirement). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organ function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS33B gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. One of the primary disorders linked to VPS33B mutations is arthrogryposis–renal dysfunction–cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder. This condition is characterized by renal tubular abnormalities, cholestasis, hypotonia, and platelet storage pool deficiency, all resulting from abnormal intracellular protein trafficking and defective membrane fusion mechanisms (Gissen2004Mutations). 

VPS33B mutations also cause autosomal recessive keratoderma-ichthyosis-deafness (ARKID) syndrome, which includes symptoms such as severe palmoplantar keratoderma, ichthyosis, and sensorineural deafness. These mutations disrupt the interaction of VPS33B with Rab proteins, impairing collagen modification and epidermal barrier formation (Gruber2017Autosomal).

Additionally, a novel missense mutation in VPS33B, c.1726T>C, p.Cys576Arg, has been linked to isolated low gamma-glutamyltransferase cholestasis, presenting an attenuated form of ARC syndrome. This mutation results in decreased VPS33B expression and impaired interaction with VIPAS39, affecting bile acid transport and leading to cholestasis (Qiu2019Novel). 

These findings underscore the critical role of VPS33B in maintaining normal cellular functions and its impact when mutated.

## Interactions
VPS33B is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in vesicular trafficking and platelet α-granule biogenesis. It forms a stable complex with VPS16B, also known as VIPAR, which is distinct from the larger CORVET and HOPS complexes. This interaction is essential for the stability of VPS16B, as the absence of VPS33B leads to reduced levels of VPS16B (Ambrosio2019Mechanism; Urban2012The). VPS33B also interacts with VIPAS39, α-tubulin, and SEC22B in megakaryocytes, which are important for the trafficking of Vwf-positive vesicles and α-granule biogenesis (Dai2016Vps33b).

VPS33B has been shown to interact with integrin subunits, particularly the IIb 3 integrin, which is crucial for platelet activation and hemostasis. This interaction involves the cytoplasmic domain of integrin IIb 3 and is important for outside-in signaling in platelets (Xiang2015Characterization). Additionally, VPS33B interacts with CCDC22 and VPS53, although these interactions may be transient or regulated, as suggested by proteomic studies (Hunter2017Proteomic). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of VPS33B in cellular processes related to vesicular trafficking and platelet function.
