# PSMD13

## Overview
PSMD13 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 13, a component of the 26S proteasome complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of the non-ATPase regulatory subunit of the proteasome, which plays a crucial role in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and stress responses. The proteasome, including the PSMD13 subunit, is involved in the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress response, helping to prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins and supporting cellular health. PSMD13's interactions within the proteasome complex and its expression levels are significant in the context of cancer, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes in several cancer types (Li2021Integrated; Larsson2022Pancancer; Gao2023Interlukin4).

## Function
PSMD13 is a component of the 26S proteasome, a critical complex in eukaryotic cells responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. This degradation process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating protein turnover, and ensuring the proper function of various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses. PSMD13 is part of the non-ATPase regulatory subunit of the proteasome, contributing to substrate recognition and processing within the complex (Gao2023Interlukin4).

In healthy human cells, PSMD13 plays a pivotal role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. By participating in the degradation of misfolded proteins, PSMD13 helps prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates, thereby supporting cellular health and function (Gao2023Interlukin4). The proteasome, including PSMD13, is active in various cellular compartments, where it facilitates the removal of damaged or unnecessary proteins, thus contributing to cellular homeostasis and adaptation to stress conditions (Gao2023Interlukin4). This function is crucial for the survival and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, particularly under stress conditions, highlighting the importance of PSMD13 in maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology (Gao2023Interlukin4).

## Clinical Significance
PSMD13 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. High expression of PSMD13 is associated with poor survival outcomes in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Li2021Integrated). In a pan-cancer analysis, PSMD13 was found to be overexpressed in the majority of 16 cancer types studied, suggesting its potential role in cancer-related processes (Larsson2022Pancancer). The gene is part of a cluster of co-expressed proteasome genes, indicating its involvement in complex regulatory networks within cancer cells (Larsson2022Pancancer).

PSMD13 expression is also linked to the immune microenvironment in cancers, showing significant associations with immune subtypes and immune-related scores. This suggests that PSMD13 may play a role in cancer progression and immune interactions (Li2021Integrated). Although specific diseases or conditions resulting from PSMD13 mutations are not detailed, its expression alterations are significant in the context of cancer progression and prognosis. The gene's involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment (Li2021Integrated).

## Interactions
PSMD13 is a component of the 26S proteasome complex, specifically part of the 19S regulatory particle lid, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation by recognizing and unfolding ubiquitinated proteins (Li2021Integrated). It interacts with other proteasome subunits, such as PSMA1, PSMB2, PSMC3, PSMC4, PSMD1, and ADRM1, which are involved in maintaining protein homeostasis and are associated with processes like apoptosis and DNA damage repair (Wei2022PSMD13). 

In the context of sickle cell disease, PSMD13 is part of a cluster dominated by proteasome proteins, indicating its involvement in protein interactions related to the proteasome complex (Ammann2009Cluster). The clustering analysis suggests that PSMD13, along with other proteasome proteins, may be impacted by sickle cell disease, affecting their interactions within the human erythrocyte protein interactome (Ammann2009Cluster).

PSMD13's expression and interactions are also influenced by interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling, which downregulates PSMD13 in hematopoietic stem cells, affecting their function and lineage differentiation (Gao2023Interlukin4). This interaction highlights the role of PSMD13 in stress responses and apoptosis in these cells (Gao2023Interlukin4).
