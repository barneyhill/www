# TMEM128

## Overview
TMEM128 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 128, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are not fully elucidated. TMEM128 has been studied in the context of several health conditions, including colorectal cancer and vertigo, where it has been identified as a potential genetic factor influencing disease susceptibility (Chen2024A; Liu2022Linkage). Despite these associations, the specific role of TMEM128 in these conditions remains to be clearly defined, necessitating further research to understand its functional implications and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM128 has been implicated in several health conditions, although its specific role remains unclear. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM128 was identified as a potential low-risk gene associated with CRC, but no conclusive evidence was found linking TMEM128 mutations directly to CRC in the studied families (Liu2022Linkage). This suggests that while TMEM128 may contribute to CRC risk, it is not considered a high-risk gene.

In studies related to vertigo, TMEM128 has been associated with genetic susceptibility to the condition. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified TMEM128 as one of the genes with significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the cerebellum, a key area for maintaining balance and coordination, suggesting a potential role in vestibular symptoms (Chen2024A). Another study mentioned TMEM128 in proximity to a variant associated with vertigo, although its function in this context is poorly understood (Skuladottir2021A).

Overall, while TMEM128 is associated with certain conditions, its exact clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it influences these diseases require further investigation.
