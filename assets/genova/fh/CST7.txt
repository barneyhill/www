# CST7

## Overview
The CST7 gene encodes cystatin F, a type II cysteine protease inhibitor that plays a critical role in modulating protease activity within immune cells. Cystatin F is characterized by its ability to form disulfide-bonded dimers, a unique feature among cystatins, which influences its inhibitory activity. The protein is synthesized as an inactive dimer and becomes active upon conversion to a monomer, primarily targeting cathepsin C and other cathepsins. This regulation is crucial for the activation of effector serine proteases in immune cells, impacting processes such as cancer immunosurveillance and immune response modulation. Cystatin F's glycosylation, involving mannose-6-phosphate modification, is essential for its intracellular targeting and function. Alterations in CST7 expression have been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Daniels2023Cystatin; Hamilton2008Cystatin; Colbert2009Glycosylation).

## Structure
Cystatin F, encoded by the CST7 gene, is a glycosylated human low molecular weight cysteine proteinase inhibitor. The primary structure of cystatin F consists of a 145-residue preprotein, which includes a 19-residue signal peptide and a mature protein of 126 amino acids (Nathanson2002Regulated; Ni1998Cystatin). The protein features two disulfide bridges common to type II cystatins, with two additional cysteine residues at positions 1 and 37, suggesting the formation of a third disulfide bridge that stabilizes the N-terminal region (Ni1998Cystatin; Langerholc2005Inhibitory).

The secondary structure includes typical motifs such as a central Gln-Xaa-Val-Xaa-Gly sequence and a Pro-Trp pair toward the C-terminal end, which are characteristic of cystatins (Ni1998Cystatin). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, and the protein is glycosylated at two N-linked sites, positions 36 and 88, which do not interfere with enzyme binding (Nathanson2002Regulated; Ni1998Cystatin).

Cystatin F can form disulfide-bonded dimers, a unique feature among cystatins, which affects its inhibitory activity. The monomeric form is necessary for its function as a protease inhibitor (Langerholc2005Inhibitory).

## Function
Cystatin F, encoded by the CST7 gene, is a cysteine protease inhibitor primarily involved in regulating protease activity within immune cells. It is synthesized as an inactive disulfide-linked dimer and becomes active upon conversion to a monomer through proteolytic cleavage in the endosomal/lysosomal system (Perišić2017Cystatin; Colbert2009Glycosylation). This active form targets cathepsin C and potentially other cathepsins, playing a crucial role in the activation of effector serine proteases in immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells (Colbert2009Glycosylation; Hamilton2008Cystatin).

Cystatin F's regulation of cathepsin C is significant because cathepsin C is involved in activating granule-localized serine proteases, which are essential for immune responses (Hamilton2008Cystatin). The protein's glycosylation pattern, involving mannose-6-phosphate modification, is essential for its intracellular targeting and retention in the lysosomal pathway (Colbert2009Glycosylation). Cystatin F can be secreted by one cell and internalized by another, suggesting a role in regulating protease activity in trans, which is important for immune cell function (Colbert2009Glycosylation). This regulation is crucial for processes such as cancer immunosurveillance and controlling tumor growth (Perišić2017Cystatin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CST7 gene, which encodes cystatin F, have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, CST7 expression is notably upregulated in microglia during conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion diseases. In AD, CST7 plays a sex-dependent role in microglial function, with its deletion leading to increased amyloid plaque pathology and synapse loss in female mice, suggesting a regulatory role in microglial endolysosomal function and phagocytosis (Daniels2023Cystatin). In prion diseases, CST7 is highly upregulated in the brains of prion-inoculated mice, indicating its potential as a biomarker for prion pathogenesis (Nuvolone2017Cystatin).

In cancer, CST7 expression levels are associated with prognosis and survival outcomes. In hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CST7 expression is significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to healthy liver tissues. High CST7 expression correlates with increased recurrence-free survival and overall survival, suggesting a protective effect against HCC progression (Zhou2019Investigation). Conversely, in other cancers such as liver, oral, and brain cancer, high CST7 levels are linked to poor prognosis due to its immunosuppressive function, which decreases the cytotoxicity of NK cells and enhances tumor progression (Zhang2023Type).

## Interactions
Cystatin F, encoded by the CST7 gene, participates in several interactions with other proteins, primarily involving cysteine peptidases. It interacts with cathepsins C, L, and S, which are crucial for its role as a cysteine protease inhibitor. These interactions have been confirmed through techniques such as immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, proximity ligation assay, and co-immunoprecipitation (Dautović2018The). Cystatin F also shows strong colocalization with cathepsins C and S in non-differentiated U937 cells, indicating physical interactions, particularly with cathepsin C (Dautović2018The).

The protein is known to inhibit cathepsins C and H, which are essential for generating active granzymes, thereby affecting the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells (Perišić2017Cystatin). Cystatin F can be internalized by cells and targeted to lysosomes, where it inactivates these cathepsins, leading to reduced cytotoxicity (Perišić2017Cystatin). The internalization process is dependent on its glycosylation and involves the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor system, which is crucial for its targeting and activation (Colbert2009Glycosylation).

Additionally, cystatin F interacts with amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, inhibiting their phagocytosis by monocytes, which may contribute to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (Li2024Monocytes). These interactions highlight cystatin F's role in modulating immune responses and its potential implications in disease processes.
