# FBLN5

## Overview
Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) is a gene that encodes the extracellular matrix protein fibulin 5, which is integral to the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers in various tissues, including the skin, lungs, and blood vessels. As a matricellular protein, fibulin 5 is involved in elastogenesis, interacting with structural components such as tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, and facilitating the assembly of elastic fibers. The protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes calcium-binding EGF-like motifs and a fibulin-type C-terminal module, essential for its function in elastic fiber assembly and interaction with other extracellular matrix components (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Kobayashi2007A). Fibulin 5 also plays a role in cellular processes by binding to integrin receptors and influencing cell behavior, potentially impacting conditions such as cutis laxa, age-related macular degeneration, and certain cancers when dysregulated (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Stone2004Missense).

## Structure
Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) is a 66-kDa glycoprotein composed of 448 amino acids, featuring a signal sequence of 23 amino acids at the N-terminal, six calcium-binding EGF (cbEGF)-like motifs, and a C-terminal fibulin-type module (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Gharesouran2021New). The first cbEGF domain includes a proline-rich insertion sequence, and the sixth is a divergent type with eight cysteines (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). An unusual long linker sequence of about 28 amino acids is present between the fourth and fifth cysteine residues of the first cbEGF motif (Gharesouran2021New).

The protein contains an evolutionarily conserved RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) sequence in the first cbEGF domain, which is crucial for binding with integrin receptors (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Gharesouran2021New). Fibulin-5 is characterized by a tandem array of EGF-like repeats and a fibulin-type C-terminal module, with a modified cbEGF-like module at the N terminus (Kobayashi2007A). It has two potential N-glycosylation sites and one predicted O-glycosylation site, suggesting post-translational modifications (Kobayashi2007A). The protein's modular structure is essential for its role in elastic fiber assembly, interacting with tropoelastin and other extracellular matrix components (Segade2010Molecular; Kobayashi2007A).

## Function
Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) is a matricellular protein that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of various tissues, including skin, lungs, and blood vessels. It is involved in elastogenesis by binding to structural components such as tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, as well as cross-linking enzymes, facilitating the assembly of elastic fibers (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). Fibulin-5 accelerates the coacervation process, a crucial step in elastogenesis, and regulates the size of elastin aggregates, ensuring optimal cross-linking of tropoelastin (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5).

In healthy cells, fibulin-5 is secreted by various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and is localized in structures like Bruch's membrane and the choriocapillaris of the retina (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). It influences cell behavior by potentially antagonizing fibronectin-mediated signaling, affecting cell proliferation, migration, and attachment (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). Fibulin-5 also interacts with extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), suggesting a role in regulating oxidative stress (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). Its expression is regulated by cytokines and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues that rely on elastic fibers (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FBLN5 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. Homozygous missense mutations, such as p.S227P and p.C217R, are associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa, a disorder characterized by loose skin and internal organ involvement. These mutations impair fibulin-5's ability to bind to tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, leading to defective elastic fiber formation (Loeys2002Homozygosity; Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). Other mutations, like p.A182P, have been identified in cutis laxa cases, disrupting fibulin-5-tropoelastin interactions and elastin polymerization (Gharesouran2021New).

FBLN5 is also implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Missense variations in FBLN5 have been significantly associated with AMD, suggesting a role in its pathogenesis (Stone2004Missense). In cancer, FBLN5 expression is often down-regulated, particularly in metastatic malignancies, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role (Schiemann2002Contextspecific).

In pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), FBLN5 variants are considered risk factors, with decreased expression observed in affected tissues. This suggests a role in extracellular matrix maintenance and disease progression (Padhy2019De). FBLN5's involvement in these conditions underscores its critical role in maintaining tissue integrity and its potential impact when dysregulated.

## Interactions
Fibulin-5 (FBLN5) is an extracellular matrix protein that engages in various interactions crucial for elastic fiber assembly and cellular functions. It contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif that facilitates binding to integrin receptors such as αvβ3, αvβ5, and α9β1, promoting cell attachment and influencing endothelial cell adhesion (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Gharesouran2021New). FBLN5 also interacts with fibronectin receptors α5β1 and α4β1, although it does not activate downstream signaling, suggesting an inhibitory role in fibronectin receptor-mediated signaling (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Gharesouran2021New).

FBLN5 binds to tropoelastin, a precursor to elastin, in a calcium-dependent manner, facilitating the coacervation process essential for elastic fiber formation (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5). It also interacts with fibrillin-1, lysyl oxidase-like proteins (Loxl-1, -2, and -4), and latent TGF-β binding proteins (LTBPs), which are critical for the cross-linking and assembly of elastic fibers (Yanagisawa2009Fibulin5; Noda2013Latent). The interaction with LTBP-4 is particularly important for the linear deposition of fibulin-5 on microfibrils, promoting elastic fiber assembly (Noda2013Latent).

In the context of disease, FBLN5 interacts with proteins involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, influencing processes such as angiogenesis and cancer cell metastasis (Bian2023Clinical). These interactions highlight FBLN5's multifaceted role in maintaining tissue integrity and its potential implications in pathological conditions.
