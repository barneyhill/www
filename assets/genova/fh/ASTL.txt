# ASTL

## Overview
The ASTL gene encodes the protein ovastacin, a member of the astacin metallopeptidase family, which is characterized by its zinc-binding catalytic domain. Ovastacin is a crucial enzyme in mammalian reproduction, specifically expressed in oocytes, where it plays a vital role in preventing polyspermy by modifying the zona pellucida, the protective glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte. This modification is achieved through the cleavage of the ZP2 protein, thereby preventing additional sperm from binding to the egg. The enzyme's activity is dependent on zinc ions, which are essential for its catalytic function. Ovastacin is released during the cortical reaction following sperm penetration, leading to the hardening of the zona pellucida, which provides structural support to the embryo until implantation (GomisRüth2023Structural; Kang2023Ovastacin:).

## Structure
The human gene ASTL encodes the protein ovastacin, a member of the astacin metallopeptidase family. Ovastacin is characterized by a basic domain composition of S-PRO-CD, followed by a disordered domain of unknown function. This disordered domain remains associated with the oolemma after the enzyme is released, suggesting a role in membrane anchoring and shedding (GomisRüth2023Structural).

The molecular structure of ovastacin includes a zinc-binding catalytic domain (CD) that is typical of astacin metallopeptidases. This domain features a conserved zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and an EXXRXDRD motif, which includes a family-specific glutamate. The catalytic domain spans approximately 200 residues and consists of two subdomains flanking an active-site cleft. A downstream SIMHY-motif includes a 'Met-turn' methionine and a zinc-binding tyrosine, which are crucial for the enzyme's function (GomisRüth2023Structural).

Ovastacin is expressed exclusively in oocytes and plays a crucial role in fertility by hardening the zona pellucida after sperm intrusion, providing structural support to the embryo until implantation (GomisRüth2023Structural). The protein's structure and function are paralleled by alveolin in the medaka fish, which similarly hardens the fertilized egg envelope in bony fishes (GomisRüth2023Structural).

## Function
The ASTL gene encodes the protein ovastacin, a metalloproteinase belonging to the astacin family, which plays a crucial role in reproductive processes. Ovastacin is specifically expressed in oocytes and is involved in preventing polyspermy during fertilization in mammals. It achieves this by cleaving the N-terminal of the ZP2 protein in the zona pellucida (ZP), the glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte, thereby preventing additional sperm from binding and fertilizing the egg (Kang2023Ovastacin:). This process is essential for ensuring that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, maintaining the integrity of the fertilization process.

Ovastacin is released from cortical granules during the cortical reaction, which occurs after sperm penetration. This release leads to the hardening of the zona pellucida, providing rigidity and robustness to the embryo until it implants in the uterus (GomisRüth2023Structural). The protein's activity is dependent on zinc ions, which are crucial for its enzymatic function (Kang2023Ovastacin:). Ovastacin's role extends to the development of the follicle, where it aids in the removal of cumulus cells and the release of the oocyte during ovulation (Kang2023Ovastacin:).
