# RING1

## Overview
RING1 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 1, a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. The protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, a zinc-binding motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This activity is pivotal in the monoubiquitination of histone H2A, a modification essential for transcriptional repression and the maintenance of gene silencing, particularly in developmental processes and stem cell pluripotency (Satijn1997RING1; Buchwald2006Structure). RING1 interacts with other Polycomb group proteins, such as BMI1, to form a stable complex that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. The gene's role extends to various biological processes, including neurogenesis and X chromosome inactivation, and its mutations have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (Vidal2009Role; Ryan2024RING1).

## Structure
RING1, also known as ring finger protein 1, is a component of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which play a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. The protein contains a RING finger domain, a specific zinc-binding motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, essential for its function within the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (Satijn1997RING1). 

The RING finger domain of RING1 is characterized by its ability to bind zinc ions, which is a common feature among proteins involved in ubiquitination processes. This domain is crucial for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which targets histone H2A for monoubiquitination, a key step in transcriptional repression (Buchwald2006Structure). 

RING1 forms a heterodimer with other PcG proteins, such as Bmi1, within the PRC1 complex. This interaction is vital for its structural stability and function. The N-terminal arm of RING1 is important for forming stable complexes with Bmi1, which enhances its E3-ligase activity (Buchwald2006Structure). 

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, are common for RING1, influencing its role in transcriptional regulation. The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in maintaining repressed gene states, which is significant in development and cancer (Wang2008Structural).

## Function
RING1 (Ring Finger Protein 1) is a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzing the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). This histone modification is essential for transcriptional repression, particularly in the silencing of developmental genes such as Hox genes, and is involved in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells by preventing inappropriate differentiation (Vidal2009Role; Ryan2024RING1; Endoh2012Histone).

RING1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other Polycomb group proteins, including BMI1, to form a multimeric complex that regulates gene activity through changes in chromatin structure (Satijn1997RING1). This complex does not bind directly to DNA but mediates transcriptional repression by altering chromatin accessibility (Satijn1997RING1). The activity of RING1 is crucial for maintaining the balance of H2AK119ub1 dosage, which is vital for efficient DNA replication and repair, particularly during neurogenesis (Ryan2024RING1). Additionally, RING1 is involved in the repression of paternal heterochromatin in the zygote and plays a role in X chromosome inactivation in female mammals (Vidal2009Role; de2004Polycomb).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RING1 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders. A notable missense variant, RING1 c.284G > A;p.R95Q, is associated with microcephaly, growth restriction, intellectual disability, and schizophrenic symptoms. This variant results in a stable protein that fails to catalyze the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1), a process crucial for DNA damage repair during neurogenesis. The impaired DNA repair leads to delayed double-strand break repair and prolonged S-phase in neural progenitor cells, contributing to the observed clinical phenotypes (Ryan2024RING1).

RING1 mutations can act in a dominant negative manner, affecting DNA damage repair more than transcription regulation. This is due to the competition with its paralogue RNF2 for binding at polycomb domains, which reduces H2AK119ub1 levels (Ryan2024RING1). The dosage of H2AK119ub1 is critical for efficient DNA repair and S-phase progression, and its reduction due to RING1 mutations can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by microcephaly and growth restrictions (Ryan2024RING1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RING1 gene mutations in human corticogenesis and their potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
RING1 (ring finger protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). It interacts with other Polycomb group proteins, such as BMI1, CBX, and PHC, to facilitate chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (Satijn1997RING1). RING1 is known to ubiquitinate histone H2A, a process that is significantly enhanced when it forms a complex with other PRC1 components, such as RING2/Ring1B and BMI-1/Bmi-1 (Cao2005Role).

RING1 also interacts with the LIM domain protein KyoT2, forming a complex with RBP-J, a transcription factor. This interaction is mediated by KyoT2, which binds to the C-terminal fragment of RING1, facilitating the formation of a three-molecule complex that includes RBP-J (Qin2004RING1). This complex plays a role in inhibiting the transactivation of RBP-J by the Notch intracellular domain (NIC) and EBNA2, highlighting RING1's role in transcriptional repression (Qin2004RING1).

In cancer biology, RING1 interacts directly with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating p53 stability and is independent of its paralog RNF2 (Shen2018The).
