# DYNLT1

## Overview
DYNLT1 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein light chain Tctex-type 1, a critical component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein subunit and plays a vital role in intracellular transport processes, including the movement of organelles, mitotic spindle orientation, and cell migration. Beyond its functions within the dynein complex, dynein light chain Tctex-type 1 is involved in various cellular processes such as neuritogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and mitochondrial metabolism. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as nucleoporins and mitochondrial proteins, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and homeostasis. Alterations in DYNLT1 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Huang2023DYNLT1; Sarma2013Dynein; Miao2023Identification).

## Function
DYNLT1, or dynein light chain Tctex-type 1, is a 14 KDa protein subunit of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is essential for intracellular transport processes. This protein is involved in the transport of membranous organelles, mitotic spindle orientation, nuclear migration, and cell migration (Sarma2013Dynein). DYNLT1 forms homodimers and interacts with the intermediate chain DYNC1I1 within the dynein complex, playing a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport by potentially facilitating the nuclear import of certain proteins (Sarma2013Dynein).

DYNLT1 is also implicated in functions independent of the dynein complex, such as mediating neuritogenesis during neuronal development and acting as an activator of G-protein signaling. It interacts with Lfc, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to regulate neurogenesis (Sarma2013Dynein). A sub-population of DYNLT1 localizes to the nucleus, where it may play a role in transcriptional regulation, as evidenced by its involvement in transcriptional dysregulation by NUP98-HOXA9 (Sarma2013Dynein).

In addition to its role in cellular transport, DYNLT1 is involved in mitochondrial metabolism, where it colocalizes with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) on mitochondria, stabilizing VDAC1 and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production (Huang2023DYNLT1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DYNLT1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, DYNLT1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor relapse-free survival. The gene promotes breast cancer development by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis. Knockdown of DYNLT1 in experimental models has been shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for breast cancer (Miao2023Identification).

In glioblastoma, DYNLT1, also known as Tctex1, is overexpressed and correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness, including enhanced proliferation and invasion. This overexpression is linked to shorter overall survival and progression-free survival in patients, making it a potential independent prognostic biomarker. The effects of DYNLT1 in glioblastoma are mediated through pathways involving the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and the release of matrix metalloprotease 2 (Dumitru2021Dynein).

In gastric cancer, DYNLT1 is targeted by miR-15b-3p, which is upregulated in cancer tissues. This interaction leads to reduced DYNLT1 expression, promoting tumorigenesis and malignant transformation through the DYNLT1/Caspase-3/Caspase-9 signaling pathway (Wei2020Exosomal).

## Interactions
DYNLT1, or dynein light chain Tctex-type 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex and interacts with the intermediate chain DYNC1I1, forming homodimers that are essential for dynein's role in organelle transport and cell migration (Sarma2013Dynein). DYNLT1 also interacts with nucleoporins such as NUP98, NUP62, and NUP153, binding specifically to their FG repeat regions. These interactions are important for nucleocytoplasmic transport and the perinuclear accumulation of proteins (Sarma2013Dynein).

DYNLT1 is implicated in transcriptional dysregulation by the oncogenic fusion protein NUP98-HOXA9, where it is required for the transcriptional activation of certain promoters and the proliferation of hematopoietic cells (Sarma2013Dynein). In breast cancer cells, DYNLT1 interacts with the mitochondrial protein VDAC1, promoting mitochondrial metabolism by inhibiting VDAC1's ubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for ATP production and cancer cell proliferation (Huang2023DYNLT1). Additionally, DYNLT1 interacts with the Chlamydia trachomatis protein CT850, playing a role in the positioning of bacterial inclusions within host cells (Mital2015Chlamydia).
