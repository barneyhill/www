# JARID2

## Overview
JARID2 is a gene that encodes the protein jumonji and AT-rich interaction domain containing 2, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. This protein is a non-catalytic member of the jumonji family and is primarily involved in the recruitment and modulation of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a key player in transcriptional repression and histone methylation. JARID2's structure includes several domains, such as the jmjN, ARID, and jmjC domains, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and other proteins, although the jmjC domain is inactive in this context (Al‐Raawi2018A). The protein is essential for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and plays a significant role in cell differentiation and development by guiding PRC2 to specific genomic loci (Li2010Jarid2). Additionally, JARID2 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including heart failure, hematological disorders, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Lei2016JARID2; Celik2018JARID2; Bovill2008Induction).

## Structure
JARID2 is a protein with a complex molecular structure, featuring several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region of JARID2 is crucial for the recruitment of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin and includes a nucleosomal binding domain and an RNA binding domain (Al‐Raawi2018A). This region is essential for modulating PRC2 binding to genomic DNA and is necessary for the recruitment of PRC2 to PRC1-modified nucleosomes (Cooper2016Jarid2).

The C-terminal of JARID2 contains three conserved domains characteristic of the jumonji family: jmjN, ARID, and jmjC. The ARID domain is required for DNA binding, while the jmjC domain is inactive in JARID2 due to specific amino acid changes (Al‐Raawi2018A). JARID2 also has a zinc finger domain in its C-terminus, which is needed for interaction with SUZ12, a component of PRC2 (Al‐Raawi2018A).

JARID2 can be methylated at lysine 116, which enhances PRC2 activity by interacting with the EED subunit of PRC2 (Kasinath2018Structures; Sanulli2015Jarid2). This methylation mimics a methylated histone H3 tail, further stimulating PRC2 activity (Kasinath2018Structures). The protein also contains a ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM) in its N-terminus, which is essential for recognizing H2AK119u1-modified chromatin (Cooper2016Jarid2). 

In lineage-committed cells, a low molecular weight form of JARID2, known as DN-JARID2, is predominant. This form lacks the N-terminal PRC2-interacting domain and is a cleaved product of the full-length JARID2, spanning the C-terminal conserved jumonji domains (Al‐Raawi2018A).

## Function
JARID2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, primarily through its role as a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). In healthy human cells, JARID2 is crucial for recruiting PRC2 to chromatin, which is necessary for histone methylation and transcriptional repression during development and cell differentiation (Son2013Nucleosomebinding; Al‐Raawi2018A). JARID2 interacts with PRC2 components such as Ezh2 and Suz12, facilitating the complex's recruitment to target genes and influencing gene silencing (Son2013Nucleosomebinding; Li2010Jarid2).

In embryonic stem cells, JARID2 is essential for maintaining pluripotency and proper differentiation by guiding PRC2 to specific genomic loci (Li2010Jarid2). During skeletal muscle differentiation, JARID2 modulates Wnt signaling by repressing Wnt antagonists, which is crucial for activating MYOD, a key factor in muscle differentiation (Adhikari2018JARID2). In lineage-committed cells like keratinocytes, a cleaved form of JARID2, known as DN-JARID2, is important for the activation of differentiation genes, indicating a functional shift from PRC2 recruitment to gene activation (Al‐Raawi2018A). Overall, JARID2 plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and cell differentiation through its interaction with PRC2.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the JARID2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of heart failure, particularly due to left ventricular overload and aortic stenosis, JARID2 expression is significantly reduced. This reduction is associated with altered expression of cardiac genes, contributing to decreased myocardial contractility and heart failure (Bovill2008Induction).

In hematological disorders, JARID2 functions as a tumor suppressor in myeloid neoplasms. Deletions of JARID2 are frequently observed in the leukemic transformation of chronic myeloid malignancies, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes, progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Celik2018JARID2; Puda2011Frequent). These deletions are associated with impaired differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, contributing to disease progression (Celik2018JARID2).

JARID2 haploinsufficiency is linked to a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and specific facial features. This condition is associated with deletions or single-nucleotide variants in the JARID2 gene, leading to loss of normal protein function (Verberne2021JARID2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, JARID2 is upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Its overexpression promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis by repressing PTEN expression and activating the AKT signaling pathway (Lei2016JARID2).

## Interactions
JARID2 is a key component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. JARID2 interacts with PRC2 components such as EZH2, SUZ12, and EED, facilitating the recruitment and stabilization of PRC2 on chromatin (Kasinath2018Structures; Kaneko2014Interactions). It binds to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) like MEG3 and HOTAIR, which act as scaffolds to enhance PRC2 assembly and occupancy on target genes (Kaneko2014Interactions).

JARID2 also interacts with nucleosomes, enhancing the nucleosome-binding activity of PRC2-Ezh2, which is essential for its histone methyltransferase activity (Son2013Nucleosomebinding). It binds to mono-ubiquitylated H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119u1) through a ubiquitin interaction motif in its N-terminus, mediating crosstalk between PRC1 and PRC2 and facilitating PRC2 recruitment to chromatin (Cooper2016Jarid2). JARID2 is methylated by PRC2, which stimulates PRC2 activity, and this methylation is crucial for its interaction with the EED subunit of PRC2 (Kasinath2018Structures). These interactions highlight JARID2's versatile role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression.
