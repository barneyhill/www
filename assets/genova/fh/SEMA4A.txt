# SEMA4A

## Overview
SEMA4A is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 4A, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance, immune regulation, and vascular development. Semaphorin 4A is a transmembrane glycoprotein characterized by a sema domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its diverse biological functions (NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology; Chapoval2022Identifying). The protein exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, allowing it to participate in various signaling pathways. Functionally, semaphorin 4A is involved in modulating immune responses by interacting with receptors such as Plexin B1 and ILT-4, influencing T-cell activation and differentiation (Lu2018Human; Chapoval2022Identifying). Additionally, it plays a critical role in inhibiting angiogenesis by binding to Plexin-D1, thereby regulating vascular development (Toyofuku2007Semaphorin4A). Mutations in the SEMA4A gene have been linked to retinal degenerative diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Nojima2013A; Schulz2014Germline).

## Structure
SEMA4A (semaphorin 4A) is a glycoprotein composed of 761 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. The protein includes several distinct domains: an NH2-terminal signal peptide, a sema domain, an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of the C2 type, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology). The sema domain, a hallmark of the semaphorin family, is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller topology stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is crucial for its function (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins; Chapoval2022Identifying).

The tertiary structure of SEMA4A is complex, involving these domains to form a functional protein, although the complete crystal structure has not been defined (NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology). The protein can exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the soluble form being evidenced by a 120-kDa band in culture supernatants (NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology).

Post-translational modifications of SEMA4A include glycosylation, which is common among semaphorins, contributing to their stability and function (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). The protein's structure and function are also influenced by specific amino acid residues, such as M198 and F223, which are critical for its interaction with receptors like Plexin B1 (Chapoval2022Identifying).

## Function
SEMA4A (semaphorin 4A) is a membrane-bound protein that plays a crucial role in both the immune system and vascular development. In the immune system, SEMA4A is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and B cells, and its expression is upregulated upon cell activation. It acts as an activator of T-cell-mediated immunity by enhancing T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, including IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-4, depending on the culture conditions (Lu2018Human; NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology). SEMA4A interacts with receptors such as Tim-2 and ILT-4 on T cells, promoting Th2 differentiation and influencing immune responses (Lu2018Human).

In vascular development, SEMA4A is expressed in endothelial cells and functions to suppress angiogenesis. It inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation by binding to the Plexin-D1 receptor, which negatively regulates VEGF-dependent vascular formation (Toyofuku2007Semaphorin4A). This anti-angiogenic activity is crucial for regulating blood vessel formation and maintaining vascular homeostasis. SEMA4A's dual role in immune activation and angiogenesis suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases involving immune dysregulation and abnormal vascular growth (Toyofuku2007Semaphorin4A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEMA4A gene are associated with several diseases, particularly affecting the retina and immune system. In retinal degenerative diseases, mutations such as F350C in SEMA4A lead to defective endosomal sorting, causing conditions like retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy. These mutations disrupt the localization of essential proteins in retinal pigment epithelial cells, crucial for photoreceptor survival (Nojima2013A).

SEMA4A is also implicated in cancer, particularly familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX). Germline variants like V78M predispose individuals to this condition by affecting proliferative pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for SEMA4A (Schulz2014Germline). Other variants, including G484A and S326F, are linked to ovarian and endometrial cancers (Schulz2014Germline).

In autoimmune diseases, the SEMA4A rs3738581 SNP is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The T allele and certain genotypes are more frequent in patients, indicating a genetic susceptibility. Increased SEMA4A expression in T cells may exacerbate immune responses, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Cavalcanti2019Tcell).

## Interactions
SEMA4A (semaphorin 4A) is known for its interactions with several receptors, playing significant roles in immune regulation and cellular signaling. It primarily interacts with Plexin B1, a receptor that mediates its effects on Treg cell stability. SEMA4A competes with SEMA4D for binding to Plexin B1, with both proteins exhibiting similar binding affinities, although SEMA4A stabilizes Treg cells while SEMA4D inhibits them (Chapoval2022Identifying). Specific residues in SEMA4A, such as M198 and F223, are critical for its binding to Plexin B1 and its functional specificity (Chapoval2022Identifying).

SEMA4A also interacts with Plexin-D1, particularly in endothelial cells, where it suppresses angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF-mediated signaling pathways (Toyofuku2007Semaphorin4A). In the immune system, SEMA4A binds to the ILT-4 receptor on CD4+ T cells, driving Th2 responses and influencing T-cell proliferation (Lu2018Human). Additionally, SEMA4A interacts with Tim-2 on T-cells, contributing to immune cell activation (Yukawa2009Sema4A). These interactions highlight SEMA4A's multifaceted role in modulating immune responses and cellular processes.
