# ATP5MGL

## Overview
ATP5MGL is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit g like protein, which is a component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein is involved in the synthesis of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell, by facilitating the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial membrane, a critical step in oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP synthase complex, also known as Complex V, is essential for cellular energy metabolism and is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ATP5MGL gene is expressed in various tissues, reflecting its fundamental role in energy production. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene may have implications in metabolic disorders and mitochondrial diseases, although specific clinical associations are still under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
