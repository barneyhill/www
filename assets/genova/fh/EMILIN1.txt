# EMILIN1

## Overview
EMILIN1 is a gene that encodes the protein elastin microfibril interfacer 1, a glycoprotein integral to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of connective tissues. This protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including an EMI domain, a coiled-coil region, and a gC1q domain, which facilitate its interactions with other ECM components and cell surface receptors (Colombatti2012The). Elastin microfibril interfacer 1 plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers, contributing to the structural integrity and function of tissues such as blood vessels, skin, and lungs (Zanetti2004EMILIN1). It interacts with integrins, particularly α4β1 and α9β1, to regulate cell proliferation and maintain tissue homeostasis (Danussi2011EMILIN1–α4α9). Mutations in the EMILIN1 gene have been associated with various connective tissue disorders and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Capuano2015Diagnostic; Iacomino2020Distal).

## Structure
EMILIN1 is a protein characterized by a unique domain organization, including an N-terminal EMI domain, a central coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal gC1q domain. The EMI domain is cysteine-rich, containing seven cysteine residues and a conserved sequence motif, distinguishing it from other cysteine-rich domains (Colombatti2012The). The central region features a 90-residue sequence with leucine zippers, contributing to coiled-coil associations, and a collagenic region with 17 GXY triplets forming a trypsin-resistant triple helix (Colombatti2012The).

The gC1q domain of EMILIN1 is about 151 residues long and forms a beta-sheet secondary structure with a beta sandwich topology in its tertiary structure. This domain is part of a homotrimeric assembly, with each protomer maintaining a jelly-roll topology with two β-sheets of antiparallel strands. Unlike typical gC1q structures, it has a nine-stranded β-sandwich fold due to the absence of the F beta strand, replaced by a dynamic, solvent-accessible segment (Colombatti2012The). The quaternary structure involves a non-covalent association of three polypeptides, forming a homotrimer (Colombatti2012The). The gC1q domain is crucial for interactions with integrins, particularly α4β1, with the residue E933 playing a major role in this interaction (Colombatti2012The).

## Function
EMILIN1 is a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of healthy human cells, particularly in connective tissues. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers, which are crucial for the structural integrity of tissues such as blood vessels, skin, and lungs (Zanetti2004EMILIN1). EMILIN1 interacts with integrins, specifically α4β1 and α9β1, to regulate cell proliferation by inhibiting the excessive growth of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. This interaction modulates signaling pathways, including PTEN and Erk1/2, which are essential for maintaining skin homeostasis (Danussi2011EMILIN1–α4α9).

In the vascular system, EMILIN1 contributes to the regulation of arterial blood pressure by maintaining the integrity and elasticity of blood vessels. It binds to proTGF-β1, preventing its processing and thereby controlling vascular cell proliferation and vessel width. The absence of EMILIN1 leads to increased TGF-β levels, reduced vascular cell proliferation, and hypertension due to narrower blood vessels and increased peripheral resistance (Colombatti2012The). EMILIN1 also plays a role in elastogenesis by facilitating the fusion of elastin deposits, ensuring the proper formation of elastic fibers (Zanetti2004EMILIN1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EMILIN1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, primarily affecting connective tissues and the nervous system. A novel heterozygous mutation, c.748C > T [p.R250C], in the EMILIN1 gene is associated with distal motor neuropathy. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the distal lower limbs, and is thought to result from impaired coiled-coil formation due to the mutation (Iacomino2020Distal).

Another mutation, p.A22T, affects the processing of the signal peptide of EMILIN-1, leading to its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced secretion. This mutation is associated with autosomal-dominant hereditary connective tissue disease, characterized by altered EMILIN-1 expression and increased cellular stress markers (Capuano2015Diagnostic).

EMILIN1 deficiency has also been implicated in cardiovascular diseases. In mouse models, the absence of EMILIN1 leads to aortic valve disease, characterized by increased stiffness, fibrosis, and altered signaling pathways, including TGF-β and non-canonical MAPK pathways. These changes contribute to biomechanical dysfunction and early disease processes in the aortic valve (Angel2017Proteomic; Munjal2014TGFβ).

## Interactions
EMILIN1 interacts with several proteins in the extracellular matrix, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue structure and function. One of its key interactions is with the α4β1 integrin, a cell membrane receptor involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The gC1q domain of EMILIN1 acts as an adhesive ligand for α4β1 integrin, and this interaction is essential for its anti-proliferative effects (Maiorani2017Neutrophil; Colombatti2012The). EMILIN1 also interacts with α9β1 integrin, inhibiting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which is crucial for maintaining skin homeostasis (Danussi2011EMILIN1–α4α9).

In the context of elastic fiber formation, EMILIN1 binds to elastin and fibulin-5, stabilizing elastic fibers and influencing cell adhesion properties. This interaction is critical for the proper formation and maintenance of elastic fibers, as demonstrated in EMILIN1-deficient mice, which show alterations in elastic fibers and cell morphology (Zanetti2004EMILIN1).

EMILIN1 also plays a role in the extracellular matrix of osteoblasts by interacting with fibulin-4. It is necessary for the proper deposition of fibulin-4 fibers, as its depletion impairs fibulin-4 fiber formation (Schiavinato2017Fibulin4).
