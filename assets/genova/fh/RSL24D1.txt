# RSL24D1

## Overview
RSL24D1 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal L24 domain containing 1 protein, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis in human cells. This protein is primarily involved in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a critical component of the ribosome responsible for protein synthesis. RSL24D1 functions predominantly within the nucleolus, where it associates with nuclear pre-ribosomes to facilitate the maturation and export of pre-60S ribosomal particles to the cytoplasm (Durand2022RSL24D1). The protein's role as a large subunit ribosome biogenesis factor is underscored by its rapid removal from cytoplasmic pre-ribosomes, where it is likely replaced by RPL24 (Durand2022RSL24D1). RSL24D1 is essential for maintaining ribosome biogenesis and supports the translation of key pluripotency factors, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Durand2022RSL24D1).

## Function
The RSL24D1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. In healthy human cells, RSL24D1 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it is involved in the early stages of pre-ribosome assembly. It associates with nuclear pre-ribosomes, facilitating the maturation of pre-60S ribosomal particles and their export to the cytoplasm (Durand2022RSL24D1). The protein is rapidly removed from cytoplasmic pre-ribosomes, likely being replaced by RPL24, which indicates its role as a large subunit ribosome biogenesis factor (Durand2022RSL24D1).

RSL24D1 is essential for maintaining steady-state ribosome biogenesis and supports the translation of key pluripotency factors, such as POU5F1 and NANOG, which are critical for maintaining the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (Durand2022RSL24D1). The depletion of RSL24D1 leads to a decrease in 60S and 80S ribosomal subunits, affecting global protein synthesis and resulting in ribosomal stress (Durand2022RSL24D1). This stress activates quality control pathways, such as the stabilization of p53, which can influence cell proliferation and differentiation (Durand2022RSL24D1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
RSL24D1 is involved in several critical interactions within human cells, primarily related to ribosome biogenesis. It interacts with the PeBoW complex, which includes the proteins WDR12, BOP1, and PES1. This complex is essential for the processing and maturation of the large ribosomal subunit, and its overexpression is linked to cancer (Buhagiar2022Human; McCool2022Human). RSL24D1 also interacts with RNA polymerase I (RNAPI), specifically with its largest subunit, RPA194. This interaction suggests that RSL24D1 may influence ribosome biogenesis at the level of pre-rRNA transcription (Buhagiar2022Human; McCool2022Human).

In embryonic stem cells, RSL24D1 is associated with nuclear pre-ribosomes and is involved in the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It is primarily located in the nucleoli and is rapidly removed from cytoplasmic pre-ribosomes, likely replaced by RPL24 after nuclear export (Durand2022RSL24D1). The protein is also involved in maintaining steady-state levels of specific proteins crucial for pluripotency, such as POU5F1 and NANOG, by supporting their translation (Durand2022RSL24D1). These interactions highlight RSL24D1's role in linking ribosome assembly with broader cellular functions.
