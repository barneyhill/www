# NAP1L5

## Overview
NAP1L5 is a gene that encodes the nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 5, a protein involved in chromatin assembly and regulation. This protein is categorized as a nucleosome assembly protein, which plays a critical role in the organization and stabilization of chromatin structure. NAP1L5 is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative disorders and cardiac conditions. Its expression levels and functional interactions suggest that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, where it influences key signaling pathways and cellular processes (Wang2022Nucleosome; Guo2021NAP1L5).

## Clinical Significance
NAP1L5 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cardiac conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NAP1L5 expression is significantly downregulated in the brain tissues of patients, as well as in mouse models of AD. This downregulation is associated with increased APP metabolism, production of sAPPβ and Aβ, and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, all of which are hallmarks of AD pathology (Wang2022Nucleosome). Overexpression of NAP1L5 in cell models has been shown to alleviate these pathological characteristics by modulating the GSK3B/Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for AD (Wang2022Nucleosome).

In cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, NAP1L5 is upregulated and plays a role in translation control and ribosome assembly, processes crucial for the excessive protein synthesis required during cardiac hypertrophy. Knockdown of NAP1L5 in cardiomyocytes blocks cell enlargement and the induction of pathological genes, indicating its involvement in the pathological growth of heart muscle cells (Guo2021NAP1L5). These findings suggest that NAP1L5 could be a potential molecular target for treating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.
