# NPAS2

## Overview
Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (NPAS2) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles in mammals. The protein product, also known as NPAS2, is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS family of transcription factors, characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression in response to environmental cues. NPAS2 forms heterodimers with ARNTL (BMAL1), which are essential for its function in the circadian molecular clock, influencing the rhythmic expression of numerous genes. The protein is primarily expressed in the forebrain and plays a significant role in circadian transcriptional events and intracellular signaling within neural circuits. Additionally, NPAS2 is involved in hepatic metabolism and has been implicated in various cancers and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its broad biological and clinical significance (Murgo2023Role).

## Structure
The NPAS2 protein, also known as Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating circadian rhythms. It is composed of 824 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 91,791 Da (Murgo2023Role). The protein structure includes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and is responsive to NADPH, indicating that the NADPH binding site resides on this domain (Murgo2023Role; Rutter2001Regulation). NPAS2 also contains two heme-binding PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B) in the N-terminal region and one PAC domain in the C-terminal region, which allow it to act as a gas-regulated sensor, modifying DNA binding based on heme status (Murgo2023Role).

The protein functions as an obligate dimeric partner of ARNTL (also known as BMAL1), forming heterodimers that are essential for its role in the circadian molecular clock (Murgo2023Role). The heme-binding domains enable NPAS2 to bind heme and carbon monoxide (CO), which affects its DNA-binding activity (Murgo2023Role). The transition from Cys to His as the axial ligand upon heme reduction highlights the dynamic nature of its heme environment (Murgo2023Role). The protein's structure and function are influenced by the redox state of NAD cofactors, with reduced forms enhancing DNA binding (Rutter2001Regulation).

## Function
NPAS2, or Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles in mammals, including humans. It is a core component of the molecular clockwork that controls daily biological processes. NPAS2 functions by forming heterodimers with ARNTL (also known as BMAL1), binding to enhancer (E)-box DNA sequences of target genes, and driving the expression of first-order clock-controlled genes, such as DBP, TEF, and HLF, which influence the rhythmic expression of numerous tissue-specific genes (Murgo2023Role). 

NPAS2 is primarily expressed in the forebrain and is a main component of the circadian molecular clock, particularly important for circadian transcriptional events and intracellular signaling in mammalian brain structures and neural circuits (Murgo2023Role). It is involved in the regulation of circadian genes, such as Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and Rev-erbα, which are crucial for maintaining the circadian clock (Murgo2023Role). NPAS2 also plays a significant role in hepatic metabolism, interacting with the small heterodimer partner (SHP) to regulate triglyceride and lipoprotein homeostasis and driving the rhythmic expression of hepatic CYP1A2, a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism and lipid synthesis (Murgo2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
NPAS2, a circadian gene, has been implicated in various cancers and psychiatric disorders due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In breast cancer, high NPAS2 expression is associated with improved disease-free and overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yi2009The). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NPAS2 is frequently upregulated, promoting cell survival and correlating with poor prognosis (Yuan2017NPAS2). In colorectal cancer, lower NPAS2 expression is linked to tumor progression, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor (Xue2014Silencing; Murgo2023Role).

NPAS2 also plays a role in lung adenocarcinoma, where high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics (Huang2023Characterization). In prostate cancer, NPAS2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression affecting disease progression and immune response (Murgo2023Role). Beyond cancer, NPAS2 is involved in psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, highlighting its significance in central nervous system conditions (Murgo2023Role). These findings underscore the diverse clinical implications of NPAS2 across various diseases.

## Interactions
NPAS2 interacts with BMAL1 to form a heterodimer that binds to E-box DNA sequences, activating the transcription of circadian genes such as Cryptochrome (CRY) and Period (PER) (Murgo2023Role; Kondratov2006Posttranslational). This interaction is crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms, as the NPAS2/BMAL1 complex regulates the expression of clock-controlled genes (Murgo2023Role). NPAS2 can also compensate for the loss of CLOCK in the molecular clockwork, particularly in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues (Murgo2023Role).

The DNA-binding activity of the NPAS2/BMAL1 heterodimer is influenced by the redox state of NAD(P)H, with NADH and NADPH enhancing the binding activity, while NAD+ and NADP+ inhibit it (Yoshii2013Effects). The presence of heme is necessary for NPAS2's interaction with DNA, as heme binding to the PAS-A domain of NPAS2 is essential for its DNA-binding activity (Mukaiyama2006Spectroscopic).

NPAS2's transcriptional activity is modulated by interactions with cryptochromes (CRYs), which inhibit the transcriptional activity of the NPAS2/BMAL1 complex through post-translational modifications (Kondratov2006Posttranslational). This regulation does not affect the DNA-binding ability of the complex but influences its functional activity (Kondratov2006Posttranslational).
