# CT47A1

## Overview
CT47A1 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 47 member A1, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a crucial role in human spermatogenesis by regulating meiosis, particularly through the stabilization of the epigenetic regulator PRMT5. The CT47A1 protein functions as a gatekeeper during spermatogenesis, ensuring the proper timing of meiosis in response to testosterone levels. Beyond its role in normal physiology, CT47A1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including its overexpression in certain subtypes of breast cancer and its reactivation in renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, CT47A1 has been identified as a potential host factor in the replication of the Rift Valley Fever Virus, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Faramarzi2017Renal; Li2022Humanspecific; Balaraman2023Identification; Caballero2013Expression).

## Function
The CT47A1 gene, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, plays a significant role in human spermatogenesis. It is primarily expressed in the testes and is involved in the regulation of meiosis, a critical process in the formation of sperm cells. CT47A1 stabilizes the epigenetic regulator PRMT5 by preventing its degradation, which is essential for the progression of meiosis. This stabilization occurs through the inhibition of PRMT5's polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby maintaining its presence in the nucleus of spermatocytes (Li2022Humanspecific).

In healthy human cells, CT47A1 acts as a gatekeeper during spermatogenesis by regulating the transition from the leptotene/zygotene to the pachytene stage of meiosis. This regulation is crucial for synchronizing the meiotic process with testosterone levels during puberty. The presence of CT47A1 is necessary for testosterone-induced entry into meiosis, as demonstrated by experiments showing that its knockout leads to an increase in haploid spermatogenic cells (Li2022Humanspecific).

CT47A1's function is particularly important in preventing premature meiosis initiation before the testosterone surge, thus maintaining the prespermatogenesis stage and ensuring proper spermatogenesis (Li2022Humanspecific).

## Clinical Significance
CT47A1, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, CT47A1 is significantly overexpressed in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), particularly in estrogen receptor-negative and high-grade subtypes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in these cancers (Tabl2019A; Caballero2013Expression). Its expression in breast cancer highlights its role in tumorigenesis and its potential utility in cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies.

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), CT47A1 is expressed in the SK-RCC-1 renal cancer cell line, indicating its reactivation in this type of cancer. This reactivation is typical of cancer/testis antigens, which are usually restricted to gametogenic tissues but become aberrantly expressed in tumors, making them potential targets for immunotherapy (Faramarzi2017Renal).

CT47A1 has also been identified as a potential host factor involved in the replication of the Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV). A CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in A549 cells revealed CT47A1 among the top genes enriched in cells resistant to RVFV infection, suggesting its involvement in viral replication processes (Balaraman2023Identification).
