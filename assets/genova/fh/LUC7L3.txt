# LUC7L3

## Overview
LUC7L3 is a gene in humans that encodes the LUC7 like 3 pre-mRNA splicing factor, a protein integral to the spliceosome complex. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for gene expression and the generation of protein diversity. LUC7 like 3 is characterized by its zinc finger domains and arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other splicing factors and its incorporation into the spliceosome (Daniels2021Functional). The protein plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the U1 snRNA/5′ splice site duplex, influencing splice site selection and alternative splicing (Daniels2021Functional; Kenny2022LUC7). LUC7L3 is highly expressed in the brain and immune cells, underscoring its importance in these tissues (Daniels2021Functional). Additionally, it has clinical significance as a prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes (Hou2024Proteomics).

## Structure
LUC7L3 is a human protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, characterized by several distinct structural features. The protein contains a conserved N-terminal region that includes an alpha helix and two zinc finger domains (ZnF1 and ZnF2), which are crucial for its function in splicing regulation (Daniels2021Functional). The zinc finger domains are particularly important for stabilizing interactions with the U1 snRNA and the 5′ splice sites, with ZnF2 playing a significant role in promoting splicing at weak 5′ splice sites (Daniels2021Functional; Carrocci2024Functional).

The C-terminal region of LUC7L3 is rich in arginine and serine residues, forming RS domains that are essential for nuclear localization and interactions with other splicing factors, such as SR proteins (Daniels2021Functional). These RS domains facilitate the protein's incorporation into the spliceosome and its role in splice site selection (Daniels2021Functional).

LUC7L3 is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its function in splicing regulation (Daniels2021Functional). The protein may also be subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and activity within the spliceosome (Daniels2021Functional).

## Function
LUC7L3 is a critical component of the spliceosome complex, primarily involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. It interacts with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to stabilize the U1 snRNA/5′ splice site (5'SS) duplex, which is essential for accurate splicing (Daniels2021Functional; Kenny2022LUC7). LUC7L3 preferentially enhances the splicing of 'left-handed' 5'SS, which have stronger consensus matching on the exon side, thereby influencing splice site selection and alternative splicing (Daniels2021Functional; Kenny2022LUC7).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds predominantly to exonic sequences, particularly at weak 5'SS, and interacts with other splicing factors, including SR proteins, to regulate splicing events (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L3's role in splicing regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular function and viability, as its knockout results in embryonic lethality in mice and growth inhibition in human cell lines (Daniels2021Functional).

LUC7L3 is highly expressed in the brain and various immune cell lineages, suggesting its importance in these tissues (Daniels2021Functional). Its involvement in splicing regulation contributes to the diversity of protein isoforms, which is essential for normal cellular processes and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
LUC7L3 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its overexpression is linked to more aggressive cancer subtypes and poorer patient prognosis, correlating with higher Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages, microvascular invasion, and lower differentiation (Hou2024Proteomics). High LUC7L3 expression is associated with increased activity in cell proliferation-related pathways, such as DNA replication and cell cycle checkpoints, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Hou2024Proteomics). Knockdown experiments in HCC cell lines have shown that reducing LUC7L3 expression leads to decreased cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Hou2024Proteomics).

In addition to its role in HCC, LUC7L3 is involved in splicing regulation and interacts with various small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the spliceosome. Disruptions in its splicing function could contribute to diseases, particularly those involving splicing errors or myeloid neoplasms (Daniels2021Functional). Although LUC7L3 is not recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms, its interactions and regulatory roles in splicing suggest potential implications for disease pathogenesis (Daniels2021Functional).

## Interactions
LUC7L3 is a component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, where it interacts with U1 snRNA and the U1-70K protein (SNRNP70), playing a crucial role in the early stages of spliceosome assembly (Daniels2021Functional). It binds to exonic sequences near 5′ and 3′ splice sites, resembling the binding patterns of SR proteins, and is enriched for U1 snRNA at the 5′ end, indicating its incorporation in the U1 snRNP particle (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L3 also interacts with other spliceosomal factors, including U2 and U6 snRNAs, suggesting its involvement in the transition of the 5′ splice site from U1 to U6 snRNA (Daniels2021Functional).

LUC7L3 has been shown to interact with the splicing factor RBM25 through its C-terminal end, regulating splicing events (Daniels2021Functional). It also interacts with SR proteins, likely through its RS domains, and is involved in alternative splicing regulation (Daniels2021Functional). Additionally, LUC7L3 is implicated in the negative regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by interacting with the enhancer II/basal core promoter (ENII/BCP) region, although it does not directly bind to DNA (Li2016LUC7L3CROP).
