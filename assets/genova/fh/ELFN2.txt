# ELFN2

## Overview
ELFN2, or extracellular leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in synaptic regulation and neuronal communication. The ELFN2 protein is characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in the nervous system (Dolan2007The). It is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it plays a significant role in modulating synaptic transmission by interacting with group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). ELFN2's involvement in synaptic regulation extends to its participation in the functional wiring of retinal cone synapses, highlighting its importance in both central and peripheral nervous system functions (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). Additionally, ELFN2 has been implicated in various neurological and oncological conditions, including glioblastoma, where it acts as an oncogene, and in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, where its dysregulation affects synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic; Liu2018LINC00470).

## Structure
The ELFN2 protein is characterized by the presence of extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains. The LRR domain typically forms a horseshoe-shaped solenoidal structure, which is a common feature of proteins involved in protein-ligand interactions. This structure is composed of tandemly arranged LRR motifs, each consisting of a conserved N-terminal stretch of 9-12 amino acids with hydrophobic residues forming a β-strand, and a more variable C-terminal stretch of 10-19 amino acids (Dolan2007The). The FN3 domain is a beta-sandwich structure, which is also involved in protein-protein interactions (Dolan2007The).

The ELFN2 protein is a type I transmembrane protein, featuring a signal peptide, six LRR repeats, an LRR-CT domain, and an FN3 domain extracellularly, followed by a transmembrane domain and a long cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail contains numerous tyrosines but lacks other detectable motifs (Dolan2007The). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in extracellular proteins like ELFN2, although specific modifications for ELFN2 are not detailed in the available data (Dolan2007The). Information on specific splice variants or isoforms of ELFN2 is not provided in the context.

## Function
ELFN2 is a protein involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal communication. It is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, playing a crucial role in the functional wiring of cones with cone ON-bipolar cells in the retina by associating with metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6) (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). In the hippocampus, ELFN2 is primarily located in the postsynapse and inhibits glutamatergic transmission, as evidenced by increased amplitudes and slopes of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in ELFN2 knockout mice, suggesting its role in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic).

ELFN2 is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) fibronectin domain-containing family and interacts with group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8. These interactions are significant for synapse formation and the modulation of synaptic properties (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). In healthy human cells, ELFN2 is widely distributed in cerebral cortex neurons, striatum, and hippocampus, particularly in connections between neurons in the thalamus and cerebral cortex, where it acts as a regulator of protein phosphatase 1 (Liu2018LINC00470).

## Clinical Significance
ELFN2 has been implicated in various neurological and oncological conditions due to its role in synaptic function and gene expression regulation. In glioblastoma (GBM), ELFN2 is identified as an oncogene that promotes cell proliferation and autophagy. Its overexpression in GBM is attributed to hypomethylation of its promoter and interactions with LINC00470, a long non-coding RNA that enhances ELFN2 expression by inhibiting miR-101, a microRNA that suppresses ELFN2 (Liu2018LINC00470). High levels of ELFN2 expression are associated with poor prognosis in astrocytoma patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Liu2018LINC00470).

In the context of neurological disorders, ELFN2 is involved in the regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are crucial for synaptic transmission. Alterations in ELFN2 expression or function can affect excitatory input and glutamatergic transmission, potentially leading to conditions such as epilepsy and behavioral abnormalities. Elfn2 knockout mice exhibit increased seizure susceptibility, hyperactivity, anxiety, and impaired sociability, indicating the gene's role in these phenotypes (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). These findings suggest that ELFN2 may be a target for therapeutic interventions in both cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ELFN2 is involved in trans-synaptic interactions with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), specifically group III mGluRs, which include mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8. These interactions are crucial for synaptic regulation and function. ELFN2 directly associates with mGluR6, playing a significant role in the functional wiring of cones with cone ON-bipolar cells in the retina (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic). In the hippocampus, ELFN2 is expressed in pyramidal neurons and is primarily located in the postsynapse, where it inhibits glutamatergic transmission. This is evidenced by increased amplitudes and slopes of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in Elfn2 knockout mice (Matsunaga2021TransSynaptic).

ELFN2 is also part of the DBC signalplex at cone synapses, along with other proteins such as TRPM1, LRIT3, mGluR6, and GPR179. However, the absence of LRFN2 does not affect the localization of ELFN2 or other synaptic proteins, indicating that LRFN2 is not required for their expression or localization (Hasan2024Cone). Despite its involvement in these complexes, specific details on the physical interactions of ELFN2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-characterized (Hasan2024Cone).
