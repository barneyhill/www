# PGM2

## Overview
Phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglucomutase 2, which is a member of the α-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in carbohydrate metabolism by facilitating the interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate, a critical step in glycogenolysis and glycolysis (QUICK1972Differentiation). PGM2 isozymes are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with significant activity in red blood cells, lung, spleen, and placentae, and are particularly noted for their phosphoribomutase activity (Beck1979Differential; McALPINE1970The). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various metabolites and is involved in complex protein interactions, including those with calphoglin and calmodulin, which suggest a role in calcium signaling and cellular metabolic regulation (Takahashi2004Cellular).

## Structure
Phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2) is a member of the α-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily, characterized by a conserved four-domain architecture forming a heart-shaped structure. Each domain is approximately 100-150 residues in size and includes both α-helices and β-sheets (Stiers2017Biology). The active site of PGM2 is located in a positively charged cleft formed by residues from all four domains, which is crucial for catalysis and ligand binding (Stiers2017Biology). 

PGM2 contains specific motifs in its active site loops, such as the DPDADR motif in the metal-binding loop and the FAFEE motif in the sugar-binding loop (Muenks2017Sequencestructure). The phosphate-binding loop is characterized by conserved arginine and lysine residues, which are essential for its function (Muenks2017Sequencestructure). 

The enzyme requires a divalent metal ion, typically Mg2+, for maximal activity, with the metal ion binding site located near the phosphoserine in the active site (Stiers2017Biology). PGM2 is primarily expressed in the lung, spleen, and thymus, and it has a preference for pentose phosphosugars, such as ribose 1-phosphate and deoxyribose 1-phosphate (Stiers2017Biology).

## Function
Phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. This reaction is essential for glycogenolysis and glycolysis, processes that are vital for energy production and storage in cells (QUICK1972Differentiation). PGM2 isozymes are active in the cytoplasm and are involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis in human cells (Beck1979Differential).

In human tissues, PGM2 isozymes are present in all tissues and are particularly prominent in red blood cells, lung, spleen, and placentae. They are the second most active set of isozymes after PGM1, especially in red cells where PGM1 and PGM2 contribute equally to phosphoglucomutase activity (McALPINE1970The). PGM2 isozymes are characterized by significant phosphoribomutase activity, which distinguishes them from PGM1 and PGM3 isozymes (Beck1979Differential).

The activity of PGM2 isozymes is influenced by various metabolites, with certain substances like fructose-1,6-diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate inhibiting their activity more strongly than that of PGM1 isozymes. This suggests that PGM2 may have a distinct role in cellular metabolism, particularly under challenging metabolic conditions (Beck1979Differential).

## Interactions
Phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its activity and function. In yeast, PGM2 interacts with proteins such as DBP7 and YRF1-6, which are implicated in the regulation of PGM2 mRNA translation. These proteins may interact with ribosomal proteins, potentially modifying ribosome function and affecting the translation of structured mRNAs (Jagadeesan2023DBP7). The study suggests that DBP7 and YRF1-6 might have helicase functions that help unwind structured mRNAs, facilitating translation (Jagadeesan2023DBP7).

PGM2 is also part of a protein complex that includes calphoglin homologues and calmodulin, indicating a role in calcium signaling. Calphoglin enhances the activity of PGM2 by inducing its phosphorylation, which is crucial for various biosynthetic pathways, including oligosaccharide and fatty acid synthesis (Takahashi2004Cellular). Calphoglin directly stimulates PGM2 activity, suggesting a direct interaction, and is involved in calcium signaling by binding to calcium ions and enhancing calcium uptake in microsomal vesicles (Takahashi2004Cellular).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving PGM2, which are essential for its role in glucose metabolism and cellular signaling pathways.
