# HIF1AN

## Overview
HIF1AN is a gene that encodes the protein hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha inhibitor, also known as Factor Inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1). This protein is an asparagine hydroxylase that plays a critical role in the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which is essential for cellular responses to oxygen availability. By hydroxylating specific asparagine residues on the HIF-1α subunit, HIF1AN inhibits the binding of transcriptional coactivators necessary for HIF-1α's transcriptional activity, thereby preventing the activation of hypoxia-responsive genes under normoxic conditions (Tang2023Low; Kunej2021Integrative). HIF1AN is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function, including interactions with KANK proteins and ubiquitin protein E3 ligase ASB9, which have implications in cancer biology and reproductive health (Li2023Ubiquitin; Kim2017A). Through these mechanisms, HIF1AN contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and has potential clinical significance in conditions related to oxygen homeostasis and tumor suppression.

## Function
HIF1AN, also known as factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1), is a crucial regulator of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway in healthy human cells. It functions as an asparagine hydroxylase, specifically hydroxylating asparagine 803 in the transactivation domain of the HIF-1α subunit. This hydroxylation prevents the binding of transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP (CREB binding protein), which are essential for the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α (Tang2023Low; Kunej2021Integrative). By inhibiting this interaction, HIF1AN suppresses the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, thereby preventing the activation of hypoxia-responsive genes when oxygen is abundant (Kunej2021Integrative).

HIF1AN is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, playing a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the cellular response to oxygen levels. This regulation is essential for processes such as angiogenesis and metabolism, ensuring that hypoxia pathways are not inappropriately activated in healthy cells (Tang2023Low). The inhibition of HIF1A by HIF1AN is relieved under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF1A to activate the expression of target genes involved in the hypoxic response (Tang2023Low).

## Interactions
HIF1AN, also known as Factor Inhibiting HIF-1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that modulate its function as an oxygen-sensing enzyme. It interacts with KANK proteins, particularly KANK3, which has been identified as a novel substrate. This interaction involves the hydroxylation of specific asparagine residues within KANK3, which plays a tumor-suppressive role in hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting cell migration and invasion (Kim2017A). The interaction between HIF1AN and KANK3 is enhanced by dimethyloxalylglycine treatment, indicating a hydroxylation-dependent mechanism (Kim2017A).

HIF1AN also interacts with the ubiquitin protein E3 ligase ASB9 in human spermatogonial stem cells. This interaction leads to the degradation of HIF1AN, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. The re-expression of HIF1AN can partially restore these cellular functions, highlighting its regulatory role in spermatogonial stem cell biology (Li2023Ubiquitin).

These interactions underscore HIF1AN's role in cellular processes related to oxygen homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer and reproductive biology.
