# ZNF92

## Overview
ZNF92 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 92, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are known for their ability to interact with nucleic acids and other proteins, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. ZNF92, in particular, has been implicated in various biological functions and disease contexts, including cancer and psychiatric disorders. The protein encoded by ZNF92 is involved in key interactions with other proteins, such as histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) and TRIM28, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression (Kamran2022ZNF92; Chang2023AcetylationMimic). Clinically, ZNF92 is over-expressed in breast cancer and serves as a prognostic marker for poor outcomes, while genetic variants in ZNF92 have been associated with bipolar disorder and Swyer syndrome (Kamran2022ZNF92; Privitera2023Heterozygosity; Reeves2015Case).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF92 is notably over-expressed in breast cancer, where it serves as a prognostic marker associated with poor outcomes. Its over-expression is linked to pathways involved in metastasis and poor cancer outcomes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis (Kamran2022ZNF92). The ET-9 gene expression signature, which includes ZNF92, correlates with shorter overall and relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, independent of clinical variables like age and disease stage (Kamran2022ZNF92). High ZNF92 expression is associated with poor survival in various breast cancer subtypes, including HER2+, Luminal-B, triple-negative, and basal-like breast cancers (Kamran2022ZNF92).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, ZNF92 has been implicated in bipolar disorder. Genetic variants in ZNF92 may influence susceptibility to psychiatric diseases, particularly bipolar disorder, although further research is needed to confirm these findings (Privitera2023Heterozygosity). In Swyer syndrome, a microdeletion involving ZNF92 may lead to dysregulated RNA transcription, contributing to gonadal dysgenesis and potentially increasing the risk of developing dysgerminoma (Reeves2015Case). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of ZNF92 across different conditions.

## Interactions
ZNF92, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence gene expression and cellular processes. In the context of breast cancer, ZNF92 is co-expressed with histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) in the nucleus of breast cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential interaction or regulatory relationship between these proteins (Kamran2022ZNF92). The study highlights the HDAC1-HDAC7-ZNF92 axis, which is associated with breast cancer metastasis and survival, indicating that ZNF92 may function as a downstream co-target of these histone deacetylases (Kamran2022ZNF92).

In leukemic K562 cells, ZNF92 interacts with TRIM28, a protein involved in gene expression regulation. This interaction occurs with both wild-type TRIM28 and the TRIM28-K304Q mutant, which mimics acetylation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). The interaction between TRIM28 and ZNF92 suggests a role in the regulation of gene expression, although specific details on the nature of this interaction or its impact on nucleic acids are not provided in the available context (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

Overall, ZNF92's interactions with other proteins, such as HDAC7 and TRIM28, highlight its potential role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression. However, detailed mechanisms of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
