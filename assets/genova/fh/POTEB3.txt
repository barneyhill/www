# POTEB3

## Overview
POTEB3 is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member B3, which is part of the POTE gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for their role in protein-protein interactions. The POTE proteins, including POTE ankyrin domain family member B3, are categorized as cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), typically expressed in the testis but aberrantly expressed in various cancers (Fan2021Cancer/testis). The expression of POTEB3 is notably up-regulated in several cancer types, suggesting its involvement in cancer biology and potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Despite its recognized role in cancer, the specific biological functions and mechanisms of action of the POTEB3 protein remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
POTEB3, a member of the POTE gene family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that POTEB3 is up-regulated in several cancer types, including esophageal adenocarcinoma and different forms of breast cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The POTE gene family, including POTEB3, is expressed in epithelial ovarian and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Fan2021Cancer/testis). These genes are considered cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), which are typically restricted to the testis but are aberrantly expressed in various tumors, making them potential targets for cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell immunotherapy (Fan2021Cancer/testis).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of POTEB3 mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes is not fully understood. The current research focuses on its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target, given its tumor-specific expression patterns and involvement in cancer-related processes (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary; Fan2021Cancer/testis). Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of POTEB3 in cancer and its potential utility in clinical applications.
