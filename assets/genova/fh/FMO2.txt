# FMO2

## Overview
FMO2, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme flavin-containing dimethylaniline monoxygenase 2, which is primarily expressed in the lungs. This enzyme belongs to the flavin-containing monooxygenase family, which is involved in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. FMO2 plays a crucial role in the detoxification processes by catalyzing the S-oxygenation of various substrates, including cysteamine and lipoic acid, although the full physiological implications of these reactions are not completely understood (Phillips2019Endogenous). The enzyme is also implicated in cellular metabolism, enhancing mitochondrial function and stress resistance (Huang2021FlavinContaining). Variants of the FMO2 gene, such as the FMO2*1 and FMO2*2A alleles, have significant clinical implications, influencing drug metabolism and susceptibility to toxic chemicals, with notable interethnic differences in allele distribution (PHILLIPS2008Flavincontaining; Phillips2019Flavincontaining).

## Function
FMO2, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 2, is an enzyme primarily expressed in the lungs, where it plays a significant role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. It catalyzes the S-oxygenation of cysteamine to cystamine, a reaction that may serve as a detoxification mechanism due to the toxicity of cysteamine at low concentrations (Phillips2019Endogenous). FMO2 is also involved in the S-oxygenation of lipoic acid, although the physiological significance of this reaction is not fully understood (Phillips2019Endogenous).

In terms of cellular metabolism, FMO2 contributes to the regulation of amino acid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism. It is involved in pathways such as alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, as well as vitamin B6 metabolism (Huang2021FlavinContaining). FMO2 enhances mitochondrial function by increasing mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, indicating a shift in energy production from glycolysis to mitochondrial metabolism (Huang2021FlavinContaining). This enzyme also plays a role in stress resistance, helping cells withstand various stressors like heavy metals and UV radiation (Huang2021FlavinContaining).

## Clinical Significance
The FMO2 gene is clinically significant due to its role in drug metabolism and susceptibility to toxic chemicals. The FMO2*1 allele encodes a full-length, active enzyme primarily expressed in the lungs, which is involved in the detoxification of organophosphate insecticides and the metabolism of certain drugs, such as the antituberculars ethionamide and thiacetazone (PHILLIPS2008Flavincontaining; Phillips2019Flavincontaining). Individuals with the FMO2*1 allele may have a reduced risk of toxicity from organophosphates but an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity from thioureas due to the production of more toxic derivatives (Phillips2019Flavincontaining).

The FMO2*2A allele, a variant resulting from a C>T mutation at position 1414, is catalytically inactive and nearly universal in non-African populations. This mutation leads to a truncated protein and is associated with variability in drug response and susceptibility to toxic chemicals, particularly affecting the lungs (PHILLIPS2008Flavincontaining; Krueger2009Characterization). The presence of the FMO2*1 allele in some African populations suggests interethnic differences in drug efficacy and toxicity, impacting the clinical outcomes of treatments involving drugs metabolized by FMO2 (PHILLIPS2008Flavincontaining; Phillips2019Flavincontaining).
