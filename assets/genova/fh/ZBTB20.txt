# ZBTB20

## Overview
ZBTB20 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 20 protein, a transcription factor involved in various biological processes. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and a BTB domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. ZBTB20 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression across different tissues, including the liver, brain, and immune system. It is essential for liver development and function, particularly in repressing alpha-fetoprotein gene transcription and regulating lipid metabolism. In the brain, ZBTB20 is vital for hippocampal development and neuronal differentiation. Additionally, it influences immune responses by modulating B-cell differentiation and inflammatory pathways. Dysregulation of ZBTB20 has been linked to various diseases, including Primrose syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Stellacci2018Clinical; Stoyanov2020Transcription; Xie2008Zinc).

## Function
ZBTB20 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes and cellular functions. It is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to DNA in the nucleus, influencing the transcription of target genes. In the liver, ZBTB20 is crucial for postnatal development and functions as a key repressor of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene transcription, maintaining its expression at basal levels (Xie2008Zinc). It also regulates hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which is essential for systemic lipid homeostasis, by influencing the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and lipid metabolism (Liu2017Regulation).

In the brain, ZBTB20 is expressed in the hippocampus and is essential for the specification of the CA1 field identity, ensuring proper neuronal development and survival (Xie2010Zbtb20). It is also involved in neurogenesis and gliogenesis, indicating its role in brain development and function (Stoyanov2020Transcription).

ZBTB20 is critical for anterior pituitary development, particularly affecting the somatotrope and lactotrope populations. It enhances the transcriptional activity of the prolactin (Prl) promoter, suggesting a role as a coactivator in Prl gene activation (Cao2016ZBTB20). In the immune system, ZBTB20 is expressed in B-cells and is involved in their differentiation into plasma cells and memory B-cells (Stoyanov2020Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the ZBTB20 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Primrose syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the ZBTB20 gene. This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly, unusual facial features, calcified external ears, and other symptoms such as truncal obesity and ectopic calcification. The mutations typically affect the zinc-finger motifs of the ZBTB20 protein, leading to impaired DNA binding and a dominant negative effect on its function (Stellacci2018Clinical; Melis2020Primrose; Mattioli2016Novel).

Alterations in ZBTB20 expression levels have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of ZBTB20 is linked to increased proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis in tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). In HCC, ZBTB20 is considered a potential tumor marker, and its expression is associated with the integration of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (He2020HBV; Stoyanov2023Transcription).

Hypermethylation of the ZBTB20 gene has been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), suggesting a potential role in the disorder through its impact on hippocampal function and structure (Davies2014Hypermethylation).

## Interactions
ZBTB20 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple biological pathways. It acts as a transcriptional repressor of the PPARG gene, which in turn affects the WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis, as ZBTB20 suppresses PPARG expression, leading to increased activity of CTNNB1 and its target genes, such as AXIN2 and cyclin D1 (CCND1) (To2021ZBTB20).

ZBTB20 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, playing a crucial role in liver regeneration. It indirectly regulates EGFR expression, which is essential for hepatocyte proliferation. In ZBTB20-deficient livers, there is a marked reduction in EGFR expression and activation, leading to impaired hepatocyte proliferation and delayed cyclin D1 induction (Zhang2018ZBTB20).

In the context of immune responses, ZBTB20 represses the transcription of the IκBα gene, thereby promoting NF-κB activation. This interaction enhances the production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages upon stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Liu2013Zinc). These interactions highlight ZBTB20's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular functions.
