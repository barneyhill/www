# FCHO1

## Overview
FCHO1 (FCH and mu domain containing endocytic adaptor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a vital cellular mechanism for the internalization of molecules. The FCHO1 protein is categorized as an endocytic adaptor protein, characterized by its modular structure comprising an N-terminal F-BAR domain and a C-terminal μ-homology domain (μHD). These domains facilitate membrane curvature and protein-protein interactions, respectively, playing a crucial role in the formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. FCHO1 is predominantly expressed in neuronal and lymphoid cells, where it interacts with the AP2 adaptor complex and other endocytic proteins, thereby orchestrating the assembly and function of the endocytic machinery (Umasankar2012Distinct; Calzoni2019FBAR; Łyszkiewicz2020Human). Mutations in FCHO1 have been linked to immunodeficiency disorders, underscoring its significance in immune cell function and development (Łyszkiewicz2020Human).

## Structure
The FCHO1 protein is a modular structure consisting of two main domains: the N-terminal F-BAR domain and the C-terminal μ-homology domain (μHD). The F-BAR domain is responsible for membrane binding and curvature induction, interacting specifically with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) on the cell membrane (Umasankar2012Distinct; Calzoni2019FBAR). This domain forms an antiparallel dimer, which is crucial for its membrane-binding and curvature-sensing properties (Umasankar2012Distinct).

The μHD domain serves as an endocytic interaction hub, binding to various proteins such as EPS15, EPS15L1, and intersectin, among others (Łyszkiewicz2020Human; Umasankar2012Distinct). The linker region between the F-BAR and μHD domains is largely unstructured and contains motifs that interact with the AP-2 adaptor complex, facilitating clathrin recruitment (Umasankar2012Distinct).

FCHO1 is known to exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Calzoni2019FBAR). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, particularly in T-cell development and function (Łyszkiewicz2020Human).

## Function
The FCHO1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a primary mechanism for the internalization of molecules across cell membranes. FCHO1 is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) and vesicles (CCVs), which are essential for the uptake of proteins into the intracellular endosomal system of eukaryotic cells (Łyszkiewicz2020Human; Zaccai2022FCHO). The protein is primarily expressed in neuronal and lymphoid cells, where it is crucial for the proper operation of the CME cargo-adaptor AP2 (Zaccai2022FCHO).

FCHO1 interacts with the AP2 complex, promoting its active conformation by destabilizing its closed state, which is necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Hollopeter2014The). The FCHO1 protein contains several domains, including a membrane-binding F-BAR domain and a C-terminal μ-homology domain, which are involved in membrane curvature and interaction with other endocytic proteins (Calzoni2019FBAR). The FCHO1 protein acts as an endocytic hub, facilitating the recruitment of accessory proteins and clathrin to the plasma membrane, thereby playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of endocytic machinery (Umasankar2012Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FCHO1 gene are associated with combined immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent severe infections, T-cell lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with FCHO1 deficiency often experience severe bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, and some may develop B-cell lymphoma or neurological diseases (Łyszkiewicz2020Human; Calzoni2019FBAR). The deficiency is linked to impaired T-cell receptor (TCR) internalization and signaling, which affects T-cell development and function (Łyszkiewicz2020Human).

FCHO1 mutations can lead to structural alterations in the protein, affecting its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This results in defective T-cell proliferation and increased activation-induced cell death (Calzoni2019FBAR). The mutations include frameshift mutations causing premature termination and splice-site mutations leading to exon skipping, resulting in truncated or absent FCHO1 protein (Calzoni2019FBAR).

In some cases, FCHO1 deficiency is associated with additional complications such as lymphoproliferation, growth failure, chronic diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used successfully to treat some patients, reversing severe symptoms and restoring immune function (Aydemir2021Inflammatory).

## Interactions
FCHO1 interacts with several proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It binds to the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex through its μ-homology domain (μHD), specifically interacting with the globular appendage domain of the large α subunit and the β2-subunit appendage. The interaction site on the α appendage is the platform subdomain, as demonstrated by the loss of binding with a W840A substitution (Umasankar2012Distinct). FCHO1 also associates with proteins such as EPS15, EPS15R, intersectin, Dab2, Hrb, and CALM. The μHDs of FCHO1/2 bind to EPS15, EPS15R, and intersectin in HeLa lysates, while Dab2, Hrb, and CALM bind in a concentration-dependent manner (Umasankar2012Distinct).

FCHO1's interaction with EPS15 is crucial for its function in endocytosis. Mutations in FCHO1, such as pR679P, disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired clathrin-coated pit formation and T-cell receptor internalization (Łyszkiewicz2020Human). The FCHO1 protein also interacts with the AP2 complex through a conserved segment in its linker domain, known as the AP2 Activator motif (APA), which is essential for activating the AP2 complex and facilitating endocytosis (Hollopeter2014The). These interactions highlight FCHO1's role as a critical adaptor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
