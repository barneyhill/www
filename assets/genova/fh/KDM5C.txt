# KDM5C

## Overview
KDM5C is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 5C, a member of the histone demethylase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation by removing methyl groups from lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2/3), thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. As a multi-domain enzyme, KDM5C contains several functional domains, including the JmjC domain responsible for its catalytic activity, and the ARID domain for DNA binding. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and skeletal muscle, where it is crucial for normal neuronal development and function. Mutations in the KDM5C gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, such as X-linked intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its significance in cognitive development and neurological health (Poeta2019Histone; Vallianatos2018Altered).

## Structure
The KDM5C protein, encoded by the KDM5C gene, is a multi-domain structure involved in histone demethylation. It consists of several key domains, including the JmjC domain, which is responsible for its catalytic demethylase activity, and the ARID domain, which is involved in DNA binding (Grafodatskaya2013Multilocus; Peng2016Cofactorsloaded). The protein also contains two PHD zinc finger domains, which play a role in histone binding and substrate recognition (Hoekstra2024Characterization; Grafodatskaya2013Multilocus).

The quaternary structure of KDM5C includes the JmjN, ARID, PHD1, JmjC, and ZF domains, along with the substrate histone peptide, enzymatic cofactors, and DNA (Peng2016Cofactorsloaded). The PHD1 domain, although not essential for demethylase activity, contributes to substrate recognition by binding to the tri-methylated H3K9 residue (Peng2016Cofactorsloaded). The ARID domain's interaction with DNA is facilitated by its positive charge, complementing the negatively charged DNA (Peng2016Cofactorsloaded).

Mutations in KDM5C can affect its structure and function, such as the p.Cys1190Trp variant, which may cause unfolding of the PHD2 domain by disrupting its interaction with a Zn2+ atom (Leonardi2022Expanding). These structural features and interactions are crucial for KDM5C's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.

## Function
KDM5C, also known as lysine demethylase 5C, is a histone demethylase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by removing di- and tri-methyl groups from lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2/3). This demethylation process is essential for transcriptional repression and is involved in maintaining proper chromatin structure and gene expression, which are vital for normal neuronal maturation and function (Poeta2019Histone; Brookes2015Mutations). KDM5C is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels found in human skeletal muscle and brain tissues, particularly in regions critical for cognitive function such as the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala (Vallianatos2018Altered).

In healthy human cells, KDM5C functions as an epigenetic regulator, influencing processes like transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. It acts primarily in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin accessibility and gene expression (Leonardi2022Expanding). The gene is also involved in X-chromosome inactivation by regulating Xist RNA expression, which is crucial for maintaining proper X-chromosome dosage in females (Samanta2022Activation). KDM5C's activity is essential for cognitive development, and its dysfunction is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (Vallianatos2018Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KDM5C gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations can lead to a spectrum of clinical features, including intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe, epilepsy, short stature, aggressive behavior, and microcephaly (Grafodatskaya2013Multilocus; Iwase2016A). KDM5C mutations are also linked to Claes-Jensen syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and other symptoms, with males typically exhibiting more severe manifestations than females due to X-linked inheritance patterns (Schenkel2018Peripheral; Vallianatos2018Altered).

The gene's dysfunction can result in cognitive impairments, dendritic spine abnormalities, and transcription dysregulation of neurodevelopmental genes (Lintas2022Expanding). In some cases, KDM5C mutations have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other behavioral issues, suggesting a broader impact on neurological function (Vallianatos2018Altered). Additionally, KDM5C has been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its knockdown leads to a more immature leukemia phenotype with increased proliferative capacity (Trempenau2023The).

Alterations in KDM5C expression can also affect gene regulation, as seen in studies where specific gene expression signatures were identified in patients with KDM5C mutations, providing potential diagnostic tools for these conditions (Jensen2010A).

## Interactions
KDM5C, also known as lysine demethylase 5C, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. KDM5C interacts with gene-specific transcription factors such as c-MYC and ELK1, facilitating their recruitment to specific genomic loci. This interaction is supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which show a strong correlation between KDM5C and c-MYC binding sites (Outchkourov2013Balancing).

KDM5C also interacts with regulatory proteins ARX, ZNF711, and PHF8, which synergistically transactivate the KDM5C promoter. Mutations in these genes can affect KDM5C expression, linking it to neurodevelopmental disorders (Poeta2019Histone). In addition, KDM5C is part of the CoREST complex, a transcriptional repressor involved in neuronal and stem cell fate regulation. This complex includes components such as REST, HDAC1/2, and LSD1/KDM1A, with overlapping genomic targets between KDM5C and REST (Pavlenko2022Functions).

In breast cancer cells, KDM5C interacts with TRIM11, which regulates its stability through proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction involves the ARID and PHD domains of KDM5C (Xiao2022Regulation). These interactions highlight KDM5C's role as a central hub in transcriptional regulation and its potential involvement in various diseases.
