# DAAM2

## Overview
DAAM2 (dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. The DAAM2 protein is categorized as an actin assembly factor, playing a crucial role in actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; Kuzman2009Genomewide). It interacts with dishevelled proteins to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and is implicated in several biological processes, including placental development, bone metabolism, and neurodevelopment (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; de2021DAAM2; Sun2019Whole). DAAM2's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy, neurological disorders, and cancer progression (Ding2020The; Zhu2017Daam2; Qi2021Increased).

## Function
DAAM2 (dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. In healthy human cells, DAAM2 plays a significant role in actin polymerization, a process essential for maintaining the cytoskeleton's structure and function. This is facilitated through its interaction with dishevelled proteins, which regulate cytoskeletal dynamics (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

DAAM2 is expressed throughout gestation and is involved in placental development and fetal growth, with its expression highest at term. It is suggested to play a role in early placental vascularization and the establishment of the maternal-fetal blood supply (de2021DAAM2). The gene is also implicated in bone metabolism, where it influences bone-resorption activity through the Wnt signaling pathway, indicating its role in bone formation and resorption processes (Sun2019Whole).

In the context of neurodevelopment, DAAM2 is involved in the regulation of myelination and may alter the nuclear transport of transcriptional factors critical for this process (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). Its expression is also linked to cytoskeletal organization, as evidenced by its role as an actin assembly factor (Kuzman2009Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the DAAM2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In diabetic nephropathy (DN), DAAM2 expression is upregulated in the early stages and is associated with glomerular hypertrophy. This suggests that DAAM2 may play a role in podocyte injury and adaptation to stress related to glomerular hypertrophy, making it a potential target for understanding and treating DN (Qi2021Increased).

In the context of neurological disorders, DAAM2 is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin structure regulation. Dysregulation of DAAM2, particularly its interaction with the VHL and Nedd4 proteins, is associated with impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, which are relevant to conditions like multiple sclerosis and white matter injury (Cristobal2022Daam2; Ding2020The).

DAAM2 is also implicated in cancer progression. In glioma, DAAM2 promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating the degradation of the VHL protein, leading to increased levels of HIF1α and pAkt, which are associated with tumor growth and angiogenesis (Zhu2017Daam2). In colorectal cancer, DAAM2 promotes invasion by activating PAK1 and increasing MMP7 expression, and its high expression is linked to poor prognosis (Chen2021Disheveledassociated).

## Interactions
DAAM2 interacts with several proteins involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. It physically associates with Dvl3 through the DIX domain, which is crucial for Wnt signaling. This interaction is mediated by the GBD domain of DAAM2, which is essential for its role in Wnt activity (Lee2012Daam2). DAAM2 enhances the binding of Dvl3 to Axin2, stabilizing their interaction and promoting the assembly of Dvl3/Axin2 complexes, thereby amplifying Wnt signaling (Lee2012Daam2). 

In the context of oligodendrocyte differentiation, DAAM2 interacts with Rac1 and Gelsolin, key cytoskeletal regulators. It modulates Rac1 activity during early differentiation stages and associates with Gelsolin at later stages, influencing oligodendrocyte morphology and myelin structure (Cristobal2022Daam2). 

DAAM2 also interacts with the VHL protein, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is significant in glioma tumorigenesis, as DAAM2-driven degradation of VHL promotes cancer progression (Zhu2017Daam2). These interactions highlight DAAM2's role in various cellular processes through its involvement in multiprotein complexes and regulatory pathways.
