# DSEL

## Overview
The DSEL gene encodes the dermatan sulfate epimerase-like protein, which is a critical enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme is categorized as an epimerase due to its role in converting glucuronic acid to iduronic acid within the dermatan sulfate chain, thereby influencing the structural and functional properties of this glycosaminoglycan (Mizumoto2023Histories). The DSEL gene is located on chromosome 18 and is distinct from its homolog DSE, both in its exon/intron organization and its expression profile, which is predominantly in the brain (Mizumoto2023Histories; Thelin2013Biological). While DSEL shares structural similarities with DS-epi1, it lacks sulfotransferase activity, highlighting its specialized function in dermatan sulfate biosynthesis (Mizumoto2023Histories). The gene's expression and its variants have been linked to neuronal functions and certain medical conditions, although its precise role in these contexts requires further investigation (Zayed2010A; Mizumoto2023Histories).

## Structure
The DSEL gene encodes the DSE2 protein, which is a homolog of DSE and consists of 1222 amino acids. DSE2 features an epimerase domain of approximately 700 amino acids at the N-terminus and a predicted O-sulfotransferase domain at the C-terminus (Mizumoto2023Histories). The epimerase domain is shared with DS-epi1, showing 51% amino acid sequence identity, and is composed of two structural domains: one mainly of alpha-helices and one of beta-sheets, forming a groove for substrate positioning (Thelin2013Biological). Despite the presence of a predicted sulfotransferase domain, DSE2 lacks sulfotransferase activity towards desulfated dermatan sulfate and other related substrates (Mizumoto2023Histories).

The secondary and tertiary structures of the epimerase domain in DSE2 are similar to those in DS-epi1, suggesting a conserved structural framework for its enzymatic activity (Thelin2013Biological). The DSEL gene is located on chromosome 18 and has a distinct exon/intron organization compared to DSE, with only two exons (Thelin2013Biological). The protein's structure and function are influenced by interactions with other enzymes, such as D4ST1, which play a role in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (Thelin2013Biological).

## Function
The DSEL gene encodes the enzyme dermatan sulfate epimerase-like protein, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan involved in various cellular processes. This enzyme is responsible for the epimerization of glucuronic acid (GlcUA) to iduronic acid (IdoUA) within the DS chain, contributing to the structural diversity and function of DS (Mizumoto2023Histories). DSEL is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in the formation of IdoUA/GlcUA-hybrid structures in the DS chain, rather than the IdoUA-block structures formed by its homolog, DSE (Mizumoto2023Histories).

The activity of DSEL is essential for the proper formation of DS, which is a component of the extracellular matrix and plays a role in cell signaling, proliferation, and tissue repair (Mizumoto2023Histories). In Dsel-deficient mice, reduced epimerase activity was observed in several tissues, although no morphological defects were noted, suggesting that DSE may compensate for the loss of DSEL functions (Mizumoto2023Histories). The gene's expression and its variants have been associated with neuronal functions and conditions such as bipolar disorder (Mizumoto2023Histories).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DSEL gene have been investigated for their potential role in various medical conditions, particularly those affecting connective tissues. A study identified a novel missense substitution, c.1516G>A, predicting p.Met14Ile, in a patient with a late-presenting diaphragmatic hernia. This variant was not found in 200 Hispanic control chromosomes, suggesting it may be rare, although it was predicted to be benign by PolyPhen, a tool for assessing the functional impact of non-synonymous SNPs (Zayed2010A). Another variant, c.4445G>A, predicting p.Asp991Asn, was found in a patient with diaphragmatic hernia and trisomy 18, but its presence in a healthy parent suggests it may not be pathogenic (Zayed2010A).

The DSEL gene is involved in the synthesis of decorin, a protein crucial for normal collagen formation, which is important for connective tissue integrity. Despite its role in collagen synthesis, the study found weak expression of DSEL in the murine diaphragm and no significant change during myoblast differentiation, indicating a reduced likelihood of its involvement in diaphragm myogenesis (Zayed2010A). While the 18q22.1 deletion and DSEL haploinsufficiency might contribute to diaphragmatic defects, a definitive role for DSEL in diaphragm formation has not been established (Zayed2010A).
