# TRHR

## Overview
The TRHR gene encodes the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. This receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is crucial for the regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the pituitary gland. The TRHR protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical domain structure, which facilitates its interaction with TRH and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Xu2022Structural; Ji2022Molecular). The receptor's function is modulated by its ability to undergo desensitization and endocytosis, processes that are essential for maintaining homeostasis within the endocrine system (Gershengorn1996Molecular). Mutations in the TRHR gene can lead to clinical conditions such as central hypothyroidism, highlighting its significance in human health (BeckPeccoz2006Syndromes).

## Structure
The thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven-transmembrane (7TM) helical domain structure. This receptor is involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and is activated by the binding of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (Xu2022Structural; Ji2022Molecular). The TRHR structure includes a Y-shaped transmembrane domain pocket that is amphipathic, facilitating TRH binding through interactions with positively charged and hydrophobic residues (Xu2022Structural).

Key residues such as Y106, W160, Y181, and Y192 are crucial for TRH binding, with mutations in these residues leading to decreased receptor activation (Xu2022Structural). The N-terminal region of TRHR interacts with the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), influencing receptor activation (Ji2022Molecular). Upon TRH binding, conformational changes occur, including the outward displacement of TM6 and shifts in TM5 and TM7, which are typical of class A GPCR activation (Xu2022Structural).

The receptor also features conserved motifs such as the rotamer toggle switch and NPxxY motifs, which play roles in receptor activation and interaction with the Gαq protein (Yang2022Structural). These structural insights are crucial for understanding TRHR function and for the design of therapeutic agents targeting TRHR.

## Function
The thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Upon binding thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), TRHR undergoes conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with various G proteins, including Gq, G11, Gi-2, Gi-3, and a Gs-like protein. This interaction primarily activates phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PPI-PLC), leading to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and subsequent intracellular signaling cascades (Gershengorn1996Molecular).

The receptor's activation results in the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland, which then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. These hormones are crucial for regulating metabolism, growth, and development in the organism (Gershengorn1996Molecular). The TRHR is predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland, but its mRNA transcripts are also found in other tissues, including the thalamus, basal ganglia, pancreatic islets, and stomach (Gershengorn1996Molecular).

TRHR's function is modulated by its ability to undergo desensitization and endocytosis, processes that are influenced by specific residues and motifs within the receptor's structure (Gershengorn1996Molecular). These regulatory mechanisms ensure precise control over TRHR activity and, consequently, the physiological effects of TRH signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRHR gene, which encodes the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, can lead to resistance to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) action. This condition is characterized by impaired sensitivity of thyrotropes to TRH stimulation, resulting in central hypothyroidism. Clinically, this manifests as symptoms such as short stature and low serum total T4 levels, despite normal TSH levels. The disorder is recessive, and the first described case involved a child who was a compound heterozygote with two different mutations in the TRHR gene. One allele had a complex mutation involving a deletion and a missense mutation, while the other allele had a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated peptide. Functional studies demonstrated impaired TRH binding and response (BeckPeccoz2006Syndromes).

Alterations in TRHR expression levels have also been studied in the context of environmental exposures. For instance, exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in prepubertal rats was found to increase the relative expression of TRHR mRNA in the pituitary, suggesting potential impacts on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (de2020Proteomic). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from altered TRHR expression levels in humans have not been extensively documented.

## Interactions
The thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) engages in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. TRHR1 and TRHR2 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, which influence their internalization and interaction with intracellular proteins such as β-arrestins. TRHR1 interacts with both β-arrestins 1 and 2, classifying it as a class B GPCR, while TRHR2 primarily interacts with β-arrestin 2, classifying it as a class A GPCR. These interactions affect the receptors' internalization kinetics and β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways (Pfleger2004Receptors).

TRHR oligomerization is supported by biophysical techniques like BRET, which have shown that TRHR1 forms constitutive homo-dimers or oligomers, likely during biosynthesis. Agonist treatment increases the BRET signal, suggesting enhanced oligomerization or conformational changes (Pfleger2004Receptors). The oligomerization of TRHR1 and TRHR2 also alters their interactions with intracellular proteins, potentially affecting receptor function and signaling (Pfleger2004Receptors).

Additionally, TRHR interacts with protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1α), which is involved in the dephosphorylation of the receptor. This interaction is crucial for receptor desensitization and internalization, highlighting the complexity of TRHR regulation by phosphatases (Gehret2012siRNA).
