# PPP1R3E

## Overview
PPP1R3E is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3E, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a pivotal role in glycogen metabolism. The protein is characterized by a carbohydrate-binding module 21 (CBM21) domain, which is essential for its function in binding glycogen particles, thereby influencing glycogen synthesis and breakdown (Casamayor2020Controlling). Predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, PPP1R3E is regulated by insulin, linking its activity to glucose homeostasis and energy balance (Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). Variants of this gene have been associated with diabetes, underscoring its significance in metabolic processes and potential implications in metabolic disorders (Casamayor2020Controlling).

## Structure
The human PPP1R3E gene encodes a protein that is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), involved in glycogen metabolism. The PPP1R3E protein consists of 279 amino acid residues and includes a predicted carbohydrate-binding module 21 (CBM21) domain located near its C-terminal end, spanning residues 181-259 (Casamayor2020Controlling). This domain is crucial for its role in glycogen metabolism, as it facilitates the binding of the protein to glycogen particles.

The protein is structurally similar to other PP1R3 proteins, which are known to interact with the catalytic subunit of PP1, influencing its activity and substrate specificity. While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PPP1R3E are not provided, the presence of the CBM21 domain suggests a role in carbohydrate binding, which is a common feature in proteins involved in glycogen metabolism (Casamayor2020Controlling).

PPP1R3E is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle and heart tissues, with its expression levels regulated by insulin. Genetic variants of this gene have been associated with diabetes, highlighting its physiological significance (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein's expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms suggest its critical role in energy storage and utilization.

## Function
PPP1R3E encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism. This protein is involved in modulating PP1 activity, thereby influencing glycogen synthesis and breakdown. In healthy human cells, PPP1R3E is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, where it contributes to the regulation of glycogen storage and energy homeostasis (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein contains a predicted CBM21 carbohydrate-binding domain near its C-terminal end, which is crucial for its function in glycogen metabolism (Casamayor2020Controlling).

PPP1R3E is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in muscle cells, where it interacts with PP1 to enhance its activity towards glycogen synthase, a key enzyme in glycogen synthesis (Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). The expression of PPP1R3E is regulated by insulin, linking its activity to the regulation of blood glucose levels, which is essential for maintaining energy balance in the body (Casamayor2020Controlling). Genetic variants of PPP1R3E have been associated with diabetes, suggesting its critical role in glucose metabolism and potential implications in metabolic disorders (Casamayor2020Controlling).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PPP1R3E, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in glycogen metabolism and interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP1 to modulate its activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of glycogen synthesis and breakdown, influencing glucose homeostasis (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The protein contains a predicted CBM21 carbohydrate-binding domain near its C-terminal end, which is structurally similar to other PP1R3 proteins, suggesting a role in carbohydrate metabolism (Casamayor2020Controlling).

PPP1R3E is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle and heart, with its expression levels being controlled by insulin. This regulation indicates its involvement in metabolic processes related to energy storage and utilization (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein's interactions are not extensively detailed in the available literature, but its association with glycogen metabolism and muscle function suggests it may interact with other proteins involved in these pathways (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

The presence of the PP1 binding motif (PP1-BM) 'RVRF' in PPP1R3E supports its role as a PP1 interactor, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not comprehensively documented in current databases (Esteves2012Protein).
