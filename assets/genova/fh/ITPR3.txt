# ITPR3

## Overview
The ITPR3 gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in calcium (Ca2+) signaling within cells. This receptor is primarily located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is integral to the release of Ca2+ into the cytosol upon binding with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a second messenger involved in various cellular processes (Neumann2022Disrupted). The protein structure of IP3R3 includes several functional domains, such as the IP3-binding domain and a pore-forming region, which facilitate its role in Ca2+ transport and signaling (Mangla2020Type). IP3R3 is involved in critical cellular functions, including mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and immune response activation, and interacts with various proteins to modulate its activity (Nguyen2018Chlamydia; Cárdenas2010Essential). Alterations in the ITPR3 gene have been linked to several diseases, including cancers and immunodeficiencies, highlighting its clinical significance (Neumann2022Disrupted; Zheng2022Transcriptional).

## Structure
The ITPR3 protein, part of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor family, is composed of approximately 2,700 amino acids and shares about 70% sequence homology with the other isoforms, ITPR1 and ITPR2 (Mangla2020Type). The protein structure includes a cytosolic N-terminal IP3-binding domain, a large coupling/regulatory multidomain region, a pore-forming region with six transmembrane helices, and a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Neumann2022Disrupted). The ITPR3 protein forms a tetramer, contributing to its quaternary structure, and can form homo- or heterotetramers with other IP3 receptor isoforms (Neumann2022Disrupted).

The ITPR3 protein is structured into five main functional domains: the suppressor domain (SD), the InsP3 binding core (IBC), the regulatory domain, the transmembrane domain (TD), and the carboxy-terminus domain (CTD) (Mangla2020Type). The IBC contains the binding pocket for InsP3, while the TD, formed by six transmembrane helices, constitutes the ion-conducting pore responsible for cation selectivity, primarily transporting Ca2+ (Mangla2020Type). The regulatory domain, located at the cytoplasmic face, interacts with various regulatory proteins and small molecules and is a site for post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc-glycosylation (Mangla2020Type). The R1850Q variant is located near a phosphorylation site, indicating the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating the protein's function (Neumann2022Disrupted).

## Function
The ITPR3 gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3), a crucial component in calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathways within human cells. IP3R3 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and functions as part of a tetrameric complex that releases Ca2+ from the ER into the cytosol upon binding with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a second messenger produced following the activation of phospholipase Cγ (Neumann2022Disrupted). This Ca2+ release is essential for various cellular processes, including the activation of lymphocytes, where it triggers downstream signaling pathways such as NF-κB and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which are critical for immune responses (Neumann2022Disrupted).

IP3R3 also plays a significant role in mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling, contributing to mitochondrial function and energy production by facilitating Ca2+ uptake necessary for oxidative phosphorylation (Cárdenas2010Essential; Mangla2020Type). This process is vital for maintaining cellular bioenergetics and preventing metabolic stress, which can lead to autophagy activation as a survival mechanism (Cárdenas2010Essential). IP3R3 is also involved in ER-mitochondrial contacts, supporting local Ca2+ transfer and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bartok2019IP3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITPR3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In pancreatic cancer, specifically pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), overexpression of ITPR3 is associated with poor overall survival and advanced pathological stages. It is considered a potential independent risk factor for patient survival and a target for drug development and biomarker identification (Zheng2022Transcriptional). ITPR3 is also linked to several cancers, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and cholangiocarcinoma, where its overexpression provides a survival advantage to cancer cells by inhibiting apoptotic cell death (Zheng2022Transcriptional).

In the context of immunodeficiency, compound heterozygous variants in the ITPR3 gene have been identified in patients with conditions such as combined immunodeficiency and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). These variants disrupt calcium signaling, leading to impaired lymphocyte activation and immune function (Neumann2022Disrupted). Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ITPR3 promoter is associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Graves' disease (GD) (Oishi2008A).

## Interactions
ITPR3, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in calcium signaling. ITPR3 interacts with the Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion membrane protein MrcA, which recruits ITPR3 to inclusion-ER contact sites, modulating local calcium concentrations and promoting extrusion formation (Nguyen2018Chlamydia). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of chlamydial release by extrusion, as disruption of MrcA or depletion of ITPR3 reduces extrusion formation (Nguyen2018Chlamydia).

ITPR3 also forms complexes with the ER calcium sensor STIM1, which is essential for extrusion and calcium signaling (Nguyen2018Chlamydia). In the context of cancer, ITPR3 interacts with proteins such as BAP1, which stabilizes its expression by inhibiting degradation, affecting mitochondrial calcium levels and cancer cell sensitivity to apoptosis (Mangla2020Type). ITPR3 is also involved in the NF-ĸB/CD44 signaling pathway in bladder cancer, where its knockdown suppresses cancer stemness by affecting CD44 protein levels and NF-κB translocation (Zhang2021ITPR3). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ITPR3 in cellular processes and disease contexts.
