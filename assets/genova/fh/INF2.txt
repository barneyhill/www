# INF2

## Overview
The INF2 gene encodes the protein inverted formin 2, a member of the formin family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. This protein is characterized by its ability to modulate the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments, essential for maintaining cellular structure and function. Inverted formin 2 contains several key domains, including the formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains, which are vital for actin nucleation and elongation. The protein exists in two isoforms, INF2-nonCAAX and INF2-CAAX, each with distinct cellular roles. INF2 is involved in various cellular processes, such as vesicular transport, mitochondrial fission, and podosome formation, by interacting with other proteins and responding to intracellular calcium levels. Mutations in the INF2 gene are associated with diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), highlighting its clinical significance (Brown2009Mutations; LabatdeHoz2020The; Chhabra2006INF2).

## Structure
The INF2 protein is a member of the formin family, characterized by its ability to modulate actin filament dynamics. It contains several key domains, including the formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains, which are crucial for actin nucleation and elongation (Chhabra2006INF2). The FH1 domain interacts with profilin to accelerate actin filament elongation, while the FH2 domain is responsible for nucleating new actin filaments and remains at the barbed ends during elongation (Gurel2014INF2Mediated).

The N-terminal region of INF2 includes a Diaphanous Inhibitory Domain (DID) and a unique extension organized into two α-helices. The first α-helix contains a calmodulin-binding site (CaMBS), which is essential for activation by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) (LabatdeHoz2022Structure). The C-terminal region contains a Diaphanous Autoregulatory Domain (DAD), which is involved in autoinhibition through interaction with the DID (Ueda2023Characterization).

INF2 can form dimers, consistent with the quaternary structure observed in other formins (Chhabra2006INF2). The protein exists in two isoforms, INF2-nonCAAX and INF2-CAAX, which differ at their C termini and have distinct cellular roles (Gurel2014INF2Mediated).

## Function
The INF2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the formin family, which is involved in the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments, crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function. In healthy human cells, INF2 is expressed as two isoforms, INF2-1 and INF2-2, with INF2-1 localizing to the endoplasmic reticulum and INF2-2 being cytosolic (LabatdeHoz2020The). INF2 plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics by catalyzing actin filament formation and severing, which is essential for actin homeostasis and cellular processes such as vesicular transport, mitochondrial fission, and podosome formation (LabatdeHoz2020The).

INF2 interacts with calmodulin to mediate actin cytoskeleton remodeling in response to increased intracellular calcium levels, highlighting its role in cellular signaling (LabatdeHoz2020The). It also stabilizes microtubules and regulates their posttranslational modifications, which is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity (LabatdeHoz2020The). In T lymphocytes, INF2 is essential for the transport of proteins like MAL to the plasma membrane, facilitating proper cellular function and immune response (AndrésDelgado2010Formin). Overall, INF2's function in healthy cells is to regulate actin dynamics and facilitate proper membrane trafficking, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and function (LabatdeHoz2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INF2 gene are primarily associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease characterized by scarring in the glomeruli, leading to proteinuria and potentially progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Brown2009Mutations; Caridi2014Novel). These mutations are located in the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) of the INF2 protein, disrupting the interaction with the diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD) and leading to deregulated actin polymerization (Brown2009Mutations; LabatdeHoz2024INF2). 

INF2 mutations are also linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a neurological disorder affecting peripheral nerves. Some mutations result in both FSGS and CMT, with these dual-condition variants often causing more severe cytoskeletal disruptions than FSGS variants alone (Ueda2023Characterization). The presence of INF2 mutations can lead to altered mitochondrial dynamics and microtubule organization, contributing to cellular dysfunction and disease phenotypes (Ueda2023Characterization). 

INF2 mutations account for a significant proportion of familial FSGS cases, making it a critical gene for genetic analysis in families with inherited renal failure and neuro-sensorial defects (Caridi2014Novel).

## Interactions
INF2 (inverted formin 2) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It interacts with the diaphanous autoregulatory domains (DADs) of mammalian diaphanous-related formins (mDias), including mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3, through its diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID). This interaction inhibits mDia-mediated, Rho-activated actin polymerization and serum response factor (SRF)-responsive gene transcriptional changes (Sun2011Rho). 

INF2 also forms a complex with lysine-acetylated actin (KAc) and cyclase-associated protein (CAP), which strengthens the weak interaction between its DID and DAD domains, inhibiting INF2 activity. The binding of calmodulin (CaM) to a calmodulin-binding site (CaMBS) in INF2 can disrupt this inhibitory interaction, promoting a conformational change that activates INF2 (LabatdeHoz2022Structure).

INF2's interaction with actin filaments involves its FH1 and FH2 domains, which influence actin polymerization and depolymerization. The presence of profilin, which competes with INF2 for actin monomer binding, modifies these interactions, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin monomers and barbed end elongation (Chhabra2006INF2). INF2 also interacts with microtubules, bundling them and forming coaggregates with actin filaments (Gaillard2011Differential).
