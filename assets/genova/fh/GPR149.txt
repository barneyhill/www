# GPR149

## Overview
GPR149 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 149, a member of the class A, rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its atypical structure, lacking the conventional DRY motif necessary for G protein coupling, and instead possessing a conserved NFY motif, which suggests a unique functional role distinct from traditional GPCRs (Edson2010Deletion). GPR149 is predominantly expressed in oocytes and is implicated in reproductive biology, particularly in the regulation of fertility. In murine models, the deletion of Gpr149 has been associated with increased fertility and altered gene expression in ovarian cells, indicating its potential role in modulating reproductive processes (Edson2010Deletion; Alexander2013The). Beyond its reproductive functions, GPR149 has been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its broader biological significance (Provasek2023lncRNA; Kim2019ZNF492).

## Function
GPR149 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the class A, rhodopsin family of GPCRs. Unlike typical GPCRs, GPR149 lacks the characteristic DRY motif, which is important for G protein coupling, and instead has a conserved NFY motif in humans and other species, suggesting it may not function as a traditional GPCR (Edson2010Deletion). The protein is highly expressed in oocytes and plays a role in reproductive biology. In mice, deletion of Gpr149 leads to increased fertility, enhanced ovulation, and elevated levels of certain mRNAs in granulosa cells, indicating its involvement in regulating fertility (Edson2010Deletion; Alexander2013The). The absence of GPR149 results in increased expression of genes such as Gdf9 in oocytes and Fshr and Ccnd2 in granulosa cells, suggesting an altered intraovarian regulatory loop that enhances the response to pituitary gonadotropins (Edson2010Deletion). Although the exact molecular processes and cellular roles of GPR149 in humans are not fully elucidated, its conservation across species and impact on fertility in mice highlight its potential significance in reproductive biology (Edson2010Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
GPR149 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression and methylation patterns. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), GPR149 is hypermethylated, which is associated with advanced pathological stages and shorter progression times. This hypermethylation serves as an independent predictor of disease progression, with studies showing a strong predictive capability for ccRCC outcomes (Kim2019ZNF492). 

In the context of neurodegeneration, GPR149 is involved in regulating myelination processes. Its expression is enriched in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, where it negatively regulates differentiation into oligodendrocytes. This suggests that GPR149 may play a role in demyelinating diseases, and its inhibition could potentially promote myelin repair (Provasek2023lncRNA).

GPR149 has also been studied in relation to fertility. In mice, GPR149 deficiency leads to increased fertility, characterized by larger litter sizes and higher litter frequency. This is attributed to reduced follicular atresia and increased antral follicles, suggesting that GPR149 may influence reproductive aging and fertility (Fauser2011Contemporary). These findings indicate that GPR149 could be a target for fertility treatments.
