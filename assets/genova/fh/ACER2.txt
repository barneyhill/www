# ACER2

## Overview
ACER2, or alkaline ceramidase 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the metabolism of sphingolipids, specifically the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of bioactive lipids, which are integral to cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Duarte2020Elusive; Xu2021Alkaline). The protein encoded by ACER2 is predominantly localized in the Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in cellular stress responses and signaling pathways (Duarte2020Elusive; Xu2021Alkaline). ACER2's function is modulated by calcium ions, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Xu2021Alkaline). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and ischemic injuries, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Liu2023ACER2; Xu2017Tumor).

## Function
ACER2, or alkaline ceramidase 2, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in sphingolipid metabolism by hydrolyzing ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids. This process is essential for regulating the balance between ceramides, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which are key molecules involved in cell death and survival pathways (Duarte2020Elusive; Xu2021Alkaline). ACER2 is predominantly localized in the Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences cellular stress responses and signaling pathways (Duarte2020Elusive; Xu2021Alkaline).

In healthy human cells, ACER2 is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is upregulated in response to DNA damage, where it induces programmed cell death through a sphingosine-dependent pathway (Coant2017Ceramidases; Duarte2020Elusive). ACER2 also plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the levels of sphingolipids, particularly sphingosine and S1P, which are more efficiently regulated than ceramides (Xu2021Alkaline). The enzyme's activity is influenced by calcium ions in the Golgi lumen, which are essential for its catalytic function (Xu2021Alkaline).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACER2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. ACER2 is frequently deleted or mutated in various cancers, which can promote tumorigenesis by allowing cells to survive DNA damage. Restoring ACER2 expression has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by inducing programmed cell death, highlighting its potential as a tumor suppressor (Xu2017Tumor). In bladder cancer, high ACER2 expression is associated with a non-inflamed tumor microenvironment, characterized by reduced immune cell infiltration and negative correlations with immune checkpoints. This suggests a suppressive role in anticancer immunity, making ACER2 a potential biomarker for predicting tumor microenvironment status and molecular subtypes in bladder cancer (Liu2023ACER2).

In the context of diabetic hindlimb ischemia, ACER2 is targeted by miR-125b-5p, which is derived from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosomes. Overexpression of ACER2 in this setting has an anti-proliferative effect and can counteract protective mechanisms, indicating its role in modulating ceramide catabolism and affecting cell survival (Guo2023Exosomal). These findings underscore the importance of ACER2 in various pathological conditions, including cancer and ischemic injuries.

## Interactions
ACER2 interacts with the transcription factor Sp1 through the Timeless (TIM) protein, which acts as a coactivator. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ACER2 expression in breast cancer cells. TIM and Sp1 physically interact, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) assays. The TIM-Sp1 complex directly targets the ACER2 gene, as demonstrated by ChIP-PCR and luciferase reporter assays, which confirm that ACER2 is a target gene of this complex (Zhang2020TIMELESS).

ACER2 is also a direct transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor protein p53. The regulation involves p53 binding to specific response elements within the ACER2 gene, enhancing its promoter activity. This interaction has been demonstrated through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, which identified p53 binding sites in the ACER2 gene (Xu2017Tumor). The p53/ACER2 pathway plays a significant role in the DNA damage response and programmed cell death, with ACER2 mediating these processes in response to p53 activation (Xu2017Tumor). These interactions highlight ACER2's involvement in critical cellular pathways, influencing cell growth, apoptosis, and response to DNA damage.
