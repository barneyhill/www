# N4BP1

## Overview
N4BP1, or NEDD4 binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to ubiquitin signaling pathways. The protein NEDD4 binding protein 1 is characterized as a ubiquitin-binding protein, featuring domains such as the CUE domain, which facilitates its interaction with ubiquitin molecules (Kliza2024N4BP1; Kliza2021N4BP1). Functionally, N4BP1 plays a critical role in regulating immune responses by modulating NF-κB signaling and interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligases like Itch, thereby influencing protein stability and transcriptional activity (Oberst2007The; Shi2021N4BP1). Additionally, N4BP1 is involved in nucleolar processes and has been implicated in the degradation of viral RNAs, highlighting its potential role in antiviral defense (Yamasoba2019N4BP1). The gene's dysregulation is associated with diseases such as psoriasis, where it affects keratinocyte proliferation and immune cell infiltration, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune regulation (Gou2021The).

## Structure
NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains and structural features. The primary structure of N4BP1 includes a CUE domain, spanning residues 850-893, which forms a canonical three-helical bundle typical of CUE domains (Kliza2024N4BP1; Kliza2021N4BP1). This domain is involved in ubiquitin binding, forming a hydrophobic interface with ubiquitin (Kliza2024N4BP1).

The tertiary structure of N4BP1 involves the RNase domain, which does not directly bind ubiquitin but enhances the binding affinity for M1-linked ubiquitin chains by facilitating dimerization (Kliza2024N4BP1). This dimerization is crucial for the protein's function, as it brings two CUE domains into proximity, allowing simultaneous interaction with M1-linked di-ubiquitin (Kliza2021N4BP1).

In terms of quaternary structure, N4BP1 functions as a dimerization-dependent linear ubiquitin reader. The RNase domain acts as a dimerization module, positioning the CUE domains to form a stable complex with M1-linked di-ubiquitin (Kliza2024N4BP1). This dimerization is essential for the protein's specificity in binding linear ubiquitin chains (Kliza2021N4BP1).

N4BP1 also contains a CoCUN domain, which binds to the I44 hydrophobic patch of mono-ubiquitin (Kliza2024N4BP1). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing by caspase-8, which affects its function in apoptosis (Kliza2021N4BP1).

## Function
N4BP1 (NEDD4 binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with ubiquitin-related pathways. It acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling by binding to and inhibiting the oligomerization of NEMO, a key component in the NF-κB pathway. This inhibition prevents excessive NF-κB activation, which is crucial for controlling immune responses and preventing chronic inflammation or autoimmunity (Shi2021N4BP1).

N4BP1 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, inhibiting its ability to ubiquitylate substrates such as p73α and c-Jun. This interaction stabilizes these proteins, enhancing their transcriptional activity and impacting cell death regulation, which may influence tumor progression and the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy (Oberst2007The).

In the nucleolus, N4BP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including sumoylation and polyubiquitylation, which regulate its localization and degradation. This suggests a potential role in nucleolar RNA processing and protein turnover, particularly at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (Sharma2010N4BP1). These activities highlight N4BP1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune and stress responses in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the N4BP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly psoriasis and conditions involving immune dysregulation. In psoriasis, N4BP1 is crucial for maintaining skin homeostasis by regulating keratinocyte proliferation and neutrophil infiltration. N4BP1-deficient mice exhibit severe psoriasis-like symptoms, characterized by increased keratinocyte proliferation and neutrophil activity, suggesting that N4BP1 dysfunction contributes to the development of this chronic skin condition (Gou2021The). The gene's role in psoriasis is independent of the overproduction of cytokines like TNFa, IL-17, and IL-23, indicating that N4BP1 regulates cytokine signal transduction in a novel manner (Gou2021The).

In the context of immune responses, N4BP1 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling by inhibiting NEMO oligomerization. Mutations in N4BP1 can lead to enhanced NF-κB activation and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which may influence inflammatory responses and potentially contribute to conditions characterized by excessive inflammation (Shi2021N4BP1; Shi2020Mechanism). Despite these molecular insights, N4BP1-deficient mice do not exhibit overt autoimmune symptoms, suggesting a complex role in immune regulation (Shi2021N4BP1).

## Interactions
NEDD4 binding protein 1 (N4BP1) is known for its interactions with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. N4BP1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, specifically binding to the WW2 domain of Itch. This interaction inhibits Itch-mediated ubiquitylation of substrates such as p73α and c-Jun, thereby stabilizing these proteins and affecting their transcriptional activity (Oberst2007The). N4BP1 does not affect the ubiquitylation of p53 by MDM2, indicating its inhibitory effect is specific to Itch (Oberst2007The).

N4BP1 also interacts with the E3 ligase Nedd4, where it serves as a substrate for monoubiquitylation. This interaction is regulated by SUMO1 conjugation, which prevents N4BP1's ubiquitylation (Sharma2010N4BP1). Additionally, N4BP1 has been identified as a nucleolar protein that undergoes SUMO-regulated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal turnover at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (Sharma2010N4BP1).

In the context of viral interactions, N4BP1 degrades HIV-1 RNA, inhibiting the expression of HIV-1 mRNA and proteins. This activity is attributed to its nuclease domain, which is structurally similar to Regnase-1 (Yamasoba2019N4BP1). N4BP1 also suppresses Hepatitis B virus replication by degrading HBV RNAs, utilizing its KH-like and RNase domains (Kobayashi2023NEDD4binding).
