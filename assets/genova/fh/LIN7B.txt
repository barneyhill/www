# LIN7B

## Overview
LIN7B is a gene that encodes the protein lin-7 homolog B, a crucial component of the crumbs cell polarity complex. This protein functions as a scaffold, playing a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and organizing protein assemblies at cell junctions, particularly in synaptic and epithelial cells. Lin-7 homolog B is characterized by its PDZ domain, which facilitates interactions with various proteins, thereby contributing to the establishment and maintenance of asymmetric protein distribution within cells. This protein is essential for neuronal migration and axon growth during brain development, particularly in corticogenesis, where it supports synaptic development and plasticity. The proper functioning of lin-7 homolog B is vital for maintaining cortical architecture and ensuring healthy cellular function and organismal development (Mizuno2014Role).

## Function
LIN7B encodes a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and organizing protein assemblies at cell junctions. It is part of the crumbs cell polarity complex and is involved in the trafficking and localization of membrane proteins, particularly in synaptic and epithelial cells. LIN7B contains a PDZ domain, which facilitates interactions with various proteins, contributing to the establishment and maintenance of the asymmetric distribution of proteins within the cell (Mizuno2014Role).

In the brain, LIN7B is essential for neuronal migration and axon growth during corticogenesis. It supports the axon growth of excitatory neurons from the ipsilateral cortex to the contralateral one, playing a significant role in synaptic development and plasticity (Mizuno2014Role). LIN7B's function is critical for proper cortical architecture, as its deficiency can lead to delayed neuronal migration and defects in axon/synapse network formation (Mizuno2014Role).

LIN7B is active in the cell membrane, where it interacts with other proteins to facilitate cell signaling and tissue organization. Its role in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial cell organization is vital for healthy cellular function and organismal development (Mizuno2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LIN7B gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. LIN7B is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as mutations such as the c.602+1G>C splice-donor site mutation can lead to exon skipping and frameshift mutations, disrupting cortical neuron migration and potentially contributing to ASD pathophysiology (Mizuno2014Role). LIN7B is also involved in synaptic development, and its dysfunction may lead to synaptic abnormalities linked to ASD (Mizuno2014Role).

In addition to ASD, LIN7B has been associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Polymorphisms in LIN7B, such as the LIN-7_1 C allele, have been over-transmitted in ADHD probands, suggesting a genetic link to the disorder (Lanktree2008Association). LIN7B's role in synaptic function and its interaction with proteins like IRSp53 are crucial for neuritogenesis, and disruptions in these interactions may contribute to ADHD (Crespi2012LIN7).

LIN7B expression is also altered in Rett syndrome models, where its decreased expression is part of a broader pattern of gene dysregulation associated with cognitive deficits (Pelka2006Mecp2). Additionally, LIN7B has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) (Vastrad2020Identification).

## Interactions
LIN7B, a component of the crumbs cell polarity complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic function and neuronal development. It encodes a scaffold protein that interacts with the ionotropic glutamate receptor, GRIN2B, which is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Mizuno2014Role). LIN7B is part of the Lin-7 family, characterized by conserved PDZ and L27 domains, which facilitate interactions with proteins essential for neuronal signaling and adhesion (Mizuno2014Role).

LIN7B interacts with IRSp53, a protein involved in synaptic development, to regulate the formation of filopodia and neurites. This interaction is dependent on the L27 domain of LIN7B and the PDZ target motif of IRSp53, highlighting the importance of these domains in their interaction (Crespi2012LIN7). The LIN7:IRSp53 complex plays a significant role in the extension of membrane protrusions, with LIN7B being crucial for recruiting IRSp53 to plasma membrane complexes (ferrari2015role).

LIN7B also interacts with MALS proteins, mammalian homologs of LIN-7, which are enriched at brain synapses and associated with the postsynaptic density-95/NMDA receptor complex. These interactions are mediated through PDZ domain interactions, which are vital for synaptic protein assembly and receptor localization (Jo1999Characterization).
