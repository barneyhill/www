# SHROOM1

## Overview
SHROOM1 is a gene that encodes the protein shroom family member 1, which is a key regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly influencing the organization of actin filaments. This protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein and plays a significant role in cell shape and tissue morphogenesis by interacting with cytoskeletal elements such as actin filaments, microtubules, and α-spectrin (Lee2009The). It is crucial for processes like neural tube closure and the maintenance of epithelial cell structure, thereby impacting overall organismal development (Lee2009The). SHROOM1 is maternally expressed and is involved in early developmental stages, with its expression patterns suggesting a vital role in morphogenesis and neural development (Lee2009The). Alterations in SHROOM1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its clinical significance (Nemtsova2019Epigenetic; SevillaPérez2008Shroom).

## Function
SHROOM1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly influencing actin filament organization. In healthy human cells, SHROOM1 plays a crucial role in cell shape and tissue morphogenesis by controlling cellular architecture through interactions with cytoskeletal elements such as actin filaments, microtubules, and α-spectrin (Lee2009The). This protein is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for processes like neural tube closure and epithelial cell structure maintenance, impacting overall organismal development (Lee2009The).

SHROOM1 is maternally expressed, with its mRNA localized in the animal hemisphere of the Xenopus egg and early blastula, indicating its early involvement in development (Lee2009The). During development, SHROOM1 is expressed in the ectodermal and mesodermal layers, excluding the endoderm, and is later restricted to the neural plate region during neurulation. It is mostly expressed in the deep layer of neuroepithelial cells and is also detected in the notochord, paraxial mesoderm, cement gland, otic placode, and pronephric tubes and duct (Lee2009The). These expression patterns suggest that SHROOM1 is integral to morphogenesis and neural development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and regulation of the SHROOM1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), SHROOM1 expression is significantly downregulated in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) under hypoxic conditions. This downregulation is associated with PASMC hypertrophy, a characteristic of PAH, suggesting a potential link between SHROOM1 expression and the disease's pathogenesis (SevillaPérez2008Shroom). In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients, SHROOM1 mRNA levels are upregulated in lung homogenates, but when normalized for acta2 mRNA levels, SHROOM1 expression appears downregulated in PASMCs, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (SevillaPérez2008Shroom).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SHROOM1 is significantly hypermethylated in the promoters of synovial fibroblasts, particularly in the early stages of the disease. This hypermethylation suggests that SHROOM1 could serve as a biomarker for early RA diagnosis (Barik2021Emerging; Nemtsova2019Epigenetic). The gene's role in microtubule rearrangement during cell division and nervous tissue development further implicates it in the disease's pathogenesis (Barik2021Emerging).
