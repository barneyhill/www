# KDM4D

## Overview
KDM4D, also known as JMJD2D, is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 4D, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression by specifically demethylating histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a mark associated with transcriptional repression (Wu2016H3K9me3). The demethylase activity of lysine demethylase 4D is crucial for DNA replication and cell cycle progression, as it facilitates the formation of the pre-initiation complex at replication origins (Wu2016H3K9me3). Additionally, KDM4D is involved in the DNA damage response and interacts with various proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53, to modulate transcriptional activity (Kim2012Regulation). Dysregulation of KDM4D expression or function has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2022Histone).

## Structure
KDM4D, also known as JMJD2D, is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of proteins, which are involved in histone demethylation. The primary structure of KDM4D includes the JmjN and JmjC domains, with the JmjC domain containing the catalytic site essential for its demethylase activity (Wang2021Crystal; Chen2006Structural). The secondary structure of KDM4D is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteins of this family (Chen2006Structural).

The tertiary structure of KDM4D involves the folding of these secondary elements into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by the coordination of metal ions such as Fe(II) at the catalytic site (Wang2021Crystal). This structure is crucial for its function in demethylating specific histone marks, particularly H3K9me3 (Krishnan2013Structural).

KDM4D does not have a canonical RNA binding domain, but it can bind RNA through non-canonical regions located in its N-terminal and C-terminal areas, which include the JmjN and JmjC domains (Zoabi2014RNAdependent). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect the demethylase activity of KDM4D (Krishnan2013Structural).

## Function
KDM4D, a lysine demethylase, plays a crucial role in DNA replication by demethylating histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a modification associated with transcriptionally silenced chromatin. This demethylation is essential for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication. KDM4D facilitates the formation of the pre-initiation complex (pre-IC) by reducing H3K9me3 levels at replication origins, thereby promoting proper replication initiation and elongation (Wu2016H3K9me3). 

KDM4D interacts with several replication proteins, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and DNA polymerases, indicating its involvement in the replication process. These interactions are regulated during the cell cycle, with KDM4D associating with chromatin during the G1 and S phases (Wu2016H3K9me3). 

KDM4D's function is distinct from its role in the DNA damage response, as it binds to DNA replication proteins and origins independently of DNA damage (Wu2016H3K9me3). Its activity is crucial for maintaining a favorable chromatin environment for DNA replication, ensuring efficient cell cycle progression and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the KDM4D gene, also known as JMJD2D, have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KDM4D is upregulated and promotes tumor progression by enhancing oncogene expression and tumor glycolysis through pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling (Chen2022Histone). It also contributes to immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1 expression, which inhibits CD8+ T cell activation (Chen2022Histone). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KDM4D is highly expressed in tumor tissues and inhibits p53 signaling, which is crucial for tumor suppression, thereby promoting cancer progression (Chen2022Histone).

KDM4D is also involved in the pathogenesis of other cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In GIST, it promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis through HIF1β/VEGFA signaling (Chen2022Histone). In AML, it enhances cell survival by activating MCL-1 expression (Chen2022Histone). Interestingly, KDM4D acts as a tumor suppressor in ESCC, indicating its role is cancer-type dependent (Chen2022Histone). These findings suggest that KDM4D could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
KDM4D, also known as JMJD2D, is a histone demethylase that interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It forms a complex with the tumor suppressor protein p53, specifically interacting with its DNA binding domain. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of p53, particularly in activating the p21 promoter, a p53 target gene. The C-terminal region of KDM4D is responsible for this interaction, and its catalytic activity is essential for the coactivation of p53-dependent transcription (Kim2012Regulation).

KDM4D also interacts with components of the DNA replication machinery. It is recruited to DNA replication origins in a manner dependent on the origin recognition complex (ORC) and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. KDM4D facilitates the formation of the pre-initiation complex by reducing H3K9me3 levels, which is crucial for the chromatin association of replication proteins such as Cdc45 and PCNA during the S phase of the cell cycle (Wu2016H3K9me3).

Additionally, KDM4D is involved in the DNA damage response, where it binds to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and RNA. These interactions are crucial for its recruitment to DNA damage sites, highlighting its role in facilitating double-strand break repair (KhouryHaddad2015The).
