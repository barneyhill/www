# PTEN

## Overview
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a critical tumor suppressor gene that encodes a protein with dual-specificity phosphatase activity, primarily functioning as a lipid phosphatase. The PTEN protein is pivotal in regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), thereby inhibiting cell growth, proliferation, and survival (Dahia2000PTEN; Sansal2004The). Structurally, PTEN comprises an N-terminal phosphatase domain and a C-terminal C2 domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and membrane association (Masson2019Structural; Lee1999Crystal). PTEN's role extends beyond lipid phosphatase activity, as it also influences cell migration, adhesion, and genomic stability, acting in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Lee2018The). Mutations in the PTEN gene are linked to various hereditary cancer syndromes, such as Cowden syndrome and PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome, as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Ngeow2015Breast; Yehia2020The).

## Structure
The PTEN protein is composed of two main domains: the N-terminal phosphatase domain and the C-terminal C2 domain. The phosphatase domain, spanning residues 15-185, features a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices and includes the active site with the P loop, characterized by the conserved CX5R motif. This domain is crucial for PTEN's ability to dephosphorylate substrates, with the active site formed by the WPD, TI, and P loops, creating a deep, positively charged pocket suitable for the bulky PI(3,4,5)P3 substrate (Masson2019Structural; Lee1999Crystal). The C2 domain, consisting of residues 192-353, has a β-sandwich structure and plays a role in membrane binding through its positively charged CBR loops (Masson2019Structural; Lee1999Crystal).

The interface between the phosphatase and C2 domains is critical for PTEN's function, with mutations in this region affecting its activity and structure (Masson2019Structural; Lee1999Crystal). PTEN's structure is stabilized by these domains, allowing it to interact with cellular membranes. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate PTEN's activity and stability, with phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail being crucial for protein stability (Waite2002Protean). PTEN also has several splice variant isoforms that can influence its function (Waite2002Protean).

## Function
The PTEN gene encodes a protein that functions as a lipid phosphatase, primarily involved in dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), thereby antagonizing the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. This action is crucial for regulating cell growth, survival, and apoptosis, as it prevents the activation of downstream components like Akt and mTOR kinases, which promote cell proliferation and survival (Dahia2000PTEN; Sansal2004The; LESLIE2004PTEN).

In healthy cells, PTEN's activity leads to cell-cycle arrest, particularly at the G1 phase, and can increase apoptosis in response to various stimuli. This is linked to its influence on the p27 KIP1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which reduces CDK2 activity and halts cell-cycle progression (Dahia2000PTEN). PTEN also regulates cell migration and adhesion by interacting with the integrin pathway and reducing focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation (Dahia2000PTEN).

PTEN is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability and prevents uncontrolled cell division. Its regulation involves post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and cellular localization (Lee2018The). The protein's role in controlling the mTOR signaling pathway is also significant, as it influences cell size and proliferation (Sansal2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTEN gene are associated with a range of hereditary cancer syndromes and other disorders. Cowden syndrome (CS) and PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) are notable conditions linked to germline PTEN mutations. Individuals with these mutations have increased lifetime risks for several cancers, including breast, thyroid, kidney, endometrial, and colon cancers (Ngeow2015Breast; Yehia2020The). Cowden syndrome is characterized by multiple hamartomas and an elevated risk of breast and thyroid cancers, while Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) involves macrocephaly, lipomas, and intestinal polyps (Bonneau2000Mutations; Sansal2004The).

PTEN mutations are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with macrocephaly, and can lead to a variety of benign conditions, including thyroid diseases and colorectal polyps (Yehia2020The). Somatic mutations in PTEN are frequently found in endometrial carcinomas and glioblastomas, often resulting in protein inactivation (Bonneau2000Mutations). These mutations can lead to the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, promoting cancer development (Sansal2004The). PTEN's role in tumor suppression is further supported by its interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Fusco2020PTEN).

## Interactions
PTEN interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It forms complexes with proteins such as MAGI2 and MAGI3, which bind to PTEN's C-terminal PDZ domain, enhancing its recruitment to the plasma membrane and activating its lipid phosphatase function (Lee2018The). PTEN also interacts with β-arrestins, which are co-recruited to the plasma membrane, enhancing PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity (Lee2018The). 

PTEN's interactions extend to proteins that regulate its stability and activity. For instance, it interacts with PREX2, SIPL1, and MAN2C1, which act as negative regulators by suppressing its lipid phosphatase activity (Lee2018The). PTEN also forms a complex with histone acetyltransferase p300, which is essential for PTEN-mediated cell cycle arrest (Lee2018The). 

PTEN's interactions are not limited to proteins; it is also regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively affect its expression. However, competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) can act as decoys for these miRNAs, thereby boosting PTEN expression (Lee2018The). These interactions highlight PTEN's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential as a target for cancer therapies.
