# DUT

## Overview
The DUT gene encodes the enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), a critical hydrolase involved in nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by catalyzing the conversion of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate, thereby preventing the misincorporation of uracil into DNA. dUTPase is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme and is characterized by its jelly-roll β-sheet structure, which forms a homotrimeric complex essential for its enzymatic function (Vértessy2008Keeping). The enzyme exists in multiple isoforms, including nuclear and mitochondrial variants, which are differentially regulated and play distinct roles in DNA replication and repair processes (Ladner1997The). The activity of dUTPase is crucial in rapidly dividing cells, where it ensures the proper balance of nucleotide pools, thus safeguarding DNA integrity and cellular viability (Sousa2007DNAuracil).

## Structure
The DUT gene encodes the enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), which plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by hydrolyzing dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, thereby preventing uracil incorporation into DNA. The protein typically forms a homotrimer, with each subunit contributing to the active site. Each subunit of dUTPase folds into a jelly-roll β-sheet structure, a common motif that contributes to the enzyme's stability and function (Vértessy2008Keeping). The active sites are symmetrically formed, involving conserved sequence motifs from all three subunits, which are essential for the enzyme's specificity and catalytic activity (Vértessy2008Keeping).

The enzyme's specificity for dUTP over dUDP is achieved through steric exclusion and a unique hydrogen bonding pattern specific to uracil. The conserved motifs coordinate the metal ion and the phosphate chain of the nucleotide, with motif 5 playing a crucial role in creating a secluded microenvironment for the active site (Vértessy2008Keeping). In humans, dUTPase exists in different isoforms, including nuclear and mitochondrial variants, which are generated through alternative splicing or promoter usage (Vértessy2008Keeping). Common post-translational modifications of the dUTPase protein include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and stability.

## Function
The DUT gene encodes the enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), which plays a critical role in maintaining DNA integrity in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate, a reaction essential for preventing the incorporation of uracil into DNA. By reducing the intracellular concentration of dUTP, dUTPase minimizes the risk of uracil incorporation during DNA synthesis, which can lead to mutations and genomic instability (Vértessy2008Keeping; Ladner1997The).

dUTPase is expressed in two isoforms in human cells: a nuclear isoform (DUT-N) and a mitochondrial isoform (DUT-M). DUT-N is regulated in accordance with nuclear DNA replication and is induced during the transition from G0 to S phase, while DUT-M is expressed constitutively and is involved in mitochondrial DNA replication (Ladner1997The). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in dividing cells, where it helps maintain a low dUTP/dTTP ratio, ensuring the availability of dUMP for thymidylate synthesis, a precursor for thymidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair (Dos2017dUTPase; Sousa2007DNAuracil).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DUT gene are linked to a novel monogenic syndrome characterized by diabetes and bone marrow failure. This syndrome has been identified in two unrelated consanguineous families, with a specific homozygous missense mutation (chr15:g.48,626,619A>G) affecting both mitochondrial and nuclear isoforms of the DUT enzyme. This mutation leads to a nonsynonymous substitution that is predicted to cause damaging conformational changes in the protein, resulting in clinical symptoms such as diabetes and bone marrow failure (Dos2017dUTPase). The syndrome is non-autoimmune, begins in childhood or early adulthood, and patients eventually require insulin. The variability in disease severity among patients with the same mutation suggests potential contributions from other genetic or environmental factors (Dos2017dUTPase).

The DUT enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining DNA integrity by preventing uracil incorporation into DNA. Loss of dUTPase activity can lead to increased uracil in DNA, triggering apoptosis and potentially causing conditions like megaloblastic anemia and neural tube defects (Chon2019Deoxyuracil). Inhibition of DUT in pancreatic beta cells increases apoptosis through the mitochondrial cell death pathway, highlighting its importance in cell viability (Dos2017dUTPase).

## Interactions
The DUT gene encodes the enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), which is involved in nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to maintain DNA integrity. One significant interaction is with the Staphylococcal repressor protein Stl. The human dUTPase (hDUT) forms a complex with Stl, leading to a substantial reduction in the enzymatic activity of dUTPase and the DNA-binding capability of Stl. This interaction involves specific regions of the proteins, particularly the substrate binding pocket of dUTPase, which includes conserved motifs (Nyíri2018Structural). The binding of Stl to dUTPase is mutually exclusive with the substrate dUTP, suggesting that Stl can only bind to the substrate-free form of dUTPase (Nyíri2018Structural).

The formation of the hDUT-Stl complex was confirmed using native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, revealing a hetero-oligomer consisting of a human dUTPase trimer and two Stl monomers. This complex formation significantly inhibits the catalytic activity of hDUT, with Stl causing approximately 70% inhibition (Nyíri2018Structural). The interaction also affects Stl's ability to bind DNA, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, where increasing hDUT concentrations reduced the Stl-DNA complex formation (Nyíri2018Structural).
