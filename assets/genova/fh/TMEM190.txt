# TMEM190

## Overview
TMEM190 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 190, a small transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is primarily localized in the inner-acrosomal membrane of acrosome-intact sperm and plays a role in sperm function, particularly during the acrosome reaction, where it relocates to the equatorial segment. Despite its involvement in sperm interactions, TMEM190 is not essential for fertilization, as evidenced by the fertility of TMEM190-null mice (Figueroa2015Role). The protein is hypothesized to undergo post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Figueroa2015Role). TMEM190 has also been implicated in clinical contexts, including potential associations with major depressive disorder and as a biomarker for Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection (Nicolas2020Human; Zhang2019A). Further research is required to fully understand the biological and clinical significance of TMEM190.

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM190 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its precise role in disease remains under investigation. In the study by Zhang et al., TMEM190 was found to have a p-value close to the significance threshold for association with major depressive disorder (MDD) after Bonferroni correction, suggesting a potential link to this condition. The gene is expressed in brain regions associated with MDD, such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus, which may indicate its involvement in the disorder's pathophysiology (Zhang2019A). 

In another study, TMEM190 was identified as a potential specific biomarker for Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) infection. The expression of TMEM190 was notably decreased in the small airway epithelium of smokers, although its expression profile in other viral infections has not been described. This suggests that TMEM190 could serve as a biomarker specific to HRSV, highlighting its potential role in respiratory conditions (Nicolas2020Human).

While these findings suggest possible associations with certain diseases, further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of TMEM190 mutations or alterations in its expression.

## Interactions
TMEM190 is a small transmembrane protein that participates in various interactions within mouse sperm. It is primarily localized in the inner-acrosomal membrane of acrosome-intact sperm and relocates to the equatorial segment during the acrosome reaction. TMEM190 co-localizes with IZUMO1, a protein essential for sperm-oocyte fusion, both before and after the acrosome reaction, although they do not form a direct physical complex as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Figueroa2015Role; HernándezFalcó2022The).

TMEM190 forms protein complexes with other sperm proteins, specifically associating with 65-, 43-, and 40-kDa proteins on the acrosome-reacted sperm surface (Figueroa2015Role). Despite these interactions, TMEM190-null mice remain fertile, suggesting that while TMEM190 may play a role in sperm function, it is not essential for fertilization (Figueroa2015Role). The protein is also hypothesized to undergo post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and function (Figueroa2015Role). The presence of TMEM190-derived proteins of different sizes (19-, 15-, and 14-kDa) has been noted, but their biological significance remains unclear (Figueroa2015Role).
