# TMEM177

## Overview
TMEM177 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 177, an integral membrane protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is involved in the biogenesis of COX2, a core subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is essential for mitochondrial respiratory function. As part of the COX20 interaction network, TMEM177 plays a critical role in the early steps of COX2 assembly by interacting with COX20 and other assembly factors such as SCO2, thereby facilitating the stabilization and assembly of COX2 at the Cu A-site. Although TMEM177 is not essential for the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, it is important for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, impacting cellular metabolism and overall cellular health (Lorenzi2018The).

## Function
TMEM177 is a mitochondrial protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of COX2, a core subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is essential for mitochondrial respiratory function (Lorenzi2018The). TMEM177 is part of the COX20 interaction network, which is involved in the early steps of COX2 assembly. It interacts with COX20 and other assembly factors such as SCO2, facilitating the stabilization and assembly of COX2 at the Cu A-site (Lorenzi2018The).

The protein is an integral membrane protein with its C-terminus facing the intermembrane space, and it colocalizes with mitochondrial networks, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial protein import and assembly (Lorenzi2018The). TMEM177 influences the abundance of COX20, which in turn affects the stability and turnover of newly synthesized COX2, although it is not essential for the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (Lorenzi2018The).

In healthy human cells, TMEM177 is important for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, impacting cellular metabolism and overall cellular health (Lorenzi2018The). Its role in COX2 biogenesis underscores its significance in mitochondrial function and cellular respiration.

## Interactions
TMEM177 is involved in the biogenesis of COX2, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, through its interactions with other proteins. It is a part of the COX20 interaction network, which is crucial for the assembly of COX2. TMEM177 forms complexes with COX20, and this interaction is dependent on mitochondrial translation products, particularly COX2 (Lorenzi2018The). TMEM177 co-purifies with COX20, COX2, and SCO2, but not with COX18, indicating a specific role in early COX2 assembly (Lorenzi2018The). The interaction between TMEM177 and COX20 is reduced when mitochondrial translation is inhibited, suggesting that newly synthesized COX2 is crucial for this association (Lorenzi2018The).

TMEM177 also interacts with COX2 assembly factors in a COX20-dependent manner, as demonstrated by FLAG-immunoprecipitation experiments (Lorenzi2018The). It engages with newly synthesized COX2, and its interaction with SCO2 is also COX20-dependent (Lorenzi2018The). These interactions suggest that TMEM177 plays a crucial role in regulating COX20 levels and COX2 stability, although it does not significantly impact the assembly of respiratory chain complexes (Lorenzi2018The).
