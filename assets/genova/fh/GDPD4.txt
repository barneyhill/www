# GDPD4

## Overview
GDPD4, or glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically functioning as a phosphodiesterase. This enzyme plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters, contributing to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol, which are essential for membrane lipid remodeling and cellular signaling pathways. The GDPD4 protein is typically localized in cellular membranes and the cytoplasm, where it influences membrane dynamics and signaling processes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its involvement in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways underscores its significance in broader biological processes, including cell signaling and membrane dynamics, which are crucial for the organism's overall health and function (Wang2023Identification; Denomme2024Paternal).

## Function
GDPD4 (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 4) encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically functioning as a phosphodiesterase. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters to produce glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol, a process crucial for membrane lipid remodeling and signaling pathways. The activity of GDPD4 is essential for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and facilitating various signaling processes within the cell (Wang2023Identification; Denomme2024Paternal).

GDPD4 is typically active in cellular membranes and the cytoplasm, where it influences membrane dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. These functions are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell function. The protein's role in lipid metabolism and signaling suggests its involvement in broader biological processes, such as cell signaling and membrane dynamics, which are essential for the organism's overall health and function (Wang2023Identification; Denomme2024Paternal).

While the specific functions of GDPD4 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways indicates its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Wang2023Identification; Denomme2024Paternal).

## Clinical Significance
The GDPD4 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and certain cancers. In the context of ASD, intronic loci within the GDPD4 gene have been significantly associated with neurocognitive development scores, specifically the PPVT score, which measures receptive vocabulary and serves as a proxy for verbal intelligence. This association suggests a potential role for GDPD4 in the neurodevelopmental aspects of autism (Lee2021EndophenotypeWide). Additionally, inherited or de novo copy number variations (CNVs) involving GDPD4 have been observed in patients with ASD, although these variations are not always considered disease-causing when inherited from healthy parents (Xu2012A).

In cancer research, GDPD4 has been identified in the context of ERBB2-amplified breast cancers. Gains targeting GDPD4, along with other genes, have been associated with ER-negative ERBB2-amplified breast cancers, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Sircoulomb2010Genome). Furthermore, missense mutations in GDPD4 have been identified in glioblastoma multiforme, although specific disease associations were not detailed (Shpak2014An). These findings suggest that alterations in GDPD4 may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders.
