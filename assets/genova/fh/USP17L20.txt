# USP17L20

## Overview
USP17L20 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 20, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thereby rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L20 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
