# CRYBG3

## Overview
CRYBG3 is a gene that encodes the protein crystallin beta-gamma domain containing 3, which is a member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily. This protein is characterized by the presence of βγ-crystallin-like domains, which are crucial for maintaining cellular architecture and stabilizing large oligomeric structures, such as the cytoskeleton (Wistow2012The). The CRYBG3 protein is structurally similar to other members of its superfamily, such as AIM1, but it is distinguished by additional coding exons and a C-terminal trefoil domain that plays a role in organizing actin filaments (Slingsby2014Functions). The protein's domain structure, featuring repeated Greek-key motifs, suggests its involvement in cellular stabilization and macromolecular complex formation (Slingsby2014Functions).

## Structure
The CRYBG3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the βγ-crystallin superfamily, characterized by the presence of βγ-crystallin-like domains. These domains are typically involved in maintaining cellular architecture and stabilizing large oligomers, such as the cytoskeleton (Wistow2012The). The protein structure includes six βγ-crystallin-like domains, which are encoded in exons arranged similarly to those in β-crystallin genes (Wistow2012The). 

The CRYBG3 protein shares structural similarities with AIM1, another member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily, but includes two additional coding 5' exons (Wistow2012The). It also contains a C-terminal trefoil domain, which is known for its role in organizing actin filaments (Slingsby2014Functions). The βγ-crystallin domains are characterized by repeated pairs of modified Greek-key motifs, which form tightly folded domains with conserved tryptophan residues contributing to the hydrophobic core and domain stability (Slingsby2014Functions).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CRYBG3 are not provided, the protein's domain structure suggests a role in cellular architecture and stabilization of macromolecular complexes (Wistow2012The; Slingsby2014Functions).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CRYBG3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of lung cancer, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) CRYBG3 is significantly upregulated and is associated with increased malignancy, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It interacts with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), promoting glycolysis and enhancing cancer cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a tumor promoter (Chen2018Long). Conversely, in the context of ionizing radiation, CRYBG3 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which affects tumor growth and metastasis. It impairs cytoskeleton organization and mechanotransduction pathways, reducing YAP/TAZ activity and thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Zheng2022Ionizing).

In neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, loss-of-function mutations in CRYBG3 have been identified as shared genetic determinants in conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, indicating its potential involvement in the genetic etiology of these disorders (Glessner2017Copy). Additionally, CRYBG3 has been identified as a gene associated with B-cell lymphomagenesis, suggesting its specificity in this type of cancer (Rahrmann2019Sleeping).
