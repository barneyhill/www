# DUOXA2

## Overview
The DUOXA2 gene encodes the dual oxidase maturation factor 2, a crucial chaperone-like protein involved in the maturation and functional expression of dual oxidase enzymes, particularly DUOX2, in the thyroid gland. This protein plays a pivotal role in the translocation and stabilization of DUOX2, facilitating its movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the apical plasma membrane, where it participates in the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, as it is required for the iodination of thyroglobulin. DUOXA2's function is indispensable, as it cannot be compensated by DUOXA1, underscoring its unique role in thyroid physiology. Mutations in the DUOXA2 gene can lead to congenital hypothyroidism and other thyroid dysfunctions due to impaired H2O2 production, highlighting its clinical significance (Targovnik2020Defects; Ohye2010Dual).

## Function
The DUOXA2 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the maturation and proper functioning of dual oxidase proteins, specifically DUOX1 and DUOX2, in the thyroid gland. DUOXA2 acts as a maturation factor that facilitates the translocation of DUOX proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the apical plasma membrane, where hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production occurs. This process is crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis, as H2O2 is necessary for the oxidation of iodide, a key step in hormone production (Ohye2010Dual).

DUOXA2 consists of 320 amino acids and includes several membrane-integral regions and N-glycosylation sites, which are important for the proper folding and function of DUOX proteins. The DUOXA2 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the thyroid gland, highlighting its significant role in thyroid function (Ohye2010Dual). Mutations in the DUOXA2 gene can lead to insufficient H2O2 production, resulting in thyroid dysfunction and diseases such as congenital hypothyroidism (Ohye2010Dual). DUOXA2's role is specific and cannot be compensated by DUOXA1, indicating its unique importance in the maturation and activation of DUOX2 (Ohye2010Dual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DUOXA2 gene are associated with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), a condition characterized by insufficient thyroid hormone production from birth. DUOXA2 is crucial for the maturation and function of dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), which is necessary for hydrogen peroxide production in the thyroid gland. This hydrogen peroxide is essential for the iodination of thyroglobulin, a key step in thyroid hormone synthesis (Sugisawa2017Homozygous; Zamproni2008Biallelic).

Clinical cases have demonstrated that mutations in DUOXA2 can lead to thyroid dyshormonogenesis, a form of CH. For instance, compound heterozygous mutations in DUOXA2 have been linked to fetal goitrous hypothyroidism, characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (TanaseNakao2018Fetal). Homozygous mutations, such as p.Tyr138*, result in a loss of function, leading to persistent goiter and CH, although phenotypic expression can vary among individuals (Sugisawa2017Homozygous; Jung2020Persistent).

The presence of DUOXA2 mutations can result in partial or complete iodide organification defects, contributing to the development of goiter even when patients maintain a euthyroid status (Jung2020Persistent). These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported (Jung2020Persistent).

## Interactions
DUOXA2 is a chaperone-like protein that plays a critical role in the maturation and surface expression of the DUOX2 enzyme. It forms a stable complex with DUOX2, which is essential for the enzymatic activity of DUOX2. This interaction involves intermolecular disulfide bonds, specifically between the N-terminal cysteine residues 568 and 582 of DUOX2 and cysteine residues 167 and 233 of DUOXA2. These bonds are crucial for the proper function and maturation of DUOX2, facilitating its ER-to-Golgi transition and ensuring that only properly folded proteins are exported from the ER (Targovnik2020Defects).

DUOXA2 does not influence the reduced-to-oxidized transition of DUOX2 but allows for the rapid ER exit of folded DUOX2. It also enhances the degradation of DUOX2 mutants that are not suitable for ER output, thus participating in the quality control system of DUOX2 (Targovnik2020Defects). The interaction between DUOX2 and DUOXA2 is vital for the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is necessary for thyroid hormone biosynthesis (Targovnik2020Defects).
