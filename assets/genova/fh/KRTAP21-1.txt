# KRTAP21-1

## Overview
KRTAP21-1 is a gene located on chromosome 21q22.1 that encodes the keratin-associated protein 21-1, a member of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. This protein is characterized by its high content of glycine and tyrosine, as well as significant amounts of cysteine and serine, which contribute to its structural properties. The keratin-associated protein 21-1 plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of human hair by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments in the hair cortex, thereby influencing hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human). The gene's expression is heterogeneous within the hair follicle, suggesting a specialized role in hair fiber formation (Rogers2006Human). While the clinical significance of KRTAP21-1 is not fully understood, its downregulation has been observed in olaparib-resistant prostate cancer, indicating a potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Cahuzac2022Development). Additionally, its location within a chromosomal inversion associated with neurodevelopmental disorders suggests further areas for research (Drabova2014A).

## Structure
The KRTAP21-1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family, located on chromosome 21q22.1. These proteins are characterized by a high content of glycine (35.4 mol %) and tyrosine (17.7 mol %), along with significant amounts of cysteine and serine (Rogers2006Human). The KRTAP21-1 protein is relatively small, with a molecular weight of approximately 7.9 kDa, and features repetitive dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures throughout the central portions of the molecule. This structural feature is common among high glycine-tyrosine KAPs and contributes to their unique properties (Rogers2006Human).

The primary structure of KRTAP21-1 includes sequences rich in glycine and tyrosine, which are typical for this family of proteins. The secondary structure likely involves repetitive motifs, although specific details on alpha-helices or beta-sheets are not provided. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, facilitated by the high cysteine content, which is a common feature in keratin-associated proteins. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with keratin proteins, forming a matrix that embeds keratin intermediate filaments (Li2019Identification).

## Function
KRTAP21-1 encodes keratin-associated protein 21-1, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of human hair. This protein is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, as well as cysteine and serine, which contribute to its unique structural properties. The protein exhibits repetitive dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures throughout its central portions, which are essential for its function (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP21-1 is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments. This interaction is vital for the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers, influencing hair texture and quality by modulating keratin filament assembly. The protein's high glycine-tyrosine content is indicative of its role in forming a compact and durable hair structure (Rogers2006Human).

The expression of KRTAP21-1, along with other high glycine-tyrosine KAP genes, is not uniform within the hair follicle, exhibiting low to very low and heterogeneous mRNA expression levels. This expression pattern suggests a specialized role in the differentiated regions of the hair follicle, contributing to the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber (Rogers2006Human).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the KRTAP21-1 gene, which encodes a keratin-associated protein involved in hair structure, is not fully understood. However, alterations in its expression have been observed in certain conditions. In the context of olaparib-resistant prostate cancer, KRTAP21-1 was found to be significantly downregulated, suggesting a potential role in the mechanisms of drug resistance (Cahuzac2022Development). This downregulation indicates that KRTAP21-1 may be involved in pathways related to DNA repair, autophagy, and cell cycle regulation, which are critical in the development of resistance to cancer therapies (Cahuzac2022Development).

In a study of a large paracentric inversion on chromosome 21 in the Czech population, the KRTAP21-1 gene was located within a region flanked by duplications. Although the inversion was not directly linked to pathogenic outcomes, it was found in families with children exhibiting intellectual disabilities and autism, suggesting a potential, albeit unclear, contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders when combined with other genetic factors (Drabova2014A). The impact of this inversion on the expression of KRTAP21-1 and its potential clinical implications remain subjects for further research (Drabova2014A).
