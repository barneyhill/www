# SLC5A10

## Overview
The SLC5A10 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 5 member 10 (SGLT5), which is a member of the sodium/glucose cotransporter family. SGLT5 is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the human kidney, where it functions as a sodium-dependent transporter. It plays a critical role in the reabsorption of specific sugars, including 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), mannose, and fructose, from the glomerular filtrate. This transporter is essential for maintaining physiological levels of 1,5-AG in the blood, thereby influencing glucose homeostasis and metabolic processes. The protein's structure includes multiple transmembrane helices, which facilitate its function as an electrogenic transporter with a proposed Na+:glucose coupling ratio of 1:1 (Diederich2023SGLT5; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). Mutations in SLC5A10 can lead to altered transporter activity, impacting conditions such as neutropenia and potentially affecting glucose metabolism (Diederich2023SGLT5; Loomis2019Rare).

## Structure
The SLC5A10 gene encodes the SGLT5 protein, a member of the solute carrier family involved in sodium-dependent sugar transport. The primary structure of SGLT5 includes key residues such as Ser70, Glu71, and Leu75, which are crucial for its substrate specificity, particularly for 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), mannose, and fructose (Diederich2023SGLT5). These residues differ from those in other SGLT family members, contributing to SGLT5's unique transport capabilities.

The secondary structure of SGLT5 likely includes multiple transmembrane helices, as is common in the SLC5 family, which typically features 14 transmembrane helices (Wright2013Glucose). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices, with specific mutations such as Asn96Ile, Arg401His, and Gly471Glu affecting the protein's function by altering interactions between helices (Diederich2023SGLT5).

SGLT5 exists in at least two isoforms, with the shorter isoform being active in transporting 1,5-AG, while the longer isoform is not detectably active (Diederich2023SGLT5). The presence of these isoforms suggests potential differences in functional or structural properties, although detailed quaternary structure information is not provided.

## Function
The SLC5A10 gene encodes the SGLT5 protein, a sodium-dependent transporter primarily active in the human kidney, specifically in the proximal straight tubules. SGLT5 is responsible for the reabsorption of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), mannose, and fructose from the glomerular filtrate. It plays a crucial role in maintaining 1,5-AG levels in the blood by efficiently recapturing it in the S2-S3 segment of the proximal tubule, preventing its excretion in urine (Diederich2023SGLT5; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). 

SGLT5 is electrogenic and sensitive to voltage, with a proposed Na+:glucose coupling ratio of 1:1. In the absence of Na+, H+ can also drive glucose transport, albeit less effectively (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). The transporter has a higher affinity for 1,5-AG compared to mannose and fructose, with specific structural features contributing to its substrate specificity (Diederich2023SGLT5). 

Mutations in SGLT5 can lead to decreased transport activity, resulting in lower blood concentrations of 1,5-AG, which is significant in the context of certain rare forms of neutropenia (Diederich2023SGLT5). The presence of high glucose levels can compete with 1,5-AG for transport by SGLT5, leading to increased urinary excretion of 1,5-AG, particularly in conditions like uncontrolled diabetes (Diederich2023SGLT5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC5A10 gene, which encodes the SGLT5 transporter, have been associated with altered levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) in the blood, impacting conditions such as neutropenia. Specifically, rare loss-of-function mutations in SLC5A10 can lead to significantly reduced transport activity of 1,5-AG, contributing to the pathophysiology of glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD1b) and severe congenital neutropenia type 4 (SCN4) (Diederich2023SGLT5). These conditions are characterized by the accumulation of 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate in neutrophils, which inhibits hexokinase and contributes to neutropenia (Diederich2023SGLT5).

Research has also identified specific mutations, such as Asn96Ile and Gly471Glu, that decrease or abolish the transport efficiency of SGLT5, further linking these genetic variations to lower blood 1,5-AG levels and associated neutropenias (Diederich2023SGLT5). Additionally, genetic studies have found that rare variants in SLC5A10 are significantly associated with serum 1,5-AG levels, suggesting a broader impact on glucose metabolism and potential implications for diabetes management (Loomis2019Rare; Li2017Genomewide).
