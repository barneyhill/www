# HOXD12

## Overview
HOXD12 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D12 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. The homeobox D12 protein plays a pivotal role in the morphogenesis of limbs and axial structures, influencing the formation of skeletal elements such as digits. It is also involved in the development of the terminal part of the digestive tract. The precise regulation of HOXD12 expression is crucial for normal development, as its mis-expression can lead to congenital abnormalities. Additionally, HOXD12 interacts with other proteins, such as the Maf oncoprotein, modulating their transcriptional activities. Mutations in the HOXD12 gene have been associated with developmental disorders, including non-syndromic clubfoot, highlighting its clinical significance in musculoskeletal anomalies (Charng2024Exome; Favier1997Developmental; Hérault1998Genetic).

## Function
HOXD12 is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. In healthy human cells, HOXD12 is primarily involved in the development and patterning of limbs and axial structures. It functions by binding to DNA in the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of target genes essential for proper limb morphogenesis and the formation of skeletal elements such as digits (Favier1997Developmental; Hérault1998Genetic).

The expression of HOXD12 is tightly regulated by specific enhancer elements, such as the RXI regulatory element, which ensures precise spatial and temporal expression patterns during limb development. This regulation is critical, as mis-expression can lead to developmental abnormalities (Hérault1998Genetic). HOXD12, along with other Hox genes, is also involved in the morphogenesis of the terminal part of the digestive tract, contributing to the formation of structures like the internal anal sphincter (Favier1997Developmental).

Overall, HOXD12's role in cell biology is to act as a master regulator, guiding the development of specific body structures by influencing the expression of a network of genes involved in developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXD12 gene have been implicated in the development of non-syndromic clubfoot, a congenital musculoskeletal anomaly characterized by the inward and downward turning of the foot. Exome sequencing of 1190 non-syndromic clubfoot cases identified HOXD12 as a novel disease gene, with rare variants enriched in these cases. These variants were found to segregate with clubfoot in some families, suggesting a highly penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Charng2024Exome). The study identified nine variants in HOXD12 in ten cases, with most being missense mutations and one long non-frameshift indel. These variants are thought to cause disease through dominant negative effects on protein function (Charng2024Exome).

The role of HOXD12 in limb development is supported by studies on Hoxd12 knockout mice, which exhibit multiple limb defects, indicating a potential link between HOXD12 variants and limb abnormalities (Charng2024Exome). The study also highlights the genetic heterogeneity of clubfoot, with rare and predicted deleterious variants in genes like HOXD12 present in only 8.4% of cases, emphasizing the complexity of its genetic basis (Charng2024Exome).

## Interactions
HOXD12 is known to interact with the Maf oncoprotein, a basic-leucine zipper (bZip) type transcriptional activator. This interaction occurs through the homeodomain of HOXD12 and the bZip domain of Maf, inhibiting Maf's DNA binding, transactivation, and transforming activities without affecting HOXD12's own DNA binding capabilities (Kataoka2001A). The interaction is specific to Maf family proteins, as other bZip proteins like c-Jun and c-Fos do not show significant binding with HOXD12 (Kataoka2001A).

HOXD12 can also form a ternary complex with Maf and other bZip proteins, such as Fos, inhibiting their DNA binding activities. This suggests that HOXD12 can interact with heterodimers of Maf and other proteins, modulating their function (Kataoka2001A). The interaction between HOXD12 and Maf is mediated by the leucine zipper structure of Maf, which is crucial for their association (Kataoka2001A). These interactions highlight the role of HOXD12 in modulating the oncogenic and physiological roles of Maf, potentially interfering with its transcriptional activation and transforming activities (Kataoka2001A).
