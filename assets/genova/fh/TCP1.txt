# TCP1

## Overview
The TCP1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), a molecular chaperone complex essential for the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin. The CCT complex is a hetero-oligomeric assembly that functions in the eukaryotic cytosol, facilitating protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. Unlike other chaperonins, CCT operates without a co-chaperonin lid, utilizing a unique apical protrusion to close its cavity (Willison2018The). The TCP1 protein, as part of this complex, plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular structure and function by assisting in the biogenesis of cytoskeletal components, which are crucial for processes like mitosis and cell motility (Sternlicht1993The). Additionally, TCP1's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease states, including cancer (Chen2021TCP1; Tang2020TCP1).

## Structure
The TCP1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), which is involved in the folding of proteins such as actin and tubulin. The CCT complex is a hetero-oligomeric assembly composed of eight different subunits, each approximately 60 kDa in size, sharing about 30% sequence identity (Liang2014TCP1). The primary structure of TCP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures.

The secondary structure of TCP1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional conformation of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with substrates and other proteins. The quaternary structure of the CCT complex involves the assembly of these subunits into a double-ring structure, with each ring containing eight subunits (Liang2014TCP1).

The CCT complex exhibits ATPase activity, which is essential for its function in protein folding. Unlike some other chaperonins, CCT does not require a co-chaperonin lid, instead having an apical protrusion that closes the cavity (Willison2018The). This structural feature is significant for its role in folding specific substrates. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function and interaction of TCP1 with other proteins (Doucey2006Caveolin1).

## Function
The TCP1 gene encodes a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), which is crucial for protein folding in the eukaryotic cytosol. This complex is involved in the folding and assembly of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Kubota1995The; Sternlicht1993The). CCT operates as a hetero-oligomeric ring complex, binding unfolded polypeptides and facilitating their proper folding in an ATP-dependent manner (Frydman1992Function). Unlike other chaperonins, CCT does not require a co-chaperonin like GroES, highlighting its unique mechanism in protein folding (Frydman1992Function).

In healthy human cells, TCP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in the biogenesis of cytoskeletal components, impacting processes such as mitosis, motility, and maintenance of cell shape (Sternlicht1993The). The CCT complex's ability to fold proteins like actin and tubulin is vital for the assembly of structures such as the mitotic spindle, which is crucial for cell division (Sternlicht1993The). The complex's function is enhanced by the presence of ions such as Mg2+, K+, and possibly Ca2+, which are important for its activity (Kubota1995The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TCP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In AML, TCP1 is overexpressed, particularly in drug-resistant cell lines, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased drug resistance. This resistance is mediated through the suppression of autophagy and apoptosis via the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Chen2021TCP1). In HCC, TCP1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poorer survival outcomes. TCP1 influences tumor cell proliferation and migration by regulating the Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling pathway through interactions with the p53 protein (Liu2021Exploring; Tang2020TCP1). In DLBCL, TCP1 expression affects ferroptosis sensitivity differently across subtypes, with high expression linked to poor prognosis in non-GCB subtypes. TCP1 stabilizes ACSL4, promoting ferroptosis in GCB DLBCL, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024TCP1). These findings suggest that TCP1 plays a critical role in cancer progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
The human gene TCP1 (t-complex 1) is a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), which is involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin. TCP1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes.

TCP1 complex proteins have been shown to interact with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (PS-ASOs) in mammalian cells. This interaction is sequence-independent and involves at least 10 PS-modified nucleotides for binding. The interaction is influenced by the hydrophobicity of the modifications, with more hydrophobic modifications like 2'-LNA binding more tightly. TCP1 proteins enhance the antisense activity of PS-ASOs, potentially by assisting in nuclear import or retention in nuclear PS-bodies (Liang2014TCP1).

TCP1 also interacts with caveolin-1, a protein that modulates its protein folding activity. The N-terminal region of caveolin-1 is crucial for this interaction, which affects the folding of actin, particularly in filamin-deficient cells. This interaction is influenced by divalent cations and is involved in cellular signaling pathways (Doucey2006Caveolin1).

In yeast, TCP1 is involved in microtubule-mediated processes, with mutations affecting microtubular structures and sensitivity to drugs like benomyl, suggesting a role in microtubule assembly (Ursic1991The).
