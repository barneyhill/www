# RBIS

## Overview
RBIS is a gene that encodes the ribosomal biogenesis factor, a vertebrate-specific protein involved in the critical process of ribosome assembly. This protein is categorized as a nuclear protein, predominantly localized in the nucleoli, where it plays a significant role in the synthesis and maturation of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. The ribosomal biogenesis factor is particularly associated with pre-60S particles, indicating its specific involvement in the formation of the 60S subunit. However, its function extends to influencing the maturation of both ribosomal subunits, suggesting a broader role in nucleolar ribosome biogenesis. The protein may act as a chaperone for ribosomal RNA or serve as a placeholder for ribosomal proteins, ensuring the balanced production of ribosomal subunits. Its proper function is essential for cellular homeostasis, as disruptions in ribosome synthesis can activate stress response pathways and are implicated in various diseases (Badertscher2015Genomewide).

## Structure


## Function
RBIS, encoded by the gene C8ORF59, is a vertebrate-specific protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the production of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. It is a nuclear protein enriched in the nucleoli, where it is essential for the efficient synthesis and maturation of these subunits (Badertscher2015Genomewide). RBIS is associated with pre-60S particles, indicating a specific involvement in the synthesis of the 60S subunit. Despite this specific interaction, depletion of RBIS affects the maturation of both ribosomal subunits, suggesting its role in a nucleolar step of ribosome biogenesis that impacts both subunits or indirectly through a 60S biogenesis defect (Badertscher2015Genomewide).

RBIS may function as a chaperone for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during its maturation or act as a placeholder for a ribosomal protein, thereby contributing to the balanced synthesis of ribosomal subunits. Its depletion leads to the nucleoplasmic accumulation of ribosomal proteins and trans-acting factors, highlighting its role in the nucleoplasmic maturation or export of ribosomal subunits (Badertscher2015Genomewide). This function is critical for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, as defects in ribosome synthesis are linked to stress response pathways and diseases (Badertscher2015Genomewide).
