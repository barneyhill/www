# REXO2

## Overview
REXO2 is a gene that encodes the protein RNA exonuclease 2, a crucial enzyme involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. This protein is categorized as a ribonuclease and is part of the DEDDh-family of exonucleases, functioning primarily to degrade small RNA oligonucleotides into mononucleotides. RNA exonuclease 2 operates as a homodimer, with its activity being essential for maintaining mitochondrial RNA homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) within the mitochondria (Chu2019Structural; Szewczyk2020Human). The enzyme's structural and functional characteristics are conserved across species, as evidenced by its similarity to bacterial oligoribonucleases (Chu2019Structural). Dysfunction or mutations in the REXO2 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as interferonopathy and have been implicated in familial pheochromocytoma, highlighting its significance in cellular and mitochondrial health (Laitman2020Germline; Idiiatullina2024Heterozygous).

## Structure
The human REXO2 protein, also known as RNA exonuclease 2, is a ribonuclease that primarily functions in the degradation of small RNA oligonucleotides into mononucleotides. Structurally, REXO2 is part of the DEDDh-family of exonucleases and operates as a homodimer, with each protomer contributing to the enzyme's function (Chu2019Structural). The dimeric form is stabilized by conserved hydrophobic residues, including Ser170, Leu175, Trp179, Ile214, and Phe215, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Chu2019Structural).

The active site of REXO2 contains conserved DEDD residues, specifically Asp47, Asp147, Asp199, and Glu49, which coordinate two magnesium ions essential for its catalytic activity. His194 plays a role as a general base, activating a water molecule for the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds (Chu2019Structural). The protein's substrate binding involves π-π stacking interactions with the last two 3'-end nucleobases of RNA or DNA, facilitated by residues Leu53, Trp96, and Tyr164 (Chu2019Structural).

REXO2 shows a preference for degrading nanoRNAs, which are small RNA oligonucleotides, and exhibits higher RNase activity for RNA compared to DNA (Chu2019Structural). The structural similarity between REXO2 and the bacterial enzyme Oligoribonuclease suggests a conserved mechanism across species (Chu2019Structural).

## Function
REXO2, also known as RNA exonuclease 2, is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. It functions as an RNA exonuclease, degrading short single-stranded RNA molecules, which are by-products of mitochondrial RNA processing and decay. This activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in mitochondria, which can be harmful to cellular function (Szewczyk2020Human).

REXO2 operates as a homodimer with two catalytic centers, allowing it to efficiently degrade RNA substrates up to 44 nucleotides in length. It shows a preference for single-stranded RNA and is less effective on adenine-rich sequences (Szewczyk2020Human). The enzyme is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it collaborates with other components of the mitochondrial degradosome, such as PNPase, to maintain RNA homeostasis (Szewczyk2020Human).

The absence or dysfunction of REXO2 leads to the accumulation of non-coding mitochondrial RNAs, including antisense transcripts and novel short RNAs like ncH2, which can interfere with mitochondrial RNA degradation processes (Szewczyk2020Human). This disruption can affect mitochondrial gene expression and overall cellular health, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Szewczyk2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the REXO2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A heterozygous de novo dominant negative mutation, specifically the p.T132A variant, results in a condition known as interferonopathy. This mutation impairs the RNA cleavage ability of REXO2, leading to the accumulation of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) and activation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5. This triggers an innate immune response characterized by elevated levels of type I interferons, IgE, and inflammatory cytokines, along with dermatological symptoms such as skin rash and hyperkeratosis (Idiiatullina2024Heterozygous).

The mutation acts in a dominant negative manner, inhibiting the wild-type REXO2 and disrupting the degradosome-dependent mtRNA decay pathway, which contributes to immune dysregulation and skin inflammation. The inflammatory response is dependent on the MDA5/MAVS pathways, and treatment with JAK inhibitors like Ruxolitinib has shown potential in ameliorating the type I IFN signature in affected individuals (Idiiatullina2024Heterozygous).

Additionally, a germline variant in REXO2 has been identified as a novel candidate gene in familial pheochromocytoma (PCC), a rare neuroendocrine tumor. This variant affects splicing and co-segregates with the PCC phenotype in a family, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Laitman2020Germline).

## Interactions
REXO2, a human mitochondrial exonuclease, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in RNA processing and degradation. REXO2 forms a homodimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, as mutations that disrupt dimerization result in loss of function (Nicholls2019Dinucleotide). This dimerization allows REXO2 to effectively bind and degrade small RNA oligonucleotides, primarily interacting with the last two 3'-end nucleotides through hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions involving residues such as Leu53, Trp96, and Tyr164 (Chu2019Structural).

REXO2 also interacts with the mitochondrial degradosome, a complex involved in RNA degradation, which includes SUV3 and PNPase. REXO2 enhances the degradation efficiency of tRNA-like substrates by the degradosome, indicating its role in preventing impairments in degradosome-mediated RNA decay by scavenging nanoRNAs (Szewczyk2020Human). The presence of catalytically active REXO2 supports the degradation of longer structured substrates by the degradosome, highlighting its cooperative function in maintaining mitochondrial RNA integrity (Szewczyk2020Human). These interactions underscore REXO2's critical role in mitochondrial RNA metabolism and its contribution to cellular homeostasis.
