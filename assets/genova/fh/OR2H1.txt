# OR2H1

## Overview
OR2H1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily H member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Kang2024Influence). Beyond its olfactory function, OR2H1 is expressed in human spermatozoa and testis, suggesting a role in reproductive processes, particularly in sperm chemotaxis, which is the movement of sperm towards the egg in response to chemical signals (Flegel2016Characterization). The receptor's expression is also linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), indicating potential involvement in mate selection through MHC-based sexual selection mechanisms (Kang2024Influence). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of OR2H1's molecular functions and clinical implications remains to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Function
OR2H1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in signal transduction processes. In healthy human cells, OR2H1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a neuronal response that contributes to the perception of smell (Kang2024Influence). 

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2H1 is expressed in human spermatozoa and testis, suggesting a potential function in reproductive processes. The receptor is localized on the head and flagella of sperm cells, indicating a role in sperm chemotaxis, which is the movement of sperm towards the egg in response to chemical signals (Flegel2016Characterization). OR2H1 is also linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which may imply a role in mate selection through MHC-based sexual selection mechanisms (Kang2024Influence). Despite these findings, the specific molecular functions of OR2H1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR2H1 gene, an olfactory receptor, is primarily associated with its role in cancer and reproductive biology. In breast cancer, OR2H1 is differentially hypomethylated at the 5' UTR and promoter site, a modification linked to cancer progression and poor prognosis. This hypomethylation is thought to activate transcription, potentially contributing to carcinogenesis (Fessahaye2021Breast). The gene's expression and localization in human spermatozoa suggest a role in reproductive processes, although the clinical implications of these findings are not fully understood (Flegel2016Characterization).

The presence of both sense and antisense transcripts for OR2H1 in spermatozoa indicates complex regulatory mechanisms, but specific clinical outcomes related to these transcripts have not been detailed (Flegel2016Characterization). While OR2H1 is highly expressed in testis, its expression in other tissues and the potential for chimeric transcripts involving OR genes suggest intricate regulatory interactions that may have broader implications, though these are not yet clearly defined in clinical terms (Flegel2013Expression). Overall, while OR2H1 is implicated in significant biological processes, its direct clinical significance requires further investigation.

## Interactions
OR2H1, a member of the olfactory receptor family, is primarily expressed in human spermatozoa and testis. The protein is localized to specific compartments in sperm, such as the acrosome cap and the caudal part of the sperm head, suggesting a role in sperm function (Flegel2016Characterization). The study by Flegel et al. identified OR2H1 as the most highly expressed MHC-linked OR transcript in spermatozoa, with antisense transcripts also detected, indicating complex regulation of its expression (Flegel2016Characterization).

OR2H1 is activated by the odorant methional, which induces calcium (Ca2+) signals in human spermatozoa. These signals are crucial for sperm physiological processes and depend on extracellular calcium. The use of calcium channel blockers like mibefradil significantly reduces these odorant-induced Ca2+ signals, suggesting the involvement of specific calcium channels in the process (Flegel2016Characterization). This indicates that OR2H1 may interact with calcium channels to mediate its function in sperm.

In the context of cancer, OR2H1 has been associated with hypomethylation in breast cancer samples, which may influence its expression and interactions with other genes and pathways involved in carcinogenesis (Fessahaye2021Breast). However, specific protein interactions involving OR2H1 in cancer or other tissues have not been detailed in the available literature.
