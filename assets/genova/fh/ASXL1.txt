# ASXL1

## Overview
The ASXL1 gene encodes the ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 protein, which is a critical component in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the modulation of histone methylation, playing a pivotal role in maintaining both repressive and active chromatin states. ASXL1 is part of the Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins, which are essential for developmental processes and cellular differentiation. The protein interacts with various complexes, including the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the cohesin complex, to regulate gene expression and ensure proper chromatid separation during cell division. Mutations in the ASXL1 gene are associated with several hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and are linked to poor prognosis (Asada2019The; Medina2022ASXL1/2).

## Structure
The ASXL1 protein is characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It contains an ASXN domain at the N-terminus, which is structurally similar to the Forkhead-box (FOX) domain and is involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair (Katoh2013Functional). The ASXH domain, also known as the ASXM domain, is located in the adjoining region and serves as a protein-protein interaction module, binding to proteins such as BAP1 and KDM1A (Medina2022ASXL1/2; Katoh2013Functional).

In the middle region, ASXL1 features ASXM1 and ASXM2 domains, which are involved in interactions with nuclear hormone receptors (Medina2022ASXL1/2). The C-terminal region of ASXL1 includes a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a histone or DNA-binding module, although its specific targets in ASXL family members are not yet identified (Fisher2006Characterization; Katoh2013Functional).

ASXL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which may affect its function (Fisher2006Characterization). The protein is also subject to various genetic alterations, including truncation mutations, which are associated with several types of cancer (Katoh2013Functional). Splice variants of ASXL1 can lead to different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Dinan2017ASXL).

## Function
The ASXL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. ASXL1 functions as part of the Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins, which are essential for regulating development and differentiation by modulating histone methylation. This regulation maintains repressive and active chromatin states, preserving epigenetic memory and ensuring the expression patterns of cell lineage-defining genes during cell division and replication (Medina2022ASXL1/2).

ASXL1 interacts with the cohesin complex, which is crucial for maintaining chromatid separation and gene expression necessary for normal hematopoiesis. This interaction is vital for preventing premature chromatid separation and ensuring proper chromatid disjunction during cell division (Li2017ASXL1). ASXL1 also forms a Polycomb-repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex with BAP1, involved in removing monoubiquitination of histone H2A, and interacts with components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to repress target genes by inducing the histone repressive mark H3K27me3 (Asada2019The).

In addition, ASXL1 acts as a coactivator for the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in a ligand-dependent manner, enhancing RA-induced transactivation of RAR in certain cell types (Cho2006Additional). These functions highlight ASXL1's role as a scaffold for controlling histone modifications and gene expression, impacting processes like cell differentiation and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASXL1 gene are implicated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly myeloid neoplasms. These mutations are frequently found in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (Alvarez2017ASXL1mutations; Asada2019The). ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor prognosis, including lower remission rates and shorter survival in AML, especially in older males and those with secondary AML (Alvarez2017ASXL1mutations). In CMML, these mutations are linked to higher leukemic transformation risk and inferior overall survival (Alvarez2017ASXL1mutations; Zhang2015The).

ASXL1 mutations often result in frameshift mutations leading to truncated proteins, which disrupt normal histone modification processes and contribute to myeloid transformation (Chen2014Dynamics; Zhang2015The). These mutations are frequently found alongside other genetic alterations, such as mutations in TET2, IDH2, and RUNX1, which can influence prognosis and treatment response (Asada2019The; Chen2014Dynamics). The presence of ASXL1 mutations in clonal hematopoiesis is also an independent risk factor for the progression of myeloid malignancies (Asada2019The).

## Interactions
The ASXL1 protein is involved in numerous interactions with other proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. ASXL1 forms a Polycomb-repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex with BAP1, which is responsible for removing monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119, a process crucial for gene repression (Asada2019The; GelsiBoyer2012Mutations). It also interacts with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), including EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, to induce the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, thereby repressing target genes such as the HOXA cluster (Medina2022ASXL1/2; Zhang2020The).

ASXL1 is known to interact with the cohesin complex, which includes proteins like SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21. This interaction is essential for maintaining chromatid separation and regulating gene expression in hematopoietic cells (Li2017ASXL1; Medina2022ASXL1/2). ASXL1 also associates with the RNA polymerase II complex, influencing transcriptional activity (Asada2019The).

Additionally, ASXL1 interacts with nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) and the NHR-coactivator NCOA1, promoting NHR-dependent transcriptional activation (Katoh2013Functional). It also binds to non-histone proteins such as AKT1, affecting cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence (Asada2019The). These interactions underscore ASXL1's role as a scaffold protein in controlling histone modifications and gene expression.
