# CDS1

## Overview
CDS1, or CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme integral to lipid metabolism, specifically involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids. The enzyme, CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1, is a transmembrane protein predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to CDP-diacylglycerol. This reaction is a critical step in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol, which are essential components of cellular membranes and signaling pathways (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol; Mercadé2007Characterization). The protein's structure includes seven transmembrane domains and a conserved phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase signature motif, indicating its role in CTP transfer (Mercadé2007Characterization). CDS1 is involved in various cellular processes, including adipocyte differentiation and the regulation of lipid droplet formation, and its activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and transcription factors (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol; Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). Alterations in CDS1 expression have been linked to metabolic disorders and diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol; Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

## Structure
The human CDS1 protein is an integral membrane protein involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, specifically in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin. The protein is 461 amino acids long and is predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains, which are conserved across species such as humans, mice, rats, and pigs (Mercadé2007Characterization; Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). These transmembrane domains suggest that CDS1 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, including the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER tubules (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

The protein sequence of CDS1 includes a conserved sequence element belonging to the phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase signature motif, which is involved in CTP transfer (Mercadé2007Characterization). Post-translational modifications of CDS1 include phosphorylation at Ser37 and ubiquitylation at Lys270, which are conserved across species (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). These modifications may play a role in the regulation of its enzymatic activity and interactions.

CDS1 can form homodimers and potentially heterodimers with CDS2, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its function in lipid biosynthesis (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). The protein does not exhibit particular substrate selectivity, utilizing various phosphatidic acid species (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

## Function
CDS1 (CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). This reaction is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which are crucial components of cellular membranes and signaling pathways (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol). CDS1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, where it contributes to the production of phospholipids necessary for maintaining membrane integrity and function (Mercadé2007Characterization).

In the context of adipocyte differentiation, CDS1 is vital for the regulation of lipid droplet expansion and adipogenesis. It modulates the levels of PA, which in turn affects the activity of PPARγ, a key regulator of adipocyte development. The enzyme's activity influences the size and number of lipid droplets by altering PA levels, thereby impacting lipid storage and energy metabolism (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol). The regulation of PA levels by CDS1 is also linked to the unfolded protein response, suggesting a role in managing ER stress during adipocyte differentiation (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CDS1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cardiac myocytes, CDS1 is upregulated in response to hypertrophic stimuli, such as angiotensin II and vasopressin, which activate phospholipase C signaling. This upregulation is linked to cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that changes in CDS1 expression could contribute to heart disease (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). In tumor cells, CDS1 is associated with cFos and Fra-1, transcription factors of the AP-1 family, to support membrane biogenesis, indicating a role in tumor growth (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

Alterations in CDS1 expression also impact lipid metabolism and cellular structure. Knockdown of CDS1 leads to increased phosphatidic acid levels, resulting in the formation of super-sized lipid droplets and affecting adipocyte differentiation. This suggests a potential link to metabolic disorders such as obesity and hepatic steatosis (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol; Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). Additionally, CDS1 expression is regulated by p53 and SIRT6, with implications for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer through changes in lipid metabolism and phosphatidylinositol synthesis (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDS1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1 (CDS1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid metabolism. CDS1 interacts with AGPAT2, forming complexes that facilitate the flux of phosphatidic acid (PA) into the CDP-DAG pathway. This interaction is essential for maintaining CDS activity, as AGPAT2 deficiency leads to reduced CDS activity and impaired lipid droplet formation (Mak2021AGPAT2).

CDS1 is also regulated by transcription factors such as cFos, which binds directly to CDS1 at the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing its activity. This interaction is significant in lipid synthesis, particularly in tumor cells where cFos and Fra-1 promote phospholipid synthesis by associating with CDS1 (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

Additionally, CDS1 is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet growth through its interaction with CIDE proteins, particularly CIDEC. This interaction may be linked to mitochondrial changes, as CDS1 is possibly present on mitochondria, influencing lipid droplet morphology and growth (Xu2019CDPDAG). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CDS1 in cellular lipid metabolism and its potential implications in metabolic disorders.
