# CNN2

## Overview
The CNN2 gene encodes calponin 2, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Calponin 2 is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is involved in modulating muscle tension and cell motility by stabilizing actin filaments and inhibiting actin-activated myosin ATPase activity (Liu2016Calponin). It is expressed in a variety of cell types, including smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, and is essential for processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion (Liu2016Calponin). Calponin 2 also plays a significant role in vascular development and immune responses, particularly through its involvement in the MAPK signaling pathway and its regulation of macrophage motility and phagocytosis (Tang2006A; Huang2008Role). The protein's interactions with other cytoskeletal components and signaling molecules underscore its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function across various physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
Calponin 2 (CNN2) is a protein encoded by the CNN2 gene, characterized by a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which is approximately 100 amino acids long. This domain is involved in binding to extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and plays a role in ERK signaling cascades, although it does not bind F-actin directly (Liu2016Calponin; Hsieh2023Evolution). The primary structure of calponin 2 includes two actin-binding sites located in the middle region of the protein, specifically residues 144-162 and 171-188, which are conserved across calponin isoforms (Liu2016Calponin). These sites are crucial for its regulatory function, as they can inhibit and reverse actomyosin MgATPase activity (Liu2016Calponin).

Calponin 2 also contains three calponin-like (CLIK) repeating motifs and a variable C-terminal region, which contributes to the structural differences among calponin isoforms (Hsieh2023Evolution). The C-terminal segment influences the protein's binding affinity to F-actin, with calponin 2 having the lowest affinity among the isoforms (Liu2016Calponin). A unique feature of calponin 2 is a potentially phosphorylatable serine at position 177, which may play a role in its regulatory functions (Liu2016Calponin; Hsieh2023Evolution).

## Function
Calponin 2 (CNN2) is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. It is involved in stabilizing actin filaments and inhibiting actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, which modulates muscle tension and cell motility (Liu2016Calponin). In endothelial cells, calponin 2 enhances cell migration and is crucial for vascular development, as it influences the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly by increasing ERK phosphorylation (Tang2006A). 

Calponin 2 is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and myeloid lineage cells, where it regulates cell proliferation, motility, and adhesion (Liu2016Calponin). In macrophages, calponin 2 is involved in controlling motility and phagocytosis, contributing to immune responses (Huang2008Role). The expression of CNN2 is influenced by mechanical tension, with higher expression levels in cells cultured on hard substrates, suggesting a role in mechanotransduction (Liu2016Calponin). Overall, calponin 2 is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function through its regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CNN2 gene, which encodes calponin 2, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased levels of CNN2 are associated with kidney fibrosis. Studies have shown that CNN2 expression is elevated in fibrotic kidneys and correlates with fibrosis markers, suggesting its role in promoting fibrotic processes through metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation (Gui2023Calponin). 

In the context of inflammatory diseases, calponin 2 influences macrophage function. Its deletion has been shown to limit pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages, which can attenuate disease progression in conditions like atherosclerosis and arthritis (Liu2016Calponin; Plazyo2019Downregulation). 

Calponin 2 also plays a role in the development of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Its upregulation is linked to myofibroblast differentiation, a key process in CAVD pathogenesis. Deletion of CNN2 in mouse models significantly reduces aortic valve calcification, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Plazyo2018Deletion).

In cancer, reduced calponin 2 expression is associated with increased proliferation and migration in metastatic cells, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Liu2016Calponin).

## Interactions
Calponin 2 (CNN2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions. It interacts with actin filaments, stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and regulating cellular activities such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Liu2016Calponin; Hsieh2023Evolution). CNN2 also binds to tropomyosin and myosin, contributing to the regulation of actin-myosin interactions and cytoskeletal organization (Liu2016Calponin; Hossain2005h2calponin). 

In the context of kidney fibrosis, CNN2 interacts with estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2), which binds to the promoter of the PPARα gene, enhancing the transcription of fatty acid oxidation genes. This interaction is significant in regulating metabolic pathways associated with fibrosis (Gui2023Calponin). 

CNN2 is also implicated in the MAPK signaling pathway, where it influences ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a role as an activator of MAPK. This interaction affects endothelial cell migration and vascular development (Tang2006A). 

These interactions highlight CNN2's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways, impacting various physiological and pathological processes.
