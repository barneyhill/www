# PRPS2

## Overview
PRPS2, or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2, is a gene that encodes an enzyme critical for nucleotide metabolism. The enzyme, categorized as a synthetase, catalyzes the conversion of ATP and ribose-5-phosphate into phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), a precursor in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. These nucleotides are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, making PRPS2 particularly important in rapidly proliferating cells (Lu2023Structural; Nosal1993Overexpression). The PRPS2 protein forms hexameric structures that are crucial for its enzymatic activity, and its function is regulated by interactions with ADP and other molecules (Lu2023Structural). PRPS2 is expressed in various tissues and plays a role in maintaining nucleotide pools necessary for DNA repair and cellular proliferation (Liu2021Innate). Its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, where it contributes to tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Miao2019Targeted; Ugbogu2022Contribution).

## Structure
The human PRPS2 protein is characterized by its ability to form filamentous structures composed of hexamers with D3 symmetry. These hexamers are connected through three interaction sites involving specific amino acids, including R301, E298, R302, N305, and E307, which form a network of interactions such as salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces. Mutations at R301 and R302 result in the loss of filament-forming ability and enzyme activity, indicating the importance of these residues in the structural integrity and function of PRPS2 (Lu2023Structural).

PRPS2 has two isoforms: hPRPS2-long and hPRPS2-short, with the long isoform having an insertion after residue K102. The regulatory flexible (RF) loop, located between the active and allosteric sites, is highly conserved across species and plays a crucial role in ligand binding and filament formation. A mutation at K99 affects enzyme activity and ADP inhibition, highlighting the RF loop's significance in PRPS2's function (Lu2023Structural).

The protein's quaternary structure involves the formation of hexamers that stack into polymers in the presence of the inhibitor ADP. This polymerization is crucial for its catalytic activity, and disruption of inter-hexamer interactions reduces this activity (Lu2023Structural).

## Function
PRPS2 (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the formation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) from ATP and ribose-5-phosphate. This reaction is essential for the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA (Lu2023Structural; Nosal1993Overexpression). PRPS2 is expressed in most tissues and is particularly important in rapidly proliferating cells due to its kinetic properties, which include a lower sensitivity to feedback inhibition by purine nucleotides compared to its isozyme PRPS1 (Nosal1993Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, PRPS2 is involved in maintaining nucleotide pools necessary for DNA repair processes, such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, especially under conditions of DNA damage (Liu2021Innate). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of nucleotide synthesis and supports cellular proliferation and genomic stability (Lu2023Structural). PRPS2's activity is regulated by various factors, including allosteric inhibition by ADP and competitive inhibition by inorganic phosphate, which modulate its function in response to cellular needs (Lu2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
PRPS2 is implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), where its upregulation is associated with metastasis. Studies have shown that PRPS2 expression is significantly higher in metastatic CRC cells compared to primary cells, enhancing their migratory and invasive abilities. This upregulation is linked to the MYC proto-oncogene, which induces PRPS2 expression, promoting cancer progression through purine metabolism and regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity (Miao2019Targeted).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), PRPS2 mutations such as c.400G > A (p.A134T) and c.523G > A (p.A175T) have been identified in therapy-resistant cases, contributing to drug resistance by favoring de novo nucleotide synthesis (Delos2020PRPSAssociated; Ugbogu2022Contribution). PRPS2 is also involved in prostate cancer, where its knockdown suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor survival and proliferation (Ugbogu2022Contribution).

PRPS2's interaction with the c-Myc oncogene is crucial for metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, leading to increased proliferation. Negative PRPS2/p-mTOR staining is associated with longer survival times, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic target (Ugbogu2022Contribution). Additionally, PRPS2 may serve as a biomarker for male infertility and Myc-driven cancers (Ugbogu2022Contribution).

## Interactions
PRPS2, or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in nucleotide biosynthesis. The enzyme forms hexameric structures with D3 symmetry, which are essential for its activity. These hexamers interact through specific residues, including R301, E298, R302, N305, and E307, forming salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces. Mutations at R301 and R302 disrupt these interactions, leading to a loss of filament-forming ability and reduced enzyme activity, highlighting the importance of these interactions for PRPS2 function (Lu2023Structural).

PRPS2 also interacts with ADP, which binds at both the ATP binding site and the allosteric site, influencing enzyme activity through competitive and allosteric inhibition. This interaction is mediated by the regulatory flexible loop, particularly residue K99, which affects ATP's conformational change necessary for catalysis (Lu2023Structural).

Arginylation, a post-translational modification, enhances the stability and activity of PRPS2 by making it more resistant to degradation. This modification is not observed in PRPS1, indicating a selective regulatory mechanism that affects PRPS2's interactions and stability (Zhang2015Arginylation).
