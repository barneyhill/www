# TSPAN14

## Overview
TSPAN14 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 14, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 14 is part of the TspanC8 subgroup, which is distinguished by having eight cysteine residues in its large extracellular loop, a structural feature crucial for its function (SaintPol2017Regulation; Haining2012The). This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of ADAM10, a transmembrane metalloprotease, by promoting its maturation and cell surface expression, which is essential for various cellular processes, including Notch signaling and ectodomain shedding (Noy2016TspanC8; Dornier2012TspanC8). Tetraspanin 14 is particularly important in endothelial cells and platelets, where it helps modulate the cleavage of substrates like the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, potentially influencing platelet function and arterial thrombosis (Noy2016TspanC8). Alterations in TSPAN14 expression have been linked to the progression of non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a marker for cancer invasiveness and prognosis (Jovanović2022Decreased).

## Function
TSPAN14 is a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease. TSPAN14 interacts with ADAM10 through its large extracellular loop, which is essential for promoting ADAM10's maturation and cell surface expression in healthy human cells (Noy2016TspanC8; Haining2012The). This interaction is significant for various cellular processes, including the modulation of Notch signaling pathways, which are important for cell communication and development (Dornier2012TspanC8).

TSPAN14 is particularly important in endothelial cells and platelets, where it helps regulate the cleavage of substrates like the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, potentially protecting it from ADAM10-mediated cleavage (Noy2016TspanC8). This protective role is crucial for maintaining platelet function and could have implications for arterial thrombosis treatment. TSPAN14 also influences the trafficking of ADAM10 by promoting its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and increasing its expression at the plasma membrane, which is vital for its function in ectodomain shedding and Notch receptor activation (Dornier2012TspanC8; SaintPol2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TSPAN14 gene have been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Studies have shown that TSPAN14 expression is significantly decreased in NSCLC tumor samples compared to normal lung tissue, with this reduction being associated with poorer survival rates in patients. Specifically, low TSPAN14 expression correlates with a median survival time of 7 months, compared to 15.5 months for those with normal expression levels (Jovanović2022Decreased). This decreased expression is also linked to more aggressive tumor characteristics, such as pleural invasion, where 66.6% of patients with pleural invasion exhibited reduced TSPAN14 expression (Jovanović2022Decreased).

In NSCLC cell lines, lower TSPAN14 expression is associated with increased metastatic potential, as evidenced by enhanced gelatin degradation and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which are involved in extracellular matrix degradation (Jovanović2022Decreased). These findings suggest that TSPAN14 may play a role in regulating the invasive potential of cancer cells, making it a potential marker for NSCLC invasiveness and poor prognosis (Jovanović2022Decreased).

## Interactions
TSPAN14, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, interacts with ADAM10, a transmembrane metalloprotease involved in various biological processes. This interaction is crucial for the maturation and cell surface expression of ADAM10. TSPAN14, along with other TspanC8 tetraspanins such as Tspan15 and Tspan33, regulates ADAM10's exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and its trafficking to the cell surface (Dornier2012TspanC8; Haining2012The). 

The interaction between TSPAN14 and ADAM10 occurs through the large extracellular loop (LEL) of TSPAN14, which is necessary for promoting ADAM10's maturation and surface expression. This interaction is independent of palmitoylation, as demonstrated by experiments with palmitoylation mutants of TSPAN14, which still retained their ability to regulate ADAM10 (Noy2016TspanC8; Haining2012The). 

TSPAN14 also influences ADAM10 substrate specificity. It has been shown to reduce the cleavage of the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, suggesting a protective role in megakaryocytes and platelets. This modulation of ADAM10 activity by TSPAN14 may have implications for platelet function and potential therapeutic applications (Noy2016TspanC8).
