# PILRA

## Overview
The PILRA gene encodes the paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha, a transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, where it plays a critical role in modulating immune responses. The PILRA protein features an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain that facilitates interactions with sialylated ligands, triggering inhibitory signaling pathways that regulate inflammatory responses and cytokine production. Structurally, PILRA is characterized by a V-set Ig-like β-sandwich fold, and it can form homodimers, which are essential for its function in immune recognition and regulation. The gene and its protein product are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammatory diseases, viral infections, and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Kuroki2014Structural; Sun2012Evolutionarily; Sun2014PILRα).

## Structure
The PILRA protein is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and features an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain. It is primarily composed of one Ig-like domain, which adopts a V-set Ig-like β-sandwich fold. This structural motif is similar to that found in the Siglec family, despite low sequence similarity (Kuroki2014Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are crucial for its function in immune recognition (Sun2012Evolutionarily). 

PILRA can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and may have splice variant isoforms that affect its function (Sun2012Evolutionarily). The protein's structure allows it to interact with sialylated ligands, involving key residues like Arg-126, which is conserved across species and essential for ligand binding (Sun2012Evolutionarily). The binding mechanism involves both sugar and peptide components, with the protein undergoing significant conformational changes to accommodate these ligands (Kuroki2014Structural). 

The structural analysis of PILRA provides insights into its role in immune regulation, particularly in recognizing O-glycosylated mucin proteins and facilitating interactions with various ligands (Kuroki2014Structural).

## Function
PILRA (paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha) is an inhibitory receptor predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by interacting with various sialylated ligands through a conserved domain. This interaction is essential for its function, as it triggers an inhibitory signaling cascade involving the recruitment of phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which leads to reduced intracellular calcium mobilization (Sun2012Evolutionarily).

PILRA is involved in regulating inflammatory responses by controlling cytokine and chemokine production. It acts as a negative regulator of inflammation, particularly in myeloid cells, by modulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a, as well as chemokines like MCP-1 (Sun2014PILRα). In the context of inflammatory arthritis, PILRA expression is correlated with monocyte and neutrophil gene signatures, suggesting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis by keeping inflammatory cells in check (Sun2014PILRα).

PILRA also regulates monocyte infiltration into tissues, impacting tissue homeostasis and the pathology of metabolic diseases. It controls monocyte mobility by regulating integrin signaling and inhibiting CD99-CD99 binding, which is crucial for preventing excessive monocyte and macrophage activity in conditions like obesity and liver fibrosis (Kohyama2016Monocyte).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PILRA gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various cancers. In Alzheimer's disease, the PILRA G78R variant is associated with altered ligand binding, which may confer protection against the disease. This variant reduces the binding of PILRA to ligands such as complement component 4A and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein B, potentially decreasing inhibitory signaling in microglia and reducing susceptibility to HSV-1 infection, which is linked to AD pathogenesis (Agostini2019The; Rathore2018Paired). The PILRA SNP rs2405442 has also been associated with Alzheimer's, suggesting a role in immune system interactions related to the disease (Patel2018Whole‐exome).

In cancer, PILRA expression and mutations are significant. The gene is frequently altered in various cancers, with the highest alteration frequency in esophageal adenocarcinoma. PILRA alterations are associated with prognosis, showing better outcomes in some cancers like lung adenocarcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma, but poorer outcomes in others such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer. PILRA expression is linked to tumor immune infiltration and is considered a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and immunotherapy (Li2023Comprehensive).

## Interactions
PILRA, a paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in immune regulation. It is known to interact with several ligands, including CD99, PILR-associating neural protein (PANP), and Herpes simplex virus-1 glycoprotein B (HSV-1 gB). These interactions are crucial for modulating immune cell functions and facilitating viral entry into host cells (Sun2012Evolutionarily; Satoh2008PILRα).

PILRA's interaction with HSV-1 gB is particularly noteworthy, as it acts as a coreceptor for the virus, aiding in its entry into cells. This interaction is essential for the infection process, and blocking PILRA with specific antibodies can inhibit HSV-1 infection (Satoh2008PILRα). The binding of PILRA to HSV-1 gB is specific, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses, which confirmed that PILRA-Ig precipitates gB from infected cells (Satoh2008PILRα).

PILRA also interacts with novel ligands such as neuronal differentiation and proliferation factor-1 (NPDC1) and collectin-12 (COLEC12). These interactions are mediated by a conserved domain in PILRA and involve sialylated protein domains in the ligands, highlighting the complexity of its ligand recognition mechanism (Sun2012Evolutionarily).
