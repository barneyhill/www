# TMEM114

## Overview
TMEM114 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 114, a glycosylated protein belonging to the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family, which is characterized by its four transmembrane domains. This protein is primarily involved in the development and function of the human eye, particularly in the lens, where it plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and intercellular junctions (Jamieson2007Characterization; Maher2011The). TMEM114 is expressed in lens epithelial cells and the transitional zone, indicating its importance in lens differentiation and maintenance (Jamieson2007Characterization). The gene's disruption, such as through chromosomal translocation, is associated with congenital cataracts, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining lens transparency and function (Mihelec2008Chromosomal; Jamieson2007Characterization).

## Structure
The TMEM114 protein is a glycosylated transmembrane protein with a predicted molecular mass of 24 kDa. It is composed of 223 amino acids and is predicted to have four transmembrane domains, a characteristic feature of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family (Jamieson2007Characterization; Maher2011The). The protein contains conserved N-glycosylation sites at residues p.N54 and p.N88, which are essential for its localization to the plasma membrane. Glycosylation at these sites is confirmed by the appearance of TMEM114 as a series of bands with a higher molecular mass on a western blot, which resolves to a single band of 24 kDa upon treatment with the de-glycosylating enzyme PNGase F (Maher2011The).

TMEM114 does not contain a PDZ binding domain, which may explain its lack of co-localization with the tight junction marker ZO-1 (Maher2011The). The protein is more closely related to the voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma subunits (CACNGs) than to claudins, and it branches between TARPs and calcium channel modulating CACNGs in a phylogenetic tree (Maher2011The). The strong evolutionary conservation of TMEM114 across several species suggests its functional significance (Jamieson2007Characterization).

## Function
TMEM114 is a glycosylated transmembrane protein involved in the development and function of the human eye, particularly in the lens. It is part of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family, which includes proteins that play roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and intercellular junctions (Jamieson2007Characterization). TMEM114 is expressed in the lens epithelial cells and the transitional zone where early fiber differentiation occurs, suggesting its role in lens differentiation and maintenance (Jamieson2007Characterization). The protein is predicted to have four transmembrane domains and is N-glycosylated at specific sites, which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane (Maher2011The).

TMEM114's glycosylation is necessary for its proper localization in cells, and its expression is detected in the developing human eye and central nervous system at specific developmental stages (Maher2011The). The gene's disruption due to chromosomal translocation is associated with congenital cataracts, indicating its importance in maintaining lens transparency and function (Jamieson2007Characterization). Although the exact molecular function of TMEM114 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in eye development and lens maintenance is evident from its expression patterns and associated genetic studies (Jamieson2007Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM114 gene are associated with congenital cataracts, particularly lamellar cataracts. A balanced chromosomal translocation t(16;22)(p13.3;q22.1) has been identified in families with congenital lamellar cataracts, which disrupts the 5' promoter region of TMEM114, leading to its dysregulation (Mihelec2008Chromosomal; Jamieson2007Characterization). This disruption suggests that changes in TMEM114 expression or mutations may contribute to cataract formation (Mihelec2008Chromosomal).

Specific mutations in TMEM114, such as the missense alterations I35T and F106L, have been identified in patients with congenital cataracts. These mutations occur in conserved residues of the protein, indicating their potential significance in cataractogenesis. However, these mutations were also found in some unaffected relatives, suggesting possible reduced penetrance or the presence of rare normal variants (Jamieson2007Characterization).

TMEM114 is expressed in the lens epithelium and at the lens equator, areas critical for lens cell differentiation. Its expression pattern and homology to the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 protein family, which includes proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, suggest a role in lens development and cataract formation (Jamieson2007Characterization).
