# ELOF1

## Overview
ELOF1 is a gene that encodes the elongation factor 1 protein, a critical component in the transcription elongation process and DNA repair mechanisms. The protein is categorized as a transcription elongation factor and plays a pivotal role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), which is essential for maintaining genome stability. ELOF1 interacts with RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and is involved in the ubiquitylation of RNAPII, facilitating the recruitment of repair factors to sites of DNA damage. This interaction is crucial for the recovery of RNA synthesis following DNA damage, particularly UV-induced damage, and for preventing transcription-replication conflicts that can lead to chromosomal aberrations. Additionally, ELOF1 is involved in immune processes such as somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR), which are vital for antibody diversity (Wu2024Transcription; Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1).

## Structure
ELOF1 is a small, evolutionarily conserved protein consisting of 83 amino acids. Its molecular structure includes three distinct domains: a positively charged N-terminus, a zinc-finger domain, and a C-terminal acidic tail. The zinc-finger domain is crucial for its function, particularly in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and survival upon UV-induced DNA damage (Wu2024Transcription; Geijer2021Elongation).

The N-terminal region of ELOF1 interacts with incoming DNA, while the zinc-finger domain facilitates binding to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). This interaction is essential for ELOF1's role in transcription elongation and DNA repair processes. The C-terminal acidic tail, although absent in metazoan orthologues, is involved in interactions with RNAPII, which are crucial for ELOF1's function in somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) (Wu2024Transcription; van2021ELOF1).

ELOF1 is involved in the ubiquitylation of RNAPII, a post-translational modification critical for transcription-coupled DNA repair. This modification occurs at lysine K1268, facilitating the recruitment of repair factors to DNA damage sites (Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1). The protein's interaction with RNAPII is constitutive and not affected by UV irradiation, indicating a stable association necessary for its function (van2021ELOF1).

## Function
ELOF1 is a crucial elongation factor involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and maintaining genome stability in human cells. It is an integral component of the elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex, where it aids in transcription elongation and the transcription stress response, particularly following DNA damage (Geijer2021Elongation). ELOF1 facilitates the proper ubiquitylation of Pol II, a critical step for recruiting repair factors such as UVSSA and TFIIH to lesion-stalled Pol II, promoting the assembly of the incision complex necessary for excising transcription-blocking lesions and resuming transcription (Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1).

ELOF1 is essential for the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV-induced DNA damage, as it helps maintain transcription at the distal ends of long genes and prevents transcription-replication conflicts that can lead to genome instability (Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1). In the absence of ELOF1, cells exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage, prolonged transcription blocks, and a higher incidence of chromosomal aberrations, underscoring its vital role in genomic stability and cellular response to DNA damage (Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ELOF1 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to genome stability and immune function. ELOF1 is crucial for transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) and the prevention of genome instability. Its absence or dysfunction can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA damage, such as UV irradiation, due to impaired repair mechanisms (Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1). This sensitivity is linked to defects in the ubiquitylation of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for recruiting repair factors to sites of DNA damage (van2021ELOF1).

In the immune system, ELOF1 is vital for processes like somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR), which are necessary for antibody diversity. Disruption of ELOF1 affects the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), leading to compromised SHM and CSR. This can impact immune function and potentially contribute to oncogenesis by affecting AID activity at off-target sites (Wu2024Transcription).

Overall, ELOF1's role in maintaining transcriptional integrity and facilitating DNA repair highlights its importance in preventing diseases related to genome instability, such as cancer, and in ensuring proper immune responses.

## Interactions
ELOF1 is a transcription elongation factor that interacts with RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and is involved in several critical cellular processes. It is a part of the elongating RNAPII complex, interacting specifically with the RPB1 and RPB3 subunits, and plays a role in transcription elongation (Geijer2021Elongation). ELOF1's interaction with RNAPII is crucial for its function in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), where it facilitates the recruitment of repair factors such as UVSSA and TFIIH to lesion-stalled RNAPII (Geijer2021Elongation; van2021ELOF1).

ELOF1 also interacts with the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and is essential for processes like somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). This interaction is mediated by ELOF1's C-terminal acidic tail, which is necessary for its function in these processes (Wu2024Transcription). The interaction between ELOF1 and RNAPII does not change upon UV-induced DNA damage, indicating a stable association (Geijer2021Elongation).

ELOF1 is also involved in the ubiquitylation of RNAPII, particularly at the lysine K1268 site, which is essential for the recruitment of the TFIIH complex and the proper functioning of the transcription-coupled repair pathway (van2021ELOF1). This ubiquitylation process is crucial for the assembly of downstream repair factors and the prevention of transcription-replication conflicts (Geijer2021Elongation).
