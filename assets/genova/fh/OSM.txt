# OSM

## Overview
Oncostatin M (OSM) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein oncostatin M, which is a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family. This cytokine is characterized by its four-helix bundle structure, a common feature among IL-6 family members, and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including inflammation, hematopoiesis, and bone metabolism (AdrianSegarra2018Thea; Chollangi2012A). Oncostatin M exerts its effects by interacting with specific receptor complexes, primarily the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) in conjunction with glycoprotein 130 (gp130), which distinguishes it from other cytokines in its family (AdrianSegarra2018Thea). The protein plays a significant role in pathological conditions, such as cancer and inflammatory diseases, where it influences processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell phenotype, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wolf2023The; West2017Oncostatin).

## Structure
Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family, characterized by a polypeptide chain of 196 amino acids. Its secondary structure includes a four-helix bundle, a common feature among cytokines in this family (AdrianSegarra2018Thea; Chollangi2012A). This structure is stabilized by loops connecting the helices, with the BC loop being particularly notable for its role in receptor binding (Chollangi2012A). The BC loop, located between the B and C helices, is unique to OSM and influences its interaction with receptors such as the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) (Chollangi2012A).

OSM can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which is typical for cytokines (Chollangi2012A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function (Chollangi2012A). Specific amino acid residues within the AB loop and D-helix are crucial for receptor activation, with mutations in these regions affecting the protein's ability to activate OSMR and LIFR (AdrianSegarra2018Thea). These structural features contribute to OSM's unique signaling capabilities within the IL-6 cytokine family.

## Function
Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of endothelial cells, where it acts as a potent mitogen, promoting cell proliferation and tube formation, which are crucial for angiogenesis. OSM also regulates the expression of angiogenic mediators like VEGF, FGF2, and angiopoietin-2, enhancing angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, particularly in wound healing contexts (West2018The).

In bone biology, OSM promotes osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cell precursors and represses adipocyte differentiation through the OSMR/gp130-activated STAT3 signaling pathway. In osteoblasts, OSM can activate both STAT3 and STAT1, promoting pro-osteogenic gene expression (West2018The). OSM also influences osteoclast activity, although its deficiency in OSMR has a more significant physiological impact than OSM deficiency alone (West2018The).

OSM is crucial for hematopoiesis, particularly in maintaining steady-state hematopoiesis. It affects the bone marrow niche by influencing CXCL12 production, which is vital for hematopoietic progenitor retention (West2018The). OSM is expressed in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and is crucial for the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and the formation of the bone marrow niche (Hermanns2015Oncostatin).

## Clinical Significance
Oncostatin M (OSM) plays a significant role in the progression of various cancers through alterations in its expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, OSM is overexpressed in pre-cancerous and cancerous tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer staging. OSM-OSMR signaling is linked to increased proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells (Wolf2023The). In pancreatic cancer, OSM promotes EMT and a cancer stem cell phenotype, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis, and is associated with poor prognosis and radio resistance (Wolf2023The; Lee2021Heterocellular).

In breast cancer, OSM is linked to decreased survival rates and increased metastasis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancers, where it promotes a cancer stem cell phenotype through OSM/STAT3/SMAD3 signaling (Wolf2023The). In cervical squamous cell carcinoma, OSMR overexpression is associated with EMT and poor overall survival, enhancing cancer stem cell-like properties and metastasis (KuciaTran2016Overexpression).

OSM also plays a role in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where its expression correlates with disease severity and resistance to anti-TNF therapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (West2017Oncostatin).

## Interactions
Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine that interacts with specific receptor complexes to exert its biological effects. It primarily activates the OSM receptor (OSMR) in conjunction with glycoprotein 130 (gp130), a process that is unique to OSM among cytokines in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family (AdrianSegarra2018Thea). The interaction with OSMR is facilitated by specific sequence motifs within OSM, particularly in binding site III, which includes the AB loop and D-helix. Key residues such as Tyr-34, Gln-38, Gly-39, and Leu-45 in the AB loop, and Pro-153 in the D-helix, are critical for this interaction (AdrianSegarra2018Thea).

OSM also binds to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagen types I and XI, laminin, and fibronectin. This binding is pH-dependent and involves electrostatic interactions mediated by charged amino acids in OSM. The C-terminal extensions of OSM enhance its binding to ECM at neutral pH, while at acidic pH, all forms of OSM bind similarly (Ryan2015Oncostatin). Disulfide bonds play a role in OSM's immobilization to ECM, maintaining its bioactive conformation and protecting it from proteolytic cleavage (Ryan2015Oncostatin). These interactions are significant in the context of inflammation and metastasis, as OSM can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like changes in tumor cells when bound to ECM (Ryan2015Oncostatin).
