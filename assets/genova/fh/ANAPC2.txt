# ANAPC2

## Overview
ANAPC2 is a gene that encodes the protein anaphase-promoting complex subunit 2, which is a crucial component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation by targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis (Schrock2020APCC; Zhou2016Insights). ANAPC2, as part of the catalytic core of the APC/C, interacts with other subunits such as ANAPC10 and ANAPC11, and is involved in the ubiquitination process essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell division (Hoffman2024Targeting). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with coactivators, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Patel2024A; Zhou2016Insights).

## Structure
ANAPC2 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a large multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for cell cycle regulation. The primary structure of ANAPC2 is a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ANAPC2 gene, forming part of the catalytic sub-complex of the APC/C (Hoffman2024Targeting). This sub-complex also includes ANAPC10 and ANAPC11, with ANAPC2 functioning similarly to a cullin-like subunit (Hoffman2024Targeting).

The tertiary structure of ANAPC2 involves its three-dimensional folding, which is crucial for its interaction with other subunits within the APC/C. The quaternary structure of ANAPC2 is characterized by its integration into the APC/C complex, where it interacts with other subunits to form a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase (Hoffman2024Targeting). ANAPC2's interaction with ANAPC11 is particularly important for the catalytic activity of the complex (Hoffman2024Targeting).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of ANAPC2, influencing its role in the APC/C and its function in cell cycle regulation (Patel2024A). These structural and functional characteristics underscore the importance of ANAPC2 in maintaining proper cell cycle progression.

## Function
ANAPC2 is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for cell cycle regulation. It is part of the catalytic core of the APC/C, along with APC11 and APC10, and plays a vital role in the ubiquitination of target proteins, marking them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. This process is crucial for the transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell division (Schrock2020APCC; Zhou2016Insights).

ANAPC2 interacts with E2 enzymes such as UbcH10 and Ube2s, facilitating the ubiquitination process. It is involved in the formation of ubiquitin chains, with UBCH10 initiating and UBE2S elongating these chains, which are essential for the degradation of specific cell cycle proteins (Zhou2016Insights). The activity of ANAPC2, as part of the APC/C, is regulated by coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1, which target the complex to specific substrates at different stages of the cell cycle (Schrock2020APCC).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, ANAPC2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including differentiation, genome stability, and energy metabolism (Zhou2016Insights). Its proper function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ANAPC2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. ANAPC2 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a key regulator of the cell cycle. In cancer, mutations in APC/C subunits, including ANAPC2, have been associated with poor prognosis and are considered potential cancer driver genes. Studies have shown that 14% of cancer patients have at least one APC/C mutation, with ANAPC2 frequently co-occurring with other subunit mutations, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Melloy2019The).

In colorectal cancer, ANAPC2 plays a role in the degradation of the KRAS protein. The combination of artesunate and WNT974 has been shown to upregulate ANAPC2, enhancing KRAS degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is crucial for reducing cancer cell growth (Gong2022Combination).

ANAPC2 is also involved in idiopathic short stature (ISS) through its circular RNA form, circANAPC2. This circular RNA is upregulated in ISS patients and affects chondrocyte proliferation and ossification by interacting with the miR-874-3p/SMAD3 signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for ISS (Liu2021Circular).
