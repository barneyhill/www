# DPP4

## Overview
DPP4, or dipeptidyl peptidase 4, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane serine peptidase known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV or CD26. This enzyme is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various physiological processes, including glucose metabolism and immune regulation. DPP4 is widely expressed in numerous tissues, such as the kidney, liver, and immune cells, and exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. The protein plays a critical role in the degradation of incretin hormones, thereby influencing insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Additionally, DPP4 is involved in immune cell signaling and interaction, impacting T cell activation and proliferation. Its interactions with proteins like adenosine deaminase and the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 underscore its significance in immune modulation. Clinically, alterations in the DPP4 gene and its expression are associated with metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in health and disease (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase; Röhrborn2015DPP4; SebastiánMartín2022Role).

## Structure
The DPP4 protein, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV or CD26, is a type II transmembrane serine peptidase with a complex molecular structure. It is a homodimeric glycoprotein, with each monomer consisting of 766 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase). The primary structure is conserved across species, particularly in the C-terminal protease domain (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase).

The secondary structure includes an α/β-hydrolase domain and an eight-bladed β-propeller domain. The α/β-hydrolase domain features a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices, typical of the α/β-hydrolase family, and is formed by the C-terminal sequence (Rasmussen2002Crystal). The β-propeller domain consists of eight blades, each with four antiparallel β-strands, forming a funnel-shaped tunnel leading to the active site (Rasmussen2002Crystal).

In its tertiary structure, DPP4 forms a homodimer, with dimerization being crucial for its enzymatic activity (Rasmussen2002Crystal). The quaternary structure is characterized by a hydrophilic dimer interface, suggesting potential monomeric existence in solution (Rasmussen2002Crystal).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, contributing to its function as a glycoprotein (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase). The enzyme's active site contains a serine-protease triad composed of Ser630, Asp708, and His740, essential for its catalytic activity (Rasmussen2002Crystal).

## Function
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a serine exopeptidase, playing a significant role in glucose metabolism and immune regulation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the degradation of incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which are crucial for enhancing peripheral glucose tolerance and stimulating insulin secretion postprandially. By cleaving these incretins, DPP4 limits their action, thereby regulating insulin secretion (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase; SebastiánMartín2022Role).

In the immune system, DPP4 is expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. It interacts with proteins like adenosine deaminase (ADA) to support immune cell function and maintain cellular and humoral immunity. DPP4 also interacts with CD45, influencing T cell activation by enhancing protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Its interaction with caveolin-1 on antigen-presenting cells promotes T-cell proliferation and NF-κB activation, marking it as a key protein in T cell function (SebastiánMartín2022Role).

DPP4 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, lung, liver, and immune cells, and can be found in a soluble form in bodily fluids, where it is thought to have immunoregulatory roles (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase; SebastiánMartín2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DPP4 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. For instance, certain SNPs in the DPP4 gene are associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis in coronary artery disease patients (Röhrborn2015DPP4). The V486M mutation in DPP4 disrupts its enzymatic activity, affecting glucose metabolism and potentially contributing to type 2 diabetes (Li2021Distal).

Alterations in DPP4 expression levels are implicated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. DPP4 is highly expressed in visceral adipose tissue and is considered a novel adipokine. Its elevated levels correlate with obesity-related parameters and metabolic syndrome markers, such as insulin resistance and plasma triglycerides (SebastiánMartín2022Role; Röhrborn2015DPP4). In the context of COVID-19, altered DPP4 expression may influence disease progression and glucose homeostasis, with lower serum levels observed in patients potentially increasing infection risk (SebastiánMartín2022Role).

DPP4 also plays a role in cancer, with its expression being significant in various types, including breast and lung cancers. It is linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, affecting tumor-immune interactions (ElArabey2023Metformin).

## Interactions
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune responses and cellular processes. DPP4 interacts with adenosine deaminase (ADA), forming a high-affinity complex that preserves the enzymatic activities of both proteins. This interaction is crucial for immune regulation and is characterized by specific binding residues on both DPP4 and ADA (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase; Röhrborn2015DPP4).

DPP4 also binds to the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, which inhibits ADA association by initially binding to a distinct epitope on DPP4, followed by a conformational change that blocks ADA binding (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase). The protein interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR4, leading to cointernalization upon ligand binding, which modulates immune responses (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase).

DPP4 forms complexes with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin, influencing cell migration and adhesion (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase). It also interacts with the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor, facilitating internalization and affecting T cell proliferation (Lambeir2003DipeptidylPeptidase). These interactions highlight DPP4's multifaceted role in immune modulation and cellular signaling.
