# ACAD9

## Overview
The ACAD9 gene encodes the protein acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9, which is a crucial component of mitochondrial function. This protein belongs to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family and is primarily involved in the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, a process essential for energy production in cells (Oey2006AcylCoA; Zhang2002Cloning). Additionally, ACAD9 plays a significant role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, a key element of the electron transport chain, thereby contributing to efficient oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy metabolism (Nouws2013ACAD9; Schiff2015Complex). The protein's dual functionality in both fatty acid metabolism and complex I assembly highlights its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Schiff2015Complex). Mutations in the ACAD9 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations, including cardiomyopathy and neurological symptoms (Repp2018Clinical; Nouws2010AcylCoA).

## Structure
The ACAD9 protein is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function. It is a 621-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 68.8 kDa (Zhang2002Cloning). The primary structure of ACAD9 includes a leading sequence of 17 amino acids and one potential N-linked glycosylation site (Zhang2002Cloning). 

In terms of secondary structure, ACAD9 contains a stretch of about 35 amino acids (residues 450-485) that form helices on the opposite sides of a cleft at the membrane face of the dimer (Nouws2010AcylCoA). These helices show significant structural differences compared to VLCAD, suggesting evolutionary adaptation (Nouws2010AcylCoA).

The tertiary structure of ACAD9 is modeled based on its homology with VLCAD, sharing 47% sequence identity (Nouws2010AcylCoA). The quaternary structure of ACAD9 is a homodimer, with each monomer binding a FAD cofactor (Nouws2010AcylCoA). 

ACAD9 also contains an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase domain and is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, interacting with ECSIT and NDUFAF1 (Xia2021Molecular). The protein's structure is crucial for its dual role in fatty acid oxidation and complex I assembly (Xia2021Molecular).

## Function
The ACAD9 gene encodes a protein that plays a dual role in human cells, primarily involved in fatty acid oxidation and the assembly of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. ACAD9 is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family and catalyzes the initial step in the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, converting them into acetyl-CoA, which is crucial for energy production (Oey2006AcylCoA; Zhang2002Cloning). This enzymatic activity is particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart, skeletal muscles, brain, kidney, and liver, where ACAD9 is highly expressed (Zhang2002Cloning).

In addition to its role in fatty acid metabolism, ACAD9 is essential for the assembly and maintenance of complex I, a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This function is critical for efficient oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy metabolism (Nouws2013ACAD9; Schiff2015Complex). ACAD9's involvement in complex I assembly is independent of its catalytic activity in fatty acid oxidation, highlighting its multifaceted role in mitochondrial function (Nouws2013ACAD9). The protein's dual functionality exemplifies its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal energy homeostasis (Schiff2015Complex).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACAD9 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a condition that affects mitochondrial energy production and can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations. Patients with ACAD9 mutations often present with symptoms such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance (Repp2018Clinical; Nouws2010AcylCoA). The clinical spectrum is broad, with some patients experiencing severe conditions like cardiomyopathy, which may require interventions such as heart transplantation (Repp2018Clinical). Neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability and epilepsy, have also been reported, particularly in cases where ACAD9's dehydrogenase activity is significantly reduced (Jacobi‐Polishook2020Successful; Schiff2015Complex).

Riboflavin supplementation has shown potential benefits in some patients, improving muscle function and exercise tolerance by possibly increasing ACAD activity and stabilizing the protein for more efficient complex I assembly (Jacobi‐Polishook2020Successful; Repp2018Clinical). However, the response to riboflavin can vary depending on the specific mutation and phenotype, with some patients not experiencing significant improvement (Nouws2013A). The variability in clinical presentation and treatment response underscores the complexity of ACAD9-related disorders.

## Interactions
ACAD9 interacts with the ECSIT protein, forming a crucial part of the mitochondrial Complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. This interaction induces significant conformational changes in ACAD9, leading to the ejection of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, which shifts ACAD9's role from fatty acid β-oxidation to Complex I assembly (McGregor2023The). The binding site for ECSIT is located at the junction of the ACAD9 dehydrogenase and vestigial domains, with specific interactions involving ECSIT residues forming a 310-helix that interacts with the ACAD9 β1-β2 loop (McGregor2023The).

The interaction between ACAD9 and ECSIT is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly at the Thr320 site on ECSIT, which can disrupt the interaction and serve as a regulatory switch for MCIA complex assembly (McGregor2023The). The structural differences between ACAD9 and VLCAD, another member of the ACAD family, allow ACAD9 to specifically bind ECSIT, a capability not shared by VLCAD (McGregor2023The). These interactions are essential for the biogenesis of Complex I and the activation of the oxidative phosphorylation system (McGregor2023The).
