# NAXE

## Overview
The NAXE gene encodes the enzyme NAD(P)HX epimerase, which is integral to cellular metabolism by repairing damaged forms of the cofactors NADH and NADPH. This enzyme is classified as an epimerase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one stereoisomer into another. NAD(P)HX epimerase plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox balance by converting the R form of NAD(P)HX to the S form, which is subsequently processed to regenerate NAD(P)H. This function is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites that can disrupt cellular energy balance and lead to oxidative stress. The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, aligning with the primary sites of reactive oxygen species production, and is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain. Mutations in the NAXE gene are linked to neurometabolic disorders, underscoring its significance in cellular metabolism and stress response (Linster2013Metabolite; Marbaix2011Extremely; Sun2021NAD(P); Van2018NAD(P)).

## Function
NAXE, also known as NAD(P)HX epimerase, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox balance by repairing damaged forms of NADH and NADPH, which are essential cofactors in cellular metabolism. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the R form of NAD(P)HX to the S form, which is then processed by NAD(P)HX dehydratase to regenerate NAD(P)H. This repair mechanism is vital for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites that can inhibit key enzymes such as dehydrogenases, thereby maintaining cellular energy balance and preventing oxidative stress (Linster2013Metabolite; Marbaix2011Extremely).

NAXE is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, aligning with the major sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. By facilitating the repair of NADPH, NAXE helps maintain the redox status of antioxidants like glutathione and thioredoxin, which are critical for counteracting ROS (Sun2021NAD(P)HX page 0 of 4). This function is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain, where the enzyme's activity supports metabolic health and prevents neurometabolic disorders (Van2018NAD(P)HX page 0 of 3). Additionally, NAXE may have a moonlighting function related to vitamin B6 metabolism, potentially acting as a pyridoxal phosphate chaperone (Niehaus2018Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAXE gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as early-onset progressive encephalopathy with brain edema and/or leukoencephalopathy (PEBEL1). This condition is characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including developmental regression, hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, and cognitive decline, often leading to early death (Mohammadi2021A). The disorder results from the accumulation of toxic metabolites due to impaired repair of damaged NAD(P)H cofactors, which is crucial for normal cellular metabolism (Trinh2019Novel).

Several studies have identified various pathogenic variants in the NAXE gene, including homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations. These mutations lead to a loss-of-function mechanism, resulting in insufficient metabolic repair and the accumulation of harmful metabolites (Mohammadi2021A; Trinh2019Novel). Clinical manifestations of NAXE-related disorders can include respiratory insufficiency, movement disorders, and fluctuating disease courses, often exacerbated by fever or infections (Trinh2019Novel; Almudhry2024Longterm).

Treatment strategies, such as supplementation with vitamin B3 and coenzyme Q, have shown potential in alleviating symptoms and slowing disease progression in some cases (Trinh2019Novel; Almudhry2024Longterm).

## Interactions
The NAXE gene encodes the NAD(P)HX epimerase, which is involved in the repair of damaged NAD(P)H molecules. This enzyme has been suggested to have potential moonlighting functions beyond its known enzymatic activity. In mammals, NAXE is found in extracellular compartments and has been shown to bind to apolipoprotein A-1, a component of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) complex. This interaction suggests a possible link to cholesterol transport, atherosclerosis, and angiogenesis (Niehaus2018Evidence).

In the context of neurodevelopment, NAXE is part of a set of proteins associated with the stress-mitochondrial function/dysfunction-neurobehavioral axis in preterm infants. These proteins are involved in processes like oxidative stress response and transmembrane transporter activity, which are linked to nonoptimal neurobehavioral outcomes (Zhao2024PainStress). Although specific protein interactions are not detailed, the involvement of NAXE in these processes indicates its role in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress.

Mutations in the NAXE gene are associated with neurometabolic disorders, highlighting the importance of its interactions in cellular metabolism and stress response (Mohammadi2021A).
