# PARS2

## Overview
The PARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme prolyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme, categorized as a ligase, facilitates the attachment of proline to its corresponding tRNA, a vital step in the translation of mitochondrial proteins. The protein functions as a dimer, with each monomer comprising a ligase core domain and an anticodon-binding domain, essential for its enzymatic activity. The proper functioning of PARS2 is integral to mitochondrial homeostasis and energy production, as it supports the synthesis of proteins necessary for the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex, which is responsible for ATP production (Yin2018The; Mizuguchi2017PARS2). Mutations in the PARS2 gene have been linked to several mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Jing2024Case; Sofou2014Whole).

## Structure
The PARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial prolyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which is involved in the charging of tRNA with proline. The protein is a dimer composed of two identical monomers, each containing a ligase core domain and an anticodon-binding domain (Jing2024Case). The ligase core domain includes three active motifs: motif 1 is involved in the dimer interface, motif 2 couples ATP, amino acids, and tRNA binding, and motif 3 binds ATP (Jing2024Case). The anticodon-binding domain is responsible for recognizing the anticodon loop of the cognate tRNA (Jing2024Case).

The molecular structure of the protein associated with the PARS2 gene, known as SYPM, was predicted using AlphaFold software, resulting in the structure named AF-Q7L3T8-F1. This structure includes mutant sites located in the proline-tRNA ligase domain (Jing2024Case). The mutation site c.283G>A is located in the dimer interface of the ligase core domain, affecting the protein structure and splice site, while c.953C>T induces amino acid sequence changes (Jing2024Case). These mutations are predicted to be protein damaging, with high probability values indicating disease-causing mutations (Jing2024Case).

## Function
The PARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial prolyl-tRNA synthetase 2, an enzyme essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of the amino acid proline to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial proteins (Yin2018The; Jing2024Case). The enzyme functions as a dimer, with each monomer containing a ligase core domain and an anticodon-binding domain. The ligase core domain includes motifs that are crucial for dimerization, ATP binding, and the coupling of ATP, amino acids, and tRNA binding, while the anticodon-binding domain recognizes the anticodon loop of the cognate tRNA (Jing2024Case).

In healthy human cells, PARS2 plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and energy production by ensuring the proper synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. This process is integral to the function of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex, which is responsible for ATP production, a key energy source for cellular activities (Mizuguchi2017PARS2). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal health, as it supports the translation of genetic information into functional proteins within mitochondria (Yin2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PARS2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, most notably lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and Alpers syndrome. A case report identified a compound heterozygous variant of the PARS2 gene as the cause of lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, marking the first instance of such a variant leading to severe heart failure. The patient exhibited symptoms such as fatigue, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, ultimately succumbing to heart failure. This highlights the critical role of mitochondrial tRNA function in heart health and underscores the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial disorders (Jing2024Case).

PARS2 mutations have also been linked to Alpers syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diffuse degeneration of cerebral gray matter, seizures, and metabolic abnormalities. In one study, a compound heterozygous mutation in PARS2 was identified in a patient with Alpers syndrome, marking the first association of PARS2 mutations with this condition (Sofou2014Whole).

Additionally, research has suggested a potential association between rare variants in the PARS2 gene and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Although the significance of this association is not statistically robust, the study found a surplus of rare variants in CRS patients compared to a European population (Henmyr2016Chronic).
