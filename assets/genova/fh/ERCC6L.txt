# ERCC6L

## Overview
ERCC6L is a gene that encodes the protein ERCC excision repair 6 like, spindle assembly checkpoint helicase, also known as PICH. This protein is a DNA helicase that plays a crucial role in mitosis, particularly in the segregation of sister chromatids and the maintenance of chromosome architecture during cell division. It functions as a DNA-dependent ATPase and interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to ensure proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability, thereby preventing aneuploidy. ERCC6L is active in the nucleus, especially at centromeres, where it is involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint, a critical process for accurate chromosome distribution to daughter cells. The protein is also implicated in cancer progression, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer. ERCC6L's involvement in pathways such as PI3K/AKT and NF-κB highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Xie2019ERCC6L; Lu2022A).

## Structure


## Function
ERCC6L, also known as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)-interacting checkpoint helicase, is a DNA helicase involved in the segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis. It functions as a DNA-dependent ATPase and interacts with PLK1 to maintain chromosome architecture during prometaphase. This interaction is crucial for ensuring proper chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability, thereby preventing aneuploidy in cells (Xie2019ERCC6L).

ERCC6L is active in the nucleus, particularly at centromeres, where it plays a vital role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. This function is essential for resolving DNA structures that arise during cell division, ensuring that chromosomes are accurately distributed to daughter cells. The helicase activity of ERCC6L is critical for its role in these processes, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular health and preventing genomic instability (Xie2019ERCC6L).

In addition to its role in mitosis, ERCC6L is strongly expressed during the embryonic stage in various tissues, including the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. This expression pattern suggests a role in development, although its function in adult human cells is less well-documented (Xie2019ERCC6L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ERCC6L gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. ERCC6L is overexpressed in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and higher clinical tumor grades (Lu2022A). In breast cancer (BRCA), hypomethylation of the ERCC6L promoter correlates with elevated mRNA levels and decreased survival rates (Lu2022A). Somatic mutations, especially missense mutations, are prevalent in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and BRCA, further correlating with poor survival outcomes (Lu2022A).

ERCC6L is involved in pathways such as PI3K/AKT and NF-κB, which promote tumor growth in several cancers, including BRCA, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma (Lu2022A). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration in tumors, with significant associations observed in BRCA, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, and LUAD (Lu2022A).

These findings suggest that ERCC6L plays a critical role in cancer progression and could serve as a biomarker for prognosis and a potential therapeutic target (Lu2022A). Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms regulating ERCC6L expression and its role in cancer (Lu2022A).

## Interactions
ERCC6L, also known as PICH, is a DNA helicase that participates in several protein interactions crucial for its role in mitosis and cancer progression. It interacts with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which enhances its function in mitotic chromosome consolidation and centromeric chromatin remodeling. This interaction is significant for cell division and proliferation, particularly in the context of cancer (Huang2022Overexpression; Lu2022A).

In colorectal cancer, ERCC6L is involved in tumor growth and invasion, interacting with topoisomerase II during mitosis to promote sister chromatid disjunction and maintain chromosome architecture during prometaphase (Xie2019ERCC6L). The protein is also implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/Notch 3 signaling pathways, influencing cancer cell migration and invasion (Huang2022Overexpression).

ERCC6L's interactions extend to its role in the spindle assembly checkpoint during mitosis, where it is associated with chromatin and centromeres. These interactions are essential for its function in DNA repair and chromosome segregation, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Lu2022A).
