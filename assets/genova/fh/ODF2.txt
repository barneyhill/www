# ODF2

## Overview
The ODF2 gene encodes the protein outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2, commonly referred to as ODF2 or Cenexin, which is integral to the structural and functional integrity of sperm tails and various cellular processes. As a coiled-coil protein, ODF2 is involved in the formation of outer dense fibers in sperm tails, contributing to sperm motility and stability (Hüber2007Alternative). Beyond its role in spermatogenesis, ODF2 is a critical component of centrioles and basal bodies, playing a pivotal role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and in maintaining centrosome cohesion (Tateishi2013Two; Yang2018ODF2). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as NEURL4 and β-catenin, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular organization and regulatory processes (Yang2018ODF2; Otto2023ODF2). Mutations or dysregulation of ODF2 are linked to male infertility and ciliary dysfunction, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health and potential as a therapeutic target (Ito2019Odf2; Kunimoto2012Coordinated).

## Structure
ODF2 is characterized as a coiled-coil protein, which is crucial for its ability to self-associate and form fibrous structures. The protein contains two leucine zipper motifs in its C-terminal region, which are typically involved in oligomerization, although its self-interaction does not depend on these motifs (Donkor2004Outer). The coiled-coil structure facilitates interactions with itself, ODF1, and microtubules, although no direct interaction with tubulin has been detected (Donkor2004Outer; Rivkin2008Genomic).

ODF2 is a product of alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including cenexin. These isoforms differ by a short stretch of amino acids at their N-terminal regions, with exon 3b being a notable variant in some isoforms (Hüber2007Alternative; Hüber2008Molecular). The N-terminal region, including the Cenexin insertion, is important for associating with acetylated microtubules and targeting to the centrosome and primary cilium (Hüber2008Molecular).

The C-terminal coiled-coil region is essential for centrosomal and ciliary targeting, supporting self-association and higher-order structure formation (Hüber2008Molecular). ODF2 is also involved in the formation of primary cilia, although its exact role in cilia formation or stabilization is not fully understood (Hüber2008Molecular).

## Function
The ODF2 gene encodes a protein known as ODF2 or Cenexin, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ODF2 is essential for the formation of outer dense fibers in sperm tails, contributing to sperm motility and stability (Hüber2007Alternative). Beyond its role in sperm cells, ODF2 is a key component of centrioles and basal bodies, structures critical for ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation (Tateishi2013Two). ODF2 is involved in the formation of appendage-like structures such as transition fibers and basal feet, which are necessary for the stabilization of centrosomal microtubules and the generation of primary cilia (Tateishi2013Two).

ODF2 is also crucial for maintaining centrosome cohesion by regulating β-catenin accumulation, which is important for proper cell cycle progression and mitosis (Yang2018ODF2). It recruits Polo-like kinase 1 to the centrosome, facilitating centrosome separation and the establishment of a bipolar spindle, essential for correct chromosome segregation (Yang2018ODF2). In multiciliated cells, ODF2 is indispensable for the formation of basal feet, which are essential for the coordinated beating of cilia, a process necessary for effective mucociliary transport (Kunimoto2012Coordinated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ODF2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male fertility and ciliary function. ODF2 haploinsufficiency in mice leads to a condition known as decapitated and decaudated spermatozoa (Odf2-DDS), characterized by the separation of the neck-midpiece in sperm, resulting in immotile but viable sperm cells. This defect causes male infertility, although the sperm cells can still transmit the paternal genome through intracytoplasmic headneck injection (ICSI) (Ito2019Odf2).

ODF2 is also crucial for ciliary function, and mutations in this gene can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by uncoordinated ciliary beating and associated respiratory issues such as chronic bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and otitis media (Kunimoto2012Coordinated). In addition, the presence of anti-ODF2 autoantibodies in men with oligozoospermia is linked to increased sperm DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, contributing to reduced fertility (Kiani2023Sperm).

Altered expression of ODF2 due to microRNA interactions, specifically miR-23a/b-3p, is associated with oligoasthenozoospermia, a condition marked by low sperm count and motility (Abu‐Halima2021MicroRNA‐targeting). These findings underscore the gene's significant role in reproductive health and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ODF2 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular structures such as centrioles, basal bodies, and sperm tails. It interacts with NEURL4, facilitating the degradation of CP110, a process essential for cilia formation (Otto2023ODF2). ODF2 also interacts with β-catenin, forming part of a multi-protein complex with Axin1, which promotes β-catenin degradation and maintains centrosome cohesion (Yang2018ODF2).

ODF2 is a component of the outer dense fibers in sperm tails and interacts with ODF1, another structural protein, as well as microtubules, through its coiled-coil domains (Rivkin2008Genomic). It also physically interacts with CCDC42, a protein involved in the cytoskeletal structure of male germ cells, as demonstrated by co-localization and pull-down assays (Tapia2019CCDC42).

ODF2's interactions are not limited to structural roles; it also participates in regulatory processes. For instance, it acts as a scaffold for NEURL4 binding, which is crucial for the regulation of CP110 levels at centrioles and basal bodies, impacting primary cilia biogenesis (Otto2023ODF2). These interactions highlight ODF2's multifaceted role in cellular organization and function.
