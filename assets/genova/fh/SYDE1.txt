# SYDE1

## Overview
SYDE1, or synapse defective Rho GTPase homolog 1, is a gene that encodes a RhoGAP protein involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42. The protein encoded by SYDE1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including endothelial barrier integrity, placental development, and neuronal development. As a member of the C2-RhoGAP family, SYDE1 is crucial for cytoskeletal remodeling, synaptic exocytosis, and dendritogenesis, impacting both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions. Its interactions with proteins such as Munc18-1, liprin-α2, and XPO1 underscore its involvement in synaptic regulation and cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in SYDE1 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, neurological disorders, and potentially tumorigenesis, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Kouchi2022Function; Lo2016Association; AmadoAzevedo2017A).

## Function
SYDE1 (synapse defective Rho GTPase homolog 1) is a RhoGAP protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by regulating the activity of Rho family GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42. In endothelial cells, SYDE1 functions as a GTPase-activating protein, inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42, which are essential for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity. This regulation is critical for balancing junctional dynamics and ensuring proper barrier function (AmadoAzevedo2017A).

In placental development, SYDE1 is involved in the migration and invasion of trophoblast cells, processes vital for remodeling spiral arteries and ensuring adequate maternal-fetal blood circulation. It is highly expressed in the human placenta, particularly in extravillous trophoblast cells, and is regulated by the transcription factor GCM1. SYDE1's role in cytoskeletal remodeling is essential for placental cell migration and invasion, impacting fetal growth and placental function (Lo2016Association).

SYDE1 is also implicated in neuronal development, where it regulates synaptic exocytosis and dendritogenesis. Its RhoGAP activity is crucial for these processes, and it interacts with proteins involved in synaptic regulation, such as Munc18-1 and liprin-α2, indicating its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling (Kouchi2022Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SYDE1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. SYDE1 plays a crucial role in placental development, and its dysfunction is linked to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Studies have shown that decreased SYDE1 expression in human IUGR placentas correlates with impaired placental cell migration and invasion, leading to fetal growth restriction (Lo2016Association). In Syde1 knockout mice, similar placental abnormalities and fetal growth issues have been observed, suggesting a critical role for SYDE1 in normal placental function (Lo2016Association).

The SYDE1 gene is also implicated in neurological disorders. It is involved in synaptic regulation and neuronal development, with its RhoGAP activity being essential for these processes (Kouchi2022Function). Alterations in SYDE1 expression have been noted in the cortex of autistic patients, indicating a potential link to autism (Kouchi2022Function). Additionally, SYDE1 is part of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of achalasia, a rare esophageal motility disorder (Micale2022Downexpression). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in both placental and neurological contexts.

## Interactions
SYDE1, a member of the C2-RhoGAP family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as XPO1, which is involved in nuclear export, and is palmitoylated by Golgi-localized DHHC3, indicating its involvement in membrane targeting (Kouchi2022Function). SYDE1 also contains motifs for binding with Grb2, MAPK, and 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in signaling pathways related to synaptogenesis and active zone homeostasis (Kouchi2022Function). 

In neuronal development, SYDE1 interacts with Munc18-1 and liprin-α2, which are involved in synaptic regulation. These interactions are thought to be competitive with RPTP-liprinα interaction, suggesting a complex regulatory role in synaptic architecture (Kouchi2022Function). SYDE1 also has potential SH3 binding sites, indicating interactions with proteins like Crk and CIN85 (Kouchi2022Function). 

In the context of glioma, SYDE1 is part of a network involving the SNHG16/hsa-miR-520e/SYDE1 axis, which may play a role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Han2021SYDE1). These interactions highlight SYDE1's multifaceted role in both normal cellular functions and disease states.
