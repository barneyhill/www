# LRRC8C

## Overview
The LRRC8C gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 8 VRAC subunit C, which is a critical component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) complex. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to the structural integrity of the VRAC complex (Rutz2022Structure). As a transmembrane protein, LRRC8C plays a pivotal role in regulating cell volume by mediating the efflux of chloride ions and small organic solutes in response to osmotic changes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Takahashi2023CryoEM; Kasuya2022Recent). The LRRC8C subunit forms heteromeric assemblies with other LRRC8 family members, particularly LRRC8A, which are essential for the functional properties of VRACs, including their role in immune response regulation and T-cell function (Rutz2022Structure; Pervaiz2019Absolute). Alterations in the LRRC8C gene have been implicated in various diseases, such as non-small cell lung cancer and glaucoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Gasull2019The; Lu2024Genetic).

## Structure
The LRRC8C protein is a component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) complex, which plays a crucial role in cell volume regulation. Structurally, LRRC8C contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Rutz2022Structure). The LRR domain of LRRC8C was crystallized, revealing a structure that includes 1,633 residues, 52 water molecules, and 1 Mg2+ ion (Rutz2022Structure).

The LRRC8C protein forms heteromeric complexes with other LRRC8 subunits, contributing to its quaternary structure. In particular, LRRC8C can assemble with LRRC8A to form hexameric channels, with a predominant 2:1 ratio of A to C subunits (Rutz2022Structure). The LRRC8C subunit has extracellular and transmembrane regions, a linker, and a 17-repeat LRR domain, with the extracellular domains forming a rigid core of the channel (Kern2022Structural).

The incorporation of LRRC8C into heteromeric channels alters the size and chemistry of the extracellular selectivity filter ring, affecting substrate permeability and small molecule inhibition (Kern2022Structural). The LRRC8C subunit's structural flexibility enhances the activation properties of the VRAC complex (Rutz2022Structure).

## Function
The LRRC8C protein is a subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), which plays a crucial role in cell volume regulation by mediating the efflux of chloride ions and small organic solutes in response to osmotic changes. This function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to osmotic stress (Takahashi2023CryoEM; Kasuya2022Recent). LRRC8C, along with other LRRC8 subunits, forms heteromeric assemblies with LRRC8A, which is necessary for VRAC functionality. These assemblies are involved in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis (Rutz2022Structure; Pervaiz2019Absolute).

In immune cells, LRRC8C is involved in the transport of the immunotransmitter 2′3′cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which regulates the STING pathway and type I interferon production, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Kasuya2022Recent). The protein is active primarily in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to the regulation of ion flux and cellular responses to environmental changes (Kern2022Structural). The presence of LRRC8C in VRACs is associated with the conduction of small inorganic anions and plays a significant role in T-cell regulation (Rutz2022Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the LRRC8C gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glaucoma. In NSCLC, genetic variants in LRRC8C, specifically the rs10493829 T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), have been linked to improved survival outcomes. This SNP is associated with higher mRNA expression levels of LRRC8C, which correlates with better NSCLC survival, suggesting a potential protective role of this gene in cancer prognosis (Lu2024Genetic). The study indicates that LRRC8C may function as a suppressor gene, with its downregulation observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma compared to normal tissues (Lu2024Genetic).

In glaucoma, the expression of LRRC8C, along with other LRRC8 subunits, is significantly downregulated in glaucomatous trabecular meshwork cells. This downregulation impairs the function of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), which are crucial for cell volume regulation and aqueous humor outflow. The altered expression of LRRC8C in response to elevated pressure or steroid treatment, such as dexamethasone, suggests its involvement in the pathophysiology of glaucoma, particularly in conditions of ocular hypertension (Gasull2019The).

## Interactions
LRRC8C is a subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) and interacts with other members of the LRRC8 family, including LRRC8A, to form heteromeric channels. These interactions are crucial for the channel's function and structural properties. The LRRC8A subunit is essential for targeting the channel to the plasma membrane, while LRRC8C influences substrate selectivity and activation properties (Rutz2022Structure). In heteromeric channels, LRRC8C subunits contribute to the dynamic properties of the channel by destabilizing the closed state and enhancing activation properties (Rutz2022Structure).

The structural interactions between LRRC8A and LRRC8C involve the insertion of an LRRC8A leucine-rich repeat (LRR) into the concave interior of an LRRC8C LRR, forming a predominantly surface area interaction (Kern2022Structural). This interaction generates a gap that can accommodate additional subunit pairs, affecting the channel's stoichiometry and function (Kern2022Structural). The presence of LRRC8C in the channel alters the extracellular selectivity filter ring, impacting substrate permeability and small molecule inhibition (Kern2022Structural). These interactions highlight the importance of LRRC8C in modulating the structural and functional properties of VRACs.
