# FTCDNL1

## Overview
FTCDNL1 is a gene that encodes the protein formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase N-terminal like, which is characterized by the presence of a formiminotransferase domain in its N-terminal region. This protein is involved in the transfer of formimino groups, playing a critical role in folate metabolism and one-carbon unit transfer, which are essential for nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. The FTCDNL1 protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in the liver, skeletal muscle, and bone, where it contributes to bone homeostasis and metabolism (Kou2011Common; Lu2015Association). The gene's involvement in these metabolic pathways underscores its importance in cellular growth and division, although the precise mechanisms of its action are still under investigation (Meng2024Two).

## Structure


## Function
The FTCDNL1 gene encodes a protein that contains a formiminotransferase domain in its N-terminal, known as the FTCD_N domain. This domain is involved in the transfer of a formimino group from N-formimino-L-glutamic acid to tetrahydrofolate, resulting in the production of glutamic acid and 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate (Lu2015Association). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including bone, where it plays a significant role in bone homeostasis. Glutamic acid, a product of this process, is secreted by osteoclasts and is crucial for maintaining bone metabolism (Lu2015Association).

The FTCDNL1 protein is also implicated in folate-binding and transferase activities, which are essential for cellular growth and division. These activities are crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism, indicating the protein's role in one-carbon unit transfer and processing (Meng2024Two). The gene's expression is notably high in the liver and skeletal muscle, with moderate expression in bone, suggesting its involvement in these tissues (Kou2011Common). The exact mechanisms by which FTCDNL1 influences these processes remain an area of active research.

## Clinical Significance
The FTCDNL1 gene has been associated with several conditions, primarily osteoporosis and developmental dysplasia of the hips (DDH). In osteoporosis, a study identified the rs10203122 polymorphism in the FTCDNL1 gene as significantly associated with increased susceptibility to the disease among females in a Taiwanese population. This association was supported by findings from a genome-wide association study in Japan (Lu2015Association). Another polymorphism, rs7605378, was also linked to a decreased risk of osteoporosis, although its significance varied between populations (Lu2015Association).

In the context of DDH, the SNP rs769956 in the FTCDNL1 gene was associated with an increased risk of the condition in the Han Chinese population of Southwest China. Individuals carrying the G allele of this SNP were identified as having a higher risk factor for DDH (Meng2024Two). However, the association did not remain significant after multiple testing corrections, indicating the need for further research to confirm these findings (Meng2024Two).

Additionally, FTCDNL1 has been noted as a downregulated gene in studies investigating DNA repair and immune response pathways in familial melanoma, although its specific role in these pathways remains unclear (Potrony2021DNA).
