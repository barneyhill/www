# TMSB4X

## Overview
TMSB4X is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein thymosin beta-4 X-linked, a small actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin dynamics. Thymosin beta-4 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as motility, wound healing, and tissue regeneration by sequestering monomeric actin and preventing its polymerization into filamentous actin until needed. This regulation is vital for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and facilitating cellular functions like migration and division. The protein's flexible structure, characterized by a mix of alpha helices and random coils, allows it to interact dynamically with actin monomers. Thymosin beta-4 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer progression and glomerular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2023Deciphering; Mason2021Systemic; An2021In).

## Structure
Thymosin beta-4, encoded by the TMSB4X gene, is a small protein consisting of 43 amino acids. Its primary structure is characterized by its short peptide sequence, which plays a crucial role in various biological activities, including cellular motility and actin dynamics (An2021In). The secondary structure of thymosin beta-4 includes a mix of alpha helices and random coils, contributing to its flexible nature. This flexibility is a key feature, as it allows the protein to interact with actin monomers, sequestering them and influencing actin filament dynamics (Sun2018Crybb2).

Thymosin beta-4 lacks a defined tertiary structure due to its inherent flexibility, which prevents it from adopting a stable, folded conformation. Consequently, it does not form quaternary structures, as it functions primarily as a monomeric protein. Despite its lack of complex structural features, thymosin beta-4 is involved in significant cellular processes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell migration, by modulating actin dynamics (Wu2022Proteomic).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the cell. These modifications are essential for its role in cellular processes, including wound healing and cancer progression (An2021In).

## Function
Thymosin beta-4, encoded by the TMSB4X gene, is a crucial actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin dynamics within healthy human cells. It primarily functions by sequestering monomeric globular actin (G-actin), thereby preventing its polymerization into filamentous actin (F-actin) until specific cellular signals trigger filament formation. This regulation is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeleton, which is vital for various cellular processes such as motility, division, and maintaining cell shape (Chi2017Global).

Thymosin beta-4 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in modulating the F-actin cytoskeleton, which affects cell migration and stability. It has been shown to protect the actin cytoskeleton from disorganization, as demonstrated in studies involving human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVECs) (mason2021role). The protein's ability to bind G-actin is influenced by the nucleotide bound to actin, with a higher affinity for ATP-G-actin compared to ADP-G-actin, which allows it to control the rate of actin filament growth and nucleation (mason2021role).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal dynamics, thymosin beta-4 is involved in cellular processes such as wound healing, angiogenesis, and inflammation, contributing to tissue repair and regeneration (mason2021role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMSB4X gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of glomerular diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), the chemotherapeutic drug Adriamycin (ADR) has been shown to downregulate TMSB4X expression in podocytes, leading to glomerular injury. This suggests a role for TMSB4X in maintaining podocyte function and glomerular integrity (Mason2021Systemic). Systemic administration of thymosin β4 (TB4), which is encoded by TMSB4X, has been found to protect podocytes from injury and improve glomerular disease outcomes, indicating its therapeutic potential (Mason2021Systemic).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), TMSB4X has been identified as a prognostic risk factor. High expression levels of TMSB4X are associated with poor prognosis and increased immune infiltration, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and immune response modulation (Zhang2023Deciphering).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), TMSB4X has been found to carry nonsynonymous mutations in a significant portion of patients, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer type (de2014Exome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMSB4X in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TMSB4X, or thymosin beta 4 X-linked, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration and invasion. In melanoma cells, TMSB4X interacts with components of focal adhesions (FAs), including vinculin, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), pinch 2, α parvin, and integrin αVβ3. These interactions suggest a role in FA signaling and structure, affecting cell adhesion and motility (Makowiecka2019Thymosin).

In the context of prostate cancer, TMSB4X is identified as a key regulator of fibroblast phenotype, particularly in suppressing the transition to a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype. It binds and sequesters G actin monomers, influencing actin filament dynamics and localization, which is crucial for modulating cell migration and signaling pathways such as TGFβ and PDGF (Wu2022Proteomic).

TMSB4X also interacts with Crybb2 in neuron morphology, particularly in dendrite development. It co-localizes with Crybb2 and F-actin in cell ruffles, suggesting a potential interaction that influences dendritic morphogenesis (Sun2018Crybb2). These interactions highlight TMSB4X's role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular communication.
