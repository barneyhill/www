# LUZP4

## Overview
LUZP4, or leucine zipper protein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the nuclear export of mRNA, functioning as an mRNA export adaptor within the TREX complex. This protein is characterized by its leucine zipper motif, which is a structural feature that facilitates protein-protein interactions. LUZP4 plays a critical role in the formation of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and interacts with key proteins such as DDX39B and NXF1 to mediate the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Hautbergue2017RNA). It is predominantly expressed in germ cells, particularly in spermatogonia, indicating its importance in spermatogenesis and potential involvement in cellular homeostasis and differentiation (SiebertKuss2022Stagespecific; SiebertKuss2022Transcriptome). The gene has also been associated with various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Ambalavanan2018Exome; de2016Transcriptional).

## Structure


## Function
LUZP4 (leucine zipper protein 4) is involved in the nuclear export of eukaryotic RNAs, particularly mRNAs, by participating in the formation of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). It acts as a nuclear export adaptor within the TREX complex, which is a major pathway for mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. LUZP4 contains a conserved UBM sequence necessary for binding to DDX39B, facilitating the recruitment of ALYREF onto spliced mRNAs and the subsequent handover of RNA to Nuclear Export Factor 1 (NXF1) (Hautbergue2017RNA). 

In human cells, LUZP4 interacts with the RNA-binding region of NXF1, a nuclear export receptor, indicating its role in a complex network of interactions that provide selectivity and redundancy in mRNA export (Hautbergue2017RNA). LUZP4 is primarily expressed in germ cells, with specific expression in spermatogonia, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis (SiebertKuss2022Stagespecific; SiebertKuss2022Transcriptome). While its function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in RNA transport and expression in germ cells indicates a significant role in cellular homeostasis and possibly in cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
LUZP4 (leucine zipper protein 4) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), LUZP4 has been identified as having X-linked rare variants that may contribute to the condition, particularly in males. These variants are associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, suggesting a broader role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Ambalavanan2018Exome). 

In male infertility, LUZP4 is highlighted as a germ cell-specific marker, with its expression patterns being crucial during spermatogenesis. Alterations in its expression or splicing patterns could potentially contribute to infertility (SiebertKuss2022Transcriptome).

LUZP4 is also involved in cancer, particularly in breast cancer, where it plays a role in the transcriptional networks of different molecular subtypes. Its varying degrees of relevance in these networks suggest it may influence the regulatory programs of breast cancer (de2016Transcriptional). Additionally, LUZP4 has been included in studies on colon adenocarcinoma, where it is part of a prognostic model for the disease, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Qi2021Systematic).

## Interactions
LUZP4, also known as leucine zipper protein 4, is involved in mRNA export pathways and interacts with several key proteins and nucleic acids. It directly interacts with mRNA export factors Uap56 and Nxf1, as demonstrated by GST pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions are not RNA-dependent, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Viphakone2015Luzp4). LUZP4 also binds to Nxf2, which is expressed in testis tissues (Viphakone2015Luzp4). 

LUZP4 associates with the TREX mRNA export complex subunit Uap56 and contains a Uap56 binding motif, which is conserved in other mRNA export adaptors (Viphakone2015Luzp4). It enhances the RNA binding activity of Nxf1 while reducing its own, suggesting a role as an mRNA export adaptor (Viphakone2015Luzp4). LUZP4's interaction with Nxf1 and Uap56 is essential for its association with mRNPs in vivo (Viphakone2015Luzp4).

LUZP4 can also bind strongly to single-stranded RNA, with a preference over single-stranded DNA, and this RNA binding activity is primarily located between amino acids 119-313 (Viphakone2015Luzp4). These interactions suggest that LUZP4 functions similarly to other mRNA export adaptors like Alyref and Uif (Viphakone2015Luzp4).
