# MPPED2

## Overview
MPPED2 is a gene that encodes the protein metallophosphoesterase domain containing 2, which belongs to the class III cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, although it exhibits low catalytic efficiency due to an amino acid substitution in its catalytic site (Pellecchia2021MPPED2; Pellecchia2019The). MPPED2 is predominantly expressed in the fetal brain and adult central nervous system, suggesting a significant role in neural development and normal CNS function (Pellecchia2019The; Liguori2012The). The protein may function as a scaffold, influencing signaling pathways related to cell differentiation and growth (Pellecchia2021MPPED2; Gupta2020An). MPPED2's interactions and expression patterns indicate its potential involvement in various cellular processes and its significance as a therapeutic target in certain cancers, such as glioblastoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma (Pellecchia2021MPPED2; Shen2016miR448).

## Function
The MPPED2 gene encodes a metallophosphodiesterase protein that is part of the class III cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) family. These enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, specifically targeting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Pellecchia2021MPPED2; Pellecchia2019The). However, due to an amino acid substitution in its catalytic site, MPPED2 exhibits low phosphodiesteric activity, retaining AMP or GMP with strong affinity, which results in low catalytic efficiency (Pellecchia2019The).

MPPED2 is predominantly expressed in the fetal brain, suggesting a significant role in neural development (Pellecchia2019The). It is also highly expressed in adult human tissues, particularly in the central nervous system, indicating a potential role in normal CNS function (Liguori2012The). The protein may act as a scaffold, influencing various signaling pathways, including those involved in cell differentiation and growth (Pellecchia2021MPPED2; Gupta2020An).

In healthy human cells, MPPED2's precise function remains not fully understood, but its expression pattern and enzymatic properties suggest involvement in regulating cellular processes related to neural development and possibly other signaling pathways (Gupta2020An; Pellecchia2019The).

## Clinical Significance
MPPED2 is implicated in several cancers, notably glioblastoma (GBM) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In GBM, MPPED2 expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in the aggressive mesenchymal (MES) subtype, which correlates with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival. This downregulation is often due to promoter hypermethylation, a mechanism also observed in breast and colon cancers. Restoration of MPPED2 expression in GBM cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and increase sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Pellecchia2021MPPED2).

In OSCC, MPPED2 is targeted by miR-448, which binds to its 3'-UTR, leading to reduced expression. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis, indicating that miR-448 acts as an oncogene by downregulating MPPED2 (Shen2016miR448).

MPPED2 has also been studied in the context of dental caries, where genetic associations have been explored. However, recent studies have not found a significant link between MPPED2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to dental caries, suggesting its role in this condition may be limited (Akbarian2024Association).

## Interactions
MPPED2 is involved in several interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. In breast cancer, MPPED2 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA MPPED2-AS1, which interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). This interaction potentially prevents the methylation of CpG islands in the MPPED2 promoter region, thereby maintaining its expression (Pellecchia2019The). 

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), MPPED2 is targeted by miR-448, a microRNA that binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of MPPED2 mRNA. This binding results in decreased MPPED2 expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Shen2016miR448). 

In glioblastoma, MPPED2 expression is inversely correlated with the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT, suggesting that MPPED2 may interact with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is associated with reduced cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide (Pellecchia2021MPPED2). 

These interactions highlight MPPED2's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
