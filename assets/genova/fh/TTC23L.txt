# TTC23L

## Overview
TTC23L is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 23 like, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, and TTC23L is involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, particularly within the ciliary structure known as the Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) zone. The protein plays a crucial role in the assembly or stability of protein complexes in this zone, interacting with other ciliary proteins such as IQCE and EFCAB7 (Breslow2017A). While the gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including genetic screening and cancer risk, its precise role in specific diseases is still under investigation (Peters2015Detection; Bu2023Whole).

## Clinical Significance
The TTC23L gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its precise role in specific diseases is still under investigation. In the context of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) testing, a study identified a heterozygous deletion in the TTC23L gene, which removed all of exon 4 and part of the intron on either side. This deletion was found in both biopsies of an embryo and the father, highlighting its potential relevance in genetic screening to prevent severe genetic diseases in IVF newborns (Peters2015Detection).

Additionally, TTC23L has been associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) risk. A study identified TTC23L among the top genes associated with PTC through rare variant analysis, with an odds ratio of 2.85 and a p-value of 0.030, suggesting a potential link to the disease (Bu2023Whole). However, the clinical significance of TTC23L mutations in PTC and other conditions remains to be fully elucidated.

Overall, while TTC23L is associated with certain genetic and cancer-related conditions, further research is needed to clarify its role and the impact of its mutations or expression alterations on human health.

## Interactions
TTC23L, a protein containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, is involved in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and interacts with several other proteins within the ciliary structure. It has been identified as a component of the Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) zone, a region of the cilium crucial for Hh signaling. Through affinity purification and mass spectrometry, TTC23L was found to interact with IQCE and EFCAB7, which are non-transmembrane components of the EvC zone. These interactions suggest that TTC23L plays a role in the assembly or stability of protein complexes within this zone (Breslow2017A).

In Ttc23 knockout cells, there is a moderate reduction in the localization of IQCE and EVC to the EvC zone, indicating that TTC23L is important for the proper positioning of these proteins. Conversely, RNA interference of Iqce results in decreased localization of TTC23L to the EvC zone, highlighting a reciprocal relationship between these proteins (Breslow2017A). These findings establish TTC23L as a novel component of the EvC zone, participating in the regulation of Hh signaling through its interactions with other ciliary proteins.
