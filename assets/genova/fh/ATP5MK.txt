# ATP5MK

## Overview
ATP5MK is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit k, also known as DAPIT, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a significant role in the dimerization and structural integrity of ATP synthase, essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP5MK gene is particularly important in maintaining cellular energy metabolism, as its absence can lead to severe reductions in ATP levels and alterations in mitochondrial cristae structure. In pathological conditions such as ischemic cardiomyopathy, ATP5MK is overexpressed, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to support cardiac function under stress. Mutations in ATP5MK have been linked to severe neurological disorders, including Leigh syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (GiménezEscamilla2024Alterations; Tauchmannová2024Variability).

## Function
ATP5MK encodes a key structural subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, known as DAPIT. This protein is involved in the dimerization of the ATP synthase complex, although it does not form the dimerization interface between ATP synthase monomers. In healthy cells, DAPIT plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of ATP synthase, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Tauchmannová2024Variability). The absence of DAPIT in patient fibroblasts leads to a severe reduction in ATP levels and the absence of the dimeric form of ATP synthase, which in turn alters mitochondrial cristae structure, highlighting its importance in cellular energy metabolism (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

In the context of heart failure, ATP5MK is part of the F0 region of ATP synthase and has been found to be overexpressed in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. This overexpression is correlated with improved cardiac function, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to maintain ATP production and protect cardiac function under stress conditions (GiménezEscamilla2024Alterations). The protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the proton gradient-driven synthesis of ATP, a critical process for cellular energy supply and metabolic activities (GiménezEscamilla2024Alterations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5MK gene, which encodes the DAPIT protein, have been associated with severe Leigh syndrome (LS), a neurological disorder. A specific pathogenic variant, c.87+1G>C, has been identified in four patients from three unrelated families. These patients exhibited symptoms such as developmental delay, ataxia, movement disorders, brain lesions, ophthalmoplegia, accessory spleen, testicular atrophy, fatty liver, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP). The variant leads to the loss of the DAPIT protein due to exon 3 skipping, resulting in a severe reduction of ATP levels and absence of the dimeric form of ATP synthase, which alters mitochondrial cristae structure (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

In the context of heart failure, particularly ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), ATP5MK is overexpressed as part of an adaptive response to increased ATP demand. This overexpression is linked to improved cardiac function and remodeling parameters, suggesting a protective role in cardiac function during energy stress (GiménezEscamilla2024Alterations). The overexpression of ATP5MK and other subunits of complex V is associated with better cardiac outcomes in heart failure patients (GiménezEscamilla2024Alterations).
