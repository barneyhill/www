# ODAD4

## Overview
The ODAD4 gene encodes the protein known as outer dynein arm docking complex subunit 4, which is a vital component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC). This protein plays a crucial role in the motility of cilia and flagella by facilitating the docking of dynein arms to axonemal microtubules, thereby enabling effective ciliary beating. The proper function of ODAD4 is essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and the maintenance of left-right body asymmetry. Mutations in the ODAD4 gene can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary motility and associated clinical symptoms (Zlotina2024Characterization; Lu2024Localisation).

## Function
The ODAD4 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC), which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, ODAD4 plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the outer dynein arms, which are necessary for the proper movement of cilia. These structures are vital for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and the maintenance of left-right body asymmetry (Zlotina2024Characterization).

ODAD4 is involved in the docking of dynein arms to the axonemal microtubules within cilia, facilitating the generation of force required for ciliary beating. This function is crucial for the effective clearance of mucus and pathogens from the respiratory tract, as well as for the proper functioning of other motile cilia in the body (Lu2024Localisation). The protein's role in ciliary function is underscored by its distinct localization patterns in different types of cilia, such as those found in zebrafish, where it shows substantial cytoplasmic accumulation (Lu2024Localisation).

Loss-of-function mutations in ODAD4 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, characterized by reduced ciliary motility and associated clinical symptoms (Zlotina2024Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ODAD4 gene, also known as outer dynein arm docking complex subunit 4, are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. A novel frameshift variant, c.704dup, in the ODAD4 gene has been identified in a 17-year-old girl with PCD. This variant, found in a homozygous state, is predicted to create a premature translational stop signal, leading to a loss of function. The mutation results in total cilia paralysis, contributing to typical respiratory symptoms of PCD and left-right body asymmetry randomization (Zlotina2024Characterization).

The ODAD4 gene is part of the ODA-docking complex machinery, and its loss-of-function variants are linked to reduced ciliary motility. This reduction in motility leads to respiratory issues, chronic infections, and potentially fertility problems due to impaired ciliary movement (Zlotina2024Characterization). The presence of a splicing variant in the ZMYND10 gene in the same patient suggests the possibility of triallelic inheritance, complicating the clinical phenotype and indicating that ODAD4 mutations may interact with other genetic factors to exacerbate PCD symptoms (Zlotina2024Characterization).

## Interactions
ODAD4, also known as outer dynein arm docking complex subunit 4, is a crucial component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) involved in ciliary function. It interacts with several proteins within the ODA-DC, playing a significant role in the assembly and transport of dynein arms into cilia. ODAD4 interacts with Cfap53, a microtubule inner protein, which is essential for the transport of ODAD4 and ODA dyneins into cilia. In Cfap53 mutant mice, the absence of ODAD4 from nodal cilia highlights the importance of this interaction for proper ciliary function (Lu2024Localisation).

ODAD4 is also involved in interactions with other ODA-DC members, such as Odad1 and Odad3, which localize around the basal bodies of cilia, suggesting a role in anchoring dynein arms (Lu2024Localisation). The protein's localization and function are crucial for maintaining ciliary motility, as evidenced by its role in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), where loss-of-function variants in ODAD4 lead to reduced ciliary motility and associated symptoms (Zlotina2024Characterization). These interactions underscore ODAD4's role in the structural and functional integrity of motile cilia.
