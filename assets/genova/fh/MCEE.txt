# MCEE

## Overview
The MCEE gene encodes the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, which is a member of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the metabolic pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA by catalyzing the interconversion of D-methylmalonyl-CoA and L-methylmalonyl-CoA. This process is essential for the degradation of certain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids, contributing to energy production through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Dobson2006Homozygous; Heuberger2019Genetic). The MCEE protein is characterized by its dimeric structure and the presence of a divalent metal ion at its active site, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Heuberger2019Genetic). Mutations in the MCEE gene can lead to methylmalonic aciduria, a metabolic disorder with varying clinical presentations, underscoring the enzyme's importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Yazıcı2022Persistent; Gradinger2007Atypical).

## Structure
The methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCEE) protein is a dimeric enzyme involved in the interconversion of D-methylmalonyl-CoA and L-methylmalonyl-CoA. The primary structure of human MCEE consists of 176 amino acids, encoded by the MCEE gene located on chromosome 2p13.3 (Gradinger2007Atypical). The secondary structure of MCEE includes two βαβββ motifs that form an 8-stranded sheet, which is crucial for completing the active site of the enzyme (Heuberger2019Genetic).

The tertiary structure of MCEE reveals a divalent metal ion, such as cobalt, coordinated by conserved residues His50, His122, and Glu172, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Heuberger2019Genetic). The quaternary structure of MCEE is characterized by its dimeric assembly, which is important for its stability and function (Heuberger2019Genetic).

MCEE is part of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily, sharing a structural motif used to build a divalent metal-containing active site (Heuberger2019Genetic). The enzyme's activity can be influenced by the presence of divalent ions and is susceptible to inactivation by metal-chelating agents (Gradinger2007Atypical).

## Function
The MCEE gene encodes the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of certain amino acids and fatty acids. This enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of D-methylmalonyl-CoA and L-methylmalonyl-CoA, a key step in the catabolic pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is essential for the degradation of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and other metabolites, ultimately contributing to energy production through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Dobson2006Homozygous; Heuberger2019Genetic).

In healthy human cells, the MCEE enzyme is imported into the mitochondria, where it functions to maintain metabolic balance by preventing the accumulation of methylmalonic acid, which can lead to methylmalonic aciduria if not properly metabolized (Gradinger2007Atypical). The enzyme is part of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily, which includes other metalloenzymes that share a common structural motif and are involved in various chemical reactions (Heuberger2019Genetic). The active site of MCEE contains a divalent metal ion that stabilizes the transition state during the conversion process, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal metabolic function (Gradinger2007Atypical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCEE gene, which encodes the methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase enzyme, are associated with methylmalonic aciduria (MMAuria), a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid. This condition can present with a range of symptoms from mild to severe, including developmental delays and metabolic crises. The most common mutation identified is the c.139C>T (p.Arg47*) nonsense mutation, which leads to protein truncation and enzymatic dysfunction (Heuberger2019Genetic; Gradinger2007Atypical). 

Patients with MCEE deficiency often exhibit mild symptoms and do not respond to vitamin B12 treatment. The condition is typically managed with dietary modifications and supplements, such as carnitine, to mitigate metabolic decompensation (Yazıcı2022Persistent). Structural studies have shown that certain missense mutations, like p.Ile53Arg and p.Arg143Cys, disrupt the protein's dimeric assembly and stability, leading to reduced enzymatic activity (Heuberger2019Genetic). 

While MCEE mutations can lead to increased excretion of methylmalonic acid, they are not a common cause of methylmalonic aciduria, and other genetic factors may contribute to the condition (Gradinger2007Atypical). The clinical presentation of MCEE deficiency varies widely, and the necessity of the enzyme under normal conditions remains debated (Gradinger2007Atypical).
