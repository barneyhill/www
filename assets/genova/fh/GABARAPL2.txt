# GABARAPL2

## Overview
GABARAPL2, or Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Atg8 family, which is integral to the autophagy pathway. The protein, also known as GATE-16, is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold and plays a pivotal role in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, essential for cellular homeostasis and degradation of intracellular components (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP; Jatana2019Human). Beyond its autophagic functions, GABARAPL2 is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in intra-Golgi transport, and interacts with various proteins to facilitate these processes (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). The protein's interactions are mediated through its LIR docking site, which is crucial for binding with autophagy receptors and adaptors (Scicluna2021A). GABARAPL2's involvement in cellular defense mechanisms and its dysregulation in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders underscore its clinical significance (El2020Disturbed; Jacquet2020The).

## Structure
GABARAPL2, a member of the GABARAP subfamily of Atg8 proteins, plays a crucial role in autophagy. The protein exhibits a ubiquitin-like fold, characterized by a four-stranded central β-sheet core and two α-helices, which is a common feature among Atg8 family members (Jatana2019Human). The molecular structure of GABARAPL2 includes an N-terminal helical extension and a ubiquitin-like grasp fold, forming the LIR docking site (LDS) with hydrophobic pockets HP1 and HP2. Aromatic and aliphatic residues of LIR motifs insert into these pockets (Scicluna2021A).

The tertiary structure of GABARAPL2 is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds, particularly in the hydrophobic pocket-2, which contributes to its tight packing and stable interactions (Jatana2019Human). The protein's C-terminal Phe117 is involved in mediating crystal contacts, which can block the LDS, suggesting its removal may be necessary for interactions with LIR motifs (Scicluna2021A).

GABARAPL2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as lipidation, which are essential for its function in autophagy. This modification facilitates its role in membrane binding and autophagosome formation (Antón2016Human). The protein's interactions with specific lipids, such as cardiolipin, are influenced by its electrostatic surface potential, which is less basic compared to other Atg8 orthologs (Antón2016Human).

## Function
GABARAPL2, also known as GATE-16, is a member of the Atg8 family of proteins and plays a significant role in autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the elongation and closure of the autophagosome, a critical step in autophagy, by promoting the tethering and fusion of membranes (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). GABARAPL2 interacts with NSF and the calcium channel TRPML3 to facilitate the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome, enabling the degradation of the cargo (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP).

In addition to its role in autophagy, GABARAPL2 is involved in intra-Golgi transport, where it enhances the ATPase activity of NSF and interacts with GOS-28, a Golgi-specific SNARE, to modulate intra-Golgi trafficking (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). This function is independent of autophagy and highlights the protein's involvement in membrane transport processes.

GABARAPL2 is also implicated in selective autophagy, such as xenophagy, where it interacts with autophagy receptors like NDP52 and OPTN to target intracellular pathogens for degradation (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). These interactions underscore its role in cellular defense mechanisms and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
GABARAPL2 is implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, mutations in the GABARAPL2 gene are associated with breast cancer, where they may affect enzymatic activity and contribute to disease progression (Jatana2019Human). The expression of GABARAPL2 is also linked to cancer prognosis; its high expression is generally associated with a favorable prognosis in various cancers, including breast and prostate cancer, while decreased expression is linked to poor outcomes (Jacquet2020The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, GABARAPL2 expression is significantly increased in the blood of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. This dysregulation of autophagy-related genes, including GABARAPL2, suggests a potential link between altered autophagy processes and PD, making it a potential biomarker for the disease (El2020Disturbed).

In the context of inflammatory diseases, GABARAPL2 is upregulated in dry eye disease (DED), where it plays a role in promoting inflammation. Knockdown of GABARAPL2 in a mouse model of DED alleviated pro-inflammatory signals, indicating its involvement in the inflammatory processes of this condition (Yang2021Long).

## Interactions
GABARAPL2, also known as GATE-16, is a protein involved in autophagy and intracellular trafficking. It is part of the Atg8 protein family and interacts with various proteins to facilitate its functions. GABARAPL2 interacts with the immune system GTPase GIMAP6, a relationship that is crucial for the recruitment of GIMAP6 to autophagosomes. This interaction is direct and does not require additional proteins, with the N-terminal region of GABARAPL2 being essential for binding (Pascall2013The; mukadam2019investigation). The interaction is also dependent on the GTPase domain of GIMAP6 (Pascall2013The).

GABARAPL2 also interacts with NSF, enhancing its ATPase activity, and with GOS-28, a Golgi v-SNARE, playing a role in intra-Golgi transport and Golgi reassembly (mukadam2019investigation). Additionally, GABARAPL2 binds to the Parkin associated endothelin-like receptor (PAELR), a G-protein coupled receptor, which may regulate PAELR levels through mechanisms involving ubiquitination and autophagy (Dutta2018A).

The protein's interaction with autophagy receptors and adaptors is mediated through its LIR docking site, which consists of two hydrophobic pockets that interact with LC3-interacting region motifs (Scicluna2021A). These interactions are crucial for its role in autophagosome formation and maturation.
