# CLCA4

## Overview
The CLCA4 gene encodes the chloride channel accessory 4 protein, a member of the calcium-activated chloride channel (CLCA) family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in regulating chloride conductance across epithelial cell membranes. It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including cell differentiation, adhesion, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems (Liu2018CLCA4; Hou2017CLCA4). CLCA4 is expressed in several tissues, such as the brain, small intestine, lung, and colon, where it contributes to maintaining ion homeostasis and fluid balance (Hou2017CLCA4; Piirsoo2009Expression). The gene's involvement in pathological conditions, including certain cancers and cystic fibrosis, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2013Loss; Kolbe2012CLCA4).

## Function
The CLCA4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the calcium-activated chloride channel (CLCA) family, which plays a significant role in chloride conductance in epithelial cells. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, adhesion, apoptosis, and the progression of inflammatory responses in the airway (Liu2018CLCA4; Hou2017CLCA4). In healthy human cells, CLCA4 is expressed in tissues such as the brain, small intestine, lung, and colon, where it contributes to maintaining normal cellular functions (Liu2018CLCA4; Hou2017CLCA4).

CLCA4 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it influences processes like mucus production and airway hydration, impacting respiratory and gastrointestinal functions (Ritzka2004The). The protein's role in chloride conductance is crucial for maintaining ion homeostasis and fluid balance in epithelial tissues (Hou2017CLCA4). The expression of CLCA4 in the brain, particularly in the optic nerve, medulla, and olfactory tract, suggests its involvement in nervous system functions, although its specific role in these tissues is not fully detailed (Piirsoo2009Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The CLCA4 gene is implicated in various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancers, due to its role as a proliferation inhibitor. In breast cancer, CLCA4 is frequently downregulated, which is associated with tumor progression and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enhances cancer cell migration and invasion. This downregulation is observed across all breast cancer subtypes and is linked to lower relapse-free survival, particularly in luminal B breast cancers (Yu2013Loss). In colorectal cancers, especially those with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), CLCA4 frameshift mutations are common. These mutations lead to a loss of CLCA4 expression, which is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of these cancers (Mo2019Frameshift).

CLCA4 also plays a role in cystic fibrosis (CF), where its variants can influence the manifestation of CF-related defects in the intestine. The gene is involved in modulating chloride secretion, and certain CLCA4 promoter haplotypes are associated with differences in chloride conductance among CF patients. This suggests that CLCA4 variants may affect the severity of CF symptoms related to chloride transport (Kolbe2012CLCA4).
