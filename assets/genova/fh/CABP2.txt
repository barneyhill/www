# CABP2

## Overview
CABP2 is a gene that encodes the calcium-binding protein 2 (CaBP2), which is a member of the calcium-binding protein family characterized by EF-hand motifs. These motifs are crucial for the protein's ability to bind calcium ions, playing a significant role in calcium signaling pathways. CaBP2 is particularly important in the auditory system, where it modulates the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels in inner hair cells of the cochlea, thereby influencing synaptic transmission and auditory processing (Picher2017Ca). The protein's interactions with components of the CaV1.3 calcium channel complex and other synaptic proteins are essential for its function in hearing. Mutations in the CABP2 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory health (Yang2018Functions; Marková2016Mutations).

## Structure
CaBP2, a member of the calcium-binding protein family, is characterized by EF-hand motifs that facilitate calcium ion binding. The protein is derived from the human CaBP/calneuron family, which includes six genes, and CaBP2 itself gives rise to two splice variants: CaBP2S and CaBP2L (McCue2010Bioinformatic). The C-terminal region of CaBP2 is conserved and contains EF-hand motifs crucial for calcium binding, although the EF2 motif has undergone deletions or substitutions, potentially affecting its ability to bind cations effectively (McCue2010Bioinformatic). 

CaBP2 has an extended linker region between EF hands 2 and 3 compared to calmodulin, which is highly conserved among CaBPs (McCue2010Bioinformatic). The short forms of CaBP2 exhibit the highest sequence similarity to calmodulin, with around 36% identity, but overall, the CaBPs show limited similarity with calmodulin due to differences in the N-terminal regions (McCue2010Bioinformatic). 

In terms of functional domains, CaBP2 has functional EF hands 3 and 4, which are specific Ca2+-binding types in both zebrafish and human proteins (McCue2010Bioinformatic). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in inhibiting the inactivation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in inner hair cells, which is important for auditory function (Picher2017Ca).

## Function
CaBP2 (calcium-binding protein 2) plays a crucial role in the auditory system by modulating calcium signaling pathways in inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea. It primarily functions by inhibiting the inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels, specifically CaV1.3 channels, which are essential for the transmission of sound information at ribbon synapses between IHCs and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) (Picher2017Ca). This inhibition is vital for maintaining the availability of these channels for synaptic sound encoding, ensuring reliable excitation-secretion coupling during ongoing sound stimulation (Picher2017Ca).

CaBP2 is expressed in IHCs, outer hair cells (OHCs), and vestibular hair cells, but not in cochlear SGNs (Picher2017Ca). It acts as a low-affinity calcium buffer, preventing excessive calcium spread and potentially reducing extrasynaptic exocytosis (Picher2017Ca). The absence of CaBP2 leads to enhanced inactivation of CaV1.3 channels, resulting in impaired synaptic transmission and auditory function, as observed in conditions like DFNB93, a form of autosomal-recessive deafness (Picher2017Ca). This protein's role in calcium buffering and channel regulation is crucial for normal auditory processing and sound perception.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CABP2 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically classified as DFNB93. This condition is characterized by pre-lingual hearing impairment, which is not accompanied by other syndromic features. Studies have identified specific variants in CABP2 that are predicted to be damaging, such as c.227G>A (p.Arg76Gln) and c.466G>A (p.Glu156Lys), which have been linked to hearing loss in certain populations (Marková2016Mutations). Although these mutations are not common causes of hearing loss in the Czech population, they may still contribute to the condition in some cases (Marková2016Mutations).

Research on mice lacking the CaBP2 protein has shown significant auditory impairments, indicating the gene's crucial role in normal auditory function. CaBP2 knockout mice exhibit elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds and reduced distortion product otoacoustic emissions, suggesting impaired function of outer hair cells and the cochlear amplifier (Yang2018Functions). These findings underscore the importance of CaBP2 in sensory processing within the cochlea and its potential impact on hearing when mutated or otherwise altered (Yang2018Functions).

## Interactions
CaBP2 interacts with several components of the CaV1.3 calcium channel complex in inner hair cells, including the CaV1.3α1 splice variant, auxiliary CaVβ2, and CaVα2δ2 subunits. It also interacts with other proteins such as Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM), harmonin, and calmodulin, which are involved in synaptic function and calcium signaling (Picher2017Ca). These interactions are crucial for modulating the inactivation of CaV1.3 channels, thereby influencing synaptic vesicle release and auditory processing.

In the context of protein folding, CaBP2 contains thioredoxin domains and serves as a substrate for thioredoxin reductase. It shares catalytic properties with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in thiol-disulfide interchange reactions, although it lacks the peptide-binding and substrate interaction capabilities of PDI (KRAMER2001Functional; LundströmLjung1995Two). Despite its role in these reactions, CaBP2 does not exhibit significant activity in non-oxidative refolding compared to PDI (KRAMER2001Functional).

CaBP2 is also phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2, which may affect its conformation and function, although the physiological implications of this modification are not fully understood (Janson1997Phosphorylation).
