# APOLD1

## Overview
APOLD1, or apolipoprotein L domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the vascular system. The protein encoded by APOLD1 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which plays a crucial role in endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. It is implicated in the regulation of vascular permeability and endothelial cell signaling, contributing to the adaptive response to physiological and pathological stressors. APOLD1's expression and activity are significant in pathological angiogenesis, such as in ischemic conditions and tumor growth, where it influences blood flow recovery and endothelial cell proliferation (Fan2023The; Øster2012Non‐CpG). The gene's regulation through DNA methylation and its dispensability in normal developmental angiogenesis highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by aberrant angiogenesis (Fan2023The; Øster2012Non‐CpG).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
APOLD1 plays a significant role in pathological angiogenesis, which is crucial in conditions such as ischemia-induced revascularization and tumor growth. In ischemic conditions like hindlimb ischemia and stroke, APOLD1 deletion impairs angiogenesis, leading to reduced blood flow recovery and muscle regeneration, highlighting its importance in revascularization and functional recovery (Fan2023The). In cancer, APOLD1 expression is dysregulated through DNA methylation, with hypomethylation observed in colorectal cancer, which is associated with increased gene expression and potentially contributes to tumorigenesis (Øster2012Non‐CpG). In a melanoma mouse model, APOLD1 deletion resulted in reduced tumor growth and impaired tumor perfusion due to decreased endothelial cell proliferation, suggesting its role in controlling endothelial proliferation in tumors (Fan2023The). These findings indicate that APOLD1 is involved in the adaptive response to stress and may fine-tune angiogenic responses, with potential implications for cancer treatment by inhibiting uncontrolled endothelial proliferation (Fan2023The). Despite its role in pathological angiogenesis, APOLD1 is dispensable for normal developmental angiogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where pathological angiogenesis is a factor (Fan2023The).
