# TOM1L2

## Overview
TOM1L2 is a gene that encodes the target of myb1 like 2 membrane trafficking protein, which is a member of the ESCRT-0 protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in membrane trafficking, particularly in the retrieval of ubiquitinated proteins from cilia, and is involved in endosomal sorting and ciliary trafficking. The protein contains specific domains, such as the VHS and GAT domains, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and lipids. These interactions facilitate the protein's function as an adaptor, bridging ubiquitin chains to the BBSome complex, thereby regulating the exit of proteins from cilia. TOM1L2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including autophagy and the endolysosomal pathway, and its dysfunction can lead to ciliopathy symptoms. The gene has been associated with diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and has been linked to musculoskeletal traits like bone mineral density and lean mass (Shinde2022The; Groen2023Genetic; MedinaGomez2017Bivariate).

## Structure
TOM1L2 is a protein involved in membrane trafficking and is part of the ESCRT-0 protein family. It contains specific domains that are crucial for its function, including the VHS (Vps27, Hrs, and STAM) domain and the GAT (GGA and TOM1) domain located at its N-terminus (Shinde2022The; Roach2021Protein). These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins and lipids, playing a significant role in endosomal sorting and ciliary trafficking (Shinde2022The).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of TOM1L2 is more divergent and is responsible for interactions with the ESCRT-I subunit TSG101, MYO6, and clathrin (Shinde2022The). A specific 73 amino acid region within the CTD, particularly a 30 amino acid segment, is crucial for binding to the BBSome complex, with a BBSome-binding motif identified as 388 EVWLR 392 (Shinde2022The). This motif is essential for the protein's role in ciliary retrieval of ubiquitinated cargoes (Shinde2022The).

TOM1L2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and localization (Roach2021Protein). The evolutionary conservation of TOM1L2's function is suggested by its role in the single-cell organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Shinde2022The).

## Function
TOM1L2 is a membrane trafficking protein that plays a crucial role in the retrieval of ubiquitinated proteins from cilia, particularly G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It functions as an adaptor that bridges ubiquitin chains, specifically Lysine 63-linked ubiquitin (UbK63) chains, to the BBSome complex, facilitating the exit of these proteins from cilia (Shinde2022The). This process is essential for maintaining ciliary function and regulating signal transduction pathways, such as the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Shinde2022The).

TOM1L2 is part of the TOM1 family of proteins, which are conserved ubiquitin adaptors involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and endosomal sorting (Shinde2022The). In mammals, TOM1L2 is implicated in the endolysosomal pathway, escorting ubiquitinated proteins from cilia to the lysosome (Shinde2022The). The protein's interaction with the BBSome is critical for the regulated exit of GPCRs from cilia, acting as a bridge between ubiquitinated proteins and the retrieval machinery (Shinde2022The).

The absence or dysfunction of TOM1L2 can lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins within cilia, disrupting normal cellular signaling and potentially contributing to ciliopathy symptoms (Shinde2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TOM1L2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In pulmonary fibrosis (PF), particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a variant in TOM1L2 results in an amino acid substitution in the conserved VHS domain. This variant is associated with increased TOM1L2 RNA expression in IPF lung tissue, suggesting a role in disease processes despite normal telomere length in affected cells (Groen2023Genetic). The TOM1L2 gene is also involved in vesicular transport and trafficking, and its interaction with clathrin and myosin VI suggests a role in endosomal sorting, which may contribute to PF pathogenesis (Groen2023Genetic).

In musculoskeletal traits, the TOM1L2 locus has been associated with bone mineral density and lean mass in pediatric populations. Genetic variations at this locus may influence these traits through mechanisms involving muscle expression, although the exact implications of TOM1L2 mutations are not fully understood (MedinaGomez2017Bivariate).

Additionally, TOM1L2 is involved in the retrieval of ubiquitinated proteins from cilia, and its deficiency in mouse models leads to symptoms such as infections, tumors, and renal cysts, indicating potential clinical significance in human diseases related to ciliary dysfunction (Shinde2022The).

## Interactions
TOM1L2 is a protein involved in membrane trafficking and interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in ciliary function. It is part of the ESCRT-0 protein family and is involved in endosomal sorting through the recognition of ubiquitin chains. TOM1L2 interacts directly with the BBSome, a complex involved in ciliary trafficking, facilitating the retrieval of ubiquitinated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from cilia. This interaction is mediated by a specific 30 amino acid segment within the C-terminal domain of TOM1L2, which contains the BBSome-binding motif (BBM) identified as the 388 EVWLR 392 motif (Shinde2022The).

TOM1L2 also interacts with ubiquitin (Ub) and is essential for the retrieval of ubiquitinated GPCRs from cilia. Its interaction with Ub and the BBSome is crucial for this retrieval process, as demonstrated by experiments showing that mutations disrupting these interactions prevent the exit of GPCRs from cilia (Shinde2022The). Additionally, TOM1L2 interacts with MYO6, although the binding sites for MYO6 and the BBSome on TOM1L2 are separable, indicating distinct roles in ciliary trafficking (Shinde2022The). These interactions highlight TOM1L2's role as an adaptor protein bridging ubiquitinated cargoes to the ciliary exit machinery.
