# RRH

## Overview
The RRH gene encodes the retinal pigment epithelium-derived rhodopsin homolog, a member of the opsin family of proteins, which are integral to the function of photoreceptive cells. This protein is classified as a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), characterized by its seven transmembrane helices that facilitate the binding of a retinaldehyde chromophore, a derivative of vitamin A. The RRH protein is predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting a specialized role in visual processes or retinal health. Its structural features, including a critical lysine residue in the seventh transmembrane helix, underscore its function in photoreception and potential interactions with other cellular components (Bellingham2003In).

## Structure
The RRH gene encodes a protein that is part of the opsin family, which are membrane-bound, heptahelical G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Bellingham2003In). The primary structure of the RRH protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming seven transmembrane helices, a characteristic feature of GPCRs. These helices are crucial for the protein's function in photoreception, as they facilitate the binding of a vitamin A-based retinaldehyde chromophore. A lysine residue in the seventh transmembrane α-helix is essential for retinal attachment, highlighting its role in the protein's function (Bellingham2003In).

The secondary structure of RRH includes alpha-helices, which contribute to the protein's overall conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, necessary for its function as a receptor. While specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, the protein's role as a GPCR suggests potential interactions with other proteins or receptors.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The RRH protein is uniquely expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium, indicating a specialized function within this tissue (Bellingham2003In).
