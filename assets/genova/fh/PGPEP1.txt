# PGPEP1

## Overview
The PGPEP1 gene encodes the enzyme pyroglutamyl-peptidase I, a member of the cysteine peptidase family, specifically classified under peptidase family C15. This enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of N-terminal pyroglutamyl residues from peptides and proteins, a critical function in the regulation of peptide hormones and the degradation of biologically active peptides. Pyroglutamyl-peptidase I is predominantly a cytosolic enzyme, requiring thiol-reducing agents for its activity, and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking agents, underscoring its reliance on a cysteine residue for catalysis. The enzyme is expressed in various human tissues, including the cerebral cortex, kidney, and skeletal muscle, where it plays a vital role in processes such as protein maturation, turnover, and the inactivation of neuropeptides like thyrotropin-releasing hormone and neurotensin (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase; Cummins1998Pyroglutamyl).

## Structure
The human pyroglutamyl-peptidase I (PGPEP1) enzyme consists of 209 amino acids and is characterized by a conserved catalytic triad composed of Glu81, Cys144, and His168, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase). The enzyme belongs to the peptidase family C15 and shares significant homology with its mouse counterpart, with a 95% identity in amino acid sequence (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase).

The tertiary structure of PGPEP1 has been modeled based on the crystal structures of bacterial pyroglutamyl-peptidases from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Thermococcus litoralis. This model reveals a similar organization of β-strands, α-helices, and loops, with a notable structural difference being a shorter loop in the human enzyme, which may contribute to its monomeric nature (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase). The enzyme's molecular mass is approximately 24 kDa, consistent with its monomeric form (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase).

PGPEP1 is a cytosolic enzyme and requires thiol-reducing agents for full activity, indicating a thiol-dependent catalytic mechanism (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase). The enzyme is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking agents, which further supports the importance of its cysteine residue in catalysis (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase).

## Function
The PGPEP1 gene encodes the enzyme pyroglutamyl-peptidase I, a cytosolic cysteine peptidase involved in the hydrolysis of N-terminal pyroglutamyl residues from peptides and proteins. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the regulation of peptide hormones and the degradation of biologically active peptides, impacting processes such as protein maturation and turnover (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase; Cummins1998Pyroglutamyl). Pyroglutamyl-peptidase I is expressed in various tissues, including the human cerebral cortex, kidney, and skeletal muscle, and is particularly active in the cytosol (Cummins1998Pyroglutamyl). 

The enzyme's activity is dependent on thiol-reducing agents and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents, indicating its classification as a cysteine peptidase (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase). It plays a role in the inactivation of neuropeptides such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and neurotensin by removing the protective pyroglutamyl-blocking group, which may increase the intracellular pool of free pyroglutamate (Dando2003Pyroglutamylpeptidase). This function is significant in maintaining cellular signaling and homeostasis, as well as in the potential recycling of neuropeptides back to the amino acid pool (Cummins1998Pyroglutamyl).
