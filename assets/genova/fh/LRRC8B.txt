# LRRC8B

## Overview
The LRRC8B gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 8 VRAC subunit B, which is a component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is integral to cellular volume regulation by facilitating the efflux of chloride ions and other osmolytes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis during osmotic stress (Kasuya2022Recent). LRRC8B forms heteromeric channels with other LRRC8 subunits, such as LRRC8A, contributing to the diversity and functionality of VRACs, which exhibit distinct ion permeability and voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics (König2019Biophysics). Additionally, LRRC8B has been implicated in calcium homeostasis, particularly in the context of calcium leak from the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a broader role in intracellular calcium regulation (GaitánPeñas2018Expression).

## Function
LRRC8B is a subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), which plays a crucial role in cellular volume regulation by mediating the efflux of chloride ions and other osmolytes. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly during osmotic stress (Kasuya2022Recent). In healthy human cells, LRRC8B is primarily active in the plasma membrane and is involved in cell signaling and apoptosis (Kasuya2022Recent).

The function of LRRC8B in VRACs is characterized by its interaction with other LRRC8 subunits, such as LRRC8A, to form heteromeric channels. These channels exhibit varying biophysical properties, including ion permeability and voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics, depending on the specific subunit composition (König2019Biophysics). Although LRRC8B has not been described to have transport abilities beyond inorganic ions, its presence in VRACs contributes to the channel's overall function and diversity (König2019Biophysics).

LRRC8B has also been linked to calcium homeostasis, as its expression in HEK293 cells has been associated with calcium leak in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a potential role in regulating intracellular calcium levels (GaitánPeñas2018Expression). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific functions and mechanisms of LRRC8B in healthy human cells.
