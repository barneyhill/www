# OR52P1

## Overview
The OR52P1 gene encodes a member of the olfactory receptor family 52, subfamily P, member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are responsible for detecting odorant molecules and initiating the neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The protein encoded by OR52P1 is a transmembrane receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. While the OR52P1 gene is classified as a pseudogene in some individuals, indicating that it may not be functional in all humans, it still plays a role in the diversity of olfactory receptors that contribute to the complexity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
