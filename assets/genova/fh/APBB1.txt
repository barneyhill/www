# APBB1

## Overview
The APBB1 gene encodes the protein amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 1, commonly referred to as Fe65. This protein is a multidomain adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway. Fe65 is characterized by its N-terminal α-helical domain and three protein-protein interaction modules, including a WW domain and two phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate its interaction with APP and other proteins (Feilen2017Fe65PTB2). The interaction between Fe65 and APP is significant for the nuclear translocation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD), influencing transcriptional activity and cellular processes (Probst2020Fe65). Fe65 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer, due to its role in modulating APP processing and signaling pathways (Kim2011A; Lee2017APBB1).

## Structure
The APBB1 protein, also known as Fe65, is a multidomain protein involved in interactions with the amyloid precursor protein (APP). It contains an N-terminal α-helical domain and three protein-protein interaction modules: a WW domain and two phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. The C-terminal PTB2 domain is crucial for binding to the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which includes the GYENPTY internalization sequence (Feilen2017Fe65PTB2). The Fe65-PTB2 domain, consisting of residues 534-667, can form monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric species. Dimerization involves a structural transition of the C-terminal α-helix α3, which unwinds to form an extended β-conformation, stabilizing the dimer interface through a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues (C661) (Feilen2017Fe65PTB2).

The Fe65-PTB2 domain's dimerization mimics its interaction with AICD, blocking the AICD binding site and involving antiparallel β-augmentation with the G 681 YE sequence of AICD (Feilen2017Fe65PTB2). The protein's quaternary structure is stabilized by a disulfide bridge, and the tetrameric assembly is mediated by a newly formed β-strand (Feilen2017Fe65PTB2). APBB1 has several splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions (Chen2008Association). The Fe65a2 isoform, lacking the last exon, does not dimerize and is associated with resistance to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Feilen2017Fe65PTB2).

## Function
The APBB1 gene encodes the Fe65 protein, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation mediated by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in healthy human cells. Fe65 is involved in the nuclear signaling function of the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is released through regulated intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase. This protein is unique among its family members in supporting the translocation of AICD to nuclear spots, facilitating its transcriptional activity (Probst2020Fe65).

Fe65 acts as a transcription factor and relies on the lysine acetyltransferase Tip60 for nuclear translocation. The interaction between Fe65 and APP is crucial, as evidenced by similar phenotypes in APP and Fe65 family-knockout mice, which show cortical dysplasia and deficits in neuromuscular synapse formation (Probst2020Fe65). In the nucleus, Fe65 localizes with Tip60 in AFT spots, which are sites of transcription. The transcriptional activity of Fe65 is enhanced by co-expression with APP or AICD, and it is the only member of its family that acts as a transcription factor regulated by APP processing (Probst2020Fe65).

Fe65 also interacts with other transmembrane proteins, and its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity are influenced by γ-secretase cleavage of APP. The phosphorylation of APP and Fe65 regulates their interaction, impacting transcriptional signaling (Probst2020Fe65).

## Clinical Significance
The APBB1 gene, also known as Fe65, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling and protein interactions. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), APBB1 is associated with cancer stem cell properties and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are crucial for cancer progression and metastasis. Alterations in APBB1 expression can enhance the IGF1R signaling pathway, leading to increased radiation resistance and poor prognosis in lung cancer cells (Lee2017APBB1).

In Alzheimer's disease, APBB1 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is involved in the regulation of β-amyloid secretion. This interaction is significant because β-amyloid is a principal component of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. Overexpression of APBB1 can increase the secretion of β-amyloid, suggesting that dysregulation of APBB1 may contribute to the disease's etiology (Sabo1999Regulation).

APBB1 has also been identified as a candidate gene in early-onset familial colorectal cancer, linked to DNA repair pathways, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Jansen2019Novel). Additionally, APBB1 is highlighted as a candidate gene in syndromic congenital heart disease, suggesting its involvement in developmental disorders (Sevim2020De).

## Interactions
APBB1, also known as Fe65, is a protein that interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its phosphotyrosine-binding domain 2 (PTB2). This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is involved in transcriptional regulation (Probst2020Fe65). APBB1 also interacts with Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase, facilitating the nuclear localization of both proteins. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region and the PTB1 domain of APBB1, and it is essential for the formation of nuclear complexes known as AFT spots, which are involved in transcription (Probst2020Fe65).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, APBB1 competes with APBB2 for binding to the C-terminal motif of APP, as demonstrated by FRET-FACS analysis. This competitive binding affects the amyloidogenic processing of APP (Kim2011A). APBB1 also interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor beta (IGF1Rb) in non-small-cell lung cancer cells, enhancing the IGF1Rb/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is significant for cancer stem cell properties and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Lee2017APBB1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of APBB1 in both neurodegenerative and cancer-related processes.
