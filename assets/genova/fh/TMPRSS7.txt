# TMPRSS7

## Overview
TMPRSS7, or transmembrane protease serine 7, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease known as matriptase-3. This protease is characterized by its serine protease domain, which includes a conserved catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity. TMPRSS7 is anchored to the plasma membrane, allowing its protease domain to function extracellularly. The protein is involved in proteolytic processing, which is crucial for cellular communication and function across various tissues, including the brain, skin, and reproductive organs. TMPRSS7's potential roles in auditory processes and its implications in breast cancer risk and survival highlight its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored; Luostari2014Type; Antalis2016Extracellular:).

## Structure
TMPRSS7, also known as matriptase-3, is a type II transmembrane serine protease. It is characterized by a serine protease domain, which includes a conserved catalytic triad of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, essential for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural). The protein is anchored to the plasma membrane through a transmembrane domain, positioning the protease extracellularly (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). 

The extracellular region of TMPRSS7 may contain structural domains such as the LDL receptor class A (LDLRA) and scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are common in the TMPRSS subfamily and contribute to substrate specificity and localization (Antalis2016Extracellular:). TMPRSS7 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, skin, salivary gland, and reproductive tissues (Antalis2016Extracellular:).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are likely, as TMPRSS7 is described as a glycosylated protein (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and localization. However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMPRSS7 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMPRSS7, encoded by the TMPRSS7 gene, is a type II transmembrane serine protease that is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, skin, eye, salivary gland, and reproductive tissues such as the prostate, testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterus (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). The protein is located on the cell surface and is involved in proteolytic processing, which is crucial for cellular communication and function (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

The recombinant catalytic domain of matriptase-3, which is highly homologous to TMPRSS7, can hydrolyze synthetic peptide substrates with a preference for arginine in the P1 position. It also shows proteolytic activity toward macromolecular substrates like gelatin, casein, and albumin (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). This suggests that TMPRSS7 may have similar substrate preferences and proteolytic activities, although specific studies on TMPRSS7's substrates are not detailed in the available literature.

TMPRSS7 is also expressed in the modiolus and spiral ganglion of the inner ear, indicating a potential role in auditory processes, although its exact function in hearing remains to be fully elucidated (Guipponi2007An). The physiological function of TMPRSS7 in healthy human cells is still under investigation, with no loss of function studies reported to date (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

## Clinical Significance
The TMPRSS7 gene, encoding transmembrane serine protease 7, has been implicated in breast cancer risk and survival. A study identified the intronic variant rs1844925 in TMPRSS7 as being associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This variant is located near a missense variant, rs11929695, which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1844925 and may alter amino acid sequences, potentially affecting protein function (Luostari2014Type). Another SNP, rs2399403, in TMPRSS7 was found to be associated with breast cancer survival, suggesting a role in disease progression and prognosis (Luostari2014Type).

The study highlights that genetic alterations in TMPRSS7 may disrupt its function, leading to enhanced proteolysis and epithelial disorder, which could contribute to cancer onset and progression. These findings support a polygenic risk model for breast cancer, where an increased number of risk alleles, including those in TMPRSS7, enhances the risk of developing the disease (Luostari2014Type). Despite these associations, TMPRSS7 had not been previously reported in breast tissue or breast cancer, indicating the novelty of these findings (Luostari2014Type).
