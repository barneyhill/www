# SLC6A14

## Overview
SLC6A14 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 6 member 14, also known as ATB0,+, which is a sodium- and chloride-dependent amino acid transporter. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 6 and is characterized by its 12 transmembrane α-helices, which are typical of this family, and a LeuT-fold core structure. SLC6A14 plays a crucial role in the uptake of neutral and basic amino acids, utilizing a Na+/Cl− gradient to facilitate transport across the plasma membrane. This energy-coupled transport mechanism allows SLC6A14 to concentrate substrates within cells, distinguishing it from other transporters. The protein is predominantly expressed on the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the lung and ileum/colon, where it contributes to amino acid homeostasis. SLC6A14's broad substrate specificity and interaction with heat shock proteins for proper folding and trafficking underscore its importance in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and cystic fibrosis (Palazzolo2019SLC6A14; RogalaKoziarska2019Amino; Sikder2017The).

## Structure
The SLC6A14 protein, also known as ATB0,+, is a member of the solute carrier family 6 and functions as a sodium- and chloride-dependent amino acid transporter. It is characterized by 12 transmembrane α-helices, which are typical of the SLC6 family, and is predicted to have a LeuT-fold core structure. This fold consists of a 5 + 5 transmembrane spanning domain inverted structural repeat, a common motif in the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily (Palazzolo2019SLC6A14; Anderson2022Reshaping).

The primary structure of SLC6A14 includes specific residues crucial for substrate interaction, such as Asp478, Tyr321, and Tyr132, with Tyr321 playing a significant role in the gating mechanism (Palazzolo2019SLC6A14). The protein's secondary structure is composed of α-helices and β-strands, which are conserved throughout molecular dynamics simulations (Palazzolo2019SLC6A14).

Post-translational modifications of SLC6A14 include glycosylation, with potential sites in its extracellular loops, and phosphorylation at residues such as Ser40 and Ser261, which may influence its function and localization (Palazzolo2019SLC6A14; Kovalchuk2019Trafficking). The protein's trafficking to the plasma membrane involves an exclusive interaction with SEC24C, a component of the COPII complex, which is crucial for its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (Kovalchuk2019Trafficking).

## Function
The SLC6A14 gene encodes a Na+/Cl−-coupled amino acid transporter, which is involved in the uptake of neutral and basic amino acids in a Na/Cl-dependent manner. This transporter is active in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption and cellular metabolism by supplying amino acids necessary for anabolic processes and nucleotide synthesis (RogalaKoziarska2019Amino). SLC6A14 is energized by a Na+ gradient, a Cl- gradient, and a membrane potential, allowing it to concentrate substrates inside cells, which distinguishes it from other transporters that are not energy-coupled (Sikder2017The).

The transporter interacts with cytosolic heat shock proteins (HSPs), specifically HSP90-beta and HSP70, which are essential for its proper folding and trafficking to the cell surface. Inhibition of these HSPs can lead to reduced presence of SLC6A14 at the cell surface by directing it towards endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (RogalaKoziarska2019Amino). SLC6A14's broad substrate specificity allows it to support cell growth by providing essential amino acids like arginine, glutamine, and leucine, which are vital for cell growth and proliferation (RogalaKoziarska2019Amino). The transporter is primarily located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the lung and ileum/colon, suggesting its role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis (Sikder2017The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC6A14 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role as an amino acid transporter. In cancer, particularly pancreatic, cervical, colorectal, and breast cancers, SLC6A14 is significantly upregulated, supporting tumor growth and proliferation by facilitating amino acid import. Its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer, and blocking the transporter can reduce tumor growth and invasion (Sikder2017The; Nałęcz2020Amino). In cystic fibrosis (CF), SLC6A14 acts as a genetic modifier, influencing the severity of symptoms such as lung disease and meconium ileus. Variants in the gene are linked to differences in disease manifestations, potentially affecting CFTR function through nitric oxide signaling (Ruffin2020Update; Ahmadi2018SLC6A14).

SLC6A14 is also associated with obesity, particularly in women, where specific SNPs may alter transporter expression, influencing appetite regulation through serotonin precursor availability (Sikder2017The). In inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis, SLC6A14 is upregulated in inflamed tissues, suggesting a role in tissue repair and maintenance of epithelial barrier function (Sikder2017The). These findings highlight SLC6A14's potential as a therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
The SLC6A14 protein, also known as ATB0,+, interacts with several proteins that influence its trafficking and function. One significant interaction is with the SEC24C protein, a component of the COPII complex, which is crucial for the transport of SLC6A14 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. This interaction is specific to SEC24C and is necessary for the proper exit of SLC6A14 from the ER (Kovalchuk2019Trafficking).

SLC6A14 also interacts with heat shock proteins, particularly HSP90-beta and HSP70 (HSPA14). These interactions are essential for the proper folding and trafficking of SLC6A14 to the cell surface. Inhibition of HSP90 or HSP70 leads to a decrease in SLC6A14 presence on the plasma membrane, directing it to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway due to improper folding (RogalaKoziarska2019Amino). The interaction with HSP90-beta involves specific regions of SLC6A14, affecting the ATPase activity of HSP90-beta, which is crucial for the chaperone's function (RogalaKoziarska2019Amino).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing SLC6A14 trafficking and function, with implications for its role in cancer cell metabolism and survival.
