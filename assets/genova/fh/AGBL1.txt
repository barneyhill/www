# AGBL1

## Overview
The AGBL1 gene encodes the AGBL carboxypeptidase 1 protein, a metallocarboxypeptidase that plays a critical role in the deglutamylation of polyglutamylated proteins, such as tubulin. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining microtubule stability and function, which are vital for various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular transport (Zhang2019A; Riazuddin2013Mutations). The AGBL1 protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules to regulate their dynamics by removing glutamate residues (Zhang2019A). Mutations in the AGBL1 gene have been linked to diseases such as Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), highlighting its clinical significance (Riazuddin2013Mutations). Additionally, certain polymorphisms in AGBL1 have been associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in specific populations, indicating its broader implications in human health (Zhang2019A).

## Function
The AGBL1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a metallocarboxypeptidase, primarily involved in the deglutamylation of polyglutamylated proteins, such as tubulin. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton (Zhang2019A; Riazuddin2013Mutations). The AGBL1 protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubules to regulate their dynamics by removing glutamate residues from polyglutamylated tubulin (Zhang2019A).

In healthy human cells, the AGBL1 protein's role in modulating microtubule stability influences several cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and signaling pathways. These processes are vital for normal cellular function and organismal development (Zhang2019A). The protein's activity is particularly significant in tissues where microtubule dynamics are critical, such as in the corneal endothelium, where it has been implicated in maintaining normal corneal endothelial function (Riazuddin2013Mutations).

Mutations in AGBL1 can disrupt its normal function, leading to altered protein interactions and contributing to diseases such as Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) (Riazuddin2013Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGBL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). AGBL1 mutations, such as missense and nonsense mutations, are associated with dominant late-onset FECD. These mutations alter protein-protein interactions with TCF4, a transcription factor linked to FECD, and reduce the binding affinity to TCF4, potentially contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Riazuddin2013Mutations; Eghrari2015Fuchs). The AGBL1 gene is also involved in the deglutamylation of polyglutamylated proteins, a process necessary for neuronal survival, and its dysfunction may have broader implications (Eghrari2015Fuchs).

In addition to FECD, AGBL1 polymorphisms have been associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in Chinese nonsmoking females. The rs4513061 polymorphism, particularly the AA genotype, is linked to a reduced risk of various lung cancer types, including adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma (Zhang2019A). Despite these associations, the causal role of AGBL1 variants in FECD remains unconfirmed, with some studies indicating no expression of AGBL1 in corneal endothelial cells, suggesting a need for further research (Tsedilina2023Systematic).
