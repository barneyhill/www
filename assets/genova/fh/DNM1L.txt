# DNM1L

## Overview
The DNM1L gene encodes the dynamin 1-like protein, also known as DRP1, which is a member of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission, processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy distribution. DRP1 is primarily located in the cytosol and is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it assembles into oligomeric structures to mediate membrane constriction and division. The protein's activity is regulated through various post-translational modifications and interactions with other mitochondrial proteins. Mutations in the DNM1L gene can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including severe neurological and mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular function and human health (Liu2021DNM1LRelated; Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants; Assia2019De).

## Structure
The DNM1L gene encodes the dynamin 1-like protein, also known as DRP1, which is a member of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission. The protein structure includes several key domains: the N-terminal GTPase domain, the middle domain, and the GTPase effector domain (GED) (Assia2019De; Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants). The GTPase domain is responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, driving the conformational changes necessary for membrane fission (Wei2021Case). The middle domain is crucial for the tetramerization of the protein, which is essential for its function in forming higher-order oligomeric structures (Ashrafian2010A; Chao2016Missense). The GED domain stimulates GTPase activity and participates in the formation and stability of the DRP1 homodimer complex (Assia2019De).

DRP1 forms a tetramer in its quaternary structure, facilitating its role in membrane remodeling (Assia2019De). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. DRP1 has nine known isoforms resulting from differential splicing, which include variations in the GTPase and variable domains (Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants). These isoforms differ in their GTPase rates in the presence of cardiolipin or the DRP1 recruiter MFF, indicating functional diversity (Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants).

## Function
The DNM1L gene encodes the dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase crucial for mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission in human cells. Drp1 is predominantly located in the cytosol and is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane by receptor proteins such as mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), Fis1, MiD49, and MiD51. Upon recruitment, Drp1 assembles into higher-order oligomeric complexes at mitochondria-ER contact sites, forming helical or filamentous structures that encircle mitochondrial tubules (Whitley2019Mitochondrial; Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants).

The fission process is driven by the binding and hydrolysis of GTP, which induces conformational changes in Drp1, leading to membrane constriction and scission. This activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial network morphology, ensuring even distribution of mitochondrial content, and regulating mitochondrial activity (Liu2021DNM1LRelated). Drp1's role in mitochondrial division is vital for distributing mitochondria throughout the cell and facilitating the selective degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy (Whitley2019Mitochondrial).

Disruptions in Drp1 function can lead to impaired mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in developmental delays, neurological disorders, and other health issues (Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNM1L gene are associated with a range of severe neurological and mitochondrial disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to DNM1L mutations is encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission 1 (EMPF1), which is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, epilepsy, and can be fatal in early childhood (Liu2021DNM1LRelated; Zhang2024A). Variants in the DNM1L gene can lead to a broad spectrum of neurological phenotypes, including developmental delay, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and epilepsy (Assia2019De; Wei2021Case). 

Mutations in different domains of the DNM1L protein result in varying severities of symptoms. Variants in the GTPase domain are often associated with milder phenotypes, such as isolated optic atrophy, while mutations in the middle domain can cause severe encephalopathy with epilepsy (Liu2021DNM1LRelated; Zhang2024A). Additionally, DNM1L mutations have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunctions that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (Assia2019De). These mutations can disrupt mitochondrial dynamics, leading to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and impaired cellular functions (Verrigni2019Clinicalgenetic).

## Interactions
The DNM1L gene encodes the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), which is crucial for mitochondrial fission. DRP1 interacts with several proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, including mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MID49, MID51), and mitochondrial fission 1 (FIS1). These interactions facilitate the recruitment of DRP1 to mitochondria, where it assembles into oligomeric structures to mediate mitochondrial division (Liu2021DNM1LRelated).

DRP1's interaction with MID49 is particularly significant, as mutations in DRP1 can disrupt this interaction, affecting mitochondrial recruitment and fission activity (Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants). DRP1 also interacts with hexokinase 2 (HK2) in hypoxic conditions, influencing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and mitochondrial dynamics in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Cai2019Hypoxia‑induced).

Mutations in DNM1L can impair DRP1's ability to form higher-order oligomers, affecting its function in mitochondrial fission. These mutations can lead to altered interactions with other proteins, such as those involved in the GTPase activity and stability of DRP1, impacting its role in cellular energy regulation (Nolden2022NovelDNM1Lvariants).
