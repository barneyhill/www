# AEBP1

## Overview
AEBP1, or Adipocyte Enhancer-Binding Protein 1, is a gene that encodes the aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP), a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional repression and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. ACLP is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a discoidin domain, a carboxypeptidase domain, and a C-terminal domain, each contributing to its diverse biological functions. As a transcriptional repressor, AEBP1 modulates various signaling pathways, including those involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB, through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (Lyons2006Modeling; Majdalawieh2010Regulation). The protein plays a critical role in collagen fibrillogenesis, essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues, and is implicated in processes such as fibroblast proliferation and differentiation (Blackburn2018Biallelic). Mutations in AEBP1 are linked to classical-like Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type 2 (clEDS2), highlighting its clinical significance in connective tissue disorders (Syx2019Biallelic; Ha2024Clinical).

## Structure
AEBP1 (AE binding protein 1) is a transcriptional repressor with a complex molecular structure comprising three distinct domains: an N-terminal discoidin domain, a central carboxypeptidase domain, and a C-terminal domain rich in basic, serine-threonine-proline, and acidic amino acids (Lyons2006Modeling). The discoidin domain is structurally similar to the C2 domains of human coagulation factors V and VIII, featuring a β-barrel framework with spikes that interact with membranes. This domain has a polarized charge distribution, with one face being positively charged and the other hydrophobic, which may facilitate membrane interactions (Lyons2006Modeling).

The carboxypeptidase domain of AEBP1 is part of the regulatory carboxypeptidase family and shares similarities with carboxypeptidase D, although it lacks several residues critical for enzymatic activity found in other carboxypeptidases (Lyons2006Modeling). The C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding and interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin, with a basic region necessary for these interactions (Lyons2006Modeling). AEBP1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by MAPK at threonine 623, which is crucial for its DNA-binding and transcriptional activities (Lyons2004MAPK).

## Function
The AEBP1 gene encodes the aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP), which plays a crucial role in collagen assembly and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. ACLP is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis by binding to fibrillar collagens, particularly types I, III, and V, through its discoidin domain. This interaction is essential for proper collagen polymerization and fibril formation, which are critical for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues (Blackburn2018Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, ACLP is highly expressed in collagen-rich tissues such as skin, vasculature, and connective tissues, contributing to both embryonic development and adult tissue repair. It is secreted by various cell types, including fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and is involved in processes such as fibroblast proliferation and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into collagen-producing cells (Blackburn2018Biallelic).

ACLP also modulates the TGFb1 receptor pathways to promote fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, which is necessary for wound repair. AEBP1-deficient mice exhibit spontaneous skin ulcerations and delayed wound healing, highlighting ACLP's role in ECM remodeling following injury (Blackburn2018Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AEBP1 gene are associated with a subtype of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) known as classical-like EDS type 2 (clEDS2). This condition is characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and atrophic scarring. Patients may also experience cardiovascular complications such as arterial aneurysms and mitral valve prolapse, as well as musculoskeletal issues like osteoporosis and osteopenia (Yamaguchi2023Case; Syx2019Biallelic; Ha2024Clinical). 

The AEBP1 gene encodes the aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP), which plays a crucial role in collagen assembly and extracellular matrix maintenance. Mutations often lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in reduced levels of functional ACLP, which affects collagen production and secretion (Yamaguchi2023Case; Di2022Congenital). 

Individuals with AEBP1 mutations may also present with additional features such as easy bruising, delayed wound healing, and dental abnormalities. Some cases report congenital malformations and a prematurely aged appearance (Syx2019Biallelic; Di2022Congenital). The phenotypic variability and genetic heterogeneity of AEBP1-related conditions underscore the need for further research to fully understand the gene's role in connective tissue disorders (Syx2019Biallelic).

## Interactions
AEBP1 (Adipocyte Enhancer-Binding Protein 1) is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that influence its function as a transcriptional repressor and regulator of cellular processes. AEBP1 interacts with the AE-1 DNA oligonucleotide, although this interaction is weak in its wild-type form. Deletion variants of AEBP1, such as AEBP1(27-730) and AEBP1⌬STP, exhibit stronger DNA binding, suggesting that the C-terminal hydrophobic region in the wild-type protein inhibits DNA binding (Lyons2006Modeling).

AEBP1 also interacts with Ca2+/calmodulin, particularly through its basic region, which is implicated in DNA binding. This interaction is strong for full-length AEBP1 but weak for forms lacking the C-terminus (Lyons2006Modeling). AEBP1's discoidin-like domain (DLD) is crucial for its interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which prolongs MAPK activation by protecting it from dephosphorylation (Majdalawieh2010Regulation). AEBP1 also interacts with IκBα, a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway, through its DLD, affecting NF-κB-driven transactivation of target genes (Majdalawieh2010Regulation).

AEBP1 interacts with PTEN, a tumor suppressor protein, through its carboxypeptidase domain, promoting PTEN degradation and affecting its stability and activity (Ro2007Adipocyte). These interactions highlight AEBP1's role in modulating various signaling pathways and cellular functions.
