# PLEKHD1

## Overview
PLEKHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and coiled-coil domain containing D1. This protein is characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology domains, which are known to be involved in intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. While the specific biological functions of the PLEKHD1 protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes and disease states. Notably, alterations in PLEKHD1 expression have been associated with conditions such as Pearson syndrome and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential role in disease mechanisms (Lareau2022Singlecell; Koh2023Genetic). Additionally, PLEKHD1 is located in a chromosomal region linked to congenital heart defects and other developmental anomalies, indicating its possible contribution to these phenotypes (Oehl‐Jaschkowitz2013Deletions).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHD1 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In Pearson syndrome (PS), a study using single-cell RNA sequencing identified PLEKHD1 as differentially expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, suggesting its involvement in the altered transcriptional states associated with the syndrome (Lareau2022Singlecell). The gene is also located within a region on chromosome 14 (14q24.1q24.3) that, when deleted, is associated with congenital heart defects, brachydactyly, and mild intellectual disability. Although the study does not directly link PLEKHD1 mutations to these conditions, it is included among the genes in the deleted region that may contribute to the observed phenotypes (Oehl‐Jaschkowitz2013Deletions).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PLEKHD1 was found to be downregulated in organoids derived from a Kras G12D /Galc knockout mouse model, which is used to study lysosomal dysfunction and its impact on tumorigenesis (Koh2023Lysosomal; Koh2023Genetic). This downregulation suggests a potential role in the disease's progression, although specific conditions directly associated with PLEKHD1 mutations or expression alterations in PDAC are not detailed.
