# RBP3

## Overview
Retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3) is a gene that encodes a critical glycoprotein involved in the visual cycle, primarily expressed in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. The protein, also known as interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), plays a pivotal role in the transport of retinoids and lipids between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), facilitating the regeneration of visual pigments and maintaining light sensitivity. RBP3 is a major component of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), where it accounts for a significant portion of its composition and exhibits antioxidant properties that provide photoprotection and modulate the redox environment of the outer retina. Structurally, the protein is composed of four homologous modules, each capable of binding multiple ligands, which underscores its functional resilience. Clinically, mutations and altered expression of the RBP3 gene are associated with various retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and diabetic retinopathy, highlighting its importance in retinal health and disease (GarciaRamírez2009Interphotoreceptor; Kaushik2023Towards; Yokomizo2019Retinol).

## Structure
Retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3) is a significant glycoprotein found in the interphotoreceptor matrix of vertebrate retinas. It has a molecular mass of approximately 135 kDa and is composed of four modules, each about 300 amino acids in length (Kaushik2023Towards; Yokomizo2019Retinol). These modules have similar ligand-binding capabilities, allowing one module to compensate for the malfunction of another, which is crucial for its role in the visual cycle (Kaushik2023Towards).

The primary structure of RBP3 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, while its secondary structure likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, which is essential for its function in binding retinoids and lipids. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these four modules, which allows RBP3 to bind several ligands simultaneously, with each module having a hydrophobic cleft for ligand accommodation (Kaushik2023Towards).

RBP3 is subject to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function. The protein's modular organization and ability to bind multiple ligands make it a critical component in the transport of retinoids and lipids between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells (Zeng2020Interphotoreceptor; Kaushik2023Towards).

## Function
Retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3) is a crucial protein in the visual cycle, primarily expressed in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. It plays a significant role in shuttling retinoids, such as all-trans-retinol and 11-cis-retinal, between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is essential for the regeneration of visual pigments and maintaining light sensitivity (Zeng2020Interphotoreceptor; Kaushik2023Towards). RBP3 is a major component of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), accounting for about 5% of its composition, and is involved in the transport of essential lipids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Kaushik2023Towards).

The protein is composed of four modules, each about 300 amino acids long, allowing it to bind multiple ligands simultaneously and maintain its function even if one module is compromised (Kaushik2023Towards). RBP3 also exhibits antioxidant properties, providing photoprotection for light-sensitive retinoids and scavenging free radicals, which helps modulate the redox environment of the IPM and maintain the homeostasis of the outer retina (Kaushik2023Towards). Its rapid turnover in the IPM and distribution changes with light conditions underscore its dynamic role in retinal health (Kaushik2023Towards).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RBP3 gene, which encodes retinol binding protein 3, have significant clinical implications. RBP3 is crucial for the transport of retinoids between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium, and its deficiency or dysfunction can lead to various retinal diseases. In particular, mutations in the RBP3 gene have been associated with retinal dystrophies, such as retinitis pigmentosa, and conditions like high myopia and retinal degeneration (Kaushik2023Towards).

In diabetic retinopathy (DR), RBP3 levels are notably reduced, correlating with disease severity. Lower RBP3 levels are linked to poor prognosis in DR, while higher levels may offer some protection. This protein's downregulation is observed in both animal models and human retinas from diabetic donors, suggesting its potential as an early biomarker for DR (GarciaRamírez2009Interphotoreceptor; Kaushik2023Towards). RBP3's protective role in DR is further supported by its ability to inhibit VEGF-mediated retinal vascular permeability, a key factor in DR progression (Yokomizo2019Retinol).

Overall, RBP3's role in maintaining retinal health underscores its importance in preventing and managing retinal degenerative conditions.

## Interactions
Retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3) is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In the context of diabetic retinopathy, RBP3 interacts with the glucose transporter GLUT1, inhibiting glucose uptake in retinal cells. This interaction reduces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory cytokines, which are critical in the progression of diabetic retinopathy (Yokomizo2019Retinol). RBP3 also binds to VEGFR2, inhibiting its phosphorylation and thereby blocking VEGF-induced signaling pathways, which are involved in angiogenesis (Yokomizo2019Retinol).

In cyanobacteria, RBP3 interacts with ribosomes and the 3′ ends of mRNAs encoding photosynthesis proteins. It binds to specific mRNA regions, particularly those with U-rich motifs, and is involved in localizing these mRNAs to the thylakoid surface (Hemm2024The). RBP3 forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with these mRNAs, suggesting a role in their stabilization and targeting within the cell (Hemm2024The). Although RBP3 is enriched with ribosomal proteins, its direct association with ribosomes is not definitively supported, indicating that its interaction may be mediated through bound mRNA molecules (Hemm2024The).
