# MBTPS1

## Overview
The MBTPS1 gene encodes the membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase, site 1 (S1P), a serine protease that is integral to various cellular processes. As a member of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK) family, S1P is primarily involved in the proteolytic activation of membrane-bound latent transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which are crucial for lipid metabolism and the unfolded protein response (Schweitzer2019A; Kondo2018Site1). S1P is synthesized as an inactive precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum and becomes active following specific cleavage events in the Golgi apparatus (Velho2017Site1). The protein's structure includes a catalytic domain essential for its function, and it undergoes post-translational modifications that influence its stability and activity (Velho2017Site1). MBTPS1 is implicated in several physiological processes, including cholesterol regulation, ER stress response, and lysosomal enzyme trafficking, and its dysfunction is associated with clinical conditions such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and colorectal cancer (Yuan2023Clinical; HartalBenishay2022MBTPS1).

## Structure
The MBTPS1 gene encodes the Site-1 protease (S1P), a serine protease that is part of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK) family. S1P is synthesized as an inactive type I membrane precursor protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and becomes active after the removal of its signal peptide and autocatalytic cleavage of its prodomain in the cis-Golgi apparatus (Velho2017Site1). The protein contains a catalytic domain characterized by a triad of aspartate, histidine, and serine residues, which are essential for its proteolytic activity (Velho2017Site1).

The molecular structure of S1P includes several distinct regions: a signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic domain, and a catalytic domain. The catalytic domain is crucial for the enzyme's function and is involved in the proteolytic activation of various proteins, including membrane-bound transcription factors (Kondo2018Site1). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its expression and function (Kondo2018Site1).

Post-translational modifications of S1P may include glycosylation, which can influence its stability and activity. These structural features enable S1P to play a critical role in processes such as cholesterol regulation, ER stress response, and lysosomal enzyme trafficking (Velho2017Site1).

## Function
The MBTPS1 gene encodes Site-1 protease (S1P), a serine protease that plays a critical role in several cellular processes. S1P is involved in the proteolytic activation of membrane-bound latent transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), within the Golgi apparatus. This activation is essential for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, as well as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to manage endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Schweitzer2019A; Kondo2018Site1).

In healthy human cells, S1P is crucial for lysosomal enzyme trafficking by activating GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GPT), which facilitates the mannose-6-phosphate modification necessary for lysosomal enzyme transport (Kondo2018Site1). S1P also plays a role in skeletal development by regulating collagen trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, which is vital for extracellular matrix protein biosynthesis (Kondo2018Site1).

S1P's function extends to maintaining lipid homeostasis and ER function, preventing collagen retention in chondrocytes, and ensuring normal lysosomal enzyme secretion, which is essential for skeletal integrity and preventing apoptosis in chondrocytes (Yuan2023Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MBTPS1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting skeletal development and cellular stress responses. One significant disorder linked to MBTPS1 mutations is spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDKF), a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities such as flattened thoracolumbar vertebral bodies and decreased bone density. This condition is caused by a synonymous variant c.774C > T in the MBTPS1 gene, which leads to exon 6 skipping and abnormal mRNA splicing, ultimately affecting collagen retention in chondrocytes and bone matrix degradation (Yuan2023Clinical).

Site-1 protease (S1P) deficiency, resulting from MBTPS1 mutations, leads to impaired protein trafficking and ER stress responses, contributing to skeletal dysplasia. This deficiency affects the activation of transcription factors necessary for collagen transport and lysosomal enzyme secretion, causing apoptosis of chondrocytes and degradation of the bone matrix (Kondo2018Site1).

In colorectal cancer, MBTPS1 plays a role in regulating cell proliferation through its action on sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Alterations in MBTPS1 expression levels correlate with changes in SREBPs and ATF6 levels, impacting cancer cell growth and energy metabolism pathways (HartalBenishay2022MBTPS1).

## Interactions
MBTPS1, also known as site-1 protease (S1P), is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It is a serine protease located in the Golgi apparatus and plays a pivotal role in the activation of membrane-bound latent transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are essential for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (Kondo2018Site1). MBTPS1 also interacts with activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), contributing to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (Kondo2018Site1).

The protein POST1 (C12orf49) has been identified as a cofactor that promotes the autocatalytic cleavage and maturation of MBTPS1, facilitating its function in the SREBP pathway. This interaction enhances the production of the mature form of S1P and increases its localization to the Golgi complex (Xiao2020POST1/C12ORF49). 

MBTPS1 is also involved in the proteolytic activation of BBF2H7, a key transducer of the unfolded protein response, which regulates genes essential for collagen trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Kondo2018Site1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MBTPS1 in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases.
