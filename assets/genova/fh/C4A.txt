# C4A

## Overview
The C4A gene encodes the complement component 4A, a protein integral to the classical complement pathway of the immune system. This protein, also known as the Rodgers blood group, is a key player in immune response, facilitating the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells, thereby preventing excessive inflammation and autoimmune reactions. As a secreted protein, complement C4A undergoes various post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and tyrosine-O-sulfation, which are crucial for its function and interactions within the immune system (Blanchong2001Genetic). The protein's ability to form covalent bonds with antigens aids in solubilizing antibody-antigen aggregates, enhancing their removal from the bloodstream (Blanchong2001Genetic). Deficiencies or mutations in the C4A gene are associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its critical role in immune regulation (Barba1993Genetic; Yang2007Gene).

## Structure
The C4A gene encodes the complement component 4A, a protein involved in the classical complement pathway. The primary structure of C4A consists of 1725 amino acid residues, preceded by a 19 amino acid leader peptide characteristic of secretory proteins (Blanchong2001Genetic). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and sulfation. C4A has four N-linked glycosylation sites, with N207 on the b-chain and N843, N1309, and N1372 on the a-chain. The glycosylation on the b-chain is of the high-mannose oligosaccharide type, while the a-chain sites have biantennary, complex fucosylated oligosaccharides (Blanchong2001Genetic). Tyrosine-O-sulfation is another modification, occurring at residues 1198, 1199b, and 1200, which modulates extracellular protein-protein interactions (Blanchong2001Genetic).

The tertiary structure of C4A includes a thioester region crucial for covalent attachment to antigenic surfaces, consisting of residues Cys991, Gly992, Glu993, and Gln994 (van2002Xray). The C4d fragment of C4A shares structural similarities with C3d, featuring an α-α barrel fold (van2002Xray). The C4A protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its structural diversity (Blanchong2001Genetic).

## Function
The C4A gene encodes the complement component 4A, a crucial protein in the classical complement pathway of the immune system. C4A is particularly effective in forming covalent amide bonds with antigens containing amino groups, which aids in solubilizing antibody-antigen aggregates and inhibiting immune precipitation. This function is essential for the clearance of immune complexes through binding to complement receptor CR1 on erythrocytes, facilitating their removal from the bloodstream (Blanchong2001Genetic).

C4A is primarily expressed in the liver but is also found in peripheral blood monocytes, skin fibroblasts, and epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney. Its expression in extra-hepatic sites is important for local protection and inflammatory responses (Blanchong2001Genetic). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine-O-sulfation, which enhances its interaction with other proteins in the complement pathway (Blanchong2001Genetic).

C4A plays a significant role in maintaining immune system balance by clearing immune complexes and apoptotic cells, thus preventing excessive inflammation and autoimmune reactions (Paakkanen2012Copy). Its deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, highlighting its importance in immune regulation (Barba1993Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the C4A gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases, most notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A low copy number of the C4A gene is a significant risk factor for SLE, while a higher copy number appears to be protective (Yang2007Gene). Specific mutations, such as a C to T transition in exon 13 and a 4-bp insertion in exon 36, have been identified in families with SLE, leading to premature stop codons and complete C4 deficiency (Wu2009Molecular). These genetic alterations can result in a lack of C4A protein, which is crucial for immune complex clearance, potentially triggering aberrant immune responses (Wu2009Molecular).

C4A deficiency is also linked to an increased risk of infections due to its role in the immune system. Patients with homozygous C4A deficiency have a higher occurrence of lymphomas and sarcoidosis, and they experience more adverse drug reactions (Liesmaa2018Clinical). The genetic landscape surrounding C4A plays a crucial role in disease susceptibility, and its deficiency is not reliably assessed in genome-wide association studies (Liesmaa2018Clinical).

## Interactions
The C4A gene encodes the complement component 4A, which is involved in various interactions within the immune system. C4A is cleaved by MASP-2, a serine protease, during the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in the formation of C4a and C4b fragments. C4b binds to C2 to form the C4b2 complex, which is essential for the formation of the C3 convertase, a critical step in complement activation (Wallis2007Molecular).

C4a, a fragment of C4A, acts as a ligand for protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1 and 4, which are part of the GPCR family. It functions as a partial agonist for PAR1 and a full agonist for PAR4, leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human endothelial cells. This interaction is independent of the classical proteolytic activation mechanism of PARs and results in increased calcium influx and endothelial permeability (Wang2017Complementactivation).

C4a also interacts with IgG molecules, where it can reassociate with the heavy and light chains of IgG. This interaction was demonstrated using a chemical cross-linking technique, indicating that one molecule of C4a can bind to one heavy or one light chain of IgG (Nezlin1992Complexes).
