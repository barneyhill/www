# CDHR2

## Overview
CDHR2, or cadherin-related family member 2, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein known as protocadherin-24. This protein is characterized by its nine extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, which are essential for mediating cell-cell adhesion, particularly in epithelial tissues such as the small intestine. The CDHR2 protein plays a pivotal role in the organization and function of microvilli, contributing to the structural integrity of the brush border by forming part of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC). This complex is crucial for the proper packing and elongation of microvilli, thereby enhancing the absorptive capacity of enterocytes. CDHR2 is also implicated in various clinical conditions, including colorectal and gastric cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and cellular adhesion mechanisms (Wang2023Cadherin; Pinette2019Brush).

## Structure
CDHR2, also known as protocadherin-24, is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of 1310 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 141 kDa (Pinette2019Brush). The protein features an N-terminal ectodomain with nine tandem extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, which are crucial for mediating adhesion (Pinette2019Brush). These EC repeats are linked by regions that bind calcium ions, essential for maintaining the structural integrity and adhesive function of the protein (Gray2021Heterophilic).

The CDHR2 protein also includes a single-pass transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which interacts with various binding partners such as USH1C and MYO7B, forming part of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) (Weck2020A; Pinette2019Brush). The cytoplasmic domain contains a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with the second PDZ domain of USH1C with high affinity, suggesting a role in targeting the protein to specific cellular locations (Weck2020A).

CDHR2 is primarily expressed in the small intestine but is also found in other epithelial tissues. It has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor in colon and liver cancers and may be involved in contact inhibition in colon carcinoma cells (Pinette2019Brush). The protein's structure and interactions are species-dependent, with unique minimal adhesive units observed in different species (Gray2021Heterophilic).

## Function
The CDHR2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of microvilli in epithelial cells, particularly in the intestinal tract. CDHR2 is involved in the formation of adhesion complexes between the tips of adjacent microvilli, which is essential for their proper packing and elongation. This organization increases the membrane surface area, thereby enhancing the functional capacity of enterocytes for nutrient processing and uptake (Pinette2019Brush). In healthy cells, CDHR2 contributes to the elongation and optimal packing of microvilli, which are essential for maximizing the surface area for nutrient absorption (Pinette2019Brush). 

CDHR2 forms part of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) along with other proteins like CDHR5, MYO7B, and USH1C, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the brush border (Pinette2019Brush). The protein is a type I transmembrane protein with extracellular cadherin repeats that mediate adhesion (Pinette2019Brush). The absence of CDHR2 results in shorter, more variable microvilli with a splayed morphology and significant physical separation between neighboring protrusions, leading to a loss of the typical hexagonal packing pattern of microvilli (Pinette2019Brush). CDHR2 is essential for the proper ultrastructure and maximized packing of microvilli in the intestinal brush border (Pinette2019Brush).

## Clinical Significance
CDHR2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular adhesion and microvilli organization. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CDHR2 expression is often lost, particularly in sporadic cases, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. The loss of CDHR2, along with CDHR5, is more common in sporadic CRCs, while hereditary cases tend to retain expression of both proteins. This pattern indicates a coordinated regulation of these genes and suggests that their loss may contribute to increased tumor proliferation (losi2020cadherins).

In gastric cancer, CDHR2 is upregulated and associated with metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fructose metabolism. This upregulation suggests a role in cancer progression and cellular adhesion mechanisms (Wang2023Cadherin). Mutations in CDHR2 in gastric cancer can significantly alter the expression of other genes, affecting pathways related to the extracellular matrix and immune system (Wang2023Cadherin).

CDHR2 expression loss is also linked to structural perturbations in the brush border of Crohn's disease patients, indicating its importance in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity (Pinette2019Brush). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDHR2 in various gastrointestinal disorders and cancers.

## Interactions
CDHR2, also known as protocadherin-24, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of microvilli in the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. It is a component of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), which includes other proteins such as CDHR5, MYO7B, ANKS4B, and USH1C. CDHR2 forms heterophilic complexes with CDHR5, linking the tips of microvilli, and can also form weak homophilic complexes (Pinette2019Brush). The cytoplasmic tails of CDHR2 and CDHR5 interact with the PDZ domain protein USH1C and the actin-based motor MYO7B, which, along with ANKS4B, enrich adhesion complexes at the distal tips of microvilli (Pinette2019Brush).

CDHR2 is essential for the proper localization of these IMAC components, as its absence leads to increased cytoplasmic signals and loss of enrichment at microvillar tips (Pinette2019Brush). The interaction with MYO7B is particularly significant, as MYO7B is thought to deliver cargoes that promote microvillar growth, similar to its role in filopodia elongation (Pinette2019Brush). CDHR2's interactions are crucial for maintaining the ordered packing of microvilli, which is essential for maximizing the functional capacity of enterocytes (Pinette2019Brush).
