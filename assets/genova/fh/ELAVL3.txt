# ELAVL3

## Overview
ELAVL3, also known as HuC, is a gene that encodes the ELAV-like RNA binding protein 3, a member of the ELAV-like protein family. This protein is primarily expressed in neurons and is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, playing a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA stability and alternative splicing. The ELAV-like RNA binding protein 3 contains three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which facilitate its interaction with AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, thereby influencing their stability and translation. This protein is integral to neuronal differentiation and maturation, contributing to the maintenance of axonal and synaptic structures. ELAVL3's involvement in alternative polyadenylation and its interactions with microRNAs underscore its significance in neuronal function and its potential implications in neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (Ogawa2018Elavl3; Mulligan2023The; Scheckel2016Regulatory).

## Structure
ELAVL3, also known as HuC, is a member of the ELAV-like protein family, characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities. The protein structure includes three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which are crucial for its function. RRM1 and RRM2 are primarily responsible for binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, while RRM3 contributes to the stability of these transcripts through various mechanisms (Mulligan2023The). The hinge region between RRM2 and RRM3 contains nuclear export and localization signals, facilitating the shuttling of RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Mulligan2023The).

ELAVL3 can form multimeric complexes, enhancing its RNA-binding affinity. The third RRM domain plays a significant role in homodimerization and protein-RNA interactions (Mulligan2023The). Although the specific post-translational modifications of ELAVL3 are not detailed in the context, such modifications are known to affect the activity of ELAV family proteins. A shorter isoform of ELAVL3, approximately 25-30 amino acids shorter than the full-length protein, has been identified, though the mechanism behind this remains unclear (DiazGarcia2021Nuclear). This isoform may result from degradation or dephosphorylation processes (DiazGarcia2021Nuclear).

## Function
ELAVL3, also known as HuC, is a neuronal RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of RNA stability and alternative splicing, which are essential for neuronal differentiation and maturation. It is predominantly expressed in neurons, including cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal granule cells, where it contributes to the maintenance of axonal and synaptic structures (Ogawa2018Elavl3).

In healthy neurons, ELAVL3 is involved in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation (APA) site selection, influencing gene expression during neuronal differentiation. This regulation is crucial for the differentiation of inhibitory neuronal progenitors and is associated with the lengthening of specific mRNAs (Grassi2019Choice). ELAVL3 also interacts with miR-124 to enhance the expression of target genes, such as PTBP2, which is important for neuronal maturity and reprogramming (Lu2020MiR124).

ELAVL3's binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs stabilizes these transcripts, thereby influencing their translation and impacting neuronal function (Scheckel2016Regulatory). This protein is crucial for maintaining axonal homeostasis, which is vital for proper neuronal function and the prevention of neurodegenerative conditions (Ogawa2018Elavl3).

## Clinical Significance
The ELAVL3 gene, also known as HuC, is implicated in several neurological disorders due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ELAVL3 is significantly downregulated in motor neurons, with nuclear depletion being a hallmark of the disease. This depletion occurs in both sporadic and familial forms of ALS and is more prevalent than abnormalities in TDP-43, another protein associated with ALS. The nuclear depletion of ELAVL3 is considered a critical feature of ALS pathology, suggesting a loss of function mechanism rather than cytoplasmic toxicity (DiazGarcia2021Nuclear).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), ELAVL3, as part of the neuronal ELAV-like (nELAVL) proteins, is involved in RNA splicing regulation. Although ELAVL3 mRNA levels remain similar between AD and control samples, changes in nELAVL binding, particularly to non-coding Y RNAs, may lead to altered RNA splicing and contribute to AD pathology (Scheckel2016Regulatory).

ELAVL3 is also associated with cerebellar dysfunction, including cerebellar ataxia and seizure activity, due to its role in synaptic formation and neuronal transport. Its downregulation is observed in motor neurons from ALS patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for the disease (Mulligan2023The).

## Interactions
ELAVL3, also known as HuC, is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. It interacts with MYCN mRNA by binding to its 3'-UTR, protecting it from RNA decay and stabilizing its expression. This interaction is crucial for the post-transcriptional regulation of MYCN, forming a positive feedback loop that is important for neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer (Ji2023The). ELAVL3 also binds to RICTOR mRNA, stabilizing it and influencing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor growth (Ji2023The).

ELAVL3 can be released into extracellular vesicles (EVs), where it can influence neuroendocrine differentiation in recipient cells by transferring ELAVL3 RNA and protein, thereby promoting the expression of neuroendocrine markers (Ji2023The). The interaction between ELAVL3 and MYCN is also transcriptionally regulated, with MYCN binding to the promoter region of ELAVL3, enhancing its expression and contributing to therapy resistance in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (Ji2023The). These interactions highlight ELAVL3's role in both stabilizing key mRNAs and participating in complex regulatory networks within cells.
