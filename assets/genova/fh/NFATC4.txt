# NFATC4

## Overview
NFATC4 is a gene that encodes the nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATc4), a transcription factor belonging to the NFAT family. This family is characterized by its role in regulating gene expression in response to calcium signaling. NFATc4 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, survival, and gene expression regulation. The protein is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it supports neuronal survival and maturation, and in adipocyte differentiation, where it regulates key factors in adipogenesis. NFATc4 functions as a monomer and interacts with calcineurin, a phosphatase that facilitates its activation and nuclear translocation. It is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and localization. Alterations in NFATC4 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and cardiac developmental defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhao2020Increased; Yang2002Phosphorylation; Kitamura2020Identification).

## Structure
NFATC4 is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, characterized by a conserved NH2-terminal regulatory NFAT homology domain and a COOH-terminal Rel homology region for DNA binding (Yang2002Phosphorylation). The DNA-binding region of NFATC4 is a Rel homologue with immunoglobulin-like folds, featuring a β-sandwich structure in the N-terminal domain and an h-type immunoglobulin fold in the carboxy-terminal domain (Chen1998Structure). NFATC4 is a monomer in solution and in complex with DNA, unlike other Rel family members that typically dimerize (Chen1998Structure).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases at Ser 168 and Ser 170, which affects its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (Yang2002Phosphorylation). These phosphorylation sites are located within the Ser-rich region (SRR) domain, which is crucial for NFAT regulation (Yang2002Phosphorylation). NFATC4 also interacts with calcineurin, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT proteins, facilitating their activation and nuclear translocation (Kitamura2020Identification). The CNBR3 region in NFATC4 is identified as a novel binding site for calcineurin, distinct from other NFAT isoforms (Kitamura2020Identification).

## Function
NFATc4 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 4) is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, NFATc4 is activated by calcium signaling pathways, often in response to stimuli such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NMDA receptor activity. Upon activation, NFATc4 translocates to the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of target genes (Groth2003BrainDerived; Vashishta2009Nuclear).

NFATc4 plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation by regulating the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2), a key factor in adipogenesis. This regulation is mediated through NFATc4's binding to the PPARγ2 promoter, which is crucial for adipocyte formation (Yang2002Phosphorylation).

In the nervous system, NFATc4 is essential for the survival of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, where it supports the survival of adult-born neurons and is involved in spatial memory formation. This function is largely dependent on BDNF signaling, which enhances NFATc4 expression and activity, promoting neuronal survival and maturation (Quadrato2012Nuclear). NFATc4 also regulates the expression of neuroprotective genes, such as BDNF, in response to NMDA receptor stimulation, contributing to neuronal survival during development (Vashishta2009Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
NFATC4 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), increased expression of NFATC4 is associated with poor prognosis. This is partly due to its role in recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress immune responses and may facilitate immune evasion by the cancer cells. NFATC4 is also involved in the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter signaling pathway, which is linked to poor outcomes in AML patients (Zhao2020Increased).

In cardiac development, NFATC4, along with NFATc3, is crucial for proper heart formation and mitochondrial function. Mice lacking both NFATc3 and NFATc4 exhibit severe cardiac defects, including thin ventricular walls and mitochondrial abnormalities, leading to embryonic lethality. These defects are attributed to decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and compromised mitochondrial oxidative capacity, highlighting the importance of NFATC4 in maintaining cardiac energy metabolism and structural integrity (Bushdid2003NFATc3).

NFATC4 also plays a role in vascular development. Disruptions in NFATc3 and NFATc4 lead to significant vascular defects, such as disorganized vessel growth and underdeveloped vasculature, resulting in embryonic lethality. This underscores the gene's critical role in vascular patterning and angiogenesis (Graef2001Signals).

## Interactions
NFATc4 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in different cellular processes. In ovarian cancer, NFATc4 binds directly to the CXCR4 promoter, enhancing CXCR4 expression, which is crucial for tumor progression. This interaction is modulated by phospho-ERK, which inhibits NFAT transactivation (Zhong2022Recent). In adipocytes, NFATc4 interacts with lipin 1, which represses its transcriptional activity. This repression occurs through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to NFAT-responsive promoters, leading to chromatin deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Kim2010Lipin). Lipin 1 interacts specifically with the RHD/DNA-binding domain and carboxy terminus of NFATc4, forming complexes on DNA without affecting NFATc4's DNA-binding ability (Kim2010Lipin).

NFATc4 is also phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase at Ser 168 and Ser 170, affecting its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. This phosphorylation is crucial for NFATc4's role in adipocyte differentiation, as it interacts with the PPARγ2 promoter to increase PPARγ expression (Yang2002Phosphorylation). Additionally, mTOR and ERK5 phosphorylate NFATc4, influencing its nucleocytoplasmic localization and gene transcription activity (Yang2008Integration).
