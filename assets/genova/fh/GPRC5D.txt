# GPRC5D

## Overview
GPRC5D is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D, a transmembrane receptor belonging to the Class C family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, a common feature of GPCRs, and is distinct in its lack of a large extracellular Venus flytrap domain, which is typical of other Class C receptors (Yan2024The; BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). GPRC5D is expressed in various human tissues, including the pancreas and kidney, and is notably absent in the brain and liver (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). Although the physiological function and endogenous ligands of GPRC5D remain unidentified, its expression is induced by retinoic acid, suggesting a potential role in retinoic acid-mediated pathways (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). Clinically, GPRC5D is significant in multiple myeloma, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, and it serves as a target for emerging immunotherapies (Smith2019GPRC5D; Atamaniuk2012Overexpression).

## Structure
The GPRC5D protein is an atypical member of the Class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain typical of GPCRs (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). The primary structure of GPRC5D consists of 345 amino acids, with the 7TM region spanning from Asp17 to Val345 (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). Unlike other Class C GPCRs, GPRC5D lacks a large N-terminal extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) domain, having instead a short extracellular domain of 20-50 amino acids (Yan2024The).

The secondary structure includes seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices, which are a hallmark of GPCRs (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). The tertiary structure of GPRC5D reveals a unique head-to-head homodimer arrangement, primarily involving the TM4 transmembrane helix, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Yan2024The). This dimerization is distinct from other Class C receptors, which typically form dimers through their large extracellular domains (Yan2024The).

GPRC5D is expressed on the cell membrane and shows significant intracellular membrane compartment staining (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). The protein's structure in the absence of any ligand exhibits an inactive state, with a shallow ligand-binding pocket (Yan2024The). GPRC5D remains an orphan receptor with unknown endogenous ligands (Yan2024The).

## Function
GPRC5D is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the family C group 5 receptors. It is characterized by having seven transmembrane (7TM) domains, which are typical of GPCRs, and is localized to the cell membrane where it forms microclusters of higher expression (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). The gene is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the pancreas, kidney, small intestine, spleen, and testis, but is not detectable in the brain, heart, liver, placenta, skeletal muscle, and ovary (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning).

The physiological function and endogenous ligands of GPRC5D remain unknown, but its induction by retinoic acid suggests a potential link between retinoic acid and GPCR signal transduction pathways, indicating a possible role in mediating the effects of retinoic acids on embryogenesis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). Despite its widespread expression, GPRC5D transcription is not induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in certain cell lines, suggesting differential regulation compared to other group 5 receptors (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning). The receptor's function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, as specific binding and signaling pathways have not been clearly identified (BräunerOsborne2001Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
GPRC5D is clinically significant in the context of multiple myeloma (MM), where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. High levels of GPRC5D mRNA in the bone marrow correlate with increased plasma cell infiltration and elevated b2-microglobulin levels, both indicators of poor prognosis in MM patients (Atamaniuk2012Overexpression). The gene's expression is linked to high-risk disease and shorter progression-free and overall survival, although this may be due to high tumor burden rather than a direct causative relationship (RodriguezOtero2024GPRC5D).

GPRC5D is also a target for immunotherapy in MM, with therapies such as CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies being developed. These therapies exploit GPRC5D's selective expression in MM cells and limited expression in normal tissues (RodriguezOtero2024GPRC5D; Smith2019GPRC5D). However, resistance to GPRC5D-targeted therapies can occur through genetic or epigenetic alterations, such as biallelic deletions or mutations, leading to antigen escape and treatment failure (Derrien2023Acquired; Lee2023Mechanisms). These findings underscore the importance of GPRC5D in MM prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
GPRC5D, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, is involved in specific interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of multiple myeloma. The protein forms a homodimer through a unique interface located within the transmembrane region, specifically TM4, which is distinct from the typical dimerization seen in other Class C GPCRs (Yan2024The). This dimerization is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, involving specific amino acids such as E146, R154, Q165, I142, I143, L150, and I151 (Yan2024The).

GPRC5D has been identified as a target for immunotherapy, with specific interactions involving single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) derived from antibodies. The scFv150_18 antibody fragment binds extensively to the extracellular regions of GPRC5D, including the N-terminal region and all three extracellular loops (Yan2024The). This interaction is characterized by hydrogen bonds and other polar and hydrophobic interactions, highlighting the importance of these regions in the binding mechanism (Yan2024The).

The specificity of scFv clone 109 for GPRC5D has been demonstrated, with no significant off-target interactions observed in studies involving human GPCR libraries and plasma membrane proteins (Smith2019GPRC5D). These interactions underscore the potential of GPRC5D as a therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.
