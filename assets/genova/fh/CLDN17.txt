# CLDN17

## Overview
The CLDN17 gene encodes the protein claudin-17, a member of the claudin family, which is integral to the formation of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial tissues. Claudin-17 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its tetraspan topology, which includes four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops. This protein is distinct for its ability to form anion-selective channels, particularly favoring chloride and bicarbonate ions, which is a unique feature among claudins. Predominantly expressed in the kidney, claudin-17 plays a crucial role in regulating paracellular permeability, especially in the proximal nephron, where it contributes to chloride ion reabsorption. The structural and functional properties of claudin-17 are essential for maintaining the physiological balance of ions across epithelial barriers, and alterations in its expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and kidney injury (Sun2018Increased; Krug2012Claudin17).

## Structure
Claudin-17 (CLDN17) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by a tetraspan topology with four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ECL2) (LalNag2009The). The first extracellular loop (ECL1) is primarily responsible for charge and size selectivity, playing a crucial role in forming anion-selective channels (Conrad2015Molecular). Key residues in ECL1, such as R31, E44, E48, and K65, are essential for maintaining anion selectivity and channel function (Conrad2015Molecular). The second extracellular loop (ECL2) contains residues like Y149 and H154, which are involved in strand formation and charge selectivity (Conrad2015Molecular).

The tertiary structure of claudin-17 is modeled based on the crystal structure of claudin-15, revealing a left-handed four-transmembrane helix bundle and an extracellular beta-sheet (Conrad2015Molecular). This structure forms a hydrophilic furrow that lines the anion channel, facilitating ion passage (Conrad2015Molecular). The quaternary structure involves oligomeric pore formation within the tight junction strand, with trans-interactions between extracellular domains and cis-interactions within the strand (Conrad2015Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate claudin function, although specific modifications for claudin-17 are not detailed in the provided context (LalNag2009The).

## Function
Claudin-17 (CLDN17) is a protein encoded by the CLDN17 gene, which is part of the claudin family involved in forming tight junctions (TJs) that regulate paracellular permeability in epithelial and endothelial layers. Claudin-17 is characterized by its ability to form paracellular channels with distinct anion selectivity, a property not commonly observed in other claudins (Krug2012Claudin17). It is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and the ascending limbs of Henle's loop, with less expression in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and no expression in the collecting duct (Krug2012Claudin17). 

Claudin-17 channels show a preference for anions, particularly chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-), over cations like sodium (Na+). This anion selectivity is critically dependent on a positive charge at position 65 of the protein (Krug2012Claudin17). The protein contributes to the formation of leaky epithelia by altering the permeability of tight junctions, thus affecting the permeability properties of epithelial barriers (Krug2012Claudin17). In the kidneys, claudin-17 plays a unique physiological role in the reabsorption of chloride ions in the proximal nephron, contributing to the high chloride permeability observed in this region (Krug2012Claudin17).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN17 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), increased expression of CLDN17 is linked to a malignant phenotype in hepatocytes, promoting cell proliferation and migration through the Tyk2/Stat3 signaling pathway. This overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis, including shorter median survival times and increased metastasis in HCC patients (Wang2022The; Sun2018Increased).

In contrast, CLDN17 deficiency in mice has been shown to result in kidney injury due to electrolyte imbalance and oxidative stress. This deficiency leads to significant physiological changes, including altered serum electrolyte levels and increased oxidative stress, which contribute to kidney damage (Adil2022Claudin17).

Additionally, a variant of CLDN17, c.244G > A, resulting in the amino acid change p.A82T, has been identified in patients with neural tube defects (NTDs). This variant was found in a notable percentage of NTD cases, suggesting a potential contribution of CLDN17 mutations to the etiology of these defects (Baumholtz2020Functional).

## Interactions
CLDN17, a member of the claudin family, is involved in forming tight junctions and is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins. It can replace CLDN8 to recruit occludin (OCLN) in human bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting a potential interaction between these proteins (Adil2022Claudin17a; Adil2022Claudin17). This interaction indicates a role in blood-tissue barrier mediation, particularly in the kidneys and brain, where CLDN17 is predominantly expressed (Krug2012Claudin17).

CLDN17 is also part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network involving various other claudin family members, such as CLDN7, CLDN5, and CLDN6, among others. This network suggests functional relationships between these proteins, although specific physical interactions are not detailed (Alghamdi2023Identification).

In terms of structural interactions, CLDN17 forms anion-selective channels, with specific residues like K65 and S68 playing crucial roles in charge-selective ion permeation. These residues are involved in electrostatic interactions that influence channel formation, although these interactions are primarily within the CLDN17 protein itself rather than with other proteins (Conrad2015Molecular).
