# DDT

## Overview
The DDT gene encodes the enzyme D-dopachrome tautomerase, which is a member of the tautomerase superfamily and shares structural similarities with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (MezaRomero2016Modeling). This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including adipocyte lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling pathways. D-dopachrome tautomerase functions as an adipokine, influencing lipolysis and lipogenesis through interactions with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways (Iwata2012The). It also plays a role in the conversion of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole, a step in melanin biosynthesis (Zan2022D‐dopachrome). The protein forms a homotrimer and interacts with the CD74 receptor, which is crucial for activating inflammatory pathways (Li2022Ddopachrome; MezaRomero2016Modeling). Clinically, alterations in DDT expression are associated with various cancers and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Iwata2012The; Valdez2024Macrophage).

## Structure
D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) is a protein that shares structural and biochemical similarities with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), with approximately 35% identity between the two proteins (MezaRomero2016Modeling). The DDT protein forms a homotrimer, with each protomer consisting of two alpha helices positioned on top of a beta-sheet platform. The beta strands are centrally located, forming a solvent channel (MezaRomero2016Modeling). This structural arrangement allows DDT to bind to the CD74 receptor, forming a hexameric complex with one CD74 trimer binding to one DDT trimer (MezaRomero2016Modeling).

The interaction between DDT and CD74 involves a hydrophobic interface, with specific residues contributing to this interaction. The docking analysis suggests that DDT binds to the CD74 receptor with a different topology than MIF but uses similar types of interactions and, to some extent, similar amino acid residues (MezaRomero2016Modeling). The structural model of DDT was developed using a protein:protein docking algorithm, and the X-ray molecular coordinates for DDT (PDB ID: 1DPT) were used in the study (MezaRomero2016Modeling). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in adipocyte lipid metabolism and functions as an adipokine. It is expressed in mature adipocytes and is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and lipogenesis. DDT influences the expression of genes related to these processes, such as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), through its interaction with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways (Iwata2012The). 

DDT is secreted from adipocytes and its expression is negatively correlated with obesity-related parameters like body mass index (BMI) and fat areas, suggesting a role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Iwata2012The). In addition to its metabolic functions, DDT has been shown to improve glucose intolerance and reduce serum free fatty acid levels in animal models, indicating its potential impact on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Iwata2012The).

The enzyme is also involved in the conversion of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole, a reaction that is part of the melanin biosynthesis pathway, although the physiological relevance of this activity in humans is not fully understood (Zan2022D‐dopachrome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DDT gene, which encodes D-dopachrome tautomerase, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and metabolic disorders. In cancer, DDT is overexpressed in several types, including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), bladder cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and breast cancer. In neuroblastoma, DDT acts as a negative prognostic factor, while in GBM, its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and tumor recurrence. In bladder cancer, DDT is associated with tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, and its inhibition can reduce tumor growth. Similarly, in RCC, DDT interacts with hypoxia-inducible factors, and its knockdown significantly reduces tumor growth, indicating a major role in tumorigenesis. Elevated DDT levels in breast cancer correlate with worse survival outcomes, and its inhibition reduces tumor growth and metastasis (Valdez2024Macrophage).

In metabolic disorders, DDT is involved in adipocyte lipid metabolism and is negatively correlated with obesity-related parameters such as BMI and fat areas. Knockdown of DDT in adipocytes leads to increased expression of genes involved in lipolysis and lipogenesis, suggesting its role in lipid metabolism. Administration of recombinant DDT improves glucose intolerance in obese mouse models, indicating its potential in managing glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (Iwata2012The).

## Interactions
D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT) interacts with several proteins, primarily through its binding to the CD74 receptor. This interaction is crucial for activating inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the MAPKs/NF-κB pathway, in astrocytes following spinal cord injury (SCI). The binding of D-DT to CD74 promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, highlighting its role in mediating inflammation (Li2022Ddopachrome; Ji2021Ddopachrome).

D-DT also interacts with mutant SOD1, a protein associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While D-DT does not prevent the accumulation or toxicity of misfolded SOD1, it inhibits the amyloid aggregation of mutant SOD1 by promoting the formation of less toxic amorphous aggregates. This interaction occurs at a later stage when SOD1 is already in an oligomeric form (Alaskarov2022MIF).

D-DT shares structural similarities with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and can form complexes with it. However, D-DT lacks certain motifs present in MIF, which may influence its interaction dynamics and receptor binding affinity (Ji2021Ddopachrome; Zan2022D‐dopachrome).
