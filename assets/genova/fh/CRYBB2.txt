# CRYBB2

## Overview
The CRYBB2 gene encodes the βB2-crystallin protein, a member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily, which is primarily known for its role in maintaining lens transparency and refractive function in the human eye. βB2-crystallin is a structural protein that contributes to the lens's ability to focus light onto the retina due to its high solubility and stability. Beyond its ocular functions, βB2-crystallin is expressed in non-lens tissues, including the retina and brain, where it is involved in neuroprotection, axonal regeneration, and calcium regulation. The protein's interactions with various cellular components also implicate it in processes such as tumorigenesis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer. Mutations in the CRYBB2 gene are associated with congenital cataracts and have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders and reproductive health issues, underscoring its significance in both ocular and systemic health (Yan2021CRYβB2; Thanos2014Role; Li2021Physiological).

## Structure
The CRYBB2 gene encodes the βB2-crystallin protein, a member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily, which is crucial for maintaining lens transparency. The primary structure of βB2-crystallin consists of a sequence encoded by six exons, with the first exon being untranslated. The second exon codes for the N-terminal extension, while the remaining exons encode the Greek key motifs, which are characteristic structural elements of this protein family (Sun2013Crybb2; Li2021Physiological).

The secondary structure of βB2-crystallin includes these Greek key motifs, which form a β-sandwich structure composed of two anti-parallel β-sheets. These motifs allow for dense packaging, minimizing light scattering and ensuring lens transparency (Aravind2009The; Li2021Physiological).

In terms of tertiary structure, βB2-crystallin forms a stable protein matrix with a high degree of short-range order, contributing to its solubility and stability (Li2021Physiological). The quaternary structure involves the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers through domain swapping, which is crucial for its function in the lens (Slingsby2014Functions).

Post-translational modifications, such as deamidation, can affect the quaternary structure by altering the charge at the dimer interface (Slingsby2014Functions). These structural features are essential for the protein's role in maintaining lens transparency and function.

## Function
The CRYBB2 gene encodes the βB2-crystallin protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining lens transparency and refractive function in the human eye. This protein is highly expressed in the lens, where it contributes to the lens's ability to focus light onto the retina due to its high solubility and stability (Li2021Physiological). Beyond its structural role in the lens, βB2-crystallin is also expressed in non-lens tissues, such as the retina and brain, where it has additional functions.

In the retina, βB2-crystallin is involved in neuroprotection and axonal regeneration. It supports the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and photoreceptors, and is associated with growth-associated protein GAP-43, indicating its role in axon growth (Thanos2014Role). The protein is also involved in calcium-dependent processes, which are crucial for its function in axon elongation and regeneration (Thanos2014Role).

In the brain, βB2-crystallin is expressed in regions such as the hippocampus, where it is involved in axonal growth, synaptic remodeling, and dendritic outgrowth. It may act as a calcium buffer, playing a role in calcium regulation and neuronal function (Sun2013Crybb2). These functions suggest that βB2-crystallin is important for maintaining cellular protection and survival in various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRYBB2 gene are associated with several ocular and systemic conditions. In the eye, CRYBB2 mutations are linked to various forms of congenital cataracts, including nuclear, cerulean, and Coppock-like cataracts. These mutations often lead to protein misfolding, aggregation, and altered hydrophobicity, which contribute to lens opacity and cataract formation (Santhiya2004Mutation; Litt1997Autosomal; Chen2021Whole‑exome). Specific mutations such as CRYBB2:c.62T>A (p.I21N) and p.W151C have been identified in families with congenital cataracts, affecting protein structure and stability (Santhiya2004Mutation; Chen2021Whole‑exome).

Beyond ocular conditions, CRYBB2 mutations have implications in neuropsychiatric disorders. Alterations in the CRYBB2 gene are associated with changes in prepulse inhibition and hippocampal size, features linked to schizophrenia. C-terminal mutations in βB2-crystallin are correlated with behavioral changes and various psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Li2021Physiological).

In reproductive health, mutations such as the Crybb2 philly mutation are linked to fertility issues due to defective sperm and egg production, highlighting the gene's role in testis and ovary function (Li2021Physiological).

## Interactions
CRYβB2, a protein encoded by the CRYBB2 gene, is involved in several interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes and tumorigenesis. It interacts with nucleolin, a multifunctional protein primarily located in the nucleolus, which regulates ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of AKT, EGFR, and Bcl2 signaling pathways, while decreasing p53 protein levels, thereby promoting tumorigenesis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Yan2021CRYβB2). CRYβB2 also interacts with poly(A) binding protein-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1), PAIP2, USO1, PUF60, ENDOU, and ACBD3, which are associated with translation control, cell death, DNA damage repair, self-renewal, and proliferation (Yan2021CRYβB2). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have validated the binding of CRYβB2 to nucleolin, PAIP1, and GRB2 (Yan2021CRYβB2). CRYβB2's interaction with nucleolin is linked to increased tumor growth, stemness, and metastasis, and it determines TNBC sensitivity to anti-nucleolin therapies, such as the nucleolin aptamer AS-1411 (Yan2021CRYβB2). These interactions highlight CRYβB2's significant role in regulating protein synthesis and cellular proliferation, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis.
