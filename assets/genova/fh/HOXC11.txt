# HOXC11

## Overview
HOXC11 is a gene that encodes the homeobox C11 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. The homeobox C11 protein is involved in various biological functions, including limb formation, differentiation, and maintaining cellular identity. It acts as a master regulator by influencing the expression of target genes, thereby affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. HOXC11's expression in mesenchymal stem cells and its involvement in the "HOX code" underscore its significance in tissue-specific regenerative actions and developmental regulation (Smith2019A; Bondos2020Contextdependent; Steens2022HOX).

## Structure
The HOXC11 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved 60-amino acid homeodomain, which is crucial for DNA binding. This homeodomain typically contains a helix-turn-helix motif, a common structural feature in DNA-binding proteins (Mitchelmore1998The). The primary structure of HOXC11 includes a glycine/alanine-rich sequence preceding the homeodomain, which may play a role in its function (Mitchelmore1998The). The N-terminal arm of the homeodomain contains a proline at position 7, essential for its binding specificity to DNA sequences, particularly those containing TTTAC (Mitchelmore1998The).

The secondary structure of the homeodomain is likely composed of alpha helices, typical of homeodomain proteins, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of HOXC11 are not provided in the available literature. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's stability, localization, and interactions, contributing to its functional specificity (Draime2018Posttranslational). The HOXC11 gene may also produce different isoforms through alternative splicing, although specific variants are not detailed in the context provided. These structural and functional characteristics underscore the role of HOXC11 in gene regulation and development.

## Function
HOXC11 is a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. In healthy human cells, HOXC11 is involved in the regulation of developmental processes, including limb formation and differentiation. It functions by binding to DNA and influencing the expression of target genes, thereby playing a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Bondos2020Contextdependent).

HOXC11 is expressed in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and is upregulated in iliac crest-derived MSCs, suggesting its role in distinguishing MSCs from different bone marrow sources (Steens2022HOX). This expression pattern indicates that HOXC11 may be part of a "HOX code," which is an intrinsic property of adult stem cells and is thought to be essential for tissue-specific regenerative action (Steens2022HOX).

In the context of cellular identity, HOXC11, along with other HOX genes, acts as a master regulator, maintaining the specific identity of cells and influencing their differentiation potential. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the positional identity of cells during development and in adult tissues (Smith2019A).

## Clinical Significance
HOXC11 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and congenital malformations. In breast cancer, HOXC11 is associated with endocrine resistance. It interacts with the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1, influencing the expression of proteins like S100β, which are predictors of poor disease-free survival (McIlroy2010Developmental). Elevated HOXC11 levels are linked to chemoresistance, particularly to tamoxifen, and are associated with poor survival in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma (Bondos2020Contextdependent).

In the context of congenital malformations, mutations in HOXC11 have been associated with lower limb malformations such as clubfoot. A specific missense variant, HOXC11 p.Ser191Phe, has been found to segregate with clubfoot in families, suggesting a potential role in the condition (Alvarado2016Deletions).

HOXC11 is also involved in a rare genetic fusion, NUP98-HOXC11, observed in a case of therapy-related chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion may contribute to the pathogenesis of the leukemia, highlighting the gene's role in cancer development (Shen2022Inherited).

## Interactions
HOXC11, a homeobox gene, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that influence gene expression and cellular processes. In malignant melanoma, HOXC11 interacts with the coactivator protein SRC-1. This interaction is significant as both proteins are more frequently expressed in the nucleus of malignant melanoma cells compared to benign nevi. The interaction between HOXC11 and SRC-1 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation studies, and it plays a role in the regulation of the S100beta gene, as HOXC11 is recruited to its promoter in primary melanoma cells (deBlacam2011HOXC11–SRC1).

In lung adenocarcinoma, HOXC11 acts as a transcription factor by binding to the promoter region of the SPHK1 gene, facilitating its expression. This interaction is crucial for the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, as it enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Peng2023HOXC11).

HOXC11 also interacts with the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) promoter, stimulating HNF1α-dependent transcription. This interaction involves binding to the CE-LPH1 element, which is essential for LPH promoter activity in intestinal cells (Mitchelmore1998The). These interactions highlight HOXC11's role in transcriptional regulation across different tissues and cancer types.
