# PNOC

## Overview
The PNOC gene encodes the precursor protein prepronociceptin, which is subsequently processed into the neuropeptide nociceptin. Nociceptin functions as an endogenous agonist for the nociceptin opioid peptide receptor (NOPR), a member of the opioid receptor family. This interaction is crucial for modulating nociception, the sensory perception of pain, as well as influencing stress responses, neurotransmitter release, and immune functions. The PNOC gene is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, highlighting its significant role in central nervous system activities (Blaveri2001Genetic; Xie1999The). The gene's expression is regulated by cyclic AMP and steroid hormones, suggesting its involvement in stress and nociceptive processes (Xie1999The). While PNOC has been studied for its potential links to neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, current evidence does not support a direct role in the pathogenesis of these disorders (Blaveri2001Genetic; Maschietto2015Coexpression).

## Function
The PNOC gene encodes the precursor protein for nociceptin, a neuropeptide that functions as an endogenous agonist for the opioid-receptor-like (ORL1) receptor, also known as the NOP receptor. Nociceptin is involved in modulating nociception, which is the sensory perception of pain, as well as behavioral responses to stress, neurotransmitter and hormone release, and immune functions (Xie1999The). The PNOC gene is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, suggesting its significant role in central nervous system functions (Blaveri2001Genetic).

In terms of molecular processes, nociceptin influences neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability, playing roles in pain perception and mood regulation. It is primarily active in the central nervous system, where it modulates various physiological processes (Mollereau1996Structure). The transcription of the PNOC gene is regulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and steroid hormones, with cAMP and estrogen up-regulating its expression, while glucocorticoids down-regulate it (Xie1999The). These regulatory mechanisms suggest that the PNOC gene may be involved in stress responses and nociceptive processes, potentially influencing pain perception and inflammation (Xie1999The).

## Clinical Significance
The PNOC gene, encoding prepronociceptin, has been investigated for its potential role in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Although initial studies suggested a possible link between PNOC and schizophrenia due to its expression in the brain and involvement in neurological functions, genetic association studies have not found significant differences in allele frequencies between schizophrenia patients and control groups. This suggests that variations in the PNOC gene are unlikely to contribute significantly to schizophrenia susceptibility in the studied populations (Blaveri2001Genetic).

Research on gene expression profiling in schizophrenia has identified PNOC as a hub gene within a co-expression module related to negative regulation of cell differentiation and oxidative stress. Changes in the connectivity patterns of PNOC between schizophrenia patients and control subjects indicate that alterations in its expression or connectivity may be relevant to the disorder, although a direct causal link has not been established (Maschietto2015Coexpression).

The PNOC gene's expression is predominantly in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, and it is involved in pain modulation and stress response. However, current data do not suggest a direct involvement of PNOC in the pathogenesis of specific human diseases (Mollereau1996Structure).

## Interactions
The PNOC gene encodes prepronociceptin, a precursor protein that is processed into the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ. This neuropeptide primarily interacts with the nociceptin opioid peptide receptor (NOPR), which is part of the opioid receptor family. The interaction between nociceptin and NOPR plays a significant role in modulating pain and reward pathways. Activation of NOPR by nociceptin negatively regulates dopamine neuron activity, influencing reward-seeking behavior (Parker2019A).

PNOC-expressing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form monosynaptic inputs onto dopaminergic neurons, with GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents being evoked in these neurons. This indicates a GABAergic role for PNOC neurons, as these currents are abolished by GABA receptor blockade (Parker2019A). In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), PNOC neurons provide direct inhibitory input to proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons through GABAergic synapses. This interaction is significant because POMC neurons are anorexigenic, meaning they suppress appetite (Jais2020PNOCARC).

PNOC is also noted as a mediator of pain signaling, being enriched in the pain network alongside other proteins such as OPRM1 and TRPV1 (Jamieson2014The).
