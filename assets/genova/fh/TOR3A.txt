# TOR3A

## Overview
The TOR3A gene encodes the protein torsin family 3 member A, which is part of the torsin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their roles in cellular processes such as protein folding and trafficking within the endoplasmic reticulum. Torsin family 3 member A is categorized as a chaperone protein, which assists in the proper folding of other proteins and helps maintain cellular homeostasis. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various cellular pathways and may have clinical significance in certain disorders, although the precise mechanisms and interactions remain an active area of research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
