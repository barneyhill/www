# NEPRO

## Overview
The NEPRO gene encodes the nucleolus and neural progenitor protein, a nucleolar protein that plays a pivotal role in the development and function of neural progenitor cells and preimplantation embryos. This protein is integral to ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis and cell growth, through its interaction with the RNAse-MRP endoribonuclease complex (Narayanan2019An). In neural stem cells, NEPRO is highly expressed and functions downstream of Notch signaling to maintain these cells by preventing premature neuronal differentiation (Saito2020A). Additionally, NEPRO is crucial for the formation of nucleolar precursor bodies and nucleoli in preimplantation embryos, where it also plays a role in repressing mitochondria-associated p53 apoptotic signaling, thereby preventing apoptosis (Saito2020A; Hashimoto2015Nepro). Mutations in the NEPRO gene have been associated with skeletal dysplasia, underscoring its clinical significance in human developmental disorders (Narayanan2019An).

## Function
The NEPRO gene encodes a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in the maintenance and function of neural progenitor cells and preimplantation embryos. NEPRO is involved in ribosome biogenesis, a process essential for protein synthesis and cell growth, by interacting with components of the RNAse-MRP endoribonuclease complex, which is crucial for ribosomal biogenesis (Narayanan2019An). In neural stem cells (NSCs), NEPRO is expressed at high levels and is activated downstream of Notch signaling, which is essential for maintaining NSCs by inhibiting neuronal differentiation (Saito2020A). NEPRO's function in NSCs is distinct from its role in preimplantation embryos, where it is necessary for blastocyst formation and represses mitochondria-associated p53 apoptotic signaling (Saito2020A).

In preimplantation embryos, NEPRO is localized in the nucleolus and is essential for the formation of nucleolar precursor bodies and nucleoli, which are critical for ribosome biogenesis (Hashimoto2015Nepro). The absence of NEPRO leads to increased apoptosis and abnormal ribosome biogenesis, highlighting its importance in early embryonic development (Hashimoto2015Nepro). These functions underscore NEPRO's role in cellular processes that impact neurogenesis and overall brain function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEPRO gene have been linked to skeletal dysplasia, particularly in cases with biallelic variants. A study identified a novel homozygous variant in NEPRO in a 6-year-old girl presenting with skeletal dysplasia and features similar to cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH). This condition was characterized by severe short stature, brachydactyly, skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and joint dislocations. Protein modeling suggested that these variants decrease protein stability, expanding the spectrum of ribosomopathies affecting the skeleton and highlighting the clinical significance of NEPRO gene mutations in skeletal disorders (Narayanan2019An).

In mice, the Nepro gene is essential for preimplantation development, with Nepro-deficient embryos exhibiting abnormal ribosome biogenesis and increased apoptosis. Although these findings are specific to mice, they suggest that disruptions in NEPRO function could potentially lead to developmental abnormalities in humans. The study observed increased levels of mitochondria-associated p53 and subsequent apoptosis in Nepro-deficient embryos, indicating a critical role in apoptosis regulation during early development (Hashimoto2015Nepro). However, the direct clinical significance of these findings in human diseases remains to be fully elucidated.
