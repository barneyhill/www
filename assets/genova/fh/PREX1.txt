# PREX1

## Overview
Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 1, encoded by the PREX1 gene, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by activating the small GTPase Rac1. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell migration, and growth. P-Rex1 is characterized by its complex multidomain structure, which includes Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, as well as DEP, PDZ, and IP4P domains, facilitating its interactions with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and Gβγ subunits (Lucato2015The; Cash2019Cryo–electron). These interactions are crucial for its activation and function at the plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm. P-Rex1 is implicated in various physiological contexts, such as immune cell function, neuronal development, and vascular biology, and its dysregulation is associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (BeltránNavarro2022PRex1; tsonou2020exploring).

## Structure
The PREX1 gene encodes the P-Rex1 protein, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the small GTPase Rac. P-Rex1 is a large multidomain protein with a complex structure that includes several key domains. The N-terminal region contains a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is crucial for its GEF activity, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in membrane association and binding phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Lucato2015The; Hill2005Regulation). The DH domain is composed of six main α-helices, forming an elongated bundle, while the PH domain forms a seven-β-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich (Lucato2015The).

C-terminal to the DH-PH tandem are two DEP (Disheveled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains, two PDZ (postsynaptic density protein, discs large, zona occludens-1) domains, and a large IP4P (inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase) homology domain (Lucato2015The). The IP4P domain, although lacking phosphatase activity, is structurally homologous to phosphoinositide phosphatases and forms a docking site for Gβγ subunits (Cash2019Cryo–electron).

The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions between these domains, forming a scaffold for recruiting other signaling proteins. The binding of Gβγ and PIP3 induces allosteric changes that enhance P-Rex1's GEF activity (Cash2019Cryo–electron). P-Rex1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which occurs at flexible loops and is important for its regulation (Cash2019Cryo–electron).

## Function
PREX1 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 1) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the small GTPase Rac1, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PREX1 is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, which is essential for cell migration, growth, and survival. It is activated by phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and Gβγ subunits, primarily functioning in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (tsonou2020exploring).

In neutrophils, PREX1 acts downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in Rac-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, actin polymerization, polarization, and migration, which are critical for neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory sites (tsonou2020exploring). In platelets, PREX1 is involved in GPCR-dependent aggregation and dense granule secretion, contributing to platelet-dependent vascular adhesion and tissue recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils during inflammation (tsonou2020exploring).

PREX1 also plays a role in neuronal development and behavior, where it affects Rac activity, lamellipodia formation, and cell migration. Knockdown of PREX1 in neurons results in behavioral deficits, which can be rescued by overexpression of PREX1 (tsonou2020exploring). In vascular biology, PREX1 deficiency in endothelial cells inhibits Rac1 activity, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis, and it is involved in TNF-α-induced endothelial barrier disruption (tsonou2020exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PREX1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly the luminal subtype, PREX1 is upregulated due to promoter hypomethylation, which correlates with poor patient survival. This overexpression is linked to increased metastatic potential, especially in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, where it facilitates dissemination to bone (Clements2019PREX1; BarrioReal2014Subtypespecific). 

In melanoma, PREX1 is upregulated in tumors compared to normal melanocytes, playing a crucial role in invasion and metastasis. Genetic ablation of PREX1 in mouse models impairs melanoma metastasis, highlighting its importance in metastatic signaling (Lindsay2011PRex1). 

In lower grade glioma (LGG), high PREX1 expression is associated with reduced patient survival. It acts as a signaling hub, interacting with various chemotactic agonists and growth factors, which may exacerbate tumor progression and affect the immune tumor microenvironment (BeltránNavarro2022PRex1). 

These findings suggest that PREX1 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target across a spectrum of cancers, including breast cancer, melanoma, and glioma.

## Interactions
PREX1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It binds directly to protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) through an RVxF PP1-binding motif, inhibiting PP1 activity. This interaction is direct and independent of additional proteins, as demonstrated by binding assays using purified proteins and far-Western analysis (Barber2012The).

PREX1 also interacts with the regulatory subunit RIα of type I protein kinase A (PKA) in a cAMP-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the activation of PREX1, facilitating the formation of an active Rac guanine exchange factor complex, which is essential for processes like endothelial cell migration (AdameGarcía2019cAMPdependent).

The protein also forms complexes with G protein βγ subunits, which recruit and activate PREX1 at the plasma membrane. This interaction involves the PDZ1, PDZ2, and IP4P domains of PREX1, and is essential for its activation and membrane localization (CervantesVillagrana2021Gβγ; Cash2019Cryo–electron).

PREX1's interaction with these proteins highlights its role in modulating signal transduction pathways, impacting cellular processes such as migration and growth.
