# STEAP1

## Overview
STEAP1 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the STEAP family, which is characterized by its involvement in metal-ion transport and reduction processes. The STEAP1 protein is primarily recognized for its role as an ion channel or transporter, facilitating the movement and regulation of ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ across cellular membranes (Liu2022Expression; Gomes2012STEAP). Structurally, STEAP1 is distinguished by its six transmembrane α-helices and a b-type heme cofactor, which are integral to its function in electron transport and potential enzymatic activities (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron). Unlike other STEAP family members, STEAP1 lacks a folded N-terminal intracellular domain and shows a weaker affinity for FAD, suggesting unique functional attributes (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron). Clinically, STEAP1 is notably overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate and colorectal cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Moreaux2012STEAP1; Rocha2023STEAP1a).

## Structure
The STEAP1 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane α-helices, which are integral to its function as a membrane protein (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron; BarrocaFerreira2021Enhanced). The protein forms a trimeric complex, with each protomer interacting with an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the antibody mAb120.545 (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron). This trimeric arrangement is similar to that of its family member STEAP4, suggesting a conserved structural motif within the STEAP family (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).

The tertiary structure of STEAP1 includes a b-type heme cofactor coordinated by conserved histidine residues, which is crucial for its potential role in electron transport and metal-ion reduction (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron). The intracellular loops of STEAP1 extend into the cytoplasm, while the Fabs protrude into the extracellular space, indicating a specific orientation within the membrane (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).

STEAP1 lacks a folded N-terminal intracellular domain, which distinguishes it from other STEAP family members (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron). The protein also shows a weaker affinity for FAD compared to STEAP3 and STEAP4, with cryo-EM density suggesting a loosely bound FAD cofactor (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron). These structural features highlight STEAP1's unique characteristics and potential enzymatic functions.

## Function
STEAP1 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1) is a cell surface protein that functions primarily as an ion channel or transporter, playing a role in intercellular communication and ion concentration regulation, particularly involving Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ions (Liu2022Expression; Gomes2012STEAP). Although STEAP1 lacks the N-terminal NADPH-binding domain found in other STEAP family members, it has been shown to facilitate iron(III) reduction when fused with the NADPH-binding domain of STEAP4, suggesting a potential role in iron metabolism (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).

In healthy human cells, STEAP1 is involved in mineral absorption processes and may play a role in maintaining iron homeostasis, although its precise function remains unclear (Liu2022Expression). The protein is localized on the cell membrane, where it may participate in molecular trafficking within endocytic and exocytic pathways, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Gomes2012STEAP). Despite its significant expression in cancer cells, the specific activities of STEAP1 in normal physiological conditions are not fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in healthy tissues (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).

## Clinical Significance
The STEAP1 gene is significantly overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate, bladder, colon, ovarian, and Ewing sarcoma, and is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. High STEAP1 expression is linked to reduced overall survival in colorectal cancer, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma (Moreaux2012STEAP1). In prostate cancer, STEAP1 overexpression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and resistance to taxane-based chemotherapeutics, suggesting its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Rocha2023STEAP1a). 

In breast cancer, STEAP1 expression varies, with some studies showing underexpression in invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, while others report overexpression in certain cases. This variability may be due to differences in clinicopathological characteristics and methodologies (Rocha2022Comprehensive). In leukemia, STEAP1 is overexpressed in T- and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia but shows conflicting expression patterns in acute myeloid leukemia (Rocha2022Comprehensive). 

STEAP1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target are underscored by its involvement in intercellular communication and tumor growth, making it a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy (ChallitaEid2007Monoclonal).

## Interactions
STEAP1 interacts with various proteins, forming complexes that are significant in its function and potential as a therapeutic target. It is known to form heterotrimeric assemblies with other STEAP family members, such as STEAP2 and STEAP4, which facilitate electron transport and metal-ion reduction. This interaction is crucial because STEAP1 lacks the NADPH-binding domain necessary for independent ferric reductase activity, suggesting it may receive electrons from NADPH bound to adjacent STEAP2/3/4 subunits (Xu2022STEAP1–4; Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).

The cryo-electron microscopy structure of STEAP1 reveals its interaction with the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of the antibody mAb120.545. This interaction occurs through the extracellular helices of STEAP1, with specific polar and hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the complex. The Fab120.545 antibody inhibits the ferric reductase activity of a STEAP4/1 chimera, indicating that it binds near the substrate-binding site, affecting the protein's function (Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).

STEAP1's expression often correlates with STEAP2 in cancers, and both proteins can copurify, suggesting they may form a functional complex. This interaction is significant in cancer progression, as STEAP1 is highly expressed in various cancers, including prostate cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Nakamura2023Targeting; Oosterheert2020Cryoelectron).
