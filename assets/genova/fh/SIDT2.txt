# SIDT2

## Overview
The SIDT2 gene encodes the SID1 transmembrane family member 2 protein, a lysosomal membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of nucleic acids into lysosomes, a process known as RNautophagy and DNautophagy. This protein is characterized by its nine transmembrane helices and a cytosolic domain containing an arginine-rich motif essential for binding RNA and DNA (Hase2020Cytosolic). SIDT2 is involved in various cellular processes, including the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. It also plays a role in the innate immune response by facilitating the transport of double-stranded RNA across the lysosomal membrane (Zheng2023CryoEM). The gene's function extends to influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health, with implications in conditions such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (LeónMimila2020A). Additionally, SIDT2's interaction with nucleic acids has potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease, by reducing the expression of toxic proteins (Hase2020Cytosolic).

## Structure
The SIDT2 protein is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in the transport of nucleic acids into lysosomes, a process known as RNautophagy and DNautophagy. The molecular structure of SIDT2 includes an N-terminal glycosylated luminal region, a main cytosolic domain (CD), nine transmembrane helices, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Hase2020Cytosolic). The cytosolic domain, located between transmembrane domains 1 and 2, comprises amino acid residues 316 to 447 and contains an arginine-rich motif (ARM) crucial for binding RNA and DNA (Hase2020Cytosolic). This ARM includes arginine residues at positions 436, 440, and 443, which are essential for nucleic acid binding and are conserved among various species (Hase2020Cytosolic).

The SIDT2 protein's ability to bind nucleic acids is selective, with a preference for certain sequences such as poly-G and poly-dG, but not poly-A, poly-C, or poly-U (Hase2020Cytosolic). The presence of basic amino acids, such as arginine and lysine, in the nucleic acid binding domain supports this interaction through their basic side chains (Hase2020Cytosolic). The protein's structure and function suggest potential applications in reducing the expression levels of disease-causing toxic proteins, such as those involved in Huntington's disease (Hase2020Cytosolic).

## Function
The SIDT2 gene encodes a lysosomal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway, essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. SIDT2 is involved in the transport of nucleic acids into lysosomes, a process known as RNautophagy and DNautophagy, where it facilitates the degradation of RNA and DNA. This function is mediated by an arginine-rich motif in its cytosolic domain, which binds RNA and DNA, enabling their transport across the lysosomal membrane (Hase2020Cytosolic).

SIDT2 is also involved in the uptake of naked single-stranded oligonucleotides into cells and plays a role in activating the innate immune response by transporting internalized double-stranded RNA across the lysosome, engaging with cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors, and inducing type I interferon production (Zheng2023CryoEM). In the context of kidney function, SIDT2 is essential for the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway, maintaining kidney structure and filtration function. Its deletion leads to significant kidney damage, indicating its critical role in cellular homeostasis and function (Geng2021Sidt2). Additionally, SIDT2 is involved in cholesterol transport, impacting lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health (LeónMimila2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIDT2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of kidney function, the deletion of SIDT2 impairs the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway, leading to kidney damage characterized by structural changes and increased proteinuria. This impairment is similar to conditions observed in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that SIDT2 is crucial for maintaining kidney health (Geng2021Sidt2).

SIDT2 is also associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Variants such as rs7107152 and rs1242229 have been linked to metabolic syndrome traits, including altered triglyceride levels, in a Korean population. These variants affect the expression of SIDT2 and related genes, impacting lipid metabolism and insulin secretion (Moon2018Multiple). In a Mexican population, the rs1784042 variant is associated with low HDL-c levels, a component of metabolic syndrome, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes, particularly in women (LeónReyes2020The).

In the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, SIDT2 plays a role in RNautophagy, a process crucial for degrading RNA within lysosomes. Mutations affecting SIDT2's nucleic acid-binding capacity can disrupt this process, potentially contributing to conditions like Huntington's disease (Hase2020Cytosolic).

## Interactions
SIDT2 is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in the transport of nucleic acids, particularly RNA, into lysosomes. It interacts with nucleic acids through an arginine-rich motif located in its cytosolic domain, which is crucial for its RNautophagic activity. Specific arginine residues at positions 436, 440, and 443 are essential for this interaction, as mutations at these sites significantly reduce or eliminate SIDT2's ability to bind RNA and DNA (Hase2020Cytosolic).

SIDT2 also interacts with CAG RNA repeats associated with Huntington's disease, particularly affecting the HTT gene. This interaction is CAG repeat-dependent and facilitates the degradation of HTT mRNA, reducing the levels of polyglutamine-expanded HTT aggregates (Hase2020Cytosolic).

In addition to its interactions with nucleic acids, SIDT2 works synergistically with LAMP2C, another lysosomal membrane protein, to enhance RNautophagic activity. This synergy is dependent on specific arginine residues in both proteins, and mutations in these residues abolish the synergistic effect (Hase2020Cytosolic). These interactions highlight SIDT2's role in nucleic acid transport and its potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases.
