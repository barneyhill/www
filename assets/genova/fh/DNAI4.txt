# DNAI4

## Overview
DNAI4 is a gene that encodes the dynein axonemal intermediate chain 4, a protein that is a critical component of the axonemal dynein complex. This protein is categorized as part of the dynein family, which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. The dynein axonemal intermediate chain 4 plays a pivotal role in the generation of motile force necessary for the movement of these structures, which are crucial for various physiological processes, including respiratory tract clearance and sperm motility. Mutations in the DNAI4 gene have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to chronic respiratory issues and other clinical manifestations (Harsha2018KARTAGENER’S; Rao2024Structure). Additionally, alterations in DNAI4 expression have been observed in certain cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis and treatment response (Zhou2024Developing; Park2022Development).

## Function
DNAI4 (dynein axonemal intermediate chain 4) is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in the function of motile cilia and flagella in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in generating motile force, which is essential for the movement of cilia and flagella, structures that are vital for various cellular and physiological processes. In particular, DNAI4 is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it contributes to cellular motility and the movement of fluids across epithelial surfaces (Rao2024Structure).

The axonemal dyneins, including DNAI4, are integral to the movement of cilia and flagella, facilitating processes such as respiratory tract clearance and sperm motility. These dyneins are part of a complex structure that includes outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), which anchor on microtubule doublets within the axoneme. The dynamic binding and dissociation of dyneins from these microtubule doublets are regulated by nucleotide states, allowing for the precise control of ciliary and flagellar movement (Rao2024Structure). DNAI4, as part of this complex, is essential for the proper functioning of these motile structures, contributing to critical biological processes in humans.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAI4 gene, which encodes a component of the axonemal dynein complex, are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). This genetic disorder is characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and reduced fertility due to impaired ciliary movement. The dysfunction in ciliary motility results from defective dynein arms, which are crucial for the proper functioning of cilia and flagella (Harsha2018KARTAGENER’S).

In the context of cancer, alterations in the expression of DNAI4 have been observed in osteosarcoma and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In osteosarcoma, DNAI4 is among the genes with mutation frequencies ranging from 3-11%, which may have implications for cancer immunotherapy, particularly concerning tumor mutation burden and immune checkpoint expression (Zhou2024Developing). In TNBC, DNAI4 is listed among the down-regulated genes, which may influence the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as identified in a gene expression-based predictive model (Park2022Development). These findings suggest that DNAI4 may play a role in the pathogenesis and treatment response of certain cancers, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
