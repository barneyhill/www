# TGM2

## Overview
The TGM2 gene encodes the protein transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme that belongs to the transglutaminase family. TG2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including protein cross-linking, cell signaling, and apoptosis. It is characterized by its ability to catalyze calcium-dependent transamidation reactions, which result in the formation of N(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds, conferring structural stability and protease resistance to protein complexes (Iismaa2009Transglutaminases; Begg2006Mechanism). Additionally, TG2 functions as a GTPase and a protein disulfide isomerase, further diversifying its role in cellular homeostasis and stress response (Rossin2023Type). The enzyme's activity is intricately regulated by calcium and GTP, which influence its conformational states and functional outcomes (Tatsukawa2021Role). TG2's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, such as tissue repair, neurodegeneration, and cancer, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Tatsukawa2021Role; Malkomes2023Transglutaminase).

## Structure
Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) is a multifunctional enzyme with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of TGM2 consists of a polypeptide chain encoded by the TGM2 gene located on human chromosome 20q11-12, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of 74 to 80 kDa (Iismaa2009Transglutaminases). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Thangaraju2017Genomic).

The tertiary structure of TGM2 is characterized by four distinct domains: an NH2-terminal β-sandwich domain, a catalytic core domain, and two COOH-terminal β-barrel domains (Iismaa2009Transglutaminases; Rossin2023Type). The catalytic core domain contains a catalytic triad composed of Cys277, His335, and Asp358, essential for its enzymatic activity (Rossin2023Type). The quaternary structure of TGM2 can involve homodimer formation, which is significant for its functional versatility (Thangaraju2017Genomic).

TGM2 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and stability (Thangaraju2017Genomic). The enzyme also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its diverse biological roles (Thangaraju2017Genomic). These structural features enable TGM2 to participate in numerous cellular processes, including protein cross-linking and cell signaling.

## Function
Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is ubiquitously expressed and can be found in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, and extracellular matrix (Tatsukawa2021Role; Rossin2023Type). TGM2 plays a significant role in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue repair. It is involved in receptor signaling, extracellular matrix assembly, and apoptosis, and is allosterically regulated by calcium and GTP, which modulate its activity (Begg2006Mechanism).

TGM2 catalyzes calcium-dependent transamidation reactions, leading to posttranslational amine modification of proteins or cross-linking of interchain glutamine and lysine residues to form N(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds. These bonds confer rigidity and protease resistance on protein complexes (Begg2006Mechanism). In its GTP-bound closed conformation, TGM2 is associated with prosurvival functions, while the Ca2+-bound open form exhibits transamidase activity, which can lead to either cell death or survival depending on the context (Tatsukawa2021Role).

TGM2 also functions as a GTPase, mediating intracellular signaling through various G protein-coupled receptors, and acts as a protein disulfide isomerase, influencing cellular proteostasis and stress adaptation (Rossin2023Type; Begg2006Mechanism). Its diverse roles in cellular functions are further supported by its involvement in the phagocytosis of dead cells by macrophages and its role in fibrosis during tissue repair (Tatsukawa2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TGM2 gene, which encodes transglutaminase 2 (TG2), are implicated in several diseases. In early-onset type 2 diabetes, novel missense mutations such as p.M330R, p.I331N, and p.N333S have been identified. These mutations decrease TG2's transamidating activity, potentially impairing insulin secretion and contributing to glucose metabolism disorders (BERNASSOLA2002Role; Porzio2007Missense). TG2 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In Alzheimer's, TG2 mediates the crosslinking of amyloid-β and tau proteins, accelerating their aggregation and contributing to disease pathology (Min2018New; Tatsukawa2016Transglutaminase). In Parkinson's, TG2 is implicated in the formation of Lewy bodies through the cross-linking of α-synuclein (Min2018New).

In cancer, TG2 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer due to its role in inactivating the tumor suppressor p53, promoting cell survival and growth (Malkomes2023Transglutaminase). In gastric cancer, high TG2 expression is linked to increased macrophage infiltration and aggressive cancer phenotypes (Cho2020Amplification). TG2's role in fibrosis involves ECM stabilization and activation of TGF-β, contributing to fibrotic processes (Tatsukawa2021Role). These findings highlight TG2's significant impact on various pathological conditions through its enzymatic activity and interactions.

## Interactions
Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) is known for its diverse interactions with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. TGM2 interacts with fibronectin (FN) in the extracellular matrix, where it acts as an integrin-binding co-receptor, facilitating cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is non-covalent and involves high-affinity binding, with key residues in the N-terminal domain of TGM2 being crucial for this binding (Cardoso2016Dissecting).

TGM2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 in colorectal cancer cells. This interaction leads to the inactivation of p53, preventing apoptosis and promoting tumorigenicity. The transamidase activity of TGM2 is essential for this interaction, which involves the DNA-binding domain of p53 (Malkomes2021Transglutaminase).

Additionally, TGM2 interacts with BAF250a, a core subunit of the cBAF chromatin remodeling complex. This interaction occurs through the β-barrel 1 domain of TGM2 and the C-terminal domain of BAF250a, influencing transcriptional regulation by mediating polyamine incorporation into BAF250a (Kim2021Transglutaminase). These interactions highlight TGM2's role in modulating cellular functions and gene expression.
