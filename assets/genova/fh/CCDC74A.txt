# CCDC74A

## Overview
CCDC74A is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 74A, which is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during cell division. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are essential for its role in microtubule binding and spindle assembly. CCDC74A plays a significant role in organizing spindle microtubules, particularly in the formation and stabilization of kinetochore fibers (K-fibers), which are crucial for accurate chromosomal alignment during mitosis (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). The protein's ability to self-associate and form homodimers is vital for its function in microtubule bundling and stabilization (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). Mutations and alterations in the expression of CCDC74A have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression and resistance mechanisms (Otohinoyi2022Integrating; Schueler2019Induction).

## Structure
The CCDC74A protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, often forming alpha-helical structures that enable dimerization or oligomerization. These domains are crucial for the protein's function in microtubule binding and spindle assembly during cell division (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). CCDC74A contains two distinct regions, spanning amino acids 79-98 and 260-314, which are responsible for direct microtubule binding. These regions are rich in positively charged amino acid residues, likely interacting with the negatively charged C-terminal tail of tubulin dimers (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

The protein exhibits self-association activity, which is essential for its role in microtubule bundling and K-fiber formation. This self-association is facilitated by specific regions within the protein, including the N-terminal 1-98 amino acids and the C-terminal 221-314 amino acids (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). Mutations in these regions can reduce self-association without affecting microtubule binding, highlighting the importance of these domains in stabilizing microtubules and ensuring proper chromosomal alignment during mitosis (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). The protein's ability to form oligomers or macromolecular aggregates may provide multiple microtubule-binding sites, contributing to stable microtubule bundling (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC74A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CCDC74A was identified among mutations in resistant clones of a patient-derived xenograft model, suggesting a potential role in acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, although its biological function remains unclear (Schueler2019Induction). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CCDC74A was listed among the top 30 somatic mutated genes, with significant expression changes, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's pathology (Otohinoyi2022Integrating).

In prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), CCDC74A was identified as part of a prediction model for patient prognosis, where it was associated with alternative splicing events linked to survival outcomes (Zhu2023Identification). Additionally, a nonsynonymous mutation in CCDC74A was found in a case of acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid, although the clinical significance of this mutation was not detailed (Nichols2013A). These findings suggest that CCDC74A may play a role in cancer progression and resistance mechanisms, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.

## Interactions
CCDC74A is involved in critical interactions with microtubules, playing a significant role in spindle microtubule organization during cell division. The protein binds directly to microtubules through two distinct domains, which are essential for its function in microtubule bundling and stabilization, particularly in the formation of kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). CCDC74A also exhibits self-association activity, forming homodimers that are crucial for its role in microtubule bundling and stabilization (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). This self-association is mediated by specific amino acid sequences and is necessary for the protein's function in maintaining spindle integrity and ensuring proper chromosome alignment (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

The protein's interaction with microtubules is facilitated by positively charged amino acids that interact with the negatively charged tubulin dimers, highlighting its role in stabilizing microtubule bundles (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). CCDC74A is particularly abundant on K-fibers, suggesting its primary role in stabilizing the spindle apparatus by crosslinking microtubules of K-fibers (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). These interactions are vital for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment, which is essential for accurate chromosomal alignment during mitosis (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).
