# GAB3

## Overview
GAB3, or GRB2 associated binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the Gab family of scaffolding proteins, which are integral to various intracellular signaling pathways. The GAB3 protein is characterized by its modular structure, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, proline-rich regions, and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling. Predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, GAB3 is involved in the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, particularly macrophages, and plays a significant role in natural killer (NK) cell function. It acts downstream of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) and is crucial for the expansion of NK cells, impacting immune responses and pregnancy outcomes. Despite its important functions, studies suggest that GAB3 is not essential for normal development or immune function, indicating potential redundancy with other Gab family members (Bourgin2002Induced; Seiffert2003Gab3Deficient; Sliz2019Gab3).

## Structure
The GAB3 protein is a member of the Gab family of scaffolding proteins, characterized by a modular structure that includes an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, central proline-rich regions, and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The PH domain is crucial for membrane recruitment, as it binds preferentially to specific phosphoinositides like PI 3,4,5 P3, facilitating the localization of GAB3 to membrane areas where receptors are activated (Wöhrle2009Function). The proline-rich regions serve as potential binding sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2 and Mona, with the atypical proline-rich motif in GAB3 acting as a docking site for these proteins (Bourgin2002Induced).

GAB3 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation following stimulation by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), indicating its role in myeloid lineage cell differentiation (Bourgin2002Induced). The interaction between GAB3 and the Mona adapter protein is mediated through the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain of Mona, which binds to the atypical proline-rich motif in GAB3, and this interaction is constitutive, not requiring phosphorylation (Bourgin2002Induced). The phosphorylation of GAB3 occurs in two distinct phases during M-CSF stimulation, which is associated with macrophage differentiation (Bourgin2002Induced).

## Function
GAB3 (GRB2 associated binding protein 3) is a member of the Gab family of scaffolding proteins, which play a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways. GAB3 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and is involved in the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, particularly in macrophage development. It functions downstream of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), where it is phosphorylated in response to M-CSF stimulation, forming signaling complexes that include the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, essential for macrophage differentiation (Bourgin2002Induced).

GAB3 also plays a significant role in natural killer (NK) cell function. It is crucial for the expansion of NK cells induced by interleukins IL-2 and IL-15, affecting MAPK signaling pathways. This function is vital for NK cell-mediated immune responses, including tumor cell clearance and successful pregnancy outcomes (Sliz2019Gab3). GAB3's involvement in these pathways highlights its importance in immune regulation and cell differentiation processes. Despite its significant roles, studies in Gab3-deficient mice suggest that GAB3 is not essential for normal development or immune function, indicating potential redundancy with other Gab family members (Seiffert2003Gab3Deficient).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GAB3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of pregnancy, GAB3 is crucial for the function and expansion of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, which are essential for proper placental development. Deficiency in GAB3 can lead to impaired uNK cell function, resulting in abnormal trophoblast invasion and complications such as stillbirth, retained placenta, and maternal hemorrhage. These conditions are similar to placenta accreta, where trophoblasts invade too deeply into the uterine wall (Sliz2019Gab3).

In the realm of immune disorders, GAB3, along with GAB2, plays a redundant role in suppressing colitis by modulating macrophage and CD8+ T-cell activation. Mice lacking both Gab2 and Gab3 genes develop spontaneous colitis-like symptoms, indicating that deficiencies in these genes may contribute to inflammatory diseases by affecting immune cell regulation (Wang2019Gab2).

GAB3 overexpression has been associated with tumor growth, particularly in glioma, a type of brain cancer. Elevated levels of GAB3 in glioma tissues lead to increased Akt activation and cell proliferation, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jia2017Gab3).

## Interactions
Gab3, a member of the Gab family of scaffolding proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. Gab3 interacts constitutively with Grb2, a key adapter protein, and upon tyrosine phosphorylation, it can bind to SHP2 and PI3K, facilitating downstream signaling cascades (Seiffert2003Gab3Deficient). This interaction is significant in the context of macrophage differentiation, where Gab3 acts downstream of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) (Seiffert2003Gab3Deficient).

Gab3 also interacts specifically with the monocytic adapter protein Mona, particularly after M-CSF stimulation, forming complexes that are crucial for macrophage differentiation (Bourgin2002Induced). This interaction is mediated through Mona's carboxy-terminal SH3 domain binding to an atypical proline-rich motif on Gab3, and it does not require phosphorylation, indicating a constitutive nature (Bourgin2002Induced).

In the context of glioma, Gab3 has been shown to associate with the p85 protein, suggesting its role as an upstream regulator of the p85-Akt signaling pathway, which is important for glioma cell proliferation (Jia2017Gab3). These interactions highlight Gab3's involvement in diverse cellular processes, including differentiation, immune response, and tumorigenesis.
