# HNRNPUL1

## Overview
HNRNPUL1 is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1 (hnRNP UL1), a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing and DNA repair mechanisms. As a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, hnRNP UL1 is involved in the biogenesis and recycling of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and is essential for proper transcription termination and pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is characterized by its central domain containing SPRY and nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)-binding domains, which facilitate ATP binding and oligomerization, and its intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains with RGG motifs for RNA binding. HNRNPUL1 is also implicated in the DNA damage response, where it is recruited to sites of double-strand breaks and interacts with key components of the DNA repair machinery. Mutations in the HNRNPUL1 gene have been associated with various diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and congenital limb malformations, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome stability (Blackwell2020Hnrnpul1; Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1; Cichocka2022The).

## Structure
The HNRNPUL1 protein is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, characterized by its involvement in various RNA processes. It contains a central domain with tightly juxtaposed SPRY and nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)-binding domains, which include Walker A and B motifs. This domain allows ATP binding and regulates oligomerization, similar to hnRNPU (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). The NTP-binding domain shares structural homology with the kinase domain of mammalian polynucleotide kinase phosphatase PNKP, classifying it as a dead polynucleotide kinase (dPNK) (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). 

HNRNPUL1 also features intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains (CTDs) with interspersed RGG motifs associated with RNA binding (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as methylation on arginine residues within the RGG motif (Hong2013The). 

The protein's tertiary structure includes a single globular fold formed by the SPRY and NTP-binding domains, with a high confidence score from structural analysis, except for a region around a ligand-binding pocket (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). HNRNPUL1 can form complexes with other proteins, indicating a potential quaternary structure (Cichocka2022The). Splice variant isoforms of HNRNPUL1 may exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Cichocka2022The).

## Function
The HNRNPUL1 gene encodes the hnRNP UL1 protein, which plays a multifaceted role in RNA processing and DNA repair in healthy human cells. It is crucial for the biogenesis and recycling of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), ensuring efficient Integrator-mediated cleavage of nascent RNA downstream of snRNA genes. This process is essential for proper transcription termination and pre-mRNA splicing, particularly involving U4 and U6 snRNAs (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). The protein interacts with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and is involved in co-transcriptional processing of target RNAs, highlighting its role in snRNA 3' processing and transcription termination (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1).

In addition to its role in RNA metabolism, hnRNP UL1 is involved in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. It is recruited to sites of DNA damage, specifically double-strand breaks, where it participates in repair processes. This recruitment is regulated by arginine methylation, which is crucial for its interaction with the MRN complex and subsequent DNA repair activities (Gurunathan2015Arginine; Cichocka2022The). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genome stability and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNRNPUL1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both familial and sporadic cases have been linked to mutations in HNRNPUL1. These mutations, such as the R541X mutation, suggest a loss of function that may contribute to ALS pathology by disrupting snRNA processing and histone mRNA processing, leading to motor neuron death (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). HNRNPUL1 is also implicated in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) due to a chromosomal translocation that creates an aberrant transcription factor, highlighting its role in hematological disorders (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1).

In addition to its role in ALS and leukemia, HNRNPUL1 mutations have been identified in individuals with congenital limb malformations. A variant of uncertain significance, c.1673dup, p. (Glu560Argfs*17), was found in two sisters with craniofacial and limb abnormalities, suggesting a potential autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Blackwell2020Hnrnpul1; Blackwell2022Hnrnpul1). These findings indicate that HNRNPUL1 may play a critical role in skeletal and limb development, with its dysfunction potentially leading to developmental disorders (Blackwell2020Hnrnpul1).

## Interactions
HNRNPUL1 is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism and DNA damage response. It interacts with RNA-binding proteins, ribosomal proteins, and core snRNP components, and is crucial for the assembly and recycling of the U4-U6/U5 tri-snRNP in the nucleoplasm, working alongside SART3 (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). HNRNPUL1 binds to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, interacting with Ser2,5, and 7-phosphorylated PolII, indicating its association with actively transcribing PolII (Yonchev2023hnRNPUL1). 

The protein is also involved in DNA repair processes, interacting with NBS1, a component of the DNA damage sensing complex MRE11-RAD50-NBS1. This interaction is regulated by arginine methylation of HNRNPUL1 by PRMT1, which is crucial for its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Gurunathan2015Arginine). HNRNPUL1 also interacts with PARP1, affecting its recruitment to DNA damage sites and playing a role in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Hong2013The). These interactions highlight HNRNPUL1's multifaceted role in RNA processing and DNA damage response.
