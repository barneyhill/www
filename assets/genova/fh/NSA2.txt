# NSA2

## Overview
NSA2 is a gene that encodes the NSA2 ribosome biogenesis factor, a protein integral to the assembly and maturation of the large ribosomal subunit, specifically the 60S subunit, in eukaryotic cells. The NSA2 protein is characterized by its α-helical N-domain and a globular C-domain, and it belongs to the S8e protein family, indicating a conserved structural motif across species (paternoga2017ribosome). Functionally, NSA2 is essential for ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly, playing a pivotal role in cell proliferation and protein synthesis through its involvement in the mTOR signaling pathway (Xing2018Nop7associated). Clinically, NSA2 has been implicated in various diseases, including diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease, due to its altered expression levels and interactions with key cellular pathways (Zhang2024Coregulation; Shahni2011Elevated). Its evolutionary conservation from yeast to humans underscores its fundamental role in cellular biology (Zhang2010NSA2).

## Structure
The NSA2 ribosome biogenesis factor is a protein involved in the assembly of ribosomes, specifically the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit. Structurally, NSA2 consists of an α-helical N-domain and a globular C-domain. The N-domain is highly flexible and similar to α-helical extensions found in ribosomal proteins, while the C-domain is composed of β-strands and shares a similar fold to the β-barrel of the ribosomal protein Rps8 (paternoga2017ribosome). NSA2 is classified as a member of the S8e protein family, indicating a conserved structure across species (paternoga2017ribosome).

The N-domain of NSA2 is crucial for its association with pre-ribosomes, as truncation studies have shown that removing the N-terminal α-helices results in a loss of ribosome association (paternoga2017ribosome). The protein also contains a conserved ribosomal S8e domain, which is part of a superfamily of proteins with sequence similarities (Xing2018Nop7associated). NSA2's interaction with other ribosome assembly factors, such as Rsa4, is essential for its function, with specific amino acids like tyrosine 90 playing a critical role in these interactions (paternoga2017ribosome).

## Function
NSA2 is a nucleolar protein essential for ribosome biogenesis, specifically involved in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit in human cells. It plays a critical role in the synthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), necessary for the formation of functional ribosomes. NSA2 is involved in the maturation of 27SB pre-rRNAs and is crucial for the synthesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit, as its knockdown leads to a significant loss of this subunit while the 40S subunit remains unaffected (Lebreton2006Nsa2; Xing2018Nop7associated).

NSA2 is also implicated in protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Its depletion results in reduced protein synthesis rates and cell proliferation, partly mediated by the mTOR signaling pathway, as NSA2 knockdown leads to decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its downstream effectors (Xing2018Nop7associated). The protein is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and localizes to the nucleolus, where it is required for rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Zhang2010NSA2; Xing2018Nop7associated).

NSA2's role in cell biology extends to its involvement in the cell cycle, where it promotes cell proliferation and facilitates the G1/S transition, indicating its importance in cell growth and division (Zhang2010NSA2).

## Clinical Significance
NSA2 (NSA2 ribosome biogenesis factor) has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of diabetes, particularly diabetic nephropathy (DN), NSA2 expression is significantly elevated. Studies have shown that NSA2 mRNA and protein levels are increased in the kidneys of diabetic mouse models and in patients with DN, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Shahni2011Elevated). The gene is involved in the TGFβ1 pathway, a major mediator of glucose-induced changes leading to DN, and its expression is upregulated in response to high glucose levels (Shahni2013Nop7associated).

NSA2 is also linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where its expression is co-regulated with GFM2, affecting mitochondrial function and potentially contributing to CKD progression (Zhang2024Coregulation). In cancer, NSA2's role in ribosome biogenesis and its upregulation in adenocarcinoma patients suggest it may contribute to tumor cell proliferation by affecting protein synthesis and mTOR signaling (Xing2018Nop7associated). These findings highlight NSA2's clinical significance in various diseases, particularly those involving metabolic and proliferative dysregulation.

## Interactions
NSA2, a ribosome biogenesis factor, is involved in several critical interactions during the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It physically interacts with the ribosome assembly factor Rsa4, forming a complex that connects the ATPase Rea1 to the maturing catalytic center of the large ribosomal subunit. This interaction is mediated by a 13-amino-acid stretch in the middle domain of NSA2, which binds to the β-propeller of Rsa4, and is resistant to high salt concentrations, indicating a strong binding affinity (paternoga2017ribosome).

NSA2 also interacts with several other proteins, including Nog1, a putative GTPase essential for its presence in pre-60S complexes. This interaction is crucial for the maturation of 27SB pre-rRNA intermediates (Lebreton2006Nsa2; Xing2018Nop7associated). NSA2 is part of a protein cage around helix 89, along with assembly factors Nog1, Nog2, and Nug1, which prevents helix 89 from assuming its mature position too early in 60S biogenesis (paternoga2017ribosome).

NSA2 binds to multiple rRNA domains, stabilizing them during ribosome assembly. It interacts with rRNA at the maturing A-site and is associated with the central protuberance, the peptidyl transferase center, and the P stalk of the pre-ribosome (paternoga2017ribosome).
