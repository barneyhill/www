# BATF2

## Overview
BATF2, or basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. The BATF2 protein is characterized by its α-helical bZIP domain, which includes a basic DNA-binding region and a leucine zipper motif essential for dimerization with JUN family proteins. This transcription factor is predominantly expressed in immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes, where it plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and cytokine expression. BATF2 is involved in the modulation of antiviral responses and type I interferon signaling pathways, forming heterodimers with other transcription factors like c-JUN and interacting with interferon-regulatory factors such as IRF4 and IRF8. Additionally, BATF2 has been implicated in cancer biology, often functioning as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer cell growth and influencing chemotherapy resistance. Its expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer (Zsurka2023Loss; Lin2021Expression; Murphy2013Specificity).

## Structure
BATF2, also known as SARI, is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, characterized by an α-helical bZIP domain. This domain includes a basic DNA-binding region and a leucine zipper motif, which is crucial for dimerization with JUN family proteins, such as JUN, JUNB, and JUND (Chang2018Quantitative; Murphy2013Specificity). Unlike other members of the BATF family, BATF2 possesses an additional carboxy-terminal domain, although its function remains unknown (Chang2018Quantitative; Murphy2013Specificity).

The leucine zipper motif in BATF2 facilitates the formation of heterodimers with JUN proteins, allowing these complexes to bind specific DNA sequences, including TPA response elements (TREs) and cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) (Murphy2013Specificity). BATF2 can also form heterotrimers with IRF4 and IRF8, which influences its DNA binding preferences and regulatory roles (Chang2018Quantitative).

BATF2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its DNA-binding ability and transcriptional activity (Murphy2013Specificity). The protein may exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its functional properties (Lin2021Expression).

## Function
BATF2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses in human cells. It belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family and is predominantly expressed in macrophages and monocytes, where it regulates macrophage activation and the development of certain dendritic cell lineages, such as CD8α+ and CD103+ dendritic cells (Zsurka2023Loss). BATF2 is involved in the regulation of cytokine expression, maintaining a balanced immune response by modulating the response to various stimuli, including TLR4, TLR7/8, and cytosolic nucleic acid receptors like RIG-I and cGAS (Zsurka2023Loss).

In healthy human cells, BATF2 acts as an immunomodulatory transcription factor, influencing the expression of genes involved in antiviral responses and type I interferon signaling pathways (Zsurka2023Loss). It forms heterodimers with other transcription factors, such as c-JUN, and interacts with interferon-regulatory factors like IRF1, IRF4, and IRF8, which are crucial for various immune functions (Zsurka2023Loss; Tussiwand2012Compensatory). BATF2's activity in the nucleus involves binding to DNA to regulate transcription, impacting processes like inflammation and cellular proliferation (Zsurka2023Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BATF2 gene have been linked to various cancers, where it often functions as a tumor suppressor. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decreased BATF2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an independent risk factor for survival. This downregulation is not due to mutations in the gene's exons, suggesting other mechanisms like promoter hypermethylation might be responsible (Ma2010Decreased). Similarly, in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), reduced BATF2 expression correlates with poor tumor differentiation and decreased patient survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (WEN2013Decreased).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high BATF2 expression is linked to prolonged overall survival, indicating its protective role (Lin2021Expression). In gastric cancer, BATF2 overexpression can inhibit chemotherapy resistance by suppressing AP-1 activity, which is associated with drug resistance mechanisms (Yang2019BATF2a).

Beyond cancer, BATF2 plays a role in neuroinflammation. It regulates interferon-γ signaling in astrocytes, and its loss exacerbates conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, suggesting a protective role against excessive inflammation in the central nervous system (Tinkey2024BATF2).

## Interactions
BATF2, a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms heterodimers with JUN proteins, such as JUNB, which allows it to bind to DNA elements like CRE and TRE sites. However, BATF2 shows a preference for CRE sites over TRE sites when forming heterodimers with JUNB (Chang2018Quantitative). These interactions are crucial for its role in immune cell regulation.

BATF2 also interacts with members of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family, specifically IRF4 and IRF8, to form heterotrimers. These complexes exhibit distinct DNA binding preferences, particularly in terms of the spacing between binding sites, which influences their binding energy and specificity (Chang2018Quantitative). The interaction with IRF proteins is essential for BATF2's function in immune-regulatory networks, as it helps bind to AP-1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) (Murphy2013Specificity).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, BATF2 has been implicated in cancer biology. It is proposed to inhibit the growth of cancer cells by forming transcriptionally inert complexes with JUN proteins, potentially reducing AP-1 activity (Murphy2013Specificity). These interactions highlight BATF2's multifaceted role in both immune function and cancer suppression.
