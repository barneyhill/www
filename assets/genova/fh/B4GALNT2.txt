# B4GALNT2

## Overview
B4GALNT2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 2, a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the Sd a carbohydrate epitope. This enzyme plays a critical role in the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine to galactose residues, forming the Sd a antigen, which is important for normal cellular processes and immune recognition. The B4GALNT2 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.33 and produces two major isoforms of the enzyme through alternative splicing, each with distinct functional properties. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the modification of cell surface molecules, influencing tissue development and function. B4GALNT2 has significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal cancer, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis and response to therapy (Groux‐Degroote2021B4GALNT2; Dall’Olio2014The; Pucci2020High).

## Structure
The B4GALNT2 protein, also known as β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II, is a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the Sd a carbohydrate epitope. The primary structure of B4GALNT2 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the B4GALNT2 gene, which is located on chromosome 17q21.33 and consists of 11 coding exons (Dall’Olio2014The). The protein has two major isoforms: a long form (LF-B4GALNT2) and a short form (SF-B4GALNT2), resulting from alternative splicing. The long form has a 67-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail, one of the longest among glycosyltransferases, suggesting a specific function, while the short form is associated with higher enzyme activity (Cogez2023NGlycan; Dall’Olio2014The).

The secondary structure of B4GALNT2 includes a GT-A type fold, which is a common structural motif in glycosyltransferases that use a UDP-sugar as the donor substrate (Byrne2014Cloning). The tertiary structure forms a three-dimensional shape crucial for its enzymatic activity, with conserved cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds important for its function (Stenfelt2022Glycoproteomic).

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, which affects the protein's activity, stability, and localization. B4GALNT2 has unusual N-glycosylation sites, such as N-X-C, which are crucial for its function and dimerization (Cogez2023NGlycan). The protein forms homodimers, with N-glycans playing a role in its subcellular localization and enzymatic activity (Cogez2023NGlycan).

## Function
The B4GALNT2 gene encodes the enzyme β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-II, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of the Sd a/Cad carbohydrate antigen. This enzyme is involved in the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) in a β1,4-linkage to galactose residues, a process essential for forming the Sd a antigen. The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in the colon, ileum, stomach, and kidney, where it contributes to the regulation of glycan structures that are vital for normal cellular processes and immune recognition (Groux‐Degroote2021B4GALNT2; Dall’Olio2014The).

B4GALNT2 is expressed in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the structure and function of cell surface molecules, impacting tissue development and function. The enzyme exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter possibly resulting from proteolytic cleavage or alternative splicing (Groux‐Degroote2018The; Dall’Olio2014The). The long isoform of the enzyme, characterized by an extended cytoplasmic tail, is critical for Golgi targeting and post-Golgi sorting, suggesting a unique role in intracellular vesicle targeting (Groux‐Degroote2018The). The presence of the Sd a antigen is associated with healthy tissues, while its downregulation is observed in cancerous colonic cells (Groux‐Degroote2021B4GALNT2).

## Clinical Significance
The B4GALNT2 gene is clinically significant in the context of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). In CRC, B4GALNT2 expression is generally downregulated, which is associated with poor prognosis. However, higher expression levels of B4GALNT2 correlate with longer patient survival and a better response to therapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Pucci2021Glycosyltransferase; Pucci2020High). The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation and miRNA, particularly miR-204-5p, which inversely correlates with B4GALNT2 expression (Dall’Olio2021The; Pucci2021Glycosyltransferase).

Mutations in B4GALNT2, especially missense mutations in the C-terminal portion, are linked to the Sd a-negative phenotype, which can affect blood transfusion compatibility due to the production of anti-Sd a antibodies (Stenfelt2022Glycoproteomic). In cancer, forced expression of B4GALNT2 reduces malignancy and stemness in colon cancer cell lines, indicating its role in attenuating cancer progression (Pucci2020High). The gene's expression also influences the composition of the microbiota, which may have implications for immune response and inflammatory diseases (Pucci2021Glycosyltransferase).

## Interactions
The B4GALNT2 protein, encoded by the B4GALNT2 gene, is known to interact with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of the primary interactions is with the HLA-B protein, a product of the human leukocyte antigen class I gene. This interaction has been shown to be crucial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, where the knockdown of B4GALNT2 results in reduced cell proliferation, viability, and migration, alongside increased apoptosis. Overexpression of HLA-B in B4GALNT2-knocked down cell lines can restore these cellular functions, indicating that HLA-B acts as a downstream interaction partner of B4GALNT2 (Yu2021B4GALNT2).

In addition to HLA-B, B4GALNT2 has been identified to interact with other proteins such as CLU, STMN1, CYCS, EIF4A2, AKRIB1, CTNND1, and AXL. Among these, HLA-B shows the highest degree of interaction. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments and mass spectrometry analysis, which were used to elucidate the protein-protein interaction network involving B4GALNT2 (Yu2021B4GALNT2).
