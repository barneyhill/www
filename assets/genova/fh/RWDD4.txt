# RWDD4

## Overview
RWDD4 (RWD domain containing 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its RWD domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. This domain suggests a role in cellular signaling pathways, potentially influencing ubiquitination processes that affect protein degradation and turnover. The RWDD4 protein is active in the cytoplasm and may contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses. While its specific functions in normal physiology are not fully understood, RWDD4 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in bladder and breast cancers, where it is targeted by microRNAs such as miR-506. This interaction affects cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting RWDD4's potential as a therapeutic target (Hou2018MiR‑506; Zhu2020Identification).

## Function
RWDD4 (RWD domain containing 4) is a human gene encoding a protein that plays a role in various cellular processes. The protein contains an RWD domain, which is associated with protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Hou2018MiR‑506). RWDD4 is active in the cytoplasm, where it may participate in ubiquitination processes, influencing protein degradation and turnover. This activity potentially impacts cellular homeostasis and stress responses, although the specific functions of RWDD4 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated (Hou2018MiR‑506).

In the context of cancer research, RWDD4 has been identified as a target of miR-506 in bladder cancer cells. The downregulation of RWDD4 by miR-506 is associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in these cells (Hou2018MiR‑506). While these findings highlight RWDD4's role in cancer cell behavior, its precise functions in normal cellular physiology remain to be clarified. The involvement of RWDD4 in protein-protein interactions and potential ubiquitination processes suggests it may play a broader role in maintaining cellular function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
RWDD4 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression and interactions playing a significant role. In bladder cancer, RWDD4 is targeted by microRNA miR-506, which is downregulated in cancerous tissues. Overexpression of miR-506 leads to the suppression of RWDD4, inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in bladder cancer cells. This suggests that RWDD4 contributes to the aggressive properties of bladder cancer, and miR-506 could serve as a potential therapeutic target (Hou2018MiR‑506).

In breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), RWDD4 is identified as one of the high-frequency mutant genes. Its expression is significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, indicating a potential role in cancer progression. Although direct evidence of RWDD4 mutations in DCIS is lacking, its downregulation aligns with other genes involved in cancer development (Zhu2020Identification).

RWDD4 is also associated with prostate cancer susceptibility, as highlighted in genetic studies focusing on identifying loci linked to increased cancer risk (Bloom2017Mouse). These findings underscore the gene's potential involvement in various cancer types.
