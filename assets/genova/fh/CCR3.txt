# CCR3

## Overview
CCR3, or C-C motif chemokine receptor 3, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune system's response to inflammation and allergic reactions. The CCR3 protein is primarily expressed on eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells, where it plays a critical role in mediating chemotaxis and activation of these immune cells. This receptor binds with high affinity to several chemokines, including eotaxin, RANTES, and MCPs, facilitating the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation. The structural features of CCR3, such as its seven transmembrane regions and conserved motifs, are essential for its function and interaction with chemokines. CCR3 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including asthma, neuroinflammation, and autoimmune diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Heath1997Chemokine; Rege2023CCR3; Ponath1996Molecular).

## Structure
The CCR3 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a structure typical of chemokine receptors. It consists of seven transmembrane regions, an extracellular N-terminal domain, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (Zhu2013Characterization). The primary structure of CCR3 is a sequence of 362 amino acids (Zhu2013Characterization). The secondary structure includes the transmembrane helices and loops, which are common features of GPCRs (Zhu2013Characterization).

A highly conserved DRYLA motif is located in the second intracellular loop adjacent to the third transmembrane domain, which is crucial for G-protein interaction and signaling (Zhu2013Characterization). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation of these helices and loops, although specific details are not provided in the context (Zhu2013Characterization).

CCR3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its function and signaling. The receptor may also form homodimers or heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. Additionally, CCR3 has splice variant isoforms that may differ in function or expression (Pease1998The).

## Function
CCR3, a C-C chemokine receptor, plays a pivotal role in the immune response by mediating the chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells. This receptor is primarily expressed on eosinophils and basophils, where it binds with high affinity to chemokines such as eotaxin, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4. The binding of these chemokines to CCR3 facilitates the migration of these cells to sites of inflammation, particularly in allergic reactions and parasitic infections (Heath1997Chemokine; Uguccioni1997High; Ponath1996Molecular).

In eosinophils, CCR3 is crucial for their recruitment to inflammatory sites, which is significant in conditions like asthma. The receptor's activation leads to intracellular calcium flux and chemotaxis, essential for eosinophil function in immune responses (Heath1997Chemokine). In basophils, CCR3 mediates histamine release and chemotaxis, contributing to the immune response by facilitating the release of inflammatory mediators (Uguccioni1997High).

CCR3 is also expressed on Th2 cells, where it aids in the migration of these cells to sites of allergic inflammation, promoting the production of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5, which are crucial for activating eosinophils and basophils (Sallusto1997Selective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCR3 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In asthma, particularly in the British population, the CCR3 T51C polymorphism is significantly associated with the disease, especially in moderate-to-severe cases. This polymorphism is considered an independent risk factor for asthma, suggesting that mutations in the CCR3 gene contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma by affecting inflammatory cell recruitment and activation in the airways (Fukunaga2001Genetic).

CCR3 is also implicated in age-related cognitive changes and neuroinflammation. Inhibition of CCR3 has been shown to improve cognitive and motor functions in aging mice, indicating its role in T-cell infiltration into the brain and neuroinflammatory processes. This suggests that CCR3 could be a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Rege2023CCR3).

In autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, CCR3, along with its ligand CCL26, is involved in the acute inflammatory response in the central nervous system. Elevated levels of CCR3 and CCL26 correlate with increased inflammation and blood-brain barrier impairment, highlighting their role in disease severity (Shou2019CCL26).

## Interactions
CCR3, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with various chemokines, including CCL8, CCL11 (eotaxin-1), and CCL24. These interactions facilitate the recruitment and activation of immune cells, such as eosinophils, which are crucial in inflammatory and allergic responses. The binding of CCL8 to CCR3 has been shown to induce receptor internalization and cell migration, confirming CCL8 as an agonist of CCR3. The dissociation constant (K_D) for CCL8 binding to CCR3 is 1.2 × 10^-7 M, similar to other CCR3 ligands like CCL11 and CCL24, although CCL8 exhibits slower binding kinetics (Ge2017Functional).

The interaction between CCR3 and CCL11 involves specific structural features, such as sulfotyrosine residues in the N-terminal region of CCR3, which enhance binding affinity through hydrophobic contacts and salt bridges with CCL11. These interactions are crucial for receptor activation and are conserved across other CCR3 ligands (Millard2014Structural). Cholesterol acts as a positive allosteric modulator, enhancing the binding affinity of CCR3 to CCL11 and improving G protein coupling, which is essential for signal transduction (van2021Cholesterol). CCR3 also forms complexes with G proteins, such as Gαi, which are vital for its signaling functions (Shao2022Molecular).
