# MAP2K1

## Overview
MAP2K1, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This kinase plays a critical role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and senescence by phosphorylating and activating the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2. The protein structure of MEK1 includes distinct domains that facilitate its function and regulation, including an N-terminal sequence, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal sequence. MEK1 is activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases, such as Raf, and is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are essential for signal transduction. Mutations in MAP2K1 have been linked to several diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders, due to their impact on the MAPK/ERK pathway (Meloche2000Chromosome; Liu2019How; Roskoski2012MEK12).

## Structure
The MAP2K1 gene encodes the MEK1 protein, a dual-specificity kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The primary structure of MEK1 includes a 60-residue N-terminal sequence, a 300-residue protein kinase domain, and a 30-residue C-terminal sequence (Liu2019How). The N-terminal sequence contains an inhibitory segment, a nuclear export sequence, and a segment that aids in binding ERK substrates (Roskoski2012MEK12). 

The secondary structure of MEK1 features a small N-terminal lobe with a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a conserved α-helix, while the large C-terminal lobe is mainly alpha-helical (Roskoski2012MEK12). The tertiary structure includes a unique N-terminal helix A, which interacts with the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain and is crucial for enzymatic repression (Fischmann2009Crystal). 

MEK1 can form dimers in its core kinase fragments, although the full-length protein is a monomer in solution (Fischmann2009Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine residues S218 and S222, are essential for MEK1 activation, while phosphorylation at S212 decreases its activity (Roskoski2012MEK12). Mutations in MEK1 can lead to constitutively active kinases, contributing to diseases like cancer (Liu2019How).

## Function
MAP2K1, also known as MEK1, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a pivotal role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and senescence. MAP2K1 activates the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues, which is essential for the downstream signaling that influences cell proliferation and differentiation (Meloche2000Chromosome). 

In healthy human cells, MAP2K1 is activated by serine phosphorylation, primarily by Raf isoforms and other kinases, which then allows it to phosphorylate ERK1/2. This activation cascade is integral to the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression, impacting organismal development and homeostasis (Meloche2000Chromosome). MAP2K1 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences various cellular functions by modulating the activity of ERK1/2, thereby affecting processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation of specific cell lineages (Meloche2000Chromosome). The proper functioning of MAP2K1 is essential for maintaining cellular and organismal health, as disruptions in this pathway can lead to developmental abnormalities and diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAP2K1 gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions due to their role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), MAP2K1 mutations occur in a small percentage of cases and are mutually exclusive with other MAPK pathway mutations, suggesting they act as driver mutations. These mutations lead to increased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, contributing to cancer progression (Bu2021Recurrent).

In melanoma, MAP2K1 mutations, particularly in-frame deletions, define a distinct molecular subtype that is independent of BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 mutations. These mutations are resistant to BRAF inhibitors, highlighting their clinical significance in treatment resistance (Williams2020Melanoma).

MAP2K1 mutations are also associated with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), a RASopathy characterized by dysmorphic facial features, intellectual disability, and other systemic abnormalities. These mutations lead to continuous activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, affecting cell proliferation and autophagy (Chen2020Cardiofaciocutaneous).

In Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), MAP2K1 mutations occur in a subset of cases with wild-type BRAF, contributing to ERK pathway activation and disease pathogenesis (Nelson2015MAP2K1; Chakraborty2014Mutually). Additionally, somatic mutations in MAP2K1 are implicated in melorheostosis, a rare bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone growth (Kang2018Somatic).

## Interactions
MAP2K1, also known as MEK1, is a key component of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and participates in several protein-protein interactions. It interacts with SHC1, a docking protein that links activated receptors to downstream signaling proteins. This interaction is regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and is significant in keratinocyte differentiation, as demonstrated by increased binding and phosphorylation of ERK following EGF treatment (Yoon2008Prediction). SHC1 also binds to MAP2K1 in a differentiation-dependent manner, suggesting its role in the signaling network during keratinocyte differentiation (Yoon2008Prediction).

MAP2K1 is involved in the MAPK pathway, where it interacts with RAF kinases, which phosphorylate and activate it. Once activated, MAP2K1 phosphorylates ERK1/2, facilitating signal transduction. It also interacts with scaffold proteins like KSR1, which help assemble signaling complexes, and 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate its activity and localization (Kirouac2012Creating). These interactions highlight MAP2K1's central role in signal integration and its involvement in multiple pathways, as it is enriched in regions of high pathway maps and high betweenness within signaling networks (Kirouac2012Creating).
