# OSBPL7

## Overview
OSBPL7 is a gene that encodes the protein oxysterol binding protein like 7, a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. This family is characterized by its role in lipid metabolism and transport, with OSBPL7 specifically involved in processes such as cholesterol efflux and lipid homeostasis. The protein is categorized as a lipid-binding protein due to its oxysterol-binding domain, which facilitates interactions with sterols and phosphoinositides. OSBPL7 is implicated in various cellular functions, including autophagy and angiogenesis, through its interactions with other proteins like GABARAPL2 and AKT1. The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, being associated with conditions such as breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and eczema, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2023Clinical; Taskinen2024Functional; Wright2021Compounds).

## Structure
OSBPL7 is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, characterized by the presence of an oxysterol-binding domain (ORD) at its carboxy-terminus, which is crucial for its function in lipid metabolism and transport (Wright2021Compounds). The protein structure includes a conserved oxysterol regulatory domain, which is involved in binding sterols and phosphoinositides. Key amino acid residues within the ligand-binding pocket, such as Lys636, Ile641, Val616, and Val618, are essential for binding interactions, as mutations in these residues significantly affect ligand binding (Wright2021Compounds).

OSBPL7 shares structural similarities with other members of the OSBP family, which typically include pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that facilitate membrane association (Jaworski2001A). The gene is part of a larger classification of OSBP family members, divided into groups based on sequence similarities, with OSBPL7 belonging to group A (Jaworski2001A). The protein is composed of 842 amino acids and is located on chromosome 17q21.2 (Jaworski2001A).

The study of OSBPL7's structure through homology modeling and ligand docking has revealed its interaction with compounds that enhance cholesterol efflux, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wright2021Compounds).

## Function
OSBPL7, also known as oxysterol binding protein like 7, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, which plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and transport. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cholesterol efflux and lipid homeostasis. OSBPL7 has been identified as a target for compounds that induce ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, which is crucial for maintaining cellular cholesterol balance. These compounds, such as 5-arylnicotinamides, bind to OSBPL7 and enhance cholesterol efflux by increasing ABCA1 expression in human podocytes (Wright2021Compounds).

In endothelial cells, OSBPL7 is implicated in lipid metabolism and inflammation. It localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and interacts with proteins involved in autophagy, such as GABARAPL2 and LC3B, suggesting a role in autophagosomal processes (Taskinen2024Functional). The protein's activity affects cholesterol trafficking and angiogenesis, potentially through interactions with AKT1, a metabolic regulator (Taskinen2024Functional). OSBPL7's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and influencing endothelial cell function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OSBPL7 gene have been implicated in several health conditions. In the context of breast cancer, particularly among obese postmenopausal women, OSBPL7 is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is associated with pathways related to bile acid metabolism and immunoregulatory interactions, suggesting a potential link between OSBPL7 expression and obesity-related breast cancer risk (hosseinpour2022Bioinformatic; Hosseinpour2023Bioinformatic).

In Alzheimer's disease, OSBPL7 has been identified as a novel susceptibility gene associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ) uptake. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OSBPL7, such as rs11079797, are linked to decreased hippocampal volume and cognitive decline, indicating a role in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments (Kim2023Clinical).

OSBPL7 is also associated with eczema, where it is part of a locus containing common eczema-associated SNPs. This suggests that genetic variations in OSBPL7 may contribute to the susceptibility to eczema, potentially through shared mechanisms in immune function (Grosche2021Rare).

Additionally, OSBPL7 deficiency in podocytes, specialized kidney cells, leads to decreased autophagic flux, increased lipid droplet accumulation, and apoptosis, which could impact kidney function and contribute to kidney diseases (Pressly2022OxysterolBinding).

## Interactions
OSBPL7, also known as ORP7, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with GATE-16, a protein associated with Golgi SNARE function and autophagosome biogenesis. This interaction was confirmed using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, which demonstrated that ORP7 specifically interacts with GATE-16 in live cells. The interaction between ORP7 and GATE-16 negatively regulates the stability of the GS28 protein, a Golgi v-SNARE, through a proteasome-mediated degradation pathway (Zhong2011OSBPrelated).

ORP7 also interacts with R-Ras, a small GTPase involved in cell adhesion and migration, and with GABARAPL2, a protein involved in autophagy. These interactions suggest a role for ORP7 in modulating Golgi apparatus trafficking and potentially influencing lipid metabolism and autophagic processes (Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding).

In endothelial cells, ORP7 has been shown to interact with AKT1, a key metabolic regulator. This interaction is associated with changes in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and angiogenesis, indicating that ORP7 may play a role in cellular signaling pathways related to these processes (Taskinen2024Functional).
