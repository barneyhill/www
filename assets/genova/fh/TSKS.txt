# TSKS

## Overview
The TSKS gene encodes the testis-specific serine kinase substrate protein, which is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a vital role in spermatogenesis. This protein functions as a substrate for testis-specific serine/threonine kinases, particularly TSSK1 and TSSK2, and is involved in phosphorylation processes critical for sperm cell development (Salicioni2020Testis-specific). TSKS is integral to the formation of a kinase/phosphatase complex with the protein phosphatase PPP1CC2, which is essential for mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis and proper localization of proteins during spermatid development (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2). Through its interactions and phosphorylation, TSKS contributes to male fertility by ensuring the maturation and functionality of sperm cells (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2).

## Function
The TSKS (testis-specific serine kinase substrate) protein plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. It acts as a substrate for the testis-specific serine/threonine kinases TSSK1 and TSSK2, which phosphorylate TSKS, suggesting its involvement in phosphorylation processes during spermatogenesis (Salicioni2020Testis-specific). TSKS is primarily active in the testis, where it is involved in cell division and differentiation, contributing to male fertility by ensuring proper sperm maturation and function (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2).

TSKS interacts with the protein phosphatase PPP1CC2 through an RVxF docking motif, forming a kinase/phosphatase complex with TSSK1 in the mouse testis. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis and proper localization of TSKS and TSSK1 in spermatids, which is essential for spermatogenesis (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2). The phosphorylation of TSKS on specific serine residues, such as serine 54 within the PP1 docking motif, likely regulates its interaction with PPP1CC2, influencing the formation of this complex (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2). While the specific molecular function of TSKS in human cells is not directly detailed, its interactions and roles in mouse models provide insights into its potential functions in humans.

## Interactions
The TSKS protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of the mouse testis. TSKS interacts with the testis-specific protein phosphatase PPP1CC2 and the kinase TSSK1, forming a complex that includes both a protein kinase and a protein phosphatase. This interaction is mediated through an RVxF docking motif on the TSKS surface, specifically the sequence KAVSF, which is crucial for the formation of a kinase/phosphatase complex that plays a significant role in spermatogenesis (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2). 

Phosphorylation of TSKS on serine residues, including serine 281 and serine 54, likely inhibits its interaction with PPP1CC2. Experiments have shown that TSKS can interact with PPP1CC2 and TSSK1, with TSKS acting as a mediator for the interaction between PPP1CC2 and TSSK1, allowing all three proteins to interact simultaneously (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2). The N-terminal region of TSKS is required for interaction with TSSK proteins, suggesting close contact when bound, which is important for mitochondrial sheath morphogenesis during spermatogenesis (MacLeod2014PPP1CC2).
