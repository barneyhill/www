# LIMCH1

## Overview
LIMCH1 is a gene that encodes the protein LIM and calponin homology domains 1, which is involved in cytoskeletal organization and cellular motility. The protein is characterized by the presence of a calponin homology (CH) domain, which facilitates actin binding, and a LIM domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. These structural features categorize LIMCH1 as a cytoskeletal-associated protein. LIMCH1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with a muscle-specific isoform, mLIMCH1, produced through alternative splicing. This isoform plays a crucial role in muscle function, particularly in maintaining interfibrillar properties and calcium dynamics. LIMCH1 interacts with several proteins, including non-muscle myosin II and the E3 ligase HUWE1, influencing processes such as cell movement and tumor suppression. Clinically, alterations in LIMCH1 expression have been linked to various cancers and myotonic dystrophy type 1, highlighting its significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhang2019LIMCH1; Penna2023The; Cao2021Loss).

## Structure
LIMCH1 is a protein characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in cytoskeletal organization. The protein contains a calponin homology (CH) domain at the N-terminus, which is known for its role in actin binding. This domain is characterized by an α-helical fold, crucial for the stability and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Penna2023The; Yin2020Structural). LIMCH1 also features several coiled-coil domains throughout its middle region, which are typically involved in protein oligomerization. At the C-terminal region, the protein contains a LIM domain, a zinc-binding motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Penna2023The).

In skeletal muscle, LIMCH1 undergoes alternative splicing to produce a muscle-specific isoform, mLIMCH1, which includes six additional exons. These exons introduce 454 in-frame amino acids predicted to be disordered, a common feature of alternatively spliced protein regions (Penna2023The). The ubiquitous isoform, uLIMCH1, lacks these additional exons and is expressed in various tissues. The inclusion of these exons in mLIMCH1 is regulated by the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of proteins (Penna2023The). The protein's activity may also be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Zhang2021Phosphorylated).

## Function
LIMCH1 is a protein that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It contains LIM and calponin homology domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and actin binding, respectively. In healthy human cells, LIMCH1 is involved in regulating non-muscle myosin II (NM-II) activity, which is crucial for cell movement and the formation of actin stress fibers. This regulation helps maintain the structural integrity and proper functioning of cells by organizing actin filaments (Cao2021Loss).

LIMCH1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, where it undergoes alternative splicing to produce a muscle-specific isoform, mLIMCH1. This isoform is essential for normal muscle function, particularly in maintaining interfibrillar properties intrinsic to muscle fibers. mLIMCH1 localizes predominantly to the sarcolemma in muscle myofibers, which is necessary for proper calcium handling and muscle contraction (Penna2023The).

In the context of skeletal muscle, the absence of mLIMCH1 leads to altered localization patterns and reduced muscle strength, indicating its importance in muscle function and calcium dynamics (Penna2023The). These roles highlight LIMCH1's critical involvement in maintaining cell shape and facilitating cellular movement.

## Clinical Significance
LIMCH1 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LIMCH1 expression is frequently down-regulated, which is associated with poor prognosis and serves as an independent prognostic predictor alongside tumor stages (Cao2021Loss). The gene's down-regulation in lung cancer is linked to destabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53, contributing to tumor progression (Zhang2019LIMCH1).

In cervical cancer, LIMCH1 is part of a prognostic signature where its upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics (Halle2021A). Similarly, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), low LIMCH1 expression correlates with poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Terrematte2022A).

LIMCH1 is also involved in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), where its mis-splicing leads to muscle weakness due to the loss of the muscle-specific isoform, mLIMCH1 (Penna2023The). This mis-splicing is linked to impaired calcium handling in muscle tissues, contributing to the disease's pathology.

## Interactions
LIMCH1 (LIM and calponin homology domains 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with HUWE1, an E3 ligase known for regulating the ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is crucial for maintaining p53 stability, as LIMCH1 overexpression reduces p53 ubiquitination, thereby protecting it from degradation. Conversely, LIMCH1 knockdown increases p53 ubiquitination, indicating its role in stabilizing p53 and suppressing lung cancer cell growth (Zhang2019LIMCH1).

LIMCH1 also binds directly to non-muscle myosin II (NM-II), regulating its activity and influencing cell movement. This interaction is significant in the context of actin stress fiber assembly and cell motility, as LIMCH1 depletion reduces actin stress fibers and increases cell migration (Cao2021Loss).

In cervical cancer, LIMCH1 is part of a prognostic signature and is associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in the assembly of actin stress fibers and stabilizes focal adhesions through interaction with non-muscle myosin II, suggesting a role in cell migration and adhesion dynamics (Halle2021A).
