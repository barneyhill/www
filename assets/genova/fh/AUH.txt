# AUH

## Overview
The AUH gene encodes the AU RNA binding methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, a bifunctional protein that plays a significant role in both RNA metabolism and leucine catabolism. This protein is categorized as an enoyl-CoA hydratase and is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to fatty acid metabolism and energy production. It functions as an AU-specific RNA-binding protein, interacting with AU-rich elements in mRNA to regulate stability and degradation, thereby influencing gene expression related to immune response and cell proliferation. Additionally, the protein's enzymatic activity is crucial in the leucine degradation pathway, preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Mutations in the AUH gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, underscoring its essential role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Ly2003Mutations; Brennan1999Characterisation; Mack2006Biochemical).

## Structure
The AUH protein, encoded by the AUH gene, is a bifunctional enzyme involved in RNA binding and leucine catabolism. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of 265 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 28.8 kDa for each subunit (Ly2003Mutations). The protein shows significant homology to both long- and short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratases, with a conserved nine amino-acid motif that is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Brennan1999Characterisation). 

The secondary structure of AUH includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a hydratase fold that is essential for its function. The tertiary structure is characterized by this hydratase fold, which is important for its enzymatic activity (Brennan1999Characterisation). AUH can form homotetramers, indicating a quaternary structure, with the entire complex having a molecular mass of 110 kDa (Ly2003Mutations).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, suggesting a role in linking mRNA decay to metabolic processes (Brennan1999Characterisation).

## Function
The AUH gene encodes a bifunctional protein that plays a critical role in both RNA metabolism and leucine catabolism in healthy human cells. The protein functions as an AU-specific RNA-binding protein, interacting with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain mRNAs. This interaction is important for regulating mRNA stability and degradation, influencing gene expression related to immune response and cell proliferation (Brennan1999Characterisation; Nakagawa1995AUH).

In addition to its role in RNA binding, the AUH protein exhibits enoyl-CoA hydratase activity, specifically functioning as 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase in the leucine degradation pathway. This enzymatic activity is crucial for converting 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites and maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Ly2003Mutations; Mack2006Biochemical). The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to fatty acid metabolism and energy production (Brennan1999Characterisation; Mack2006Biochemical).

Mutations in the AUH gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I (MGA1), highlighting its essential role in normal cellular and metabolic functions (Ly2003Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AUH gene are associated with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I (MGCA1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition results from a deficiency in the enzyme 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, which is crucial for leucine degradation. The deficiency leads to the accumulation of 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid in the urine (Nardecchia20223Methylglutaconic; IJlst20023Methylglutaconic). Clinical manifestations of MGCA1 vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe neurological impairments, including developmental delays, speech retardation, and encephalopathy with basal ganglia involvement (Nardecchia20223Methylglutaconic; Wortmann20103Methylglutaconic).

Specific mutations identified in the AUH gene include nonsense mutations, splice-site mutations, and deletions, which often result in a complete loss of enzyme function (Ly2003Mutations; MercimekMahmutoglu2011Phenotypic). The disorder can present in childhood with nonspecific symptoms or remain asymptomatic until adulthood, when it may manifest as progressive leukoencephalopathy (Wortmann20103Methylglutaconic). Treatment strategies, such as dietary management with leucine restriction and carnitine supplementation, have shown some effectiveness in managing symptoms (Tavasoli2017Early). The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the neurological symptoms are not fully understood, but oxidative stress is suggested as a contributing factor (MercimekMahmutoglu2011Phenotypic).
