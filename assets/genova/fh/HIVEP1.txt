# HIVEP1

## Overview
HIVEP1, also known as Schnurri-1 or ZAS1, is a gene that encodes the HIVEP zinc finger 1 protein, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind specific DNA sequences and modulate gene expression. HIVEP zinc finger 1 plays a critical role in the negative regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a key pathway in controlling inflammation and immune responses (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1; Allen2002The). By interacting with components of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the protein helps maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammatory responses (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and apoptosis, underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions (Denisenko2019Transcriptionally).

## Function
HIVEP1, also known as Schnurri-1 or ZAS1, is a transcription factor that acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling systemic inflammation. In healthy human cells, HIVEP1 modulates NF-κB activity by interacting with components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, such as TRAF6 and MyD88, thereby inhibiting the expression of NF-κB responsive genes like TNF and TNFAIP3 (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1). This regulation helps maintain immune homeostasis and prevents excessive inflammatory responses, which is particularly important during bacterial infections and conditions like sepsis (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1).

HIVEP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs, including κB motifs, to regulate gene expression (Allen2002The). Its expression is upregulated in response to bacterial stimuli, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1). The protein's activity in the nucleus influences various cellular processes, including immune response modulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis, contributing to the organism's overall immune function and development (Denisenko2019Transcriptionally).

## Clinical Significance
HIVEP1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in gene regulation and cellular signaling. Genetic studies have identified the HIVEP1 locus as a susceptibility factor for venous thrombosis (VT), with the rs169713-C allele associated with an increased risk of VT, highlighting the gene's involvement in inflammation processes linked to thrombosis (Morange2013Current). In the context of breast cancer, HIVEP1 has shown a marginal nominal significant association with the APOBEC mutation signature, suggesting a potential role in viral defense mechanisms and cancer development (Wang2019Germline).

A novel HIVEP1-ALK fusion has been reported in a case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where the patient responded well to alectinib, an ALK inhibitor. This finding underscores the importance of genetic testing for identifying rare oncogenic fusions and tailoring treatment strategies (Gu2022Novel). Additionally, HIVEP1 has been mentioned as a candidate gene in the context of de novo inheritance in developmental delay and intellectual disability cases, suggesting its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders (Eldomery2017Lessons). These associations indicate that alterations in HIVEP1 can contribute to a range of pathological conditions.

## Interactions
HIVEP1, also known as Schnurri-1, is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with specific DNA sequences. It acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB activity, particularly in the context of Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. HIVEP1 binds to the promoter regions of NF-κB responsive genes such as TNF and TNFAIP3, competing with NF-κB for these binding sites and thereby inhibiting NF-κB activity (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1). This interaction is crucial for its role in modulating proinflammatory responses in monocytes and macrophages when exposed to bacterial agonists (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1).

HIVEP1 does not appear to affect the expression of upstream signaling proteins like MyD88 or TRAF6, indicating that it functions downstream in the signaling cascade (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1). The protein's ability to bind to NF-κB binding DNA motifs, particularly the κB motif, is essential for its regulatory function. This binding has been demonstrated in various mammalian and viral promoters, including the MHC class I gene enhancer sequence (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1). The study of HIVEP1's interactions with DNA and its regulatory role in inflammation and sepsis has been explored using various experimental methods, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (Matsumoto2021HIVEP1).
