# CRYZ

## Overview
The CRYZ gene encodes the protein zeta-crystallin, which is categorized as an NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase. This enzyme is integral to cellular redox homeostasis, primarily by reducing quinones to hydroquinones, thereby mitigating oxidative stress within cells (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). Beyond its enzymatic functions, zeta-crystallin is involved in the stabilization of mRNA, particularly those encoding enzymes critical for glutamine metabolism, such as glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, which is essential during metabolic acidosis (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). The protein also interacts with antiapoptotic proteins, contributing to cellular resistance to apoptosis, and exhibits DNA-binding capabilities, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). The multifaceted roles of CRYZ, including its involvement in cancer cell metabolism and survival, underscore its clinical significance, particularly in the context of cancer progression and chemoresistance (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:; Lulli2024Targeting).

## Function
The CRYZ gene encodes the zeta-crystallin protein, which functions primarily as an NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in cellular redox homeostasis by reducing quinones to hydroquinones, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). In healthy human cells, CRYZ is involved in stabilizing mRNA, particularly those encoding enzymes like glutaminase (GLS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which are essential for glutamine metabolism. This stabilization is vital during metabolic acidosis, as it prevents mRNA degradation and enhances enzyme expression, facilitating efficient glutamine metabolism and pH balance (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:).

CRYZ also interacts with antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, contributing to cellular resistance to apoptosis (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). Although its enzymatic role in healthy cells is not fully understood, CRYZ is hypothesized to help maintain cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage, potentially by binding to NADPH and protecting against lipid peroxidation products (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it regulates RNA turnover, although its potential nuclear functions remain to be fully explored (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CRYZ gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A specific mutation in the CRYZ gene, resulting in a truncated protein, has been associated with autosomal-dominant cataracts in guinea pigs, indicating its potential role in cataractogenesis (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). In the context of cancer, CRYZ is overexpressed in various cancer types, including lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell lymphoma, testicular germ cell tumor, thymoma, and glioblastoma multiforme. This overexpression is correlated with a worse prognosis in astrocytoma, suggesting that CRYZ may contribute to cancer progression by supporting cancer cell survival and metabolism (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:).

CRYZ is implicated in cancer cell metabolism, particularly in glutaminolysis, by stabilizing mRNAs of enzymes like GLS and GDH, which are crucial for glutamine metabolism. This function may be exploited by cancer cells to adapt to the acidic tumor microenvironment and resist oxidative stress and apoptosis (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). The protein's role in stabilizing mRNA for anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 further supports its involvement in cancer cell survival (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:).

## Interactions
CRYZ, also known as zeta-crystallin, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is known for its DNA-binding capabilities, initially identified as a bovine DNA-binding protein. CRYZ can bind to single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and double-stranded Z-DNA, and to a lesser extent, double-stranded B-DNA. It has been shown to increase the transcription rate of certain genes in cell-free experiments, suggesting a role as a transcriptional enhancer, although in vivo evidence is lacking (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:).

CRYZ also functions as an mRNA-binding protein, stabilizing rat glutaminase (GLS) mRNA in response to cellular acidosis. It interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, contributing to leukemia cell resistance to apoptosis (Lulli2019Zetacrystallin:). The protein's interaction with Bcl-2 mRNA is significant in cancer, as it enhances the stability of this anti-apoptotic mRNA, potentially contributing to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer (Lulli2024Targeting).

CRYZ's enzymatic activity is related to NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase (QOR), and its RNA-binding properties are influenced by the presence of NADPH, which competes with RNA for binding to CRYZ (Porté2009MDR). Aspirin has been shown to impair CRYZ's binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNAs, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment (Lulli2024Targeting).
