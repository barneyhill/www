# PLA2R1

## Overview
The PLA2R1 gene encodes the phospholipase A2 receptor 1, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. This receptor is primarily located on the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including inflammation regulation, cellular senescence, and immune response. The protein's structure is characterized by an ectodomain comprising a cysteine-rich domain, a fibronectin type II domain, and multiple C-type lectin-like domains, which are essential for its function and interactions with other proteins. PLA2R1 is involved in binding secreted phospholipases A2, leading to their internalization and degradation, thereby modulating inflammatory responses. It also interacts with integrins and other co-receptors, potentially mediating anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects. Clinically, alterations in PLA2R1 expression and mutations are associated with diseases such as idiopathic membranous nephropathy and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Sukocheva2019Current; Khalid2020Mutational; Fresquet2017PLA2R).

## Structure
The human phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein characterized by a complex molecular structure. It includes an ectodomain with a cysteine-rich domain (CysR), a fibronectin type II domain (FNII), and eight C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) (Yu2019Crystal). The CTLDs, particularly the CTLD7 domain, adopt a typical fold consisting of two anti-parallel β-sheets flanked by two α-helices, with a short α-helix in the loop region (Yu2019Crystal). This domain is stabilized by four conserved cysteine residues forming two disulfide bonds, crucial for maintaining its conformation (Yu2019Crystal).

The CTLD7 domain also features two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, with glycosylation observed at N1132, which may influence its function and interactions (Yu2019Crystal). The CTLDs are involved in receptor binding, immunity, and angiogenesis, with the CTLD7 domain playing a role in antibody recognition in autoimmune conditions such as idiopathic membranous nephropathy (Yu2019Crystal). The structural details of these domains are essential for understanding the receptor's role in disease and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Function
PLA2R1 (phospholipase A2 receptor 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily located on the plasma membrane and is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. PLA2R1 plays a significant role in regulating inflammation and cellular senescence. It binds secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s), leading to their internalization and degradation, which helps control inflammation by inhibiting their enzymatic function (Sukocheva2019Current; Jaber2020Generation).

In normal cells, PLA2R1 is implicated in the regulation of replicative senescence through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. This involves the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which generates ROS that contribute to cell cycle arrest and senescence (Sukocheva2019Current). The receptor's structure includes domains crucial for its function, such as a cysteine-rich domain, fibronectin-like type II domain, and C-type lectin-like domains, which are important for cell signaling related to apoptosis and proliferation (Sukocheva2019Current).

PLA2R1 also interacts with integrins and other co-receptors, potentially mediating anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory responses, including apoptosis and inhibition of cell transformation (Sukocheva2019Current). Its expression in healthy cells suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Sukocheva2019Current).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLA2R1 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), an autoimmune kidney disorder. In IMN, mutations in PLA2R1, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are linked to the production of autoantibodies against the receptor, contributing to disease pathogenesis. High-risk SNPs such as rs3749117 and rs35771982 have been identified as causing protein level changes that affect the receptor's function, potentially leading to nephropathy (Khalid2020Mutational).

In cancer, PLA2R1 is implicated as a tumor suppressor, with its expression levels altered in various cancer types. Downregulation of PLA2R1 is observed in leukemic cells, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, ductal breast carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. Conversely, increased expression is noted in prostate cancer cell lines and ovarian carcinoma effusions, indicating a complex role in tumorigenesis (Sukocheva2019Current). Epigenetic regulation, such as promoter hypermethylation, leads to PLA2R1 downregulation in several cancers, including leukemia and mammary cancer, and can be reversed with demethylating agents (Sukocheva2019Current).

PLA2R1 is also involved in inflammatory conditions, with increased expression linked to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where it correlates with early cell senescence (Sukocheva2019Current).

## Interactions
PLA2R1 (phospholipase A2 receptor 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In human podocytes, PLA2R1 specifically binds to the annexin A2-S100A10 complex, with the interaction facilitated by the S100A10 component. This binding is calcium-dependent and pH-sensitive, suggesting a role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and tight junction assembly, which are important in proteinuric membranous nephropathy (Fresquet2017PLA2R).

PLA2R1 also interacts with secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) isoenzymes, which can activate various signaling pathways, including the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB pathways. These interactions can lead to diverse cellular outcomes such as enhanced survival, migration, or apoptosis, depending on the context (Sukocheva2019Current).

The receptor's structure includes domains that are crucial for its interactions, such as the fibronectin-like type II (FNII) domain and C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs), which are important for binding to collagen and mediating migration. These domains also interact with integrin β1, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Takahashi2015C‐type).

PLA2R1's interaction with the dok2 adaptor protein through its cytoplasmic NPYY motif suggests a role in signal transduction, potentially involving pathways like JAK2 (Fresquet2017PLA2R).
