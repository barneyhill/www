# PREPL

## Overview
The PREPL gene encodes the prolyl endopeptidase-like protein, a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family, which is characterized by its structural similarity to oligopeptidase B but notably lacks typical peptidase activity (Szeltner2005The; Boonen2011PREPL). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the trans-Golgi network morphology and protein sorting, primarily through its interaction with the AP-1 complex (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi). PREPL is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant levels in the brain, suggesting its importance in neurological functions (Morawski2013Cellular). Clinically, mutations or deletions in the PREPL gene are associated with conditions such as hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome and congenital myasthenic syndrome, highlighting its critical role in human health (Jaeken2006Deletion; Régal2014PREPL).

## Structure
The PREPL protein is a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family and exhibits structural similarities to oligopeptidase B. It consists of a catalytic triad of Ser, Asp, and His, which is conserved among its homologs, although PREPL lacks typical peptidase activity (Szeltner2005The; Boonen2011PREPL). The protein is predicted to have an amino-terminal propeller domain and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain, with the catalytic triad residues located at topologically equivalent positions to those in prolyl oligopeptidase and oligopeptidase B (Boonen2011PREPL). 

PREPL's secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, similar to those found in oligopeptidase B, but it lacks certain structural elements like the short two-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and two long alpha helices (Szeltner2005The). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a higher conformational stability, possibly due to dimerization (Szeltner2005The). 

PREPL is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is associated with cytoskeletal proteins, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions rather than catalytic activity (Morawski2013Cellular; Boonen2011PREPL). The protein's physiological function may involve non-catalytic roles, potentially related to the cytoskeleton and secretory pathways (Morawski2013Cellular).

## Function
The PREPL gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) morphology and sorting through its interaction with the AP-1 complex subunit μ1A. PREPL is involved in the redistribution of the AP-1 complex from membranes into the cytoplasm, which is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and vesicle formation (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi). In healthy human cells, PREPL is expressed at high levels in the brain and to a lesser extent in the kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, indicating its importance in these tissues (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi).

PREPL influences the binding of the AP-1 complex to membranes, with high PREPL expression reducing AP-1 membrane binding, thus facilitating the recycling of AP-1 complexes. This process is crucial for the correct formation and recycling of transport vesicles, which are vital for protein sorting and cellular trafficking (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi). The protein is also associated with the Golgi membranes and is involved in synaptic function, possibly regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Régal2018PREPL). The absence of PREPL leads to significant cellular alterations, such as an expanded TGN, which affects the AP-1 complex's ability to redistribute, highlighting its essential role in cellular processes (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the PREPL gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome (HCS) and congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). HCS is characterized by symptoms such as generalized hypotonia, cystinuria, growth hormone deficiency, and minor facial dysmorphism. The syndrome results from deletions involving both the PREPL and SLC3A1 genes, which disrupt their coding sequences (Jaeken2006Deletion; Régal2014PREPL). 

PREPL deficiency can also lead to a novel form of CMS, which may occur with or without cystinuria. This condition is marked by severe neonatal hypotonia, muscle weakness, ptosis, and feeding difficulties. Patients with isolated PREPL deficiency often exhibit myasthenic symptoms that may respond to pyridostigmine treatment (Shchagina2020A; Régal2014PREPL). 

In some cases, PREPL mutations are linked to additional phenotypic features, such as intellectual disability, short stature, and reproductive anomalies, including absence of ovaries and hypoplasia of the uterus (Yang2020PREPL). The genetic basis of these conditions often involves compound heterozygous mutations or homozygous deletions, which lead to loss of function in the PREPL gene (Shchagina2020A).

## Interactions
PREPL (prolyl endopeptidase-like) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the AP-1 complex, specifically binding to the m1A adaptin N-terminal domain, which is part of the AP-1 complex involved in clathrin-coated transport vesicle formation and protein sorting between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. This interaction is specific to the m1A domain and does not occur with m2, suggesting a selective binding mechanism (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi). 

PREPL also affects the distribution and membrane binding of the AP-1 complex. Overexpression of PREPL leads to a reduction in AP-1's membrane binding, particularly at the trans-Golgi network, indicating that PREPL regulates AP-1 membrane-cytoplasm recycling (Radhakrishnan2013TransGolgi). 

Additionally, PREPL can bind to α-synuclein (α-Syn) with an affinity constant of about 5.7 µM, accelerating α-Syn oligomerization and aggregation. This interaction is influenced by PREPL's enzymatic activity, as the effect is reduced by the serine peptidase inhibitor PMSF (Santos2020Prolyl). These interactions highlight PREPL's role in cellular sorting mechanisms and protein aggregation processes.
