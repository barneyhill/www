# VAMP3

## Overview
VAMP3, also known as cellubrevin, is a gene that encodes the vesicle-associated membrane protein 3, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family. This v-SNARE protein is integral to intracellular membrane fusion processes, particularly in the recycling of endosomal transport vesicles and the secretion of cellular components. VAMP3 is predominantly localized in recycling endosomes and is involved in the trafficking of proteins such as transferrin receptors and β1 integrin, which are essential for cellular adhesion and migration (Luftman2009Silencing; Hu2007Membrane). The protein's interactions with other SNAREs, such as syntaxin and SNAP-25, facilitate the fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane, a critical step in exocytosis and endocytosis (Hu2007Membrane). VAMP3's role extends to autophagy, where it aids in the maturation of autophagic vacuoles and the formation of amphisomes (Fader2009TIVAMPVAMP7). Despite its significant functions, VAMP3 knockout studies suggest redundancy in its role, as other v-SNARE proteins may compensate for its absence (Hu2007Membrane).

## Structure
VAMP3, also known as cellubrevin, is a member of the SNARE protein family involved in vesicular transport. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a single polypeptide chain. The secondary structure of VAMP3 includes alpha-helices, which are crucial for its function in forming coiled-coil structures. These alpha-helices are part of the SNARE motif, a domain of 60-70 amino acids that facilitates the formation of trans-SNARE complexes necessary for membrane fusion (Feldmann2011Transport; Hu2007Membrane).

The tertiary structure of VAMP3 allows it to interact with other SNARE proteins, forming a complex that drives membrane fusion. This interaction is essential for its role in various cellular processes, such as recycling of transferrin receptors and secretion of α-granules in platelets (Hu2007Membrane). VAMP3 does not typically form quaternary structures independently but participates in multimeric SNARE complexes, interacting with plasma membrane t-SNAREs like syntaxin1, syntaxin4, SNAP-23, and SNAP-25 (Hu2007Membrane).

VAMP3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Hu2007Membrane).

## Function
VAMP3, also known as cellubrevin, is a v-SNARE protein involved in various intracellular membrane fusion processes. It is primarily located in recycling endosomes and endosome-derived transport vesicles, where it plays a crucial role in the recycling of transferrin receptors and the secretion of α-granules in platelets (Hu2007Membrane). VAMP3 is essential for the trafficking of β1 integrin to the plasma membrane, which is necessary for cell migration and adhesion, particularly to laminin (Luftman2009Silencing).

In the context of autophagy, VAMP3 is required for the fusion between multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and autophagosomes, facilitating the maturation of autophagic vacuoles (Fader2009TIVAMPVAMP7). It is also involved in the formation of amphisomes, which are crucial for autophagosome maturation (Fader2009TIVAMPVAMP7). VAMP3 interacts with plasma membrane t-SNAREs such as syntaxin1/SNAP-25 and syntaxin4/SNAP-25, driving the fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane (Hu2007Membrane).

VAMP3's function is modulated by interactions with proteins like WDFY2, which affects its role in vesicle recycling and secretion (Sneeggen2019WDFY2). Despite its involvement in these processes, VAMP3 knockout mice do not exhibit an obvious phenotype, suggesting possible compensation by other v-SNARE proteins (Hu2007Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the VAMP3 gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer. VAMP3 is involved in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are crucial for extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion. Studies have shown that VAMP3, along with other SNARE proteins like syntaxin-13 and SNAP23, is essential for the trafficking and secretion of MMPs such as MMP2 and MMP9. Disruption of VAMP3 function can impair MMP secretion, potentially affecting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Kean2009VAMP3).

In cancer, the loss of regulatory proteins like WDFY2, which interacts with VAMP3, can lead to increased VAMP3-dependent secretion of MT1-MMP, enhancing extracellular matrix degradation and cell invasion. This suggests that VAMP3 plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in metastatic processes (Sneeggen2019WDFY2).

Despite its involvement in these processes, studies in VAMP3-deficient mice indicate that the absence of VAMP3 does not result in significant metabolic or physiological alterations, suggesting that its role may be more critical in specific pathological contexts rather than in general physiological processes (Yang2001VAMP3).

## Interactions
VAMP3, also known as cellubrevin, is a v-SNARE protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its role in vesicular transport. It forms fusogenic pairings with plasma membrane t-SNAREs such as syntaxin1/SNAP-25, syntaxin1/SNAP-23, and syntaxin4/SNAP-25, but not with syntaxin4/SNAP-23, indicating specificity in its interactions (Hu2007Membrane). VAMP3 interacts with PI4K2A, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which is essential for its proper sorting and localization to endosomal compartments. This interaction affects the subcellular distribution of PI4K2A and is crucial for the retrograde transport of PI4K2A from endosomes to the Golgi (Jović2014Endosomal).

VAMP3 also interacts with WDFY2, a protein involved in endosomal sorting. This interaction is significant for the regulation of VAMP3's localization and function, particularly in vesicle recycling and secretion (Sneeggen2019WDFY2). Additionally, VAMP3 is implicated in the trafficking of Shiga toxin, where it interacts with syntaxin-16, syntaxin-6, and Vti1a, facilitating retrograde trafficking between early/recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (Renard2015Shiga). These interactions highlight VAMP3's role in various cellular processes, including membrane fusion, endocytosis, and exocytosis.
