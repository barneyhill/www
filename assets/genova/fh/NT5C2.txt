# NT5C2

## Overview
The NT5C2 gene encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (cN-II), which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in purine metabolism by dephosphorylating purine nucleoside monophosphates, thereby maintaining cellular nucleotide balance and homeostasis (Jordheim2018Expanding; Pesi2021Cytosolic). Structurally, cN-II is a homotetramer with a well-characterized active site, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and is allosterically regulated by ATP and other effectors (Chamani2022A). Functionally, it is involved in energy regulation, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and protein synthesis through interactions with adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Duarte2019The; Kulkarni2011Suppression). Clinically, mutations in NT5C2 are associated with chemotherapy resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and are implicated in other conditions such as hereditary spastic paraplegia and type 2 diabetes (Elsaid2017NT5C2; Chen2020NT5C2; Dieck2019Genetics).

## Structure
The NT5C2 gene encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II, which is a homotetramer composed of four identical subunits (Jordheim2018Expanding). This enzyme is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily and contains three conserved motifs that form its active site, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Chamani2022A). These motifs include specific amino acids such as Asp52, Asp54, Thr56, Leu57, Thr249, Lys292, Asp351, and Asp356, which are essential for binding to the phosphate moiety of the substrate and the enzyme's catalytic mechanism (Chamani2022A).

The enzyme's structure is stabilized by 19 hydrogen bonds and four salt bridges at the dimer interface, contributing to its quaternary structure (Chamani2022A). The NT5C2 protein is allosterically activated by effectors like ATP, with two regulatory sites identified, and its C-terminal region contains negatively charged residues that interact with positively charged regions, influencing its activation and regulation (Chamani2022A). The crystal structure of the enzyme has been known since 2007, providing insights into its molecular configuration (Jordheim2018Expanding). The enzyme's role in nucleotide metabolism is significant, particularly in the context of chemotherapy resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Chamani2022A).

## Function
The NT5C2 gene encodes the enzyme cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II), which plays a crucial role in purine metabolism by dephosphorylating purine nucleoside monophosphates such as IMP, GMP, and AMP into their corresponding nucleosides and inorganic phosphate. This activity is essential for maintaining cellular nucleotide balance and homeostasis (Jordheim2018Expanding; Pesi2021Cytosolic). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is sensitive to changes in adenylate energy charge and oxidative stress, with its activity increasing in the presence of ATP and other phosphorylated compounds (Pesi2021Cytosolic).

NT5C2 is involved in regulating energy-consuming tasks and influences cell proliferation, motility, and protein synthesis by modulating the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Duarte2019The; Kulkarni2011Suppression). In skeletal muscle, NT5C2 helps maintain the balance of AMP and ATP, which is crucial for energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility (Kulkarni2011Suppression). The enzyme's activity also affects the phosphorylation of AMPK and ribosomal protein S6, which are involved in energy metabolism and protein translation, respectively (Duarte2019The). NT5C2's role in these processes is significant for maintaining normal cellular function and energy regulation in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NT5C2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), NT5C2 mutations contribute to chemotherapy resistance, particularly against thiopurine drugs like 6-mercaptopurine. These mutations, often gain-of-function, increase nucleotidase activity, leading to drug inactivation and poor treatment outcomes. NT5C2 mutations are frequently acquired at relapse, with a higher prevalence in T-ALL compared to B-precursor ALL (Tzoneva2013Activating; Dieck2019Genetics).

In hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), NT5C2 mutations are linked to neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and developmental delays. Specific mutations, such as splice site mutations, lead to protein instability and loss of function, contributing to the disease phenotype (Darvish2017Whole; Elsaid2017NT5C2).

NT5C2 is also implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D), where its expression is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, suggesting a role in T2D pathogenesis (Chen2020NT5C2). Additionally, genetic variants in the NT5C2 locus have been linked to blood pressure regulation and body mass index, although the direct functional involvement remains unclear (Jordheim2018Expanding).

## Interactions
NT5C2, a cytosolic enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. It forms a protein complex with ZNF804A at synapses in cortical neurons, which is significant for synaptic function and is implicated in schizophrenia risk. This interaction is bidirectional, as knockdown of either protein affects the synaptic localization of the other, indicating a mutual dependency for synaptic targeting (Aabdien2021Schizophrenia).

NT5C2 also interacts with the ice protease-activating factor (IPAF), a protein involved in innate immunity and inflammation. This interaction is sensitive to oxidative stress and changes in energy charge, which can alter NT5C2's conformation and its ability to bind other proteins (Pesi2021Cytosolic).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, NT5C2 interacts with DNMT1 and the insulin receptor, forming a regulatory network that influences insulin signaling. Overexpression of NT5C2 inhibits DNMT1 and promotes insulin receptor expression, suggesting a complex interplay that affects cellular nucleotide levels and insulin signaling pathways (Chen2020NT5C2). These interactions highlight NT5C2's role in various cellular processes and its potential impact on disease states.
