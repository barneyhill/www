# TSLP

## Overview
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a gene that encodes a cytokine of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses. The TSLP protein is characterized by a four α-helical bundle structure and is primarily expressed by epithelial cells at barrier surfaces such as the skin, lungs, and gut. It is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis and promoting a TH2-type immune response, which is crucial for the development of regulatory T cells and the prevention of autoimmune responses (Hanabuchi2012TSLP; Ziegler2010Sensing). TSLP interacts with a receptor complex comprising the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Rα), forming a ternary complex essential for intracellular signaling (Verstraete2017Structure). The cytokine is implicated in various allergic and inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, and exhibits both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles in cancer, underscoring its multifaceted role in human health and disease (Marković2020Modulation; Smolinska2023Thymic).

## Structure
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine characterized by a four α-helical bundle structure, stabilized by three disulfide bridges: Cys34-Cys110, Cys69-Cys75, and Cys90-Cys137 (Verstraete2017Structure). The helices, designated αA to αD, are connected by a BC loop and two longer AB and CD loop regions, forming an open helical bundle core with an internal void volume (Verstraete2017Structure; Smolinska2023Thymic). A fully buried structural water molecule, coordinated by Trp148, Thr102, and Thr83, is integral to the protein's fold (Verstraete2017Structure).

TSLP interacts with its receptor complex, which includes the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Rα), forming a T-shaped extracellular assembly (Smolinska2023Thymic). The interaction involves specific regions, such as the C-terminal part of helix αD and the AB loop, which facilitate receptor binding and recruitment of IL-7Rα (Smolinska2023Thymic). The protein's structure is further characterized by a kinked αA helix with a p-helical turn, similar to IL-7, despite low sequence identity (Verstraete2017Structure).

Post-translational modifications of TSLP include truncation by proprotein convertases, generating a heterodimeric form with enhanced biological activity (Poposki2017Proprotein). This modification is crucial for its function in inflammatory responses.

## Function
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in regulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed by epithelial cells at barrier surfaces, such as the skin, lungs, and gut, and is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis. TSLP activates myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), leading to the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules, which are crucial for the development of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the thymus (Hanabuchi2012TSLP; Ziegler2010Sensing).

TSLP influences the differentiation of Treg cells into functionally distinct subsets, characterized by varying levels of cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-10. This differentiation is essential for immune tolerance and the prevention of autoimmune responses (Hanabuchi2012TSLP). TSLP also promotes a TH2-type immune response by activating dendritic cells to produce chemokines like CCL17 and CCL22, which recruit immune cells and facilitate the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into TH2 cells (Ziegler2010Sensing).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, TSLP has antimicrobial properties, particularly the short form (sfTSLP), which is constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and exhibits potent activity against various bacterial and fungal species (Bjerkan2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is implicated in various allergic and inflammatory diseases due to alterations in its expression and genetic polymorphisms. In asthma, TSLP is upregulated in the airways, contributing to disease severity and airway inflammation, particularly in response to allergens like house dust mites (Varricchi2018Thymic; Smolinska2023Thymic). Genetic polymorphisms, such as SNPs rs2289276 and rs2289278, are associated with increased TSLP production and a higher incidence of asthma and atopic diseases (Brister2024Multifactorial; Smolinska2023Thymic).

In atopic dermatitis (AD), TSLP is highly expressed in lesional skin, correlating with disease severity and promoting type 2 inflammatory responses (Varricchi2018Thymic; Smolinska2023Thymic). TSLP polymorphisms, such as rs1898671, are linked to AD occurrence, especially when combined with FLG mutations (Klonowska2022Combination).

TSLP also plays a role in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), where its increased expression and genetic variants are associated with heightened basophil responses and disease susceptibility (Varricchi2018Thymic; Smolinska2023Thymic). In cancer, TSLP exhibits both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles, depending on the cancer type, highlighting its complex involvement in tumorigenesis (Marković2020Modulation; Varricchi2018Thymic).

## Interactions
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that interacts with its receptor complex, which includes the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Rα). TSLP forms a ternary complex with TSLPR and IL-7Rα, which is crucial for initiating intracellular signaling pathways. The interaction between TSLP and TSLPR is characterized by electrostatic complementarity, with TSLP presenting a positively charged surface that associates with the negatively charged interdomain elbow of TSLPR. This interaction facilitates the formation of the TSLP:TSLPR binary complex, which then interacts with IL-7Rα (Verstraete2017Structure).

The TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7Rα complex involves significant conformational changes in the TSLP structure, particularly in the C-terminal part of the αD helix and the AB-loop region, which are important for interactions with IL-7Rα. This interaction aids in the formation of a T-shaped ternary complex, contributing to effective TSLP-mediated signal transduction (Marković2020Modulation). The TSLP:TSLPR interface is characterized by a large number of polar interactions, while the TSLP:IL-7R interface is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, allowing for cross-species reactivity (Verstraete2014Structural).
