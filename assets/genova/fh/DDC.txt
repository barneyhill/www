# DDC

## Overview
The DDC gene encodes the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. This enzyme is categorized as a decarboxylase and is essential for converting L-DOPA to dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin, both of which are vital for numerous physiological processes, including mood regulation and motor control (Artemaki2020Revised; MiramontesGonzalez2019A). Dopa decarboxylase functions as a homodimer and is active in the cytoplasm, with its activity being crucial in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues such as the kidneys, where it contributes to sodium and blood pressure homeostasis (Florou2012DDC; MiramontesGonzalez2019A). Mutations in the DDC gene can lead to aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, a severe neurometabolic disorder, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Babiker2022Case; Santa2024Aromatic). Additionally, variations in DDC expression have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions, underscoring its importance in human health (Eisenberg2016Common).

## Structure
The DDC protein is a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer, with each subunit having a molecular mass of 50-55 kDa and a single PLP binding site (Florou2012DDC). The full-length DDC protein consists of 480 amino acids, and its structure includes a pyridoxal phosphate-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Florou2012DDC). 

The primary structure of DDC is defined by its amino acid sequence, which includes specific residues involved in substrate and co-factor binding. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Han2010Crystal). The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape, allowing for the proper orientation of active sites and co-factor binding regions (Han2010Crystal). The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of a homodimer, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Florou2012DDC).

Alternative splicing of the DDC gene results in different mRNA isoforms, including a truncated isoform with 442 amino acids that is inactive in decarboxylation reactions, and another isoform, Alt-DDC, which is a 338 amino acid polypeptide (Florou2012DDC). These isoforms can have distinct functional properties, affecting the enzyme's activity and regulation.

## Function
The DDC gene encodes the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. In healthy human cells, DDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to serotonin, both of which are vital for various physiological functions (Artemaki2020Revised; MiramontesGonzalez2019A). This enzyme is a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent, homodimeric protein that is active in the cytoplasm (Artemaki2020Revised).

Dopamine synthesized by DDC plays a significant role in the central nervous system, influencing mood, movement, and endocrine regulation. In the kidneys, DDC is involved in the intra-renal dopamine system, which is highly expressed in the proximal tubule. This system helps maintain sodium and blood pressure homeostasis by converting circulatory L-DOPA into dopamine, which then acts to inhibit tubular sodium reabsorption and regulate sodium excretion (MiramontesGonzalez2019A). The enzyme's activity is not regulated by renal sympathetic nerve activity but is influenced by dietary sodium intake (MiramontesGonzalez2019A). The DDC gene's role in neurotransmitter synthesis underscores its importance in both neurological and renal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDC gene, which encodes the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, lead to aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder. This condition results in a deficiency of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, causing severe neurological and developmental impairments. Symptoms typically manifest early in life and include hypotonia, movement disorders like dystonia and oculogyric crises, developmental delays, and autonomic dysfunction (Babiker2022Case; Santa2024Aromatic). 

AADC deficiency is often misdiagnosed as more common conditions such as cerebral palsy or seizure disorders, leading to delays in diagnosis (Santa2024Aromatic). The disorder is diagnosed through genetic testing and biochemical evaluation of neurotransmitter metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma AADC activity (Babiker2022Case). 

Alterations in DDC expression have also been linked to various neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, and nicotine dependence. Common genetic variations in the DDC gene have been associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia and may influence therapeutic responses to L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease (Eisenberg2016Common).

## Interactions
Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a major signaling regulator. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in multiple cell types, including mouse brain, human neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and embryonic kidney cells. The interaction involves the 50 kDa isoform of DDC and is modulated by specific inhibitors like carbidopa, which decreases the amount of DDC in the complex with PI3K (Vassiliou2019LDopa).

DDC also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), particularly binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR through its C-terminal region. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of AR, which is significant in prostate cancer cell lines. The interaction is stronger in the presence of androgens and is inhibited by anti-androgens like bicalutamide. DDC's role in enhancing AR activity suggests it may influence prostate cancer cell behavior (WAFA2003Isolation).

These interactions highlight DDC's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer biology.
