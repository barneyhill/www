# CIDEB

## Overview
CIDEB is a gene that encodes the protein known as cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector b, which is a member of the CIDE family of proteins. This protein is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) and plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver and small intestine. CIDEB is involved in the lipidation and maturation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, facilitating the transport of triglycerides and cholesterol esters from the liver to peripheral tissues. The protein's structure includes a CIDE-N domain and a CIDE-C domain, which are crucial for its interactions and functions, including dimerization and caspase-independent cell death (Wu2008Molecular; Ye2009Cideb). CIDEB's interactions with apolipoprotein B and the SREBP/SCAP complex underscore its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic disorders (Ye2009Cideb; Su2019Cideb).

## Structure
CIDEB is an integral membrane protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs). It is characterized by a hydrophilic nature with a predicted isoelectric point of 9.01. The protein's structure includes a prominent hydrophobic region at the C-terminal between amino acids 166 and 195, which forms two potential alpha helices crucial for its localization to LDs and the ER (Ye2009Cideb). CIDEB contains an N-terminal CIDE-N domain and a unique C-terminal CIDE-C domain. The CIDE-N domain shares sequence similarity with the N-terminal CAD domain of DNA fragmentation factors Dffa and Dffb, and is involved in CIDE-CIDE interactions (Park2014Structural; Wu2008Molecular). The CIDE-C domain is responsible for dimerization and inducing caspase-independent cell death (Wu2008Molecular). CIDEB can form homo- or hetero-dimers with other CIDE family members (Wu2008Molecular). The protein interacts with apolipoprotein B (apoB) through a region between amino acids 118 and 165, which is essential for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) maturation (Ye2009Cideb). The electrostatic surface of CIDEB is characterized by one acidic and one basic side, influencing its interaction with binding partners (Park2014Structural).

## Function
CIDEB is a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism. It is involved in the lipidation and maturation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles by interacting with apolipoprotein B (apoB), specifically apoB-100 and apoB-48. This interaction facilitates the transfer of triglycerides (TG) to immature VLDL particles, promoting their maturation and secretion from the liver (Ye2009Cideb).

CIDEB is highly expressed in the liver and is essential for maintaining plasma lipid homeostasis. It aids in the efficient lipidation of VLDL particles, which are critical for transporting triglycerides and cholesterol esters from the liver to peripheral tissues. In CIDEB-deficient mice, there is an accumulation of TGs in the liver and a reduction in VLDL secretion, indicating its importance in lipid metabolism (Ye2009Cideb).

CIDEB also plays a role in the small intestine, where it facilitates the lipidation of chylomicrons, essential for the transport of dietary lipids. Its absence leads to increased lipid retention in the intestine and reduced lipid absorption, highlighting its role in lipid homeostasis (Zhang2014Cideb).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CIDEB gene have been implicated in several metabolic disorders. CIDEB is involved in lipid metabolism, and its deficiency has been shown to protect against diet-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. This protection is due to reduced fat accumulation in the liver and lower activation of SREBP-1 and its downstream lipogenic genes, which are crucial for lipid synthesis (Su2019Cideb). CIDEB deficiency also results in a lean phenotype, resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased metabolic rate, suggesting its role in regulating adiposity and lipid metabolism (Xu2012CIDE; Li2024To).

CIDEB is crucial for the efficient transport of the SREBP/SCAP complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, a process essential for lipid homeostasis. Loss of CIDEB impairs this transport, leading to decreased activation of SREBP and its target genes involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol metabolism (Su2019Cideb). This impairment can result in reduced plasma cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis rates, potentially impacting conditions like hepatic steatosis (Su2019Cideb). Alterations in CIDEB function may also affect lipid storage and contribute to liver-related metabolic disorders (Xu2016Differential).

## Interactions
CIDEB is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its roles in lipid metabolism and apoptosis. It interacts with apolipoprotein B (apoB), specifically with the C-terminal region of apoB-100, facilitating the lipidation and maturation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. This interaction is mediated by amino acids 118-165 of CIDEB and is essential for the efficient transfer of triglycerides to VLDL particles (Ye2009Cideb).

CIDEB also interacts with the SREBP/SCAP complex, playing a significant role in the ER-to-Golgi transport of this complex. It binds to SCAP, promoting its loading into COPII vesicles, which is crucial for the activation of SREBPs, master regulators of lipid homeostasis. This interaction is sterol-dependent, with CIDEB binding to SCAP in the absence of sterols (Su2019Cideb).

Additionally, CIDEB interacts with Sec12, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in COPII vesicle formation, enhancing the packaging of the SREBP/SCAP complex at ER exit sites (Su2019Cideb). CIDEB's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in lipid metabolism and its potential impact on cellular lipid homeostasis.
