# ANKUB1

## Overview
ANKUB1 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and ubiquitin domain containing 1, also known as C3orf16. This protein is characterized by the presence of three ankyrin repeat domains and a ubiquitin domain, which are integral to its function in cellular processes. The ankyrin repeat domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, while the ubiquitin domain is involved in tagging proteins for degradation, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2020Novel). ANKUB1 is expressed in various tissues, including airway mucus-secreting cells and endothelial cells, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular functions (Lindskog2014The). Mutations in the ANKUB1 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as polysyndactyly and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential significance in human health (Zhang2020Novel; Suroliya2023Computational). Further research is necessary to fully understand the biological roles and clinical implications of ANKUB1.

## Structure
The ANKUB1 protein, also known as C3orf16, is characterized by the presence of three ankyrin repeat domains and one ubiquitin domain, along with a low complexity region (Zhang2020Novel). Ankyrin repeat domains are 33-residue motifs that typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Zhang2020Novel). The ubiquitin domain, consisting of 76 amino acid residues, is highly conserved across eukaryotic cells and plays a role in tagging proteins for degradation through ubiquitination (Zhang2020Novel).

A frameshift mutation identified in the ANKUB1 gene results in a truncated protein that does not affect the ankyrin repeat and ubiquitin domains, suggesting these domains are crucial for its function (Zhang2020Novel). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including airway mucus-secreting cells and endothelial cells, indicating its potential involvement in diverse cellular processes (Lindskog2014The). However, the specific molecular structure details, such as primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, are not provided in the available literature. The protein's function and interactions may be influenced by post-translational modifications like ubiquitination and phosphorylation, although specific details are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The ANKUB1 gene encodes a protein that contains ankyrin repeat domains and a ubiquitin domain, both of which play crucial roles in cellular processes. The ankyrin repeat domains are 33-residue motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are essential for various cellular functions and signaling pathways (Zhang2020Novel). The ubiquitin domain, consisting of 76 amino acid residues, is highly conserved across eukaryotic cells and is involved in the process of ubiquitination. This process tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2020Novel).

In healthy human cells, the ANKUB1 protein is active in various cellular compartments, influencing cell signaling and homeostasis. Its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination suggests it may be involved in critical cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and response to cellular stress. Although the specific organismal outcomes of ANKUB1's functions are not fully detailed, its involvement in these fundamental processes indicates its importance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions (Zhang2020Novel). Further research is needed to elucidate the complete range of its biological roles and impacts.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKUB1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In a study involving a Chinese family with polysyndactyly (PSD), a novel frameshift mutation in ANKUB1 was identified. This mutation was present in affected family members but absent in unaffected ones, suggesting a potential association with PSD. The frameshift mutation truncates the protein but does not affect the ankyrin repeat or ubiquitin domains, raising questions about its impact on ANKUB1's function in osteogenesis and osteoclast differentiation (Zhang2020Novel).

ANKUB1 has also been associated with neurological disorders. Research has shown that ANKUB1 is significantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, a region linked to spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) disorders. This expression pattern suggests a potential role in ataxia phenotypes (Suroliya2024Identifying; Suroliya2023Computational).

In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and Williams syndrome (WS), ANKUB1 is more strongly downregulated in WS than in ASDs, although specific diseases directly associated with ANKUB1 mutations in these conditions have not been detailed (Niego2020Autism).
