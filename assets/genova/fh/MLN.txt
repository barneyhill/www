# MLN

## Overview
The MLN gene encodes motilin, a peptide hormone that plays a pivotal role in gastrointestinal motility. Motilin is primarily involved in stimulating smooth muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly during fasting periods, by interacting with the motilin receptor (MLN-R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (Kitazawa2021Motilin; Feighner1999Receptor). This interaction is crucial for the induction of phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC), which helps clear residual food and bacteria from the stomach and small intestine (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The MLN gene's expression and the activity of motilin are influenced by various physiological factors, including changes in duodenal pH and the release of serotonin (Kitazawa2021Motilin). Alterations in the MLN gene have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining digestive health (Mömke2012Transcription; Wang2021CircORC2).

## Structure
Motilin is a peptide hormone composed of 22 amino acids in mammals, with its primary sequence starting with phenylalanine, which is crucial for its biological activity (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The N-terminal region is highly conserved and essential for binding and activity, while the C-terminal region is more conserved across species, suggesting its role in stabilizing the motilin molecule's binding to its receptor and preventing degradation (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The C-terminal portion is thought to form an alpha-helix, contributing to the stabilization and binding of motilin to its receptor (Kitazawa2021Motilin).

Motilin does not form a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The motilin receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor known as MLN-R, shares a common binding site for motilin and erythromycin in the third transmembrane region, with the first and second extracellular loop domains being crucial for motilin binding (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The motilin receptor is part of the class A GPCRs, and its interaction with motilin involves specific structural elements, including the transmembrane helixes and extracellular loops (Xu2005Motilin). Common post-translational modifications include amidation at the C-terminus, which is typical for peptide hormones like motilin. However, detailed information on specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms is not provided in the available context.

## Function
Motilin, encoded by the MLN gene, is a peptide hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating gastrointestinal motility. It is primarily involved in stimulating smooth muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly during fasting periods. This action is mediated through the motilin receptor (MLN-R), a G protein-coupled receptor located on enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract (Kitazawa2021Motilin; Feighner1999Receptor).

Motilin is known to induce phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC), a pattern of electromechanical activity observed in the gastrointestinal tract during fasting. This process helps clear residual food and bacteria from the stomach and small intestine, maintaining digestive health and efficiency (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The release of motilin is influenced by changes in duodenal pH, with both acidification and alkalinization triggering its release. This involves the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and the release of serotonin (5-HT), which activates bicarbonate release and stimulates motilin release (Kitazawa2021Motilin).

Motilin also stimulates the release of serotonin from enteric neurons, which activates cholinergic neurons and the vago-vagal reflex pathway, leading to the contraction of the stomach and upper intestine (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The motilin receptor is expressed in the intestinal mucosa and the central nervous system, although its role in the CNS is not well understood (Kitazawa2021Motilin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MLN gene, which encodes the hormone motilin, have been associated with various gastrointestinal disorders. In German Holstein cattle, a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MLN gene, FN298674:g.90T.C, has been linked to left-sided displacement of the abomasum (LDA). This SNP affects a transcription factor binding site, leading to reduced MLN expression and increased LDA incidence, suggesting a genetic component to the condition (Mömke2012Transcription). Although this specific mutation is studied in cattle, it highlights the potential impact of MLN gene alterations on gastrointestinal motility.

In humans, motilin is involved in gastrointestinal motility, and its altered levels have been linked to conditions such as slow transit constipation (STC). Research indicates that the circORC2/miR-19a/neurotensin/motilin signaling pathway plays a role in STC, where changes in motilin levels can affect gastrointestinal function (Wang2021CircORC2). Additionally, motilin's interaction with herbal medicines has been shown to influence gastrointestinal motility, suggesting that changes in motilin levels can alleviate symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders like indigestion and constipation (Cho2023The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MLN gene expression and its interactions in gastrointestinal health.

## Interactions
Motilin (MLN) primarily interacts with the motilin receptor (MLNR), a G-protein-coupled receptor, to regulate gastrointestinal motility. This interaction is crucial for the activation of smooth muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly during the fasting state, where it induces phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC) (Kitazawa2021Motilin). The motilin receptor is expressed on enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells, facilitating its role in gastrointestinal motility (Feighner1999Receptor).

Motilin's interaction with its receptor involves binding primarily in the extracellular IV and V transmembrane regions of MLNR, with conserved domains being vital for binding (Zhou2019Identification). This binding leads to the mobilization of intracellular calcium, which is a key part of its signaling mechanism (Feighner1999Receptor).

In addition to its primary interaction with MLNR, motilin has been shown to interact with other gastrointestinal hormones. In vitro studies indicate that motilin affects the mRNA expression of ghrelin (ghrl), gastrin (gas), and cholecystokinin (cck) in the intestine, suggesting a modulatory role in gastrointestinal functions (Zhou2019Identification). Despite structural similarities with ghrelin, there is no evidence for cross-reactivity between motilin and ghrelin receptors, indicating distinct modes of binding and activities (He2011Gene).
