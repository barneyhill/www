# SERPINB5

## Overview
SERPINB5 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 5, commonly referred to as maspin. Maspin is a non-inhibitory member of the serpin superfamily, which is primarily involved in cytoskeleton organization and regulation of epithelial cell shape. Unlike many serpins that function as protease inhibitors, maspin does not inhibit proteases but instead interacts with cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments and microtubules, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion, motility, and maintaining cell integrity (da2024MaspinSerpinB5). The gene is located on chromosome 18q21.3 and is implicated in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), making it significant in cancer research (da2024MaspinSerpinB5; Heit2013Update). Maspin's interactions with other proteins, such as TRIM21, further highlight its role in modulating cellular responses to stress and maintaining cellular integrity (Zhang2020TRIM21–SERPINB5).

## Structure
SERPINB5, also known as maspin, is a non-inhibitory member of the serpin superfamily. Its primary structure consists of 375 amino acids, encoded by a gene located on chromosome 18q21.3 (Heit2013Update). The secondary structure of SERPINB5 includes the typical serpin features of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although specific details about its arrangement are not provided in the available context. The tertiary structure of serpins generally involves a conserved serpin fold, which is crucial for their function, but specific details for SERPINB5 are not mentioned (Heit2013Update).

SERPINB5 is known for its role in cytoskeleton organization, interacting with components such as actin filaments and microtubules, which suggests a functional domain related to cytoskeleton binding (da2024MaspinSerpinB5). Although the context does not provide detailed information on post-translational modifications or quaternary structure, it is noted that SERPINB5 may have splice variants resulting in different isoforms with distinct functions (Heit2013Update). These structural features contribute to its role in regulating epithelial cell shape and its involvement in processes like tumor suppression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (da2024MaspinSerpinB5).

## Function
SERPINB5, also known as maspin, is a cytoskeleton-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating epithelial cell shape and maintaining cell integrity. It interacts with actin filaments and is involved in adhesion complexes that connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape and motility (da2024MaspinSerpinB5). Maspin is also involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, where it suppresses microtubule growth, potentially through interactions at the growing microtubule ends (da2024MaspinSerpinB5).

In healthy cells, maspin is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell motility and proliferation. Its subcellular localization is regulated by cell-cell contact and calcium levels, with maspin becoming uniformly distributed across the cytoplasm and nucleus at full confluency (Longhi2021PI3KAKT). The protein's nuclear localization is crucial for its tumor suppression activity, and it is involved in post-transcriptional and translational regulation, protein folding, and cell-cell adhesion (Longhi2021PI3KAKT).

Maspin also plays a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where its depletion leads to changes in cell shape, cytoskeleton reorganization, and altered expression of EMT markers, indicating its role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and preventing EMT (da2024MaspinSerpinB5).

## Clinical Significance
SERPINB5, also known as maspin, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its function as a tumor suppressor gene. Alterations in the expression of SERPINB5 have been linked to several malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

In HCC, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SERPINB5 gene, such as rs2289520, have been associated with altered risk and clinical outcomes. The presence of the C allele in this SNP is linked to better liver function and a reduced risk of HCC, while certain haplotypes like 'C-C-C' in the promoter region increase susceptibility to the disease (Yang2016Serpin).

In LUAD, SERPINB5 is overexpressed compared to normal lung tissue, and this high expression correlates with poor overall survival. It is considered a risk factor for LUAD prognosis, with its expression levels influencing clinical outcomes and response to treatments like cisplatin (Yang2023BTG2).

In PDAC, increased SERPINB5 expression is associated with higher metastasis scores, suggesting a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Promoter methylation of SERPINB5 correlates with reduced expression and lower metastatic potential, indicating its potential as a biomarker for metastasis (Mardin2010SERPINB5).

## Interactions
SERPINB5, also known as maspin, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with components of the cytoskeleton, including actin filaments and microtubules, through its Reactive Center Loop motif. This interaction is crucial for regulating epithelial cell shape and maintaining cell polarity (da2024MaspinSerpinB5). Maspin binds to microfilaments and microtubules, acting at the interface between the cytoskeleton and adhesion sites, and is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (da2024MaspinSerpinB5).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, SERPINB5 interacts with TRIM21, an E3 ligase, to facilitate the repression of GMPS, particularly under conditions of X-ray radiation. This interaction is crucial for TRIM21-mediated repression of the GMPS-TP53 pathway, as TRIM21's ability to attenuate TP53 is dependent on SERPINB5. SERPINB5 recruits GMPS and prevents its nuclear entry, which is significant because GMPS stabilizes TP53 in the nucleus (Zhang2020TRIM21–SERPINB5). The interaction between SERPINB5 and GMPS is promoted by X-ray radiation and is independent of TRIM21 expression (Zhang2020TRIM21–SERPINB5). These interactions highlight SERPINB5's role in modulating cellular responses to stress and maintaining cellular integrity.
