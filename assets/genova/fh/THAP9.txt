# THAP9

## Overview
THAP9 is a gene in humans that encodes the THAP domain-containing protein 9, a member of the THAP protein family characterized by the presence of a THAP-type Zinc Finger domain. This protein is categorized as a DNA transposase, sharing homology with the Drosophila P-element transposase, and is involved in DNA recombination and genome evolution (Majumdar2013The). The THAP9 protein exhibits a complex structure with multiple domains, including a DNA-binding THAP domain, an RNaseH-like fold, and a leucine zipper domain, which facilitate its catalytic and oligomerization activities (Rashmi2021Evolutionary; Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation). While the precise physiological role of THAP9 in humans remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress response, and its expression is altered in various cancers, suggesting potential clinical significance (Rashmi2022Pancancer; Sharma2021Stress).

## Structure
The THAP9 protein, encoded by the human THAP9 gene, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of THAP9 features a THAP-type Zinc Finger domain at the N-terminal end, which is 89 residues long and functions as a DNA-binding domain with a C2CH motif (Rashmi2021Evolutionary). This domain is crucial for DNA interaction and is highly conserved across species (Rashmi2021Evolutionary).

The secondary structure of THAP9 includes an RNaseH-like fold, which is composed of a mixture of beta sheets and alpha helices. This fold contains a conserved DDE/D motif essential for its catalytic activity in DNA cleavage and integration (Sharma2020THAP9). The catalytic triad within this domain consists of residues D304, D374, and E613 (Sharma2020THAP9).

THAP9 also contains a leucine zipper domain, which is involved in oligomerization, suggesting a potential quaternary structure where the protein may form homodimers or higher-order oligomers (Rashmi2021Evolutionary; Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation). The protein is predicted to have a bipartite nuclear localization signal, indicating its potential nuclear function (Rashmi2021Evolutionary). The presence of kinase phosphorylation sites suggests possible post-translational modifications that could regulate its activity (Rashmi2021Evolutionary).

## Function
The human THAP9 gene encodes a protein that is homologous to the Drosophila P-element transposase, a type of DNA transposase. Despite being a domesticated transposon in humans, THAP9 retains catalytic activity, allowing it to mobilize Drosophila P-elements in both Drosophila and human cells, suggesting a potential role in DNA recombination and genome evolution (Majumdar2013The). THAP9 is expressed as a single copy in the human genome and encodes six transcripts, with only one producing the full-length transposase protein (Sharma2021Stress).

The specific function of THAP9 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but it is known to localize in mitochondria and its expression changes under oxidative stress, indicating a possible role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis (Sharma2021Stress). The expression of THAP9 is periodic throughout the S-phase of the cell cycle, suggesting it may be involved in cell cycle regulation (Sharma2021Stress). However, the precise molecular processes and organismal outcomes associated with THAP9 in non-stressed, healthy conditions have yet to be fully elucidated, as current research primarily focuses on its stress-induced expression changes (Sharma2021Stress).

## Clinical Significance
THAP9, a gene encoding a protein with a THAP domain, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. A pan-cancer analysis revealed that THAP9 is frequently altered in several cancer types, with pancreatic cancer showing the highest alteration frequency primarily through gene amplification. Other cancers, such as breast cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, melanoma, embryonal tumor, and bone cancer, also exhibit amplification of THAP9, while Uterine Endometrioid Carcinoma shows deep deletion of the gene (Rashmi2022Pancancer). In colorectal cancer, mature B-cell Lymphoma, and Head and Neck Cancer, mutations are the primary form of genetic alteration for THAP9 (Rashmi2022Pancancer).

Alterations in THAP9 expression are associated with poor overall survival in cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Rashmi2022Pancancer). The gene is upregulated in cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), while it is downregulated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) (Rashmi2022Pancancer). These expression changes are linked to poor prognosis in specific cancers, including lower-grade glioma (LGG) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (Rashmi2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
THAP9, a human protein with a THAP domain, is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It can undergo homo-oligomerization, forming homodimers primarily in the nuclei of HEK293T cells. This oligomerization is partially mediated by DNA, similar to other transposases like MuA and Hermes (Sanghavi2021Oligomerization; Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation). The presence of leucine-rich coiled coil regions in THAP9 suggests these regions facilitate oligomerization through hydrophobic interactions (Sanghavi2021Oligomerization; Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation).

THAP9 also has the potential to hetero-oligomerize with other proteins. The STRING database predicts interactions with other human THAP family members, such as THAP1, THAP10, and THAP11, as well as the regulatory protein Hcf-1. These interactions are supported by the presence of a predicted Hcf-1 binding consensus motif in THAP9 (Sanghavi2021Oligomerization; Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation). Experimental evidence shows that THAP9 can co-localize with Hcf-1, THAP1, THAP10, and THAP11, indicating significant interactions. However, truncated versions of THAP9 do not co-immunoprecipitate with THAP1 or THAP10, suggesting additional carboxy-terminal interaction domains are involved (Sanghavi2021Oligomerization; Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation).
