# UBFD1

## Overview
UBFD1 (ubiquitin family domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular regulation. The protein encoded by UBFD1 is characterized by its involvement in posttranslational modifications and protein turnover, interacting with various proteins to influence cellular processes such as proteolysis and signal transduction (Duan2020TMTbased; Pei2022Differential). UBFD1 is particularly noted for its role in ubiquitination, where it affects transcription factors and contributes to extracellular matrix degradation, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and response to infections (Yeh2019Investigating). The protein's interaction with K48-linked ubiquitin chains suggests a preference that may be relevant to its function in protein degradation pathways (Waltho2024K48). Given its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes, UBFD1 is of interest in the study of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is a common feature (Zhao2021Highthroughput; Seabra2020Ubiquitin–proteasome).

## Clinical Significance
UBFD1 (ubiquitin family domain containing 1) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. Alterations in UBFD1 expression have been associated with tuberous sclerosis complex-related renal angiomyolipoma (TSC-RAML), where it is up-regulated and may contribute to the pathogenesis through its involvement in the mTOR pathway (Zhao2021Highthroughput). This suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis and cellular growth dysregulation.

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, UBFD1 is modulated by antipsychotic medications, which affect the ubiquitin-proteasome system in human oligodendrocytes. This modulation is significant as impairments in the ubiquitin-proteasome system can lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins, a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders (Seabra2020Ubiquitin–proteasome).

UBFD1 is also involved in inflammatory processes, as it is linked to the regulation of the NFkB pathway, which is relevant to conditions such as aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgia in breast cancer patients (Reinbolt2017Genomic). These findings highlight the gene's potential impact on inflammatory and immune responses. However, specific clinical implications of UBFD1 mutations or expression alterations remain under investigation.

## Interactions
UBFD1 (ubiquitin family domain containing 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as part of a protein interaction group involved in posttranslational modification and protein turnover, interacting with proteins such as PSMD10 and PSMD3 (Duan2020TMTbased). UBFD1 also plays a role in the ubiquitination process, affecting the transcription factor FOS, which in turn regulates the gene MMP12, contributing to extracellular matrix degradation during Candida albicans infection (Yeh2019Investigating).

In the context of ubiquitin chain interactions, UBFD1 shows increased enrichment on K48-linked ubiquitin chains in the presence of the NEM inhibitor, suggesting a preference for these chains potentially due to increased chain stability or unspecific alkylation affecting ubiquitin-binding sites (Waltho2024K48). This interaction indicates UBFD1's involvement in ubiquitin-mediated processes, such as protein degradation and signal transduction. Additionally, UBFD1 is part of the protein metabolism process, interacting with other proteins involved in proteasomal protein catabolic processes and proteolysis, as observed in studies on aborted yak placentas (Pei2022Differential).
