# C22orf15

## Overview
C22orf15, or chromosome 22 open reading frame 15, is a gene located on chromosome 22 that encodes a protein of the same name. The protein encoded by C22orf15 is currently not well-characterized, and its specific biological functions remain largely unknown. However, it is categorized as a protein of interest due to its potential involvement in various cellular processes and disease states. Research has suggested that C22orf15 may play a role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth, as indicated by its association with conditions such as prostate cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (Cortese2012Epigenetic; de2005Chromosome). Despite these associations, further studies are required to elucidate the precise functions and mechanisms of the C22orf15 protein in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C22orf15 has been implicated in several diseases, although its specific role remains under investigation. In prostate cancer, C22orf15 is one of six genes identified with DNA modification changes associated with disease-free survival in primary prostate tumors. This suggests a potential role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, highlighting its prognostic relevance (Cortese2012Epigenetic).

In a study involving a developmental macular disorder and digit abnormalities, a missense variant in C22orf15 (p.Thr96Ser) was identified in affected individuals. This variant was absent from all databases used for variant filtering, suggesting it might be novel, although the study did not establish a direct link between C22orf15 mutations and specific diseases (Cipriani2017Genomewide).

C22orf15 has also been noted in the context of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where it was identified among genes with altered copy numbers in specific amplicons. While the study did not provide specific disease associations, it implies C22orf15's involvement in the complex genetic landscape of GBM (de2005Chromosome).

Overall, while C22orf15 is associated with various conditions, its precise clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it influences disease remain to be fully elucidated.
