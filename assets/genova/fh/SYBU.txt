# SYBU

## Overview
The SYBU gene encodes the protein syntabulin, which functions as a motor adaptor protein primarily involved in neuronal transport and synaptic function. Syntabulin plays a critical role in synaptic transmission by facilitating the transport of presynaptic proteins and active zone components along microtubules, linking them to kinesin-1 motors. This transport is essential for the assembly and maintenance of synapses, impacting synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release. Syntabulin's interactions with proteins such as syntaxin-1B and KIF5B are vital for maintaining the excitation/inhibition balance in neurons, which is crucial for normal neuronal function and the prevention of neurological disorders like epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (Ke2023Syntabulin; Cai2007Syntabulin–Kinesin1; Xiong2020Defects).

## Function
Syntabulin (SYBU) is a neuronal transporter that plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission by mediating the transport of presynaptic proteins. It functions as a motor adaptor, linking kinesin-1 motors to presynaptic cargos, facilitating their transport along microtubules to the presynaptic membrane. This transport is essential for the assembly and maintenance of synapses, ensuring proper synaptic function and plasticity (Ke2023Syntabulin; Xiong2020Defects).

In healthy human cells, syntabulin is involved in the long-distance delivery of newly synthesized synaptic proteins from the soma to distal synapses. This process is vital for maintaining synaptic transmission and the excitation/inhibition balance, which is crucial for normal neuronal function and preventing neurological disorders such as epilepsy (Ke2023Syntabulin; Xiong2020Defects).

Syntabulin's role extends to the transport of active zone components and synaptic vesicles, which are critical for presynaptic assembly and function. It interacts with syntaxin 1B to mediate its delivery to the synapse, impacting neurotransmitter release and synaptic strength (Ke2023Syntabulin). This function is protective against epilepsy by increasing presynaptic transmitter release, particularly affecting GABAergic activity over excitatory synapses (Ke2023Syntabulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SYBU (syntabulin) gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and epilepsy. A specific missense variant, R178Q, in the SYBU gene has been associated with autism. This mutation impairs the gene's ability to bind to kinesin-1 motors, crucial for axonal transport, leading to defects in synaptic cargo transport. These defects result in reduced synapse density and altered synaptic transmission, contributing to autism-like behaviors such as impaired social recognition and communication, increased stereotypic behavior, and impaired spatial learning and memory (Xiong2020Defects).

In epilepsy, syntabulin plays a role in maintaining the balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition. Alterations in its expression can lead to an excitation/inhibition imbalance, a key factor in epilepsy pathogenesis. Overexpression of syntabulin has been shown to reduce seizure susceptibility, while knockdown increases it. This is linked to syntabulin's role in transporting syntaxin 1B to the presynaptic membrane, affecting neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission (Ke2023Syntabulin). These findings suggest that syntabulin is a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy and other related neurological disorders.

## Interactions
Syntabulin (SYBU) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in neuronal transport and synaptic function. It acts as a motor adaptor protein, linking the kinesin-1 family member KIF5B to presynaptic cargos, facilitating their transport along axons. This interaction is essential for the anterograde transport of active zone (AZ) components, which are necessary for presynaptic assembly and synaptic plasticity (Cai2007Syntabulin–Kinesin1).

Syntabulin also interacts with syntaxin-1, a component of the SNARE complex, which is crucial for neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals. This interaction is selective for syntaxin-1B over syntaxin-1A, and it is significant in maintaining the excitation/inhibition balance in neurons, particularly in the context of epilepsy (Ke2023Syntabulin).

In addition to its role in synaptic transmission, syntabulin's interaction with KIF5B is vital for the transport of mitochondria to presynaptic terminals, supporting synaptic function and plasticity by ensuring adequate ATP production and synaptic vesicle mobilization (Ma2009KIF5B). These interactions highlight syntabulin's multifaceted role in maintaining synaptic health and function.
