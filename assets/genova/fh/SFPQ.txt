# SFPQ

## Overview
The SFPQ gene encodes the splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) protein, a multifunctional nuclear protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair. As a member of the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) protein family, SFPQ is characterized by its conserved core region, which includes RNA recognition motifs and domains essential for dimerization and oligomerization (Knott2016The). The protein is involved in forming paraspeckles, subnuclear structures that contribute to RNA processing and stress response (Knott2016The). SFPQ's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids are crucial for its function in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. Dysregulation of SFPQ is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in neuronal health and disease (Hogan2020SFPQ; Younas2020SFPQ).

## Structure
The SFPQ protein is a member of the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) protein family, characterized by a conserved core region that includes tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a NonA/paraspeckle domain (NOPS), and a coiled-coil domain (Knott2016The). The RRMs are involved in nucleic acid binding, with RRM1 being canonical and RRM2 having unique features for double-stranded DNA/RNA recognition (Knott2016The). The NOPS domain primarily mediates dimerization, while the coiled-coil domain facilitates both dimerization and oligomerization, essential for forming higher-order structures like paraspeckles (Knott2016The).

SFPQ forms dimers, which are crucial for its function, and can also form heterodimers with other DBHS proteins such as NONO and PSPC1 (Knott2016The). The protein's structure includes an extended α-helical coiled-coil projecting from the core dimer interface, which is vital for oligomerization and nucleic acid binding (Knott2016The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, methylation, and SUMOylation, modulate SFPQ's interactions and functions (Knott2016The).

The crystal structure of the SFPQ dimerization domain (residues 276-535) reveals zinc coordination, which induces polymerization and affects its structural dynamics (Huang2020Structural). This zinc-induced polymerization is mediated by three histidine residues, leading to a conformational change in the protein's α-helical secondary structure (Huang2020Structural).

## Function
The SFPQ gene encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various nuclear processes essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression in healthy human cells. SFPQ plays a critical role in RNA splicing by forming complexes with other proteins and spliceosome components, regulating the splicing of specific genes, including those involved in neuronal function and immune response (Knott2016The). It also participates in transcriptional regulation by binding to DNA and RNA, influencing transcriptional activity through interactions with transcription factors and epigenetic silencers like Sin3A and HDAC (ShavTal2002PSF; Knott2016The).

SFPQ is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), where it forms complexes with proteins like NonO and RAD51 to stabilize DNA repair mechanisms (Yu2024Established). It also plays a role in post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by microRNAs, interacting with components of the miRNA-induced silencing complex to modulate miRNA activity (Bottini2017Posttranscriptional).

In addition to its molecular functions, SFPQ is crucial for neuronal development and differentiation, impacting processes such as axon outgrowth and neuroprotection (Knott2016The; Gordon2021A). Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to the formation and integrity of paraspeckles, subnuclear structures involved in RNA processing and stress response (Knott2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the SFPQ gene are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In ALS, SFPQ is associated with intron retention, reduced expression, and protein aggregation in central nervous system tissues. These alterations are considered pathological features of ALS, with increased retention of intron nine and nuclear loss being common (Hogan2020SFPQ). SFPQ misregulation leads to the production of aberrant intron-retaining transcripts, which are enriched in ALS patients, suggesting a shared signature between SFPQ-depleted neurons and ALS (Taylor2022Prematurely).

In Alzheimer's disease, particularly rapidly progressive forms, SFPQ is downregulated at the protein level in the frontal cortex, with significant nuclear depletion observed. This dysregulation is linked to increased cell death and is considered a critical feature of Alzheimer's pathology (Younas2020SFPQ). SFPQ also interacts with other ALS-associated RNA-binding proteins, such as TDP-43 and FUS, and its mislocalization and aggregation in the cytoplasm are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases (Lim2020The). These findings highlight the significant role of SFPQ in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

## Interactions
SFPQ interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in multiple cellular processes. It forms complexes with proteins such as TRAP150, which inhibits RNA binding and alters posttranscriptional processing, and PTBP2, with which it forms a tumor suppression complex. Disruption of this complex can lead to oncogenic activity (Knott2016The). SFPQ also interacts with NONO and PSPC1, forming core components of paraspeckles, which are involved in nuclear processes like pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair (Laurenzi2022Molecular).

SFPQ binds to nucleic acids, including the murine noncoding RNA VL30, which alleviates its repressor activity, and the lncRNA NEAT1, which sequesters SFPQ into paraspeckles, affecting transcriptional activation (Knott2016The). It also interacts with long 3′UTRs, forming aggregates that facilitate miRNA targeting, particularly in relation to the Ago2-let-7a complex (Bottini2017Posttranscriptional).

In DNA repair, SFPQ is involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, forming a pre-ligation complex with the NHEJ factor Ku and the DNA substrate, essential for the joining of double-stranded DNA ends (Marshall2022Different). It also interacts with proteins like RAD51 and MATR3, facilitating DNA repair processes (Salton2010Involvement).
