# SPAG11B

## Overview
SPAG11B (sperm-associated antigen 11B) is a gene that encodes a protein primarily involved in the male reproductive system, particularly within the epididymis. The protein, also named SPAG11B, is categorized as a testicular-specific protein and plays a crucial role in sperm maturation and motility. It is also implicated in the immune defense of the male reproductive tract, exhibiting antimicrobial properties that protect sperm from pathogens (Zhou2024Identification). Beyond its reproductive functions, SPAG11B has been identified as having potential clinical significance in various cancers, including ovarian cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, where it may act as a biomarker or tumor suppressor (Shan2022Genomic; Hong2018Construction). The gene's expression and polymorphisms are also linked to fertility traits, highlighting its multifaceted role in both health and disease (Liu2011Six).

## Function
SPAG11B (sperm-associated antigen 11B) is a testicular-specific protein that plays a critical role in the normal function of the male reproductive system. It is primarily active in the epididymis, where it contributes to sperm maturation and motility. The protein is involved in the immune defense of the male reproductive tract, exhibiting antimicrobial activity that helps protect sperm from pathogens (Zhou2024Identification). SPAG11B's role in the reproductive system is underscored by its specificity and sensitivity in detecting dysfunction in supporting cells or germ cells, making it a potential therapeutic target for conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, although its primary function is related to reproductive health (Zhou2024Identification).

Despite its significance in the reproductive system, SPAG11B was not expressed in the single-cell RNA sequencing data from either ankylosing spondylitis patients or healthy controls, suggesting its expression may be limited to specific conditions or cell types not captured in the study (Zhou2024Identification). The protein's involvement in ubiquitination and immune response regulation further highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, although its specific molecular activities in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Zhou2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
SPAG11B has been identified as having potential clinical significance in various cancer types. In ovarian cancer, SPAG11B is considered a potential biomarker due to its moderate prognostic potential, with a hazard ratio of 0.86 for progression-free survival, suggesting an anti-cancer role (Hong2018Construction). Its expression pattern can help discriminate between high-risk and low-risk groups, indicating it may function as a tumor suppressor (Hong2018Construction). In lung adenocarcinoma, SPAG11B is significantly downregulated in patients with cell cycle progression pathway alterations, with a log fold change of -6.66, highlighting its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Shan2022Genomic).

In the context of inflammation-driven lung tumorigenesis, SPAG11B is notably upregulated, suggesting a role in the inflammatory processes associated with cancer development (Qian2015RNAsequencing). The gene's expression is also linked to reproductive health, with polymorphisms in SPAG11 affecting sperm quality traits in bulls, which may have implications for fertility (Liu2011Six). These findings underscore the importance of SPAG11B in both cancer and reproductive health, warranting further investigation into its clinical applications.
