# PCID2

## Overview
PCID2 is a gene that encodes the protein PCI domain containing 2, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in mRNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic trafficking. The PCID2 protein is characterized by the presence of a PCI domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and is commonly found in proteins associated with large complexes such as the proteasome and the COP9 signalosome (Ellisdon2012Structurala). As a component of the TREX-2 complex, PCID2 plays a crucial role in the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, linking nuclear export to cytoplasmic mRNA transport (Glukhova2021PCID2). Additionally, PCID2 is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle, with implications in various diseases, including cancer (Bhatia2014BRCA2; Zhang2021A). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as centrin 2 and ZNHIT1, further underscore its significance in cellular function and regulation (Cunningham2014Human; Ye2017Suppression).

## Structure
The PCID2 protein is characterized by a PCI domain, a structural motif commonly found in proteins associated with large complexes such as the proteasome, COP9 signalosome, and eIF3. This domain facilitates protein-protein interactions and is composed of a stack of alpha-helices topped with a winged-helix (WH) domain (Ellisdon2012Structurala). The WH domain is a conserved structure with a helix-turn-helix fold and a beta-sheet on the surface, crucial for interactions with nucleic acids (Ellisdon2012Structurala).

PCID2's secondary structure includes nine α-helices and three strands of antiparallel β-sheets. The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions with the intrinsically disordered protein DSS1, which forms an antiparallel β-sheet between helix III and IV of the PCID2 superhelical domain (Liu2015Conformational). The C-terminal WH domain of PCID2 is involved in specific interactions with RNA, particularly binding to the 3'-noncoding region of certain mRNAs (Vdovina2023PCID2).

Post-translational modifications of PCID2 include ubiquitination, as evidenced by the presence of different molecular weight forms in Drosophila, suggesting similar modifications may occur in humans (Glukhova2021PCID2). These modifications likely influence PCID2's function and interactions within the TREX-2 complex.

## Function
PCID2 (PCI domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic trafficking in human cells. It is a component of the TREX-2 complex, which is essential for the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, facilitating subsequent mRNA trafficking within the cell (Glukhova2021PCID2). PCID2 interacts with the nuclear pore complex and is involved in stabilizing mRNA in the cytoplasm, suggesting its role in linking nuclear export to cytoplasmic mRNA transport (Glukhova2021PCID2).

In the cytoplasm, PCID2 associates with microtubules and interacts with proteins such as NudC, which stabilizes PCID2 and is crucial for its function in mRNA transport (Glukhova2021PCID2). This interaction is important for maintaining proper mRNA distribution and transport processes, as evidenced by the accumulation of mRNA near the nuclear envelope when PCID2 is depleted (Glukhova2021PCID2).

PCID2 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability and is involved in cell cycle regulation. It is active in the nuclear pore complex, where it contributes to the regulation of mRNA export and localization, impacting cellular and organismal outcomes (Glukhova2021PCID2).

## Clinical Significance
PCID2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes and its interactions with other proteins. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PCID2 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene. Its amplification is associated with increased mRNA expression, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis. PCID2 interacts with the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, leading to its degradation and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which contributes to CRC progression. High PCID2 expression is an independent predictor of cancer recurrence, particularly in stage II and III CRC patients (Zhang2021A).

In hematopoiesis, PCID2 influences lymphoid and myeloid lineage commitment. Its deficiency skews differentiation towards lymphoid cells, affecting the balance between lymphoid and myeloid cell production. This is due to its interaction with the SRCAP complex and the transcription factor PU.1, which are crucial for lineage specification (Ye2017Suppression).

PCID2 is also involved in maintaining genome stability. It is a component of the TREX-2 complex, which is essential for mRNA export and preventing R-loop accumulation. Disruption of PCID2 can lead to genome instability, potentially contributing to cancer development (Bhatia2014BRCA2).

## Interactions
PCID2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with centrin 2, a component of the mammalian TREX-2 mRNA export complex, to localize at the centrosome. This interaction is essential for PCID2's centrosomal localization, as centrin 2 assists in recruiting PCID2 to the centrosome, particularly during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (Cunningham2014Human).

PCID2 also interacts with ZNHIT1, a regulatory component of the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex. This interaction inhibits the SRCAP complex's ATPase activity, affecting chromatin remodeling and gene expression. PCID2 can block the interaction between ZNHIT1 and SRCAP, thereby regulating lineage commitment in hematopoietic stem cells (Ye2017Suppression).

In Drosophila, PCID2 interacts with the NudC chaperone protein in the cytoplasm, which is crucial for mRNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic trafficking. This interaction is important for the stability of PCID2 in the cytoplasm and affects mRNA transport (Glukhova2021PCID2).

PCID2 also forms a stable interaction with DSS1, involving hydrophobic and ionic interactions, which enhances the conformational stability of PCID2 (Ellisdon2012Structural; Liu2015Conformational).
