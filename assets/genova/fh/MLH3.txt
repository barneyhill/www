# MLH3

## Overview
The MLH3 gene encodes the protein mutL homolog 3, which is a member of the MutL family of proteins involved in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination. As an endonuclease, MLH3 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the resolution of Holliday junctions during homologous recombination and facilitating crossover formation during meiosis. The protein forms a heterodimer with MLH1, known as the MutLγ complex, which is essential for its function in DNA repair processes. MLH3's interactions with other proteins, such as EXO1 and the MSH4-MSH5 complex, further enhance its nuclease activity, underscoring its importance in genomic integrity. Mutations in MLH3 have been linked to various cancers, including Lynch syndrome, and conditions such as male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance (Cannavo2020Regulation; Rahman2020Genetic; Nawaz2021A).

## Structure
The MLH3 protein is a member of the MutL family and plays a crucial role in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination. It contains several conserved domains, including a predicted ATPase motif in the N-terminal region and an MLH1 interaction domain in the C-terminal region (Lipkin2000MLH3:). The endonuclease domain of MLH3 is characterized by a conserved metal-binding motif, DQHA(X)2E(X)4E, which is essential for its function in resolving double Holliday junctions into crossovers during meiosis (Toledo2019A; Kadyrova2020Human).

MLH3 forms a heterodimer with MLH1, known as MutLγ, which is critical for its function in crossover formation (Toledo2019A). The interaction between MLH3 and MLH1 is facilitated by the C-terminal region of MLH3, which encodes the MLH1 interaction domain (Lipkin2000MLH3:). The protein's structure is maintained even when mutations occur in the endonuclease domain, as these do not affect the stability of the MLH3 protein or its interaction with MLH1 (Toledo2019A; Nishant2008A).

MLH3 also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that may lack certain structural features, such as a predicted amphipathic helix in the MLH1 interaction domain (Lipkin2000MLH3:).

## Function
The MLH3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes, particularly in homologous recombination (HR) and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In human somatic cells, MLH3, along with PMS2, is involved in the resolution of Holliday junctions (HJs), which are critical intermediates in HR. This function is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), contributing to genomic stability and preventing carcinogenesis (Rahman2020Genetic). MLH3 acts as an endonuclease, facilitating the separation of HJs during HR, a process that is independent of MLH1, another MMR protein (Rahman2020Genetic).

In meiosis, MLH3 forms a heterodimer with MLH1, known as MutLγ, which is crucial for processing meiotic recombination intermediates into crossovers. This activity is vital for proper chromosome segregation and genetic diversity, as it ensures the correct disjunction of homologous chromosomes (Cannavo2020Regulation). The MLH1-MLH3 complex is an ATP-stimulated endonuclease, with ATP hydrolysis enhancing its DNA cleavage activity, which is essential for crossover designation during meiosis (Cannavo2020Regulation). These molecular activities underscore MLH3's role in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential tumor suppressor functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MLH3 gene have been implicated in various cancers and conditions due to its role in DNA mismatch repair. In hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, MLH3 mutations are less common than those in other mismatch repair genes, but they still contribute to cancer susceptibility. Mice deficient in MLH3 exhibit increased microsatellite instability and a higher risk of gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal tumors, such as lymphomas and basal cell carcinoma of the skin (Chen2005Contributions). 

In colorectal cancer, somatic mutations in MLH3 have been identified in 25% of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Lipkin2001Germline). Additionally, a biallelic nonsense variant in MLH3 has been linked to a novel polyposis syndrome characterized by chromosomal instability rather than the typical microsatellite instability seen in Lynch syndrome (Olkinuora2019Biallelic).

MLH3 mutations have also been associated with male infertility, specifically severe oligozoospermia, due to their impact on spermatogenesis (Nawaz2021A). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of MLH3 mutations, affecting both cancer susceptibility and reproductive health.

## Interactions
MLH3 interacts with MLH1 to form the MutLγ complex, which plays a role in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination. This complex is involved in processing meiotic recombination intermediates into crossovers, with its activity being stimulated by the MSH4-MSH5 (MutSγ) complex. MutSγ binds to branched recombination intermediates and stabilizes the MutLγ complex at joint molecule structures, enhancing DNA cleavage activity (Cannavo2020Regulation).

The MLH1-MLH3 complex also interacts with EXO1, a protein that promotes its nuclease activity, but only in the presence of MSH4-MSH5. This interaction is specific to human proteins, as yeast Exo1(DA) cannot substitute for human EXO1(DA) (Cannavo2020Regulation). Additionally, the RFC-PCNA complex enhances the nuclease activity of MutLγ, with PCNA directly interacting with MLH3 and stimulating its endonuclease activity in conjunction with MSH4-MSH5 and EXO1 (Cannavo2020Regulation; Furman2020Expanded).

MLH3 also forms heterodimers with MLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2, interacting through specific amino acid residues. These interactions are crucial for the DNA mismatch repair system, which maintains genomic stability by correcting base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops (Kondo2001The).
