# LAT2

## Overview
LAT2, or linker for activation of T cells family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. The LAT2 protein is a component of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter complex 4F2hc-LAT2, where it functions as the light chain responsible for substrate transport. This protein is characterized by its hydrophobic nature and the presence of 12 transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role as a transmembrane transporter (Jeckelmann2019Volta; Jeckelmann2020SubNanometer). Unlike its glycosylated heavy chain partner 4F2hc, LAT2 is not glycosylated, but it is linked to 4F2hc via a conserved disulfide bridge, ensuring the stability and proper localization of the transporter complex to the plasma membrane (Jeckelmann2019Volta). The LAT2 protein is crucial for amino acid transport and has been implicated in various human diseases, including age-related hearing loss and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Jeckelmann2019Volta).

## Structure
The LAT2 protein, part of the human heterodimeric amino acid transporter 4F2hc-LAT2, is a light chain responsible for catalyzing substrate transport. It is highly hydrophobic and predicted to contain 12 transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic N-and C-termini (Jeckelmann2019Volta; Jeckelmann2020SubNanometer). LAT2 is not glycosylated, unlike its heavy chain counterpart 4F2hc, which is a type II membrane N-glycoprotein (Jeckelmann2020SubNanometer). The LAT2 protein is linked to the 4F2hc subunit by a conserved disulfide bridge, which stabilizes the heterodimeric complex and ensures its correct trafficking to the plasma membrane (Jeckelmann2019Volta).

The structure of LAT2 includes a substrate binding pocket characterized by residues involved in hydrogen-bond formation or van der Waals interactions, located in transmembrane helices TM1, TM3, and TM6 (Jeckelmann2022Structure). Specific residues such as I53, the G55-S56-G57 motif, N134, G246, and F243 play crucial roles in substrate recognition and binding (Jeckelmann2022Structure). The LAT2 protein's function and structure are significant due to its association with various human diseases, including age-related hearing loss and cancer (Jeckelmann2019Volta).
