# LRRC15

## Overview
LRRC15 is a gene that encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 15 protein, a transmembrane protein characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in mediating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling. The LRRC15 protein is part of the LRR Tollkin subfamily and is highly conserved across mammalian species, indicating its significant role in immune response and viral infection (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed; Shilts2021LRRC15). Functionally, LRRC15 is involved in osteogenic differentiation and immune responses, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2, where it acts as a receptor for the virus's spike protein, although it does not facilitate viral entry (Wang2018LRRC15; Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed). The gene's expression is associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer and osteoarthritis, where it influences disease progression and prognosis (Singh2021Transcriptomic; Cui2020Expression).

## Structure
The LRRC15 protein is a transmembrane protein characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. It consists of 581 amino acids and includes 15 extracellular LRRs, a single transmembrane domain, and a short 22 amino acid intracellular domain (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed). The LRR domains contribute to the protein's secondary structure, typically forming alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling.

LRRC15 belongs to the LRR Tollkin subfamily, which includes TLR1-13, and is closely related to the platelet von Willebrand factor receptor subunit Glycoprotein V (GP5) (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed). The protein is highly conserved among mammals, suggesting a significant role in viral infection and immune response (Shilts2021LRRC15).

There are two reported isoforms of LRRC15: LRRC15_1 and LRRC15_2. LRRC15_1 has six additional amino acids at the N-terminus compared to LRRC15_2 (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed). These isoforms can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, enhancing spike binding in cells, although they do not mediate viral entry (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed). The protein's transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic cysteine-rich region may be necessary for its function, as indicated by difficulties in producing a functional truncated version (Shilts2021LRRC15).

## Function
LRRC15 (leucine-rich repeat containing 15) is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of bone formation and immune response. In mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), LRRC15 is crucial for osteogenic differentiation, a process essential for bone formation and repair. It acts as a positive regulator by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, specifically influencing the translocation of the p65 subunit, which is critical for the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (Wang2018LRRC15).

LRRC15 is also involved in the immune response, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It functions as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, although it does not facilitate viral entry. Instead, LRRC15 helps control viral load by sequestering the virus and enhancing antiviral transcriptional programs. It is expressed in fibroblasts and is associated with the regulation of collagen production and antiviral factors, suggesting a role in balancing fibrosis and antiviral responses (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed).

In healthy human cells, LRRC15 is highly expressed in tissues forming important immune barriers, such as the placenta, skin, and lymphatics, indicating its role in innate immunity and tissue repair (Loo2023Fibroblastexpressed).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRRC15 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In osteosarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer, high LRRC15 expression is associated with increased metastasis, chemoresistance, and shorter 5-year survival rates. It is considered an independent predictor of poor prognosis and is linked to a worse response to cancer immunotherapy (Cui2020Expression). In ovarian cancer, elevated LRRC15 levels correlate with advanced tumor stages and poor treatment outcomes, serving as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Zhu2023LRRC).

In gliomas, including recurrent glioblastoma, LRRC15 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. It is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, which contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Tang2021Integrated; Zhu2024Evaluating). 

Beyond cancer, LRRC15 is also involved in osteoarthritis, where its expression is induced by inflammatory cytokines and is associated with cartilage damage. It plays a role in stress responses and extracellular matrix degradation, contributing to disease progression (Singh2021Transcriptomic). In osteoporosis, LRRC15 is crucial for osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, and its reduced expression is linked to impaired bone formation (Wang2018LRRC15).

## Interactions
LRRC15 is known to interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, specifically binding to its receptor-binding domain (RBD). This interaction is similar to the binding of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but LRRC15 does not facilitate viral entry. Instead, it acts as an inhibitory receptor, sequestering the virus on the cell surface and preventing its entry into cells (Song2022LRRC15; Song2021LRRC15). The binding affinity of LRRC15 to the spike protein is weaker than that of ACE2, with a dissociation constant of approximately 109 nM (Song2022LRRC15).

LRRC15 is expressed in specific cell types such as fibroblasts and lymphatic endothelial cells in the human lung. It is not co-expressed with ACE2, suggesting that it inhibits viral entry in a non-cell-autonomous manner, affecting neighboring cells rather than the cell it is expressed in (Song2022LRRC15; Song2021LRRC15). The interaction between LRRC15 and the spike protein is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, but not MERS-CoV, indicating a degree of specificity for certain coronaviruses (Song2022LRRC15; Song2021LRRC15).
