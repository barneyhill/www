# GGTA1

## Overview
The GGTA1 gene encodes the enzyme glycoprotein alpha-galactosyltransferase 1, which is responsible for the synthesis of alpha-gal epitopes in many mammals. However, in humans, GGTA1 is a pseudogene and does not produce an active enzyme, resulting in the absence of alpha-gal epitopes on human cells. This evolutionary inactivation is significant as it leads to the production of anti-Gal antibodies, which play a crucial role in immune defense by targeting alpha-gal epitopes present on certain pathogens (Galili2014Significance). The absence of alpha-gal epitopes in humans has important implications for xenotransplantation, as the presence of anti-Gal antibodies can cause hyperacute rejection of animal organs expressing these epitopes (Denning2001Deletion). Additionally, the GGTA1 gene's inactivation is considered an evolutionary adaptation that may have conferred a survival advantage by enhancing resistance to alpha-gal-positive pathogens (Koike2007Functionally).

## Function
The GGTA1 gene, also known as glycoprotein alpha-galactosyltransferase 1, is inactive in humans and does not produce the enzyme responsible for synthesizing alpha-gal epitopes. In other mammals, this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of galactose to N-acetyllactosamine residues on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans within the Golgi apparatus, forming alpha-gal epitopes on cell surfaces (Galili2014Significance). These epitopes are carbohydrate structures that play a role in cell-cell interactions and immune recognition.

In humans, the GGTA1 gene is a pseudogene due to evolutionary frameshift mutations that introduced premature stop codons, leading to the loss of the enzyme's catalytic activity (Galili2014Significance). As a result, humans lack alpha-gal epitopes on their cells and instead produce anti-Gal antibodies, which target alpha-gal epitopes found on pathogens. This absence of alpha-gal epitopes and the presence of anti-Gal antibodies are thought to provide a selective advantage by protecting against pathogens that utilize these epitopes as docking sites for infection (Galili2014Significance). The inactivation of the GGTA1 gene is considered an evolutionary adaptation that has significant implications for immune response and xenotransplantation (Galili2014Significance).

## Clinical Significance
The GGTA1 gene, which encodes the enzyme α1,3-galactosyltransferase, is clinically significant due to its role in the synthesis of the αGal epitope. In humans, the GGTA1 gene is inactive, resulting in the absence of αGal epitopes and the production of anti-αGal antibodies. This has implications for xenotransplantation, as the presence of these antibodies can lead to hyperacute rejection of animal organs expressing αGal epitopes (Denning2001Deletion). The deletion of the GGTA1 gene in donor animals, such as sheep, is being explored to mitigate this rejection risk (Denning2001Deletion).

Alterations in the expression of GGTA1 have also been linked to multiple sclerosis (MS). A study found that MS patients have a decreased abundance of the enzyme associated with the GGTA1 gene in their gut microbiota, correlating with lower levels of circulating anti-α1,3-Gal IgG antibodies compared to healthy individuals. This suggests that changes in GGTA1 expression and gut microbiota composition may be a novel environmental risk factor for MS (Montassier2018Are).

The evolutionary inactivation of GGTA1 in catarrhine primates, including humans, may have provided a survival advantage by enhancing resistance to αGal-positive pathogens through the production of anti-αGal antibodies (Koike2007Functionally).
