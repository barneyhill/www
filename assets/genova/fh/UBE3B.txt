# UBE3B

## Overview
UBE3B is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin protein ligase E3B, a member of the HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. UBE3B is particularly significant in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, as it is associated with mitochondria and influences mitochondrial morphology and dynamics. The protein's activity is regulated by its interaction with calmodulin, a calcium sensor, which modulates its ubiquitylation activity in response to cellular stress. UBE3B is also involved in metabolic pathways in the central nervous system, where it affects synaptic function and dendritic branching. Mutations in the UBE3B gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome and blepharophimosis-ptosis-intellectual disability syndrome, highlighting its critical role in normal development and cellular function (BaselVanagaite2012Deficiency; Braganza2017UBE3B; Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular).

## Structure
The UBE3B protein is a member of the HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a catalytic cysteine essential for its ubiquitylation activity (Braganza2017UBE3B). The protein structure includes a substrate-binding domain and a calmodulin-binding IQ motif at the N-terminus, and a HECT domain at the C-terminus (Braganza2017UBE3B). The HECT domain is divided into two lobes: the N-lobe, which binds E2 enzymes, and the C-lobe, which contains the catalytic cysteine that forms a covalent thioester bond with ubiquitin (Braganza2017UBE3B).

UBE3B undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two major isoforms. The full-length isoform, UBE3B_v1, includes the HECT domain and is functional as an E3 ligase. In contrast, UBE3B_v2 lacks the HECT domain due to an in-frame stop codon introduced by an additional exon, rendering it nonfunctional (Gong2003Characterization). The protein also interacts with calmodulin through its IQ motif, a feature that regulates its activity in a calcium-dependent manner (Braganza2017UBE3B). The human UBE3B protein shares high sequence identity with its mouse and chick counterparts, particularly in the HECT domain, indicating a conserved structure across species (Gong2003Characterization).

## Function
UBE3B encodes a calmodulin-regulated, mitochondrion-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. It is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation. This process is crucial for protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair (Braganza2017UBE3B).

UBE3B is associated with mitochondria, where it influences mitochondrial morphology and function. Knockdown of UBE3B leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial volume, which correlates with reduced cellular survival. This suggests that UBE3B is involved in modulating mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics and may play a role in stress-induced mitophagy or apoptosis (Braganza2017UBE3B).

The protein's activity is regulated by its interaction with calmodulin, a calcium sensor. Calmodulin binding inhibits UBE3B's ubiquitylation activity, and upon mitochondrial stress, increased calcium levels lead to the release of calmodulin, enhancing UBE3B's activity to tag damaged mitochondrial proteins for degradation (Braganza2017UBE3B).

UBE3B is also involved in metabolic pathways, particularly in the central nervous system, where it regulates dendritic branching and synaptic function, maintaining the balance of NMDA and AMPA receptors at synapses (Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBE3B gene are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS) and blepharophimosis-ptosis-intellectual disability (BPID) syndrome. KOS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, and growth retardation. It is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in UBE3B, which lead to a loss of its ubiquitin ligase activity, crucial for protein turnover and signaling (Flex2013Loss; Pedurupillay2015Kaufman). Clinical features of KOS include ocular anomalies, hypotonia, and metabolic disturbances such as hypocholesterolemia (Cheon2019The; Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular).

BPID syndrome, also resulting from UBE3B mutations, shares overlapping features with KOS, including intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms. The mutations often affect the HECT domain of the protein, impairing its enzymatic function (BaselVanagaite2012Deficiency). Mouse models with disrupted UBE3B expression have shown reduced viability, microcephaly, and altered cholesterol metabolism, mirroring human phenotypes (BaselVanagaite2012Deficiency). These findings underscore the critical role of UBE3B in normal development and its deficiency in the pathogenesis of these syndromes.

## Interactions
UBE3B is a calmodulin-regulated, mitochondrion-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with calmodulin through its N-terminal isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) motif, a unique feature among E3 ubiquitin ligases. This interaction is calcium-dependent, and deletion of the IQ motif disrupts calmodulin binding, leading to increased ubiquitylation activity of UBE3B (Braganza2017UBE3B). 

UBE3B also interacts with the E2 enzyme UBCH3 to catalyze the ubiquitination of the MYC protein, a process that is inhibited by TRIB3. This interaction is crucial for MYC degradation, with UBE3B overexpression leading to increased MYC ubiquitination and decreased stability (Li2020TRIB3). 

In breast cancer, UBE3B is a substrate of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, which promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is significant for suppressing breast tumor growth and metastasis, with VHL directly binding to UBE3B via its β-domain (Wang2024VHL). 

UBE3B's interactions extend to the regulation of synapse number through the ubiquitination of Ppp3cc, a subunit of protein phosphatase 2B, affecting synaptic transmission and potentially contributing to cognitive disorders (Ambrozkiewicz2019The).
