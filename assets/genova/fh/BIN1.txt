# BIN1

## Overview
The BIN1 gene encodes the protein bridging integrator 1, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including membrane dynamics, endocytosis, and cytoskeletal organization. Bridging integrator 1 is categorized as a BAR domain-containing protein, characterized by its ability to bind and induce membrane curvature through its N-terminal BAR domain and facilitate protein-protein interactions via its C-terminal SH3 domain (Casal2006The; Prokic2014Amphiphysin). The protein is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing it to perform tissue-specific functions, such as T-tubule formation in muscle cells and synaptic vesicle regulation in neurons (Sudwarts2022BIN1; Prokic2014Amphiphysin). BIN1 is implicated in several diseases, including centronuclear myopathy and Alzheimer's disease, where its altered expression or mutations can disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Tan2013Bridging; Prokic2014Amphiphysin).

## Structure
The BIN1 protein, also known as bridging integrator 1, is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes an N-terminal BAR domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. The BAR domain is a crescent-shaped, α-helical structure that forms a symmetric homodimer, crucial for membrane binding and curvature generation. It operates by dimerizing and interacting with lipid membranes, promoting and sensing curvature (Adam2015Structural; Casal2006The). The BAR domain's structure is stabilized by 'knobs-into-holes' packing of side chains, similar to conventional left-handed coiled-coils (Casal2006The).

The SH3 domain, present in all isoforms, binds proline-rich motifs and is characterized by a unique electrostatic potential and an extended n-Src loop (Prokic2014Amphiphysin). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, notably with dynamin, a protein involved in membrane dynamics (Hohendahl2016Structural).

BIN1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with tissue-specific functions. For instance, muscle-specific isoforms include the phosphoinositide (PI) binding motif, which increases BIN1's affinity for negatively charged lipids and is crucial for T-tubule formation (Hohendahl2016Structural; Prokic2014Amphiphysin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate BIN1's activity and interactions (Prokic2014Amphiphysin).

## Function
BIN1 (bridging integrator 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including membrane dynamics, endocytosis, and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, BIN1 plays a crucial role in muscle cell differentiation by promoting myotube formation and upregulating myosin heavy chain expression. It acts as a growth inhibitor, balancing cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in muscle cells (WechslerReya1998A).

In neurons, BIN1 is localized to presynaptic terminals, where it regulates synaptic vesicle dynamics, contributing to excitatory neurotransmission. The protein contains a Clathrin-Associated Protein binding region, allowing it to interact with clathrin and its adaptor protein AP-2, which is essential for endocytosis (Sudwarts2022BIN1). BIN1 is also involved in the structural organization of axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier in the brain, suggesting a role in axonal function (Butler1997Amphiphysin).

Additionally, BIN1 is expressed in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments in various tissues, with its expression pattern linked to cell differentiation and apoptosis. In the brain, BIN1 shows strong nuclear staining in certain neuronal cells, indicating a potential nuclear-based function (DuHadaway2002Immunohistochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the BIN1 gene are linked to several diseases. In centronuclear myopathy (CNM), germline mutations in BIN1 cause autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (ARCNM), characterized by nonprogressive muscle weakness from birth or infancy. These mutations affect BIN1's membrane tubulation properties and its interaction with dynamin 2, leading to muscle fiber abnormalities (Prokic2014Amphiphysin). Adult-onset autosomal dominant CNM is also associated with BIN1 mutations, which lead to structural changes in muscle fibers (Böhm2014Adultonset).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BIN1 is a significant genetic risk factor, second only to apolipoprotein E (APOE). Altered BIN1 expression is linked to tau pathology, a hallmark of AD, and may influence tau neurotoxicity. BIN1's role in endocytosis and inflammation is also implicated in AD pathogenesis (Tan2013Bridging). BIN1 expression levels in the brain are altered in AD, with neuronal BIN1 levels decreasing and ubiquitous BIN1 levels increasing, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for AD diagnosis (Gao2020The).

In cancer, downregulation of BIN1 is associated with various types, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers. BIN1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting MYC-dependent transformation and tumor growth. Its downregulation may contribute to malignant development and increased resistance to chemotherapy (Prokic2014Amphiphysin).

## Interactions
BIN1 (bridging integrator 1) is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. The SH3 domain of BIN1 is known for its promiscuous binding capabilities, interacting with numerous proteins through proline-rich motifs (PRMs). It has a preference for class 2 PxxP motifs, similar to the SH3 domains of AMPH and ARHGEF7, and these interactions often involve larger protein regions beyond the core motifs (Zambo2024Uncovering).

BIN1 interacts with dynamin 2 (DNM2), a critical partner in membrane fission during vesicle scission and T-tubule formation in muscle cells. This interaction is of high affinity and is significant in the context of centronuclear myopathy (CNM) (Zambo2024Uncovering). BIN1 also interacts with the c-Myc protein, where its SH3 domain binds to a class II SH3-binding motif in c-Myc, affecting transcriptional activity (PinedaLucena2005A).

BIN1's interaction with E2F1, a nuclear protein, acts as a corepressor, inhibiting E2F1-dependent transactivation of the ATM promoter. This interaction is crucial for BIN1's role in suppressing DNA damage responses (Folk2019Loss). BIN1 also associates with proteins involved in neuromuscular disorders, such as ATXN2, DNMT1, and SMCHD1, indicating its broad interaction network (Zambo2024Uncovering).
