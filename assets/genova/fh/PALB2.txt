# PALB2

## Overview
PALB2 (Partner and Localizer of BRCA2) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for DNA repair processes, particularly through its role in homologous recombination. The PALB2 protein acts as a molecular bridge between BRCA1 and BRCA2, facilitating their interaction and function at sites of DNA damage. It is characterized by a coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus, which mediates interaction with BRCA1, and a WD40-type beta-propeller domain at the C-terminus, which binds to BRCA2. These interactions are essential for the recruitment of repair proteins to DNA double-strand breaks, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Buisson2012PALB2; Zhang2009PALB2). Mutations in the PALB2 gene are associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer predisposition and progression (Yang2020Cancer; Hu2020Germline).

## Structure
The PALB2 protein, encoded by the PALB2 gene, is integral to DNA repair processes, particularly through its interactions with BRCA1 and BRCA2. The primary structure of PALB2 consists of 1186 amino acids, with several key domains contributing to its function (Buisson2012PALB2). The N-terminal region contains a coiled-coil domain, crucial for homodimerization and interaction with BRCA1. This domain spans the first 40 amino acids and forms a leucine zipper structure through antiparallel coiled-coil interactions (Buisson2012PALB2; Song2018Antiparallel).

The tertiary structure of PALB2 includes a carboxy-terminal WD40-type beta-propeller domain, which facilitates binding with the N-terminus of BRCA2. This domain is characterized by a seven-bladed structure, essential for protein-protein interactions (Oliver2009Structural). The interaction between PALB2 and BRCA2 is unique, involving a pocket on the opposite face of the structure compared to typical WD40-peptide interactions (Oliver2009Structural).

PALB2 also interacts with MRG15 through a region containing the FxLP motif, which is critical for its role in chromosome maintenance and tumorigenesis (Redington2021Structural). Mutations in PALB2, such as those affecting the coiled-coil domain, can disrupt its dimerization and impair DNA repair functions (Song2018Antiparallel).

## Function
PALB2 (Partner and Localizer of BRCA2) is a crucial protein in the DNA damage response and repair processes in healthy human cells. It acts as a linker between BRCA1 and BRCA2, two key proteins involved in DNA repair, particularly through homologous recombination (Xia2006Control; Zhang2009PALB2). PALB2 facilitates the proper localization and function of BRCA2 at sites of DNA double-strand breaks, ensuring efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Xia2006Control; Pauty2014Exploring).

PALB2 is essential for the DNA-damage-induced focus formation of BRCA2, although it does not affect BRCA1 in the same way, suggesting that BRCA1 may act as an upstream regulator of PALB2 and BRCA2 (Zhang2009PALB2). The interaction between PALB2 and BRCA1 is DNA-damage independent and occurs constitutively, highlighting PALB2's role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the homologous recombination repair process (Zhang2009PALB2).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, PALB2 is involved in the regulation of RAD51 activity, which is crucial for the protection and restart of stalled replication forks during DNA replication stress (Nikkilä2013Heterozygous). This function is critical for preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to tumor development (Nikkilä2013Heterozygous). PALB2's interaction with BRCA2 is vital for the mobilization of RAD51, a protein essential for homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair (Xia2006Control).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PALB2 gene are associated with an increased risk of several cancers, most notably breast cancer. Germline pathogenic variants in PALB2 significantly elevate the risk of breast cancer, with a relative risk (RR) of 7.18 and an absolute risk of 53% by age 80 (Yang2020Cancer). These mutations also increase the risk of ovarian cancer (RR of 2.91) and pancreatic cancer (RR of 2.37) (Yang2020Cancer). Male breast cancer is also linked to PALB2 mutations, with a relative risk of 7.34 (Yang2020Cancer).

PALB2 mutations are particularly significant in familial breast cancer cases, where they are often accompanied by other mutations such as BRCA1 and TP53 (Hu2020Germline). The gene's role in DNA repair through homologous recombination is compromised by these mutations, leading to genomic instability and increased cancer risk (Nepomuceno2017The).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PALB2 upregulation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Ge2021PALB2). The gene's expression in PDAC tissues is higher compared to normal tissues, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Ge2021PALB2).

## Interactions
PALB2 interacts with several key proteins involved in DNA damage repair, particularly in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. It forms a complex with BRCA1 and BRCA2, acting as a crucial linker between these two proteins. The interaction with BRCA1 is mediated by the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of PALB2, while the interaction with BRCA2 involves the C-terminal WD40 repeats (Zhang2009PALB2; Zhang2009PALB2a). These interactions are essential for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to DNA damage sites, facilitating HR (Zhang2009PALB2; Zhang2009PALB2a).

PALB2 also interacts with RNF168, a protein involved in chromatin ubiquitylation, through its WD40 domain. This interaction is crucial for PALB2's recruitment to DNA damage sites and its role in HR (Luijsterburg2017A). Additionally, PALB2 binds to MRG15, which aids in its recruitment to double-strand break sites, promoting the accumulation of BRCA2 and RAD51 (Bleuyard2011ChAM).

Mutations in PALB2, such as L21P and L24P, can disrupt its interaction with BRCA1, affecting its localization to nuclear foci and impairing DNA repair processes (Zhang2009PALB2a). These interactions highlight PALB2's critical role in maintaining genomic stability.
