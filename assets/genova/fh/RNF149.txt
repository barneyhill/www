# RNF149

## Overview
RNF149 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 149, which is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a category of enzymes that play a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging proteins for degradation. The RNF149 protein is a type I transmembrane protein, featuring a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a cytosolic RING domain, which collectively facilitate its involvement in protein-protein interactions and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Hong2012Ring; Legesse2023The; Manku2022Role). RNF149 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway through the ubiquitination of wild-type BRAF and the maintenance of protein quality control via the pre-emptive ER-associated quality control (pEQC) pathway (Hong2012Ring; Legesse2023The). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where alterations in RNF149 can influence tumor progression and treatment resistance (Wu2023Spatiotemporal; Guo2023RNF149).

## Structure
RNF149 is a protein characterized by a RING finger domain, which is a specialized zinc finger that binds two zinc atoms and is involved in mediating protein-protein interactions (Hong2012Ring). The protein is composed of 400 amino acids and is located on chromosome 2 (2q11.2) (Zhu2023RNF149; Hong2012Ring). RNF149 contains several distinct domains, including a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a cytosolic RING domain (Legesse2023The; Manku2022Role). The PA domain is involved in protein interactions and is necessary for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization (Manku2022Role).

The RING domain is crucial for the protein's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins such as wild-type BRAF (Hong2012Ring). RNF149 is a type I transmembrane protein, with an N-terminal signal peptide and a short helical membrane stretch (Legesse2023The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various substrates and components of the pre-emptive ER-associated quality control (pEQC) pathway (Legesse2023The). RNF149 also exists in different splice variant isoforms, such as VA1 and VA2, which express different domains and localize to different cellular compartments (Manku2022Role).

## Function
RNF149 is a RING finger domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, RNF149 specifically targets wild-type BRAF, a member of the RAF kinase family involved in cell growth and signaling pathways, for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This activity helps regulate the stability and turnover of wild-type BRAF, thereby modulating the MAPK signaling pathway and affecting cell growth and survival (Hong2012Ring).

RNF149 is also involved in pre-emptive quality control (pEQC) processes, where it ubiquitinates mislocalized proteins that fail to translocate into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This function is essential for maintaining protein quality control and preventing ER stress by ensuring the degradation of these mislocalized proteins via the proteasome (Legesse2023The). RNF149's activity is linked to its localization in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with components of the translocation machinery and the ribosome quality control system, further highlighting its role in cellular protein homeostasis (Legesse2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RNF149 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF149 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and increased malignancy. Its overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to HCC progression. RNF149's role in creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment further complicates treatment, as it is associated with increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, potentially leading to poor responses to immunotherapy (Guo2023RNF149).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RNF149 is linked to drug resistance and immune evasion. High levels of RNF149 expression are associated with poor prognosis and reduced effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents, such as cytarabine. This is partly due to its role in suppressing CD8+ T cell activity, which is crucial for anti-tumor responses, leading to immune evasion by AML cells (Wu2023Spatiotemporal).

RNF149 is also involved in pre-emptive quality control processes related to the ubiquitination of mislocalized ER proteins. Impairment in these processes, such as through RNF149 knockout, can lead to pathological conditions like myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (Legesse2023The).

## Interactions
RNF149, a RING finger protein, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and participates in various protein interactions. It interacts with PHLPP2, leading to its degradation and subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is associated with cisplatin resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Zhu2023RNF149). RNF149 also interacts with wild-type BRAF, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is specific to wild-type BRAF and does not occur with mutant forms like BRAF V600E (Hong2012Ring).

In the context of pre-emptive quality control (pEQC), RNF149 interacts with mislocalized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins such as VCAM-1 and IGF1-R, but not with their successfully translocated forms. It also associates with components of the translocation machinery, including the Sec61 translocon complex, and with the ribosome quality control component Listerin (Legesse2023The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RNF149 interacts with DNAJC25, promoting its degradation, which correlates with tumor progression (Guo2023RNF149). These interactions highlight RNF149's role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein quality control.
