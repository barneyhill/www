# PRND

## Overview
The PRND gene encodes the prion-like protein doppel (Dpl), which is primarily associated with male reproductive functions and has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes. Dpl is a membrane-associated protein involved in cell signaling pathways, particularly in the maturation and motility of spermatozoa, and is expressed in the male reproductive tract (Westaway2011The; AllaisBonnet2014Role). Structurally, Dpl shares similarities with the prion protein (PrP) but does not misfold into a pathogenic form, distinguishing its role from that of PrP in prion diseases (Westaway2011The). Despite its primary expression in reproductive tissues, Dpl has been studied for its interactions with PrP and other proteins, which may influence neurodegenerative conditions and male fertility (Moore1999Ataxia; Westaway2011The). Genetic variations in PRND have been linked to diseases such as sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's, highlighting its clinical significance (Schröder2001Polymorphisms; Jeong2005Polymorphism).

## Function
The PRND gene encodes the prion-like protein Doppel (Dpl), which plays a significant role in male fertility, particularly in the process of spermatogenesis. Dpl is primarily expressed in the male reproductive tract, including Sertoli cells and germ cells, and is involved in the maturation of spermatozoa during the final stages of spermiogenesis (Westaway2011The; AllaisBonnet2014Role). In humans, Dpl is detected in spermatids but not in differentiated testicular spermatozoa, although it is present on the flagella of epididymal and mature spermatozoa, suggesting a role in sperm motility and fertilization (AllaisBonnet2014Role).

Dpl is synthesized in the secretory pathway and is a membrane-associated protein, indicating its involvement in cell signaling pathways (Moore1999Ataxia). The protein's structure includes N-linked glycosylation sites and disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its stability and function (Westaway2011The). Although Dpl shares structural similarities with the prion protein (PrP), it does not misfold into a pathogenic form like PrP can (Westaway2011The). The role of Dpl in healthy human cells is primarily related to reproductive functions rather than central nervous system activities (Westaway2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the PRND gene have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). A notable polymorphism at the 3' untranslated region (UTR) +28 of the PRND gene has been associated with an increased risk of sporadic CJD in Korean populations, although this association was not observed in other populations such as the Spanish (Jeong2005Polymorphism). This polymorphism may influence gene expression or mRNA stability, potentially affecting susceptibility to the disease (Jeong2005Polymorphism).

The PRND gene encodes the doppel protein (Dpl), which shares homology with the prion protein (PrP). Overexpression of Dpl has been linked to neurodegenerative conditions, such as cerebellar neurodegeneration in PrP-knockout mice, suggesting a role for PRND in prion diseases (Jeong2005Polymorphism). In addition, polymorphisms at codon 174 of the PRND gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution from threonine to methionine, have been observed in cases of sporadic CJD and Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential predisposition factor for these conditions (Schröder2001Polymorphisms).

Alterations in PRND expression have also been studied in the context of astrocytomas, where significant differences in expression levels were found between low-grade and high-grade tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumor malignancy grading (Comincini2007Diagnostic).

## Interactions
The PRND gene encodes the prion-like protein doppel (Dpl), which participates in various interactions with other proteins. Dpl is known to interact with prion protein (PrP), although they do not coimmunoprecipitate, suggesting they localize to different membrane microdomains or rafts (Westaway2011The). Despite this, Dpl and PrP can share protein partners and occupy common membrane microdomains, indicating potential shared pathways or interactions (Westaway2011The). 

Dpl has been reported to interact with the laminin receptor protein and the human receptor for activated C-kinase 1, which may relate to its neurotoxic activities (Westaway2011The). In the context of neurodegeneration, Dpl can induce apoptosis, but this effect can be mitigated by PrP, highlighting a protective role of PrP against Dpl-induced toxicity (Westaway2011The). 

Dpl's interactions are also significant in the male reproductive system, where it is expressed in Sertoli cells and seminiferous tubules. Its expression is crucial for male fertility, and genetic ablation of Prnd results in infertility (Westaway2011The). These interactions suggest that Dpl plays a role in cellular signaling and neurodegenerative processes, potentially competing with PrP for binding to common receptors (Moore1999Ataxia).
