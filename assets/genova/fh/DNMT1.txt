# DNMT1

## Overview
DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a key enzyme involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, a crucial epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms. The protein product, DNA methyltransferase 1, is a maintenance methyltransferase that primarily targets hemimethylated DNA during replication, ensuring the faithful transmission of methylation marks to daughter strands. This enzyme plays a vital role in regulating gene expression, maintaining genomic stability, and facilitating normal cellular development and differentiation. DNMT1 is categorized as a DNA methyltransferase and is integral to transcriptional repression through its interactions with histone deacetylases and other chromatin-modifying proteins. Dysregulation of DNMT1 activity is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Vertino2002DNMT1; Egger2006Identification; Rountree2000DNMT1).

## Structure
DNMT1 is a complex enzyme with a multi-domain structure crucial for its role in DNA methylation. The protein consists of approximately 1620 amino acids and includes several functional domains. The N-terminal domain is large and regulatory, containing sequences necessary for nuclear import and replication foci association (Goll2005EUKARYOTIC). It also includes a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binding domain, a targeting sequence (TS domain), and a zinc finger domain (CXXC) (Qin2011Regulation). The N-terminal domain interacts with the C-terminal catalytic domain, which is responsible for the enzyme's methylation activity (Qin2011Regulation).

The catalytic C-terminal domain includes an AdoMet-binding domain, a target base-binding cavity, and a target sequence recognition domain (Svedružić2011Dnmt1). DNMT1 also contains two bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domains involved in chromatin regulation (Goll2005EUKARYOTIC). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which regulate its activity and stability (Cheng2015Molecular; Svedružić2011Dnmt1).

DNMT1 interacts with various proteins, including USP7, which stabilizes it through deubiquitination (Cheng2015Molecular). The enzyme's structure allows for dynamic interactions and conformational changes necessary for its function in DNA methylation maintenance.

## Function
DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is a crucial enzyme in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in healthy human cells. It primarily acts on hemimethylated DNA during DNA replication, ensuring the transfer of methyl groups to the new DNA strand, which is essential for the propagation of epigenetic information across cell generations (Vertino2002DNMT1; Egger2006Identification). DNMT1 is a component of the DNA synthesome, a multiprotein complex involved in DNA replication, and it co-localizes with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) during the S-phase of the cell cycle, facilitating its processivity and tethering to newly synthesized DNA (Vertino2002DNMT1).

In addition to its role in DNA methylation, DNMT1 is involved in transcriptional repression by forming complexes with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other co-repressors, contributing to the maintenance of transcriptionally repressive chromatin states (Rountree2000DNMT1). This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression, which are vital for normal cellular function and development (Egger2006Identification). DNMT1's function is particularly important in self-renewing tissues, where it helps maintain progenitor cell states by suppressing premature differentiation and sustaining proliferation (Sen2010DNMT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNMT1 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, mutations in exon 20 are associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy with dementia and hearing loss type 1E (HSN1E), while mutations in exon 21 are linked to autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN) (Zheng2018Identification; Maresca2015Dna). These mutations often occur in the replication foci-targeting sequence (RFTS) domain, which is crucial for DNMT1's chromatin binding and enzymatic activity (Norvil2019Effect; Hamidi2015Genetic).

The mutations can lead to global hypomethylation and site-specific hypermethylation, affecting gene expression in neural cells (Hamidi2015Genetic). In some cases, these mutations result in the mislocalization of DNMT1 to the cytosol, where it forms aggregates known as aggresomes, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration (Baets2015Defects). The A554V mutation in the RFTS domain, for example, disrupts normal autoinhibition, leading to a hyperactive enzyme state and increased DNA methylation activity, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Switzer2023DiseaseAssociated).

DNMT1 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where defects in nuclear transport are associated with the condition (Hamidi2015Genetic). In cancer, DNMT1 overexpression is linked to hypermethylation processes, contributing to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene silencing (Benetatos2016On).

## Interactions
DNMT1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation. It associates with the replication machinery through its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which enhances its methylation activity (Vertino2002DNMT1). DNMT1 also interacts with methyl-CpG binding proteins such as MeCP2 and MBD2/3, which form complexes with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, linking DNA hypermethylation with histone hypoacetylation (Qin2011Regulation).

The protein forms a complex with HDAC2 and DMAP1, co-localizing at replication foci during the S phase of the cell cycle. This complex is involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Rountree2000DNMT1). DNMT1 also interacts with UHRF1, an essential co-factor for maintenance DNA methylation, which binds hemimethylated DNA and recruits DNMT1 to these sites (Qin2011Regulation).

In cancer, DNMT1's interaction with tumor suppressor proteins such as p53 is significant, as p53 mutations correlate with DNMT1 overexpression, leading to DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional repression (Qin2011Regulation). DNMT1 also interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins like LSH and BAZ2A, and forms complexes with Polycomb group proteins EZH2 and EED, which are involved in histone methylation (Qin2011Regulation).
