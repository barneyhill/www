# SCIMP

## Overview
SCIMP (SLP adaptor and CSK interacting membrane protein) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in immune signaling, particularly within macrophages. The SCIMP protein is a member of the palmitoylated transmembrane adaptor protein (pTRAP) family and plays a crucial role in the signaling pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR4. It functions as a scaffold for various signaling molecules, including Src family kinases, facilitating the phosphorylation and activation of TLRs upon stimulation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Luo2017SCIMP; Luo2019SCIMP). SCIMP is localized in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and is associated with MHCII molecules, indicating its involvement in antigen presentation and MHCII signaling (Stepanek2014Palmitoylated). The protein's activity is essential for the regulation of immune responses, contributing to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the organism's ability to mount effective defenses against pathogens (Luo2019SCIMP; Lucas2021SCIMP).

## Structure
SCIMP (SLP adaptor and CSK interacting membrane protein) is a transmembrane adaptor protein that is part of the palmitoylated transmembrane adaptor protein (pTRAP) family. It features a short extracellular domain and a long intracellular domain, which contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a proline-rich domain (PRD) (Luo2019Signalling). The intracellular domain is crucial for its function, as it serves as a scaffold for the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn, facilitating signaling through phosphorylation (Luo2019Signalling). SCIMP is palmitoylated at two sites, which aids in its membrane association (Luo2019Signalling).

The protein is involved in TLR signaling, particularly with TLR4, and is localized on intracellular membranes and the macrophage plasma membrane, especially in dynamic cell-surface projections like filopodia and membrane ruffles (Luo2019Signalling). SCIMP interacts with TLR4 through a unique TIR-non-TIR interaction, which is distinct from other TLR adaptors that use homotypic TIR-TIR interactions (Luo2019Signalling). The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, such as Y96, enhances its binding affinity to TLR4, which is crucial for its role in pro-inflammatory signaling (Luo2017SCIMP).

## Function
SCIMP (SLP adaptor and CSK interacting membrane protein) is a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a significant role in immune signaling, particularly in macrophages. It functions as a scaffold for various signaling molecules, including Src family kinases like Lyn, and is involved in the phosphorylation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR4, upon activation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Luo2017SCIMP; Luo2019SCIMP). SCIMP facilitates the recruitment of effectors like Grb2, Csk, and SLP65, which are crucial for the propagation of downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-κB (Luo2019Signalling; Lucas2021SCIMP).

SCIMP is localized in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and is associated with MHCII molecules, suggesting a role in antigen presentation and MHCII signaling (Stepanek2014Palmitoylated). It is involved in the selective production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-12p40, which are essential for immune responses and inflammation (Luo2017SCIMP; Lucas2021SCIMP). SCIMP's activity is crucial for the regulation of immune responses, contributing to the organism's ability to mount effective defenses against pathogens and modulate inflammation (Luo2019SCIMP; Lucas2021SCIMP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SCIMP gene have been linked to several immune-related diseases. SCIMP is a key regulator in Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, and its dysregulation is associated with conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Luo2019Signalling; Lucas2021SCIMP). Genome-wide association studies have identified SCIMP as one of the top genes with enriched epigenomic elements in the promoter regions of SLE and RA-associated gene sets, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of SCIMP may be altered in these autoimmune diseases (Luo2019Signalling).

In the context of pneumonia, SCIMP is secreted in exosomes and plays a significant role in immune cell communication, particularly between macrophages and neutrophils. Elevated levels of SCIMP exosomes in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pneumonia patients indicate its involvement in the disease. SCIMP's chemotactic activity, which attracts neutrophils, is crucial for bacterial clearance and survival in acute lung injury models (Pei2024Exosomal). The interaction between SCIMP and formyl peptide receptors (FPR1/2) on neutrophils is essential for its role in immune response modulation during pneumonia (Pei2024Exosomal).

## Interactions
SCIMP (SLP adaptor and CSK interacting membrane protein) is a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a significant role in the signaling pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in macrophages. It interacts with multiple proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for immune signaling. SCIMP directly binds to the cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR4, a key interaction that is enhanced by phosphorylation at the tyrosine residue Y96. This phosphorylation is likely mediated by the Src family kinase Lyn, which constitutively associates with SCIMP (Luo2017SCIMP).

SCIMP also serves as a scaffold for various signaling molecules, including Lyn, Grb2, Csk, and SLP65, facilitating their recruitment to TLRs upon activation. This scaffolding function is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of TLR4, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-12p40 (Luo2019SCIMP). In addition to TLR4, SCIMP interacts with other TLRs, such as TLR2 and TLR3, upon stimulation with specific agonists, indicating its role as a universal adaptor in TLR signaling pathways (Luo2019SCIMP).

SCIMP also recruits Erk1/2, part of the MAPK signaling pathway, to specific membrane domains like ruffles and macropinosomes, which are crucial for pro-inflammatory signaling in TLR4-activated macrophages (Lucas2021SCIMP).
