# CACNA2D2

## Overview
The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 2, a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the modulation of calcium ion flow across cell membranes. This protein is an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are integral to various physiological processes, including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and gene expression. The α2δ-2 subunit is involved in the trafficking and functional modulation of these channels, enhancing their expression at the plasma membrane and influencing their biophysical properties. It is predominantly expressed in the lung and testis, with moderate expression in the brain, heart, and pancreas, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Gao2000Functional; Davies2007Functional). Mutations in CACNA2D2 have been linked to several neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy and cerebellar ataxia, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Ablinger2020Neuronal; Pippucci2013A).

## Structure
The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the α2δ-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which is a glycoprotein involved in modulating calcium ion flow. The protein is composed of 1,145 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 129,343 Da (Gao2000Functional). It shares 56% amino acid sequence identity with the α2δ-1 subunit, suggesting similar structural features (Gao2000Functional). The α2δ-2 subunit is highly glycosylated, with multiple putative N-glycosylation sites, which contribute to its molecular mass and function (Klugbauer1999Molecular; Gao2000Functional).

The protein undergoes post-translational cleavage into α2 and δ components, which are disulfide-linked, indicating a quaternary structure (Klugbauer2003Calcium). The α2 domain is extracellular, while the δ domain contains a transmembrane segment anchoring the protein to the membrane (Klugbauer1999Molecular). The α2δ-2 subunit also contains a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain and a MIDAS motif, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and trafficking functions (Ablinger2020Neuronal; Davies2007Functional).

Alternative splicing of CACNA2D2 results in different isoforms, affecting its function and localization. Three splice variants have been identified, with distinct expression patterns in various tissues (Klugbauer2003Calcium; Carboni2003CACNA2D2mediated).

## Function
The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the α2δ-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are integral to calcium ion transport across cell membranes. This subunit plays a critical role in the trafficking and expression of these channels at the plasma membrane by associating with the α1 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitating their transport to the plasma membrane (Davies2007Functional). The α2δ-2 subunit enhances the peak current size of N-type calcium channels and also affects L-type and T-type channels when co-expressed with specific α1 subunits, indicating its role in modulating calcium channel activity (Gao2000Functional).

In healthy human cells, the α2δ-2 subunit is involved in increasing the maximum current density of CaV1 and CaV2 calcium channels, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and gene expression (Dolphin2012Calcium). The subunit is predominantly expressed in the lung and testis, with moderate expression in the brain, heart, and pancreas, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Gao2000Functional). The α2δ-2 subunit also influences the biophysical properties of calcium currents, including inactivation kinetics, which are essential for maintaining normal neuronal activity (Davies2007Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA2D2 gene, which encodes the α2δ-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. These mutations have been linked to epileptic encephalopathy, a severe brain disorder characterized by seizures and psychomotor impairment. Specific mutations such as p.Leu1040Pro, p.Asp991Asn, p.Pro261Leu, p.Arg593Pro, and p.Tyr162Ter have been identified in patients with this condition (Ablinger2020Neuronal; Pippucci2013A). The p.Asn432fs frameshift mutation is particularly noted for its role in epileptic encephalopathy, leading to a loss of function in the α2δ-2 subunit (Pippucci2013A).

CACNA2D2 mutations are also implicated in cerebellar ataxia, a disorder affecting coordination and balance, and have been observed in patients with cerebellar atrophy (Butler2018Epileptic). In addition, variants in CACNA2D2 have been associated with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For instance, a variant (A900T) has been found in schizophrenia patients, and other mutations have been linked to bipolar disorder (Ablinger2020Neuronal).

The α2δ-2 subunit's dysfunction due to these mutations can lead to significant neurological phenotypes, including intellectual disability, dyskinesia, and motor dysfunction (Kessi2021Calcium; Geisler2021Phenotypic). These findings underscore the critical role of CACNA2D2 in maintaining normal neuronal function and its involvement in various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the α2δ-2 subunit, which is an auxiliary component of voltage-gated calcium channels. This subunit interacts with the α1 subunit of calcium channels, enhancing their plasma membrane expression and modulating their biophysical properties, such as current density and voltage dependence (Dolphin2012Calcium; Klugbauer2003Calcium). The α2δ-2 subunit is involved in the trafficking of calcium channels, particularly CaV2.2, by associating with α1 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitating their transport to the plasma membrane (Davies2007Functional).

The α2δ-2 subunit contains a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins. This motif allows the α2δ-2 subunit to bind divalent cations, influencing its role in calcium channel function (Dolphin2012Calcium). The α2δ-2 subunit also interacts with gabapentinoid drugs, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, which bind to it and affect calcium channel trafficking and synaptogenesis (Dolphin2012Calcium). These interactions highlight the α2δ-2 subunit's role in modulating calcium channel activity and its potential as a therapeutic target.
