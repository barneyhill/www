# CCNB3

## Overview
Cyclin B3 (CCNB3) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the control of the cell cycle, particularly during meiosis and mitosis. The protein, cyclin B3, is a member of the cyclin family, which is known for its role in regulating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that drive cell cycle progression. Cyclin B3 is primarily expressed in meiotic germ cells and is crucial for the metaphase-anaphase transition, particularly in female meiosis, where it is essential for oocyte maturation and fertility (Garrido2020Cyclin; Chotiner2019Functions). The protein interacts with CDK1 and CDK2, forming complexes that activate the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a key player in cell cycle regulation (Li2019Cyclin). Mutations in the CCNB3 gene have been linked to reproductive disorders and certain cancers, such as BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas, highlighting its clinical significance (Kao2018BCORCCNB3; Wang2023Mutations).

## Function
Cyclin B3 (CCNB3) is a regulatory protein involved in cell cycle control, particularly during meiosis and mitosis. In mammals, CCNB3 is primarily expressed in meiotic germ cells and plays a crucial role in the metaphase-anaphase transition during meiosis. It associates with cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1 and CDK2, facilitating the progression of cell division by activating the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This activation is essential for the degradation of mitotic cyclins and securin, allowing the transition to anaphase (Garrido2020Cyclin; Chotiner2019Functions).

In female meiosis, CCNB3 is critical for the metaphase I to anaphase I transition in oocytes. Ccnb3-null female mice exhibit sterility due to a failure in this transition, highlighting its essential role in female fertility (Chotiner2019Functions). In mitosis, CCNB3 is involved in the regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and the stabilization of the APC/C, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (Garrido2020Cyclin; Yuan2015Cyclin).

CCNB3 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with CDKs, influencing cell cycle progression and ensuring accurate cell division (Gallant1994Identification). Its evolutionary conservation across species suggests a fundamental role in cell cycle regulation (Gallant1994Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCNB3 gene have been implicated in various reproductive and oncological conditions. In the context of female infertility, CCNB3 mutations are associated with oocyte maturation arrest, a condition that contributes to primary infertility. These mutations lead to the mislocalization of cyclin B3, affecting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity and resulting in oocyte arrest at the germinal vesicle stage. This disruption in CDK1 activity impacts the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity, causing metaphase I arrest in oocytes (Wang2023Mutations).

In addition to infertility, a biallelic variant in CCNB3 has been linked to recurrent pregnancy loss due to maternal meiosis II failure and recurrent digynic triploidy. This variant destabilizes the protein structure, leading to reproductive issues (Fatemi2020Biallelic).

CCNB3 is also involved in oncological conditions, particularly in BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas. These sarcomas are characterized by a genetic fusion between the BCOR and CCNB3 genes, resulting in overexpression of CCNB3. This fusion is significant in the classification of certain bone sarcomas and is associated with a distinct subtype of undifferentiated round cell sarcoma (Kao2018BCORCCNB3; Pierron2012A).

## Interactions
Cyclin B3 (CCNB3) interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) to form an active kinase complex that is crucial for the progression of meiosis I in oocytes. This interaction is essential for the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which facilitates the transition from metaphase to anaphase by promoting the degradation of securin and cyclin B1, thereby allowing separase activation and chromosome segregation (Li2019Cyclin; Karasu2019Cyclina). 

The phosphate-binding pocket of cyclin B3 is critical for binding phosphorylated substrates, such as XErp1/Emi2, which is necessary for its degradation during meiosis I. This interaction is facilitated by the recruitment of Plk1, leading to further phosphorylations required for XErp1 degradation (Demmig2024A). Cyclin B3 does not interact with separase, unlike cyclin B1, indicating a divergence in substrate specificity between these cyclins (Demmig2024A).

Cyclin B3 is also identified as an APC/C substrate, with its degradation being dependent on a conserved destruction box (D-box), highlighting its role in the ordered degradation of APC/C substrates during oocyte meiosis I (Karasu2018Cyclin).
