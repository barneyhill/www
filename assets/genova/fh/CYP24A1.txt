# CYP24A1

## Overview
CYP24A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1, a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of vitamin D. This enzyme plays a critical role in the catabolism of the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, by hydroxylating it to produce less active metabolites, thereby regulating vitamin D homeostasis and preventing toxicity (Petkovich2011CYP24A1; Jones201225Hydroxyvitamin). The CYP24A1 enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, skin, and bone, and is integral to maintaining calcium balance and modulating immune responses (Petkovich2011CYP24A1; Schuster2011Cytochromes). Mutations in the CYP24A1 gene are linked to idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia and have implications in certain cancers, where altered expression can affect disease prognosis (Zou2014Increased; Jones2017Genetic).

## Structure
CYP24A1 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in vitamin D metabolism. The primary structure of CYP24A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function, including a heme-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Masuda2007Generation; Annalora2010Crystal). The secondary structure of CYP24A1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets that surround a buried active site cavity, with a conserved heme-binding network and an electron-transfer protein binding site (Masuda2007Generation). 

The tertiary structure of CYP24A1 is characterized by a globular shape with a substrate binding site located above the heme group. This site is a closed cavity bounded by several secondary structures, including helices and loops, which stabilize substrate access and product egress channels (Masuda2007Generation; Annalora2010Crystal). The enzyme's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available context.

CYP24A1 also features a membrane-directed substrate access channel stabilized by a cluster of conserved aromatic amino acids, allowing for substrate diffusion from within the membrane (Annalora2010Crystal). The enzyme interacts with adrenodoxin, facilitated by basic residues, including an invariant arginine pair crucial for protein folding and catalytic function (Annalora2010Crystal).

## Function
The CYP24A1 gene encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of vitamin D. This enzyme is primarily involved in the catabolism of the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3), by catalyzing its hydroxylation at the C-24 and C-23 positions, leading to the production of less active metabolites such as calcitroic acid (Petkovich2011CYP24A1; Jones201225Hydroxyvitamin). This process is essential for maintaining vitamin D homeostasis and preventing vitamin D toxicity by limiting tissue exposure to its active form (Petkovich2011CYP24A1).

CYP24A1 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, skin, and bone, where it regulates local vitamin D metabolism (Petkovich2011CYP24A1; Schuster2011Cytochromes). The enzyme's activity is part of a negative feedback loop that modulates vitamin D signaling, influencing calcium homeostasis, immune response, and cellular growth processes (Schuster2011Cytochromes; Annalora2010Crystal). In the kidney, CYP24A1 expression is developmentally regulated and influenced by factors such as parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor 23, which help maintain mineral balance (Jones201225Hydroxyvitamin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP24A1 gene are primarily associated with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), a condition characterized by elevated serum calcium levels due to impaired vitamin D metabolism. These mutations lead to a loss of function in the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase, resulting in the accumulation of active vitamin D metabolites and subsequent hypercalcemia. Symptoms of IIH include hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis, with potential long-term complications such as renal function deterioration and vascular calcifications (Cappellani2019Hereditary; Jones2017Genetic; Schlingmann2018Juvenile).

In adults, CYP24A1 mutations can manifest as mild to moderate hypercalcemia and recurrent kidney stones. The condition is often exacerbated by factors such as high vitamin D intake or pregnancy, which can increase the production of active vitamin D metabolites (Schlingmann2018Juvenile; De2019CYP24A1).

Altered expression of CYP24A1 is also linked to various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Overexpression of CYP24A1 in these cancers is associated with a worse prognosis, as it may neutralize the antitumor effects of vitamin D, particularly in tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation (Zou2014Increased; PinedaLancheros2023Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
CYP24A1, a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme, interacts with adrenodoxin (Adx) as part of its role in vitamin D metabolism. This interaction is crucial for electron transfer, which is necessary for the enzyme's catalytic function. The proximal surface of CYP24A1, rich in basic residues, interacts with the acidic surface of Adx, particularly involving conserved residues from the K-helix and the lysine-rich loop of CYP24A1 (Annalora2010Crystal; Kumar2020Evidence). Specific residues such as Arg465 and Arg466 on CYP24A1 are essential for its function, facilitating electron transfer between Adx and the heme iron of CYP24A1 (Annalora2010Crystal).

The interaction between CYP24A1 and Adx is characterized by electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts, with key interactions involving Lys-177 and Lys-382 of CYP24A1 and Glu-109 and Glu-35 of Adx (Kumar2020Evidence). The presence of substrate and Adx induces structural changes in CYP24A1, suggesting allosteric coupling between substrate binding and Adx recognition (Kumar2020Evidence). These interactions are species-specific and involve conserved α-helix 3 of Adx, with hydrophobic residues like Leu-80 of Adx playing a role in the interaction (Kumar2020Evidence).
