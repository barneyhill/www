# POTEB2

## Overview
POTEB2 is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member B2, which is part of the POTE gene family known for its involvement in protein-protein interactions through ankyrin repeats. The POTEB2 protein is characterized by structural motifs such as ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, which suggest a role in cellular interactions, potentially involving the cell membrane (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The gene has undergone evolutionary duplication events, contributing to its current structure and function, and is expressed in various tissues, including cancerous ones, indicating potential roles in oncogenesis (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). As a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, POTEB2 is of interest for its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer (Fan2021Cancer/testis).

## Structure
The POTEB2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the POTE gene family, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats, a common motif involved in protein-protein interactions. The POTEB2 protein consists of 11 exons and features two cysteine repeats, seven ankyrin repeats, and one coiled-coil domain (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Unlike some other POTE family members, POTEB2 does not contain a β-actin retrogene insertion (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The protein's structure suggests a role in cellular interactions, potentially involving the cell membrane, due to the presence of ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, which are known to facilitate such interactions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

The evolutionary analysis of the POTE gene family indicates that POTEB2, along with other POTE genes, has undergone duplication events, contributing to its current structure and function (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including cancerous tissues, which suggests potential roles in oncogenesis and as a therapeutic target (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of the POTEB2 protein are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
POTEB2, a member of the POTE gene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its expression patterns. The POTE family, including POTEB2, is expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) at higher levels than in normal tissues, and this expression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Fan2021Cancer/testis). Although the specific clinical significance of POTEB2 alone is not detailed, its classification as a cancer/testis antigen (CTA) indicates its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer (Fan2021Cancer/testis).

The evolutionary expansion of the POTE gene family, including POTEB2, has been linked to duplications in the last two million years, with expression noted in cancers such as breast cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Some POTE paralogs exhibit pro-apoptotic effects, which may contribute to their role in cancer biology, although specific effects of POTEB2 are not detailed (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The gene's expression in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues highlights its potential involvement in oncogenesis (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).
