# WDR76

## Overview
WDR76 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 76 protein, a member of the WD40 repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its WD40 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the protein's role as a hub in various cellular processes (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). The WD repeat domain 76 protein is involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and protein quality control, interacting with a range of proteins such as SIRT1, GAN, and components of the DNA-PK complex (Jeong2019WDR76; Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). It also plays a significant role in tumor suppression by targeting RAS proteins for degradation, thereby preventing excessive cell proliferation (Jeong2019WDR76). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context (Cheng2024WD; Ro2019WDR76).

## Structure
The WDR76 protein is a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, characterized by the presence of a C-terminal WD40 domain. This domain is predicted to form a coiled β-propeller architecture with seven WD40 blades, a structure common among WD40 repeat proteins, and is estimated to have over 90% accuracy in its predicted three-dimensional form (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). The WD40 domain is known for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions, and in WDR76, it is crucial for interaction with the CCT complex (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical).

The primary structure of WDR76 includes sequences outside the WD40 domain that confer functional specificity, allowing interactions with various proteins such as SIRT1, GAN, histones, PRKDC, XRCC5, XRCC6, and PARP1 (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). These interactions suggest that WDR76 functions as a hub protein with diverse biological roles, including involvement in DNA damage response and chromatin-related activities (Gallina2015Cmr1WDR76; Liu2023Serial).

While the full molecular structure of WDR76 has not been crystallized, structural modeling and interaction studies provide insights into its complex formation and functional domains, highlighting its role in cellular processes (Liu2023Serial).

## Function
The WDR76 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in forming multi-subunit protein complexes. In healthy human cells, WDR76 is implicated in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and protein quality control. It interacts with proteins involved in these processes, such as heterochromatin 1 members, SPIN1, the CCT complex, GAN, MAP1B, and DNA repair proteins like XRCC5, XRCC6, and the DNA-PK complex (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). WDR76 is also involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle organization, chromosome organization, stress response, and immune response regulation (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical).

WDR76 functions as a hub protein, forming stable interactions with the CCT complex, lamins, GAN, and SIRT1, which suggests roles in protein folding and stability regulation (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). It is recruited to DNA damage sites and shows histone binding, indicating a role in maintaining genome integrity (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). Additionally, WDR76 is involved in the degradation of RAS proteins, acting as a tumor suppressor by targeting RAS for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which is crucial for preventing excessive cell proliferation and transformation (Jeong2019WDR76).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the WDR76 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), WDR76 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of RAS proteins, which are involved in cell proliferation and transformation. A deficiency in WDR76 leads to increased RAS protein levels, enhancing cell transformation and tumorigenesis, particularly in liver cancer (Jeong2019WDR76). In colorectal cancer, WDR76 also functions as a tumor suppressor by destabilizing RAS proteins, thereby suppressing cancer stem cell activation and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Loss of WDR76 results in increased tumorigenesis and cancer stem cell enrichment (Ro2019WDR76).

In contrast, high expression of WDR76 in lower grade glioma (LGG) is associated with poor prognosis. It correlates with increased immune cell infiltration and the upregulation of oncogenic pathways, suggesting an oncogenic role in this context. WDR76 expression in LGG is linked to shorter survival rates and is considered a potential target for immunotherapy (Cheng2024WD). These findings highlight the complex role of WDR76 in cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting malignancy in others.

## Interactions
WDR76 is involved in a variety of protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the CCT complex, GAN, and SIRT1, with these interactions being highly stable under different NaCl concentrations (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). WDR76 also associates with chromatin-related proteins such as SUGT1 and HELLS, suggesting roles in chromatin and replication-associated functions (Gallina2015Cmr1WDR76). 

The protein is part of larger complexes, interacting with proteins like CBX1, CBX3, CBX5, SPIN1, and DNA repair proteins such as XRCC5, XRCC6, and the DNA-PK complex (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical). WDR76's interaction with the CCT complex is mediated through its WD40 repeat domain, while interactions with SIRT1, GAN, and other proteins occur outside this domain (Dayebgadoh2019Biochemical).

WDR76 also functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with RAS proteins, targeting them for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for reducing RAS protein levels and suppressing cellular transformation and proliferation in liver cancer cells (Jeong2019WDR76). The protein's role in RAS degradation is enhanced when localized in the cytoplasm (Jeong2019WDR76).
