# NEK7

## Overview
NEK7 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA related kinase 7, a serine/threonine kinase involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during mitosis. The NEK7 protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation by contributing to the formation and maintenance of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and successful cell division (Fry2012Cell). Beyond its role in mitosis, NEK7 is also involved in the immune response through its interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that activates caspase-1 and promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Shi2015NLRP3). Dysregulation of NEK7 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its significance in both cellular and pathological contexts (Zhao2020Recent).

## Structure
The NEK7 protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. Its molecular structure includes a canonical kinase domain with a small N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, forming an ATP-binding pocket and active site (Byrne2020Nek7). The primary structure of NEK7 consists of a sequence of amino acids, with specific residues playing crucial roles in its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of NEK7 reveals an autoinhibited conformation, characterized by the Tyr97 residue blocking the active site. This autoinhibition is released through interactions with NEK9, which induces conformational changes necessary for activation (Haq2015Mechanistic; Richards2009An). The protein exhibits a bilobal fold, with residues 20-300 modeled, except for the disordered activation loop (Richards2009An).

NEK7 does not typically form quaternary structures as it functions as a monomer, but it can dimerize with NEK9 for activation (Haq2015Mechanistic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation of Ser195, are important for its activation and function (Byrne2020Nek7).

## Function
NEK7 (NIMA related kinase 7) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. NEK7 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and centrosomes, where it contributes to microtubule organization and stability. Its kinase activity is crucial for proper spindle assembly and cytokinesis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and successful cell division (O’Regan2009The; Fry2012Cell).

NEK7 is enriched at the centrosome throughout the cell cycle and is essential for centriole duplication and the accumulation of pericentriolar material proteins in interphase cells. This function is vital for centrosome separation and proper spindle assembly during mitosis (Sun2020Physiological; Yissachar2006Nek7). NEK7 also interacts with other proteins, such as NEK9, which acts as an upstream activator, and is involved in recruiting γ-tubulin to spindle poles, crucial for microtubule nucleation (Fry2012Cell).

In addition to its role in mitosis, NEK7 is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that plays a role in the immune response by activating caspase-1 and promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 (Shi2015NLRP3; Sun2020Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in NEK7 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, particularly those related to cell division and cancer. NEK7 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its high expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Silencing NEK7 in HCC cells reduces cell proliferation, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth (Zhou2016Nek7). NEK7 is also implicated in gastric cancer, where its expression is associated with disease progression and immune cell infiltration, influencing the tumor microenvironment. Downregulation of NEK7 in gastric cancer cells inhibits proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021NEK7).

NEK7's role extends to inflammatory diseases through its involvement in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This activation is linked to conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. In these diseases, NEK7-NLRP3 interaction contributes to inflammation and disease progression, with inhibitors targeting this pathway showing therapeutic potential (Zhao2020Recent). NEK7's dysregulation can lead to mitotic errors, such as spindle disorganization and cytokinesis failure, which are associated with cancer development, including bladder, lung, and gallbladder cancers (Sun2020Physiological). These findings highlight NEK7 as a significant factor in both oncogenesis and inflammatory responses.

## Interactions
NEK7, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly with the NLRP3 inflammasome. NEK7 directly binds to NLRP3, facilitating the assembly of the inflammasome complex, which is crucial for the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β. This interaction is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3 and is enhanced by stimuli such as ATP and nigericin (Shi2015NLRP3; He2016NEK7). NEK7's role in inflammasome activation is independent of its kinase activity, as mutations that abolish this activity do not impair its function in this context (He2016NEK7).

NEK7 does not directly interact with ASC, another component of the inflammasome, but it facilitates ASC's recruitment to the NLRP3 complex, which is essential for inflammasome assembly (Shi2015NLRP3). The interaction between NEK7 and NLRP3 is also influenced by potassium efflux, a critical step in the activation process (He2016NEK7). NEK7's interaction with NLRP3 is crucial for the structural assembly of the inflammasome, impacting the inflammatory response in various diseases (Zhao2020Recent).
