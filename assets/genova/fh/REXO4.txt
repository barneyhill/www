# REXO4

## Overview
REXO4 is a gene that encodes the REX4 homolog, a 3'-5' exonuclease protein involved in nucleic acid metabolism. This protein plays a critical role in the degradation of RNA molecules, contributing to the regulation of RNA stability and processing. The REX4 homolog is categorized as an exonuclease due to its enzymatic activity, which involves the removal of nucleotides from the ends of RNA molecules. The gene's expression and the protein's function have been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Alterations in REXO4 expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes in conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma and uveal melanoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Yao2021Identification; van2022FOXD1). Additionally, REXO4 has been identified as a candidate gene in female infertility, suggesting its broader significance in human health (Maddirevula2020A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
REXO4 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In uveal melanoma (UM), low expression of REXO4 is associated with high-risk UM and poor prognosis. The gene clusters with downregulated genes in high-risk UM, suggesting its potential role in identifying high-risk cases (van2022FOXD1). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of REXO4 is linked to poor prognosis. It is part of a 9-gene signature related to stemness, with high expression levels correlating with adverse clinicopathological features and poorer survival outcomes (Yao2021Identification). REXO4 is also associated with pathways involved in RNA catabolic processes, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage response, which may contribute to its role in cancer progression (Yao2021Identification).

In the context of female infertility, REXO4 has been proposed as a candidate gene for infertility, particularly in cases of recurrent pregnancy loss and primary infertility, although its role is not yet fully understood (Maddirevula2020A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of REXO4 expression alterations in various diseases, particularly in cancer and infertility.

## Interactions
REXO4, a 3'-5' exonuclease, is involved in nucleic acid metabolism and participates in various protein interactions. In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoantibodies against REXO4 have been identified, suggesting that these interactions may affect DNA transcription and RNA translation, potentially impacting leucocyte function and organs with low cell division rates, such as the kidneys and brain (Mak2020Detection). 

REXO4 has also been identified as an interacting partner of the SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP15. This interaction was noted in a study analyzing the interactome of human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, aiming to identify human hub proteins associated with comorbidities (Ghosh2021Interactome). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), REXO4 is part of the ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis process, indicating its involvement in nucleic acid metabolic processes (Yao2021Identification). Although specific protein interactions of REXO4 in HCC are not detailed, its high expression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting a role in the disease's progression (Yao2021Identification). 

These interactions highlight REXO4's potential involvement in various cellular processes and diseases, warranting further investigation into its functional roles.
