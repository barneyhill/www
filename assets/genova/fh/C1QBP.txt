# C1QBP

## Overview
The C1QBP gene encodes the complement component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein, also known as gC1qR, p32, or HABP1, which is a multifunctional protein primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, apoptosis regulation, and immune response. Structurally, gC1qR forms a trimeric assembly and is characterized by its unique toroidal shape, which facilitates its interaction with multiple ligands and proteins. The protein plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and is implicated in several pathological conditions, including mitochondrial disorders and cancer. Its interactions with viral and bacterial proteins also highlight its function as a pathogen recognition receptor, underscoring its importance in immune defense mechanisms (Ghebrehiwet2019The; Feichtinger2017Biallelic; Gotoh2018Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The C1QBP gene encodes the gC1qR protein, also known as p33, p32, or HABP1, which is a highly acidic protein composed of 282 amino acids. The mature form of the protein spans residues 74-282 and is generated from a pre-pro mitochondrial form through post-translational processing (Ghebrehiwet2019The; Ghebrehiwet1998Structure). The protein lacks a conventional transmembrane segment or GPI anchor but contains three potential N-glycosylation sites and a tyrosine kinase recognition site (Ghebrehiwet1998Structure).

Structurally, gC1qR forms a trimer of three identical chains, creating a doughnut-shaped homotrimer (Ghebrehiwet2019The). The protein's unique fold includes two prominent N- and C-terminal α-helices and a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet at its core, contributing to its toroidal, ring-like trimeric assembly (Zhang2022gC1qRC1qBPHABP1:). This structure is maintained even in mutant forms, as demonstrated by a 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure (Zhang2022gC1qRC1qBPHABP1:).

The gC1qR protein is involved in various cellular processes, including binding to multiple ligands such as C1q, vitronectin, and high molecular weight kininogen, and plays roles in infection, inflammation, and cancer (Ghebrehiwet2019The; Ghebrehiwet1998Structure).

## Function
The C1QBP gene encodes a multifunctional protein known as complement component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein, or p32, which is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In healthy human cells, C1QBP is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins and the stability of respiratory chain complexes I, III, and IV, which are essential for ATP production (Feichtinger2017Biallelic). C1QBP also plays a role in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, interacting with proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance (Feichtinger2017Biallelic).

C1QBP is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis, nuclear transcription, and inflammation (Feichtinger2017Biallelic). It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved, indicating its importance across different tissues and species (Ghebrehiwet2019The). The protein is also implicated in immune responses, acting as a pathogen recognition receptor and interacting with viral and bacterial structures (Ghebrehiwet2019The). In dendritic cells, C1QBP supports metabolic changes necessary for maturation and function, influencing the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Gotoh2018Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C1QBP gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting cardiac and muscular systems. Biallelic mutations in C1QBP can lead to severe neonatal, childhood, or later-onset cardiomyopathy, often accompanied by combined respiratory-chain deficiencies. These mutations result in significant clinical manifestations, including exercise intolerance, ptosis, proximal weakness, and cardiomyopathy, highlighting the gene's critical role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Feichtinger2017Biallelic). 

The clinical spectrum of C1QBP mutations is broad, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms such as infantile lactic acidosis, childhood myopathy, and late-onset myopathy with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (Feichtinger2017Biallelic). In some cases, mutations lead to intrauterine growth restriction, edema, and cardiomyopathy, as observed in fetuses with a novel homozygous variant in C1QBP (Alstrup2021A). 

Alterations in C1QBP expression are also linked to various cancers, including bladder, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and other types, where high expression levels correlate with poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that C1QBP may play a role in cancer aggressiveness and progression (Saha2019Systematic).

## Interactions
C1QBP, also known as complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein, is involved in numerous protein interactions that play significant roles in various cellular processes. It interacts with protein kinase C zeta (PRKCZ), which is crucial for cell polarity and migration, particularly in the context of cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis. This interaction is enhanced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, leading to co-localization at the plasma membrane (Zhang2013Interactome). C1QBP also interacts with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1) in renal cell carcinoma, where it negatively regulates YBX1's activation by affecting its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Wang2014C1QBP).

In colon cancer, C1QBP is upregulated and interacts with apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), suggesting a role in carcinogenesis (Kim2017C1QBP). It also binds to various plasma proteins, including fibrinogen and thrombin, and is involved in coagulation pathways (Ghebrehiwet2019The). C1QBP's interactions extend to viral proteins, such as the hepatitis C virus core protein and HIV-1 gp41, indicating its role as a pathogen recognition receptor (Ghebrehiwet2019The). These interactions highlight C1QBP's multifunctional nature in cellular signaling, immune response, and disease progression.
