# ZNF331

## Overview
ZNF331 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 331, a member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, playing a crucial role in modulating gene expression through its DNA-binding zinc finger domains. ZNF331 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including gastric tissue, thyroid, myometrium, and testis, and is involved in essential cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Meiboom2003A; Yu2012Zincfinger). The gene is also imprinted and expressed from the maternal allele in the placenta, suggesting a role in fetal development (Daelemans2010Highthroughput). ZNF331's involvement in transcriptional repression and its interactions with other proteins highlight its participation in complex regulatory networks. Additionally, alterations in ZNF331 expression and promoter methylation have been linked to various cancers, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Jing2020The; Wang2017Methylation).

## Function
ZNF331, a zinc finger protein, functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator in healthy human cells. It contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is crucial for its role as a transcriptional repressor (Nie2021Association; Meiboom2003A). ZNF331 is ubiquitously expressed in various normal tissues, including gastric tissue, thyroid, myometrium, and testis, indicating its involvement in essential cellular functions across different tissues (Meiboom2003A; Yu2012Zincfinger).

In normal cells, ZNF331 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it likely participates in transcriptional regulation by binding to DNA through its zinc finger domains (Yu2012Zincfinger). This nuclear localization suggests a role in modulating the expression of genes critical for maintaining normal cellular functions, such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Yu2012Zincfinger).

The gene is also imprinted and expressed from the maternal allele in the placenta, indicating a potential role in placental and fetal development (Daelemans2010Highthroughput). The expression of ZNF331 in the placenta is associated with fetal growth parameters, suggesting its involvement in regulating growth and development during gestation (Petre2018Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF331 is implicated in various cancers, primarily due to alterations in its expression and promoter methylation. In glioma, ZNF331 is lowly expressed, and its expression decreases with increasing pathological grade. Overexpression of ZNF331 in glioma cells reduces proliferation, migration, invasion, and vasculogenic mimicry formation, indicating its tumor-suppressive role (Jing2020The).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF331 is frequently methylated, leading to its reduced expression. This methylation is associated with larger tumor size and poor prognosis, making it an independent prognostic marker. The methylation status of ZNF331 correlates with reduced overall and disease-free survival in colorectal cancer patients (Marie2014The; Wang2017Methylation).

ZNF331 also acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, where it is often silenced due to promoter hypermethylation. Its downregulation is linked to advanced cancer stages and poor survival outcomes. Restoring ZNF331 expression in gastric cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and invasiveness, suggesting its critical role in suppressing gastric carcinogenesis (Yu2012Zincfinger).

These findings highlight the potential of ZNF331 as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis in various cancers, as well as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ZNF331, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. In the context of liver cell proliferation, ZNF331 has been identified to interact with proteins such as FHL2 and ZNF408. These interactions were discovered using a matrix mating yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) technique, which categorized the interactions based on their strength (Gao2008A). The interaction with FHL2 is particularly notable as FHL2 is a transcriptional factor involved in regulating cell growth and survival, suggesting that ZNF331 may participate in signaling pathways that control these processes (Gao2008A).

In addition to protein interactions, ZNF331 is part of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) family, which are known for their role in repressing transposable elements during early embryogenesis by recruiting KAP1 and associated effectors. However, some KZFPs, including ZNF331, do not bind KAP1, indicating a functional diversification within this protein family (Helleboid2019The). These interactions highlight ZNF331's involvement in complex regulatory networks that influence gene expression and cellular functions.
