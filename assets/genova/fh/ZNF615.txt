# ZNF615

## Overview
ZNF615 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 615, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. Although the specific functions of zinc finger protein 615 are not fully understood, it is implicated in various biological pathways and conditions, including psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as certain cancers. The gene's involvement in these conditions suggests it may play a role in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways, although further research is needed to clarify its precise biological functions and mechanisms (Liu2017Integrated; Bogari2020The).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF615 has been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological conditions. A study identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ZNF615 gene that were exclusively found in children with both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These SNPs were present in 50% of the patients with both conditions, suggesting a potential genetic link between ZNF615 and the co-occurrence of these disorders (Bogari2020The). 

In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ZNF615 was found to be hypermethylated and downregulated in patients with TET2 mutations. This suggests that ZNF615 may serve as a potential biomarker for DLBCL diagnosis, although its direct clinical significance in this context requires further investigation (Liu2017Integrated).

ZNF615 has also been mentioned in studies on Dravet syndrome, where a non-synonymous variant in the gene was identified, although the study did not elaborate on its clinical significance (Hammer2017Rare). Overall, while ZNF615 is associated with various conditions, its precise role and clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated.
