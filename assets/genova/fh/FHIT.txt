# FHIT

## Overview
The FHIT gene, located on chromosome 3p14.2, encodes the fragile histidine triad (Fhit) protein, which is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a dinucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, specifically targeting Ap3A, a type of dinucleotide, although its role as a tumor suppressor is considered independent of its enzymatic activity (Croce1999Role; Barnes1996Fhit). The Fhit protein is characterized by a histidine triad motif, which is crucial for its enzymatic function, and it operates as a homodimer (Brenner2002Hint; Barnes1996Fhit). FHIT is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in DNA damage response and apoptosis, contributing to its tumor suppressive properties (Sugimoto1997Decreased). Alterations in the FHIT gene, such as deletions and promoter methylation, are frequently observed in several cancers, including colorectal, lung, and breast cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis and therapy (Cao2006Downregulation; Saldivar2010Pathology).

## Structure
The FHIT protein, encoded by the FHIT gene, is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily, characterized by a specific histidine triad motif. This motif is crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor and its role in nucleotide metabolism (Brenner2002Hint). The primary structure of FHIT includes this histidine triad, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, although its tumor-suppressing function may be independent of this activity (Brenner2002Hint).

The secondary structure of FHIT features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure forms a compact fold, which facilitates the entry and exit of substrates and products, enhancing its catalytic efficiency (Brenner2002Hint). FHIT functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its biological activity (Brenner2002Hint).

Common post-translational modifications of the FHIT protein include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions with other cellular components. The FHIT gene also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct roles in various tissues (Uboldi2006Comparative). These structural features underscore the importance of FHIT in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Function
The FHIT gene encodes the Fhit protein, which functions as a dinucleoside 5′,5′′′-P1,P3-triphosphate hydrolase, specifically hydrolyzing Ap3A, a type of dinucleotide (Barnes1996Fhit). This enzymatic activity is crucial for nucleotide metabolism, potentially linking it to the regulation of DNA replication and stress response signaling, although these roles are not strongly evidenced (Barnes1996Fhit). The Fhit protein is characterized by a histidine triad, with histidine 96 being essential for its hydrolase activity, and it functions as a dimer in its native state (Barnes1996Fhit).

In healthy human cells, the FHIT gene is expressed in most tissues, with the highest levels found in epithelial cells and tissues (Croce1999Role). The Fhit protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in DNA damage response and apoptosis, contributing to tumor suppression (Sugimoto1997Decreased). The loss of Fhit protein expression is associated with various cancers, suggesting its role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing malignant transformation (Croce1999Role). Despite its enzymatic activity, the ability to cleave Ap3A is not required for its tumor suppressor function, as mutant Fhit proteins with reduced enzymatic activity can still suppress tumorigenicity (Croce1999Role).

## Clinical Significance
The FHIT gene, located on chromosome 3p14.2, is frequently altered in various cancers, including colorectal, lung, breast, gastric, and glioblastoma multiforme. In colorectal cancer (CRC), loss of FHIT expression is associated with poorly differentiated tumors and advanced stages, often with lymph node metastasis, leading to a worse prognosis for patients (Cao2006Downregulation). Aberrant splicing and promoter methylation are mechanisms contributing to FHIT down-regulation in CRC (Cao2006Downregulation).

In breast cancer, FHIT inactivation is observed in approximately 70-72% of tumors, correlating with poor prognosis in invasive and metastatic cases. Alterations in FHIT expression are linked to interactions with specific miRNAs, affecting tumor characteristics and patient outcomes (Sevinc2016Expression).

In gastric cancer, reduced FHIT expression is significantly associated with diffuse type, poor differentiation, and advanced stage, suggesting its role as a prognostic factor (Rocco2003Loss). In glioblastoma multiforme, FHIT gene mutations and reduced protein expression are common, although their clinical significance remains unclear (Cecener2009FHIT).

FHIT alterations, including deletions, translocations, and promoter methylation, are also observed in lung cancer, where they correlate with disease progression and shorter survival (Saldivar2010Pathology). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FHIT gene alterations in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
The FHIT protein, encoded by the FHIT gene, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in its tumor suppressive functions. FHIT interacts with ferredoxin reductase (Fdxr) within the mitochondria, influencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis in cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for modulating the electron transport chain and ROS production, contributing to apoptosis in Fhit-positive cells (Druck2019Fhit–Fdxr). FHIT also interacts with the heat-shock proteins HSP60 and HSP10, which are involved in its mitochondrial import and stability (Druck2019Fhit–Fdxr).

In addition to mitochondrial interactions, FHIT associates with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme hUBC9, suggesting a role in cell cycle control and the degradation of cyclins (SHI2000Association). FHIT also forms a complex with Nit1, acting as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Mittag2023The). The interaction with Ubc9 can inhibit Ap3A hydrolysis by FHIT, indicating a regulatory mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity (Mittag2023The). These interactions highlight FHIT's multifaceted role in cellular stress responses and its potential as a target in cancer therapy.
