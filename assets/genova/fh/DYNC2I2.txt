# DYNC2I2

## Overview
DYNC2I2 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein 2 intermediate chain 2, a critical component of the cytoplasmic dynein-2 complex. This protein is integral to the process of retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia, which is essential for maintaining ciliary function and structure. The dynein-2 complex, including the DYNC2I2 protein, facilitates the transport of proteins from the ciliary tip back to the cell body, a process necessary for the recycling of ciliary components and the regulation of signaling pathways (Rao2024Structure). As a part of the dynein-2 family, DYNC2I2 plays a significant role in cellular signaling and sensory functions, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development (Rao2024Structure). Variations in the DYNC2I2 gene can lead to defects in ciliary function, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Rao2024Structure).

## Function
DYNC2I2, also known as dynein 2 intermediate chain 2, is a component of the dynein-2 complex, which plays a crucial role in retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. This process is essential for maintaining ciliary function and structure, which are vital for cellular signaling and sensory functions (Rao2024Structure). The dynein-2 complex, including DYNC2I2, is responsible for transporting proteins from the ciliary tip back to the cell body, a process necessary for the recycling of ciliary components and the regulation of signaling pathways (Rao2024Structure).

DYNC2I2 is active in the ciliary axoneme, where it contributes to the stability and function of the dynein-2 complex. This activity is crucial for the proper functioning of cilia, which are involved in sensing and transducing extracellular signals (Rao2024Structure). The protein's role in retrograde transport is vital for cellular homeostasis and development, as it ensures the correct localization and turnover of ciliary proteins, thereby supporting normal cellular signaling and function (Rao2024Structure). Variations in DYNC2I2 can lead to defects in ciliary function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Rao2024Structure).

## Clinical Significance
DYNC2I2, also known as WDR34, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in ciliary function. Alterations in DYNC2I2 expression have been associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where high mRNA levels correlate with shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for immunotherapy (Liu2021High). In cervical cancer, DYNC2I2 is identified as one of the key prognostic markers, with its expression linked to pathways such as DNA replication and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its potential as a target for anticancer treatment (Cui2022Bioinformatics).

DYNC2I2 is also mentioned in the context of cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), a retinal disease, as one of the genes related to autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, although specific details about its role in CORD are not provided (Li2023Four). Additionally, DYNC2I2 is associated with ossification and limb defects, as indicated by its involvement in transcriptome profiles affected by AFF3 variants (Bassani2024Variantspecific). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance across a range of conditions.

## Interactions
DYNC2I2, also known as dynein 2 intermediate chain 2, is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein-2 complex, which plays a crucial role in retrograde intraflagellar transport within cilia. This protein is involved in interactions with various components of the dynein-2 complex and other associated proteins. DYNC2I2 is part of the intraflagellar transport system and is associated with dynein-related proteins, contributing to the force-generating machinery of motile cilia (Pajkos2023Entering). It is identified as cytoplasmic dynein 2 intermediate chain 2 (DC2I2, or WDR34) and is part of the dynein-2 family, although specific details about its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Rao2024Structure).

The dynein-2 complex, including DYNC2I2, interacts with the IFT-B complex in anterograde trains, where it is transported to the cilium tip by kinesin-2 in an autoinhibited conformation (Rao2024Structure). While the specific interactions of DYNC2I2 with other proteins are not detailed, it is associated with the ciliary-centrosomal network and is linked to short-rib thoracic dysplasia 8 (Pajkos2023Entering).
