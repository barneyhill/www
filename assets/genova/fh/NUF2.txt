# NUF2

## Overview
NUF2 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. The NUF2 protein, characterized by its coiled-coil structure, plays a critical role in the attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, a condition that can lead to various diseases, including cancer (DeLuca2002hNuf2; Nabetani2001A). The NUF2 protein interacts with other components of the NDC80 complex, such as HEC1, SPC24, and SPC25, forming a heterotetrameric structure that is crucial for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and spindle checkpoint regulation (McCleland2003The; Liu2007Human). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are conserved across species, underscoring their evolutionary importance in cell division processes (Nabetani2001A). Additionally, NUF2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Ren2023NUF2; Jiang2022NUF2).

## Structure
The NUF2 protein is a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. The human NUF2 gene encodes a 464 amino acid protein with a coiled-coil structure, which is a common feature among proteins involved in structural and mechanical roles within the cell (Nabetani2001A). The coiled-coil domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as NDC80, forming a dimer that is part of the larger NDC80 complex (Zhang2015Nuf2). This complex is crucial for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and spindle assembly checkpoint regulation.

The NUF2 protein's secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helical regions, which contribute to its coiled-coil configuration (Osborne1994Nuf2). In terms of quaternary structure, NUF2 interacts with NDC80, SPC24, and SPC25 to form a heterotetrameric complex. This complex is highly extended and reminiscent of long coiled-coil proteins like myosin, indicating its structural role in the kinetochore (McCleland2003The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function and interactions of NUF2, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's role in kinetochore function is conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary importance (Nabetani2001A).

## Function
The NUF2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which plays a vital role in chromosome segregation during cell division. In healthy human cells, NUF2 is involved in the attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules, a process essential for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation. This attachment is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer (DeLuca2002hNuf2; Nabetani2001A).

NUF2 localizes to the outer domain of the kinetochore, where it interacts with microtubule plus ends, facilitating the stable attachment necessary for proper chromosome movement during mitosis. This localization is consistent throughout mitosis, from prophase to anaphase, ensuring that chromosomes are correctly aligned and segregated (DeLuca2002hNuf2). The protein's function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cell division (Nabetani2001A).

The depletion of NUF2 disrupts kinetochore-microtubule attachments, leading to mitotic arrest and cell death, underscoring its essential role in cell viability and division (DeLuca2002hNuf2). This function is critical for the fidelity of chromosome segregation, ensuring that each daughter cell receives the correct complement of chromosomes (Nabetani2001A).

## Clinical Significance
NUF2, a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression, which is often associated with poor prognosis. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), NUF2 is overexpressed and correlates with poor overall survival, progression-free interval, and disease-specific survival. It is linked to clinicopathological features such as M stage, pathologic stage, and TP53 status, and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, impacting cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Jiang2022NUF2). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high NUF2 expression is associated with poorer overall survival, particularly in LUAD, and is enriched in cell cycle pathways (Chen2021Integrative).

In ovarian cancer, NUF2 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. It interacts with HNRNPA2B1, activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which contributes to tumorigenesis (Ren2023NUF2). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NUF2 overexpression leads to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth (Liu2014Silencing). NUF2 is also implicated in breast cancer, where its high expression correlates with worse prognosis and is linked to immune infiltration, potentially influencing tumor stemness (Deng2023NUF2). These findings highlight NUF2's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
The human NUF2 protein is a critical component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. NUF2 interacts with several proteins to fulfill its role in the kinetochore. It forms a stable complex with HEC1, SPC24, and SPC25, known as the HsNDC80 complex, which is crucial for stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment and spindle checkpoint activation (Liu2007Human). 

NUF2 also interacts with centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E), a key kinetochore protein involved in spindle checkpoint signaling. This interaction occurs at the C-terminal domain of CENP-E and is essential for the stable localization of CENP-E at the kinetochore (Liu2007Human). The interaction between NUF2 and CENP-E is mediated by the region containing amino acids 341-424 of NUF2, which is crucial for binding (Liu2007Human).

In ovarian cancer cells, NUF2 interacts with HNRNPA2B1, a protein that regulates NUF2 expression and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and apoptosis (Ren2023NUF2). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NUF2 in both mitotic processes and cancer cell proliferation.
