# VKORC1L1

## Overview
VKORC1L1 is a gene that encodes the protein vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 like 1, which is a crucial component of the vitamin K cycle. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane oxidoreductase, featuring four transmembrane domains that facilitate its role in maintaining cellular redox balance. VKORC1L1 is involved in the reduction of vitamin K epoxide to its active hydroquinone form, which is essential for vitamin K-dependent intracellular antioxidant functions. Unlike its paralog VKORC1, VKORC1L1 exhibits reduced sensitivity to warfarin, a common anticoagulant, suggesting distinct physiological roles and potential protective functions in extra-hepatic tissues. The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various biological processes, including oxidative stress response and body composition regulation, with potential clinical significance in warfarin dosing and metabolic conditions (Westhofen2011Human; Ding2018The; Lacombe2018VKORC1L1).

## Structure
VKORC1L1 is a protein involved in the vitamin K cycle, characterized by its four transmembrane domains (TMDs) and a unique membrane topology. The protein's structure includes a four-transmembrane α-helical bundle, with both the N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm, which is distinct from its paralog VKORC1 that has a three-TMD structure (Sinhadri2017Vitamin; Tie2014Conserved). The orientation of the first TMD in VKORC1L1 follows a Nin-Cout pattern, influenced by the distribution of charged residues flanking the TMD1, adhering to the 'positive-inside rule' (Tie2014Conserved).

VKORC1L1 contains conserved cysteine residues, particularly in the loop connecting the first two transmembrane helices and in the CXXC motif within the fourth helix. These cysteines are crucial for the protein's function, facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds necessary for active site regeneration (Tie2014Conserved; Westhofen2011Human). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various oxidoreductases, supporting its role in vitamin K-dependent intracellular antioxidant functions (Westhofen2011Human). VKORC1L1 is less inhibited by warfarin compared to VKORC1, indicating differences in their physiological roles and potential resistance to vitamin K antagonists (Westhofen2011Human).

## Function
VKORC1L1 is a protein involved in the vitamin K cycle, playing a crucial role in vitamin K-dependent intracellular antioxidant functions. It is expressed in various tissues, including HEK 293T cells, where it localizes to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (Westhofen2011Human). VKORC1L1 supports both vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) and vitamin K reductase enzymatic activities, contributing to the reduction of vitamin K epoxide to its active hydroquinone form, which is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance (Westhofen2011Human).

The protein is involved in reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitigating oxidative damage to membrane proteins, thereby enhancing cell viability under oxidative stress (Westhofen2011Human). VKORC1L1 expression is upregulated in response to oxidative stress, suggesting a regulatory role in intracellular redox homeostasis (Westhofen2011Human). It is hypothesized to maintain the intracellular pool of vitamin K in its reduced, antioxidant-active form, which is vital for cell survival and protection against oxidative damage (Westhofen2011Human).

VKORC1L1 is less sensitive to warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, compared to VKORC1, which may protect extra-hepatic tissues from warfarin therapy (Lacombe2018VKORC1L1). This protein's activity is crucial for vitamin K-mediated intracellular antioxidation pathways, highlighting its fundamental role in maintaining cellular health (Westhofen2011Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VKORC1L1 gene have been studied for their potential clinical significance, particularly in relation to body composition and metabolic conditions. In mice, a mutation in VKORC1L1 caused by the insertion of a PB transposon leads to a lean phenotype characterized by reduced body weight, body length, and fat mass. This mutation results in decreased expression of mature adipocyte genes and impaired differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, suggesting a crucial role for VKORC1L1 in maintaining normal body fat levels (Ding2018The).

In humans, VKORC1L1 polymorphisms have been associated with variability in warfarin dose requirements. The VKORC1L1 rs4072879 SNP, for instance, has been linked to stable warfarin doses, with wild homozygotes requiring lower doses than variant carriers. This suggests that VKORC1L1 may influence warfarin dosing by potentially rescuing VKORC1 function in extrahepatic tissues during therapy (Chung2018Polymorphisms).

VKORC1L1 is also implicated in intracellular antioxidant functions, maintaining vitamin K in its reduced state to lower reactive oxygen species levels. Disruptions in VKORC1L1 function could affect cellular redox balance, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations have not been confirmed (Westhofen2011Human).

## Interactions
VKORC1L1 interacts with various proteins involved in the vitamin K cycle and oxidative stress response. It is known to interact with oxidoreductases, including members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, to obtain reducing equivalents necessary for its function in maintaining the intracellular vitamin K pool in its reduced form (Westhofen2011Human). These interactions are crucial for VKORC1L1's role in antioxidation and the vitamin K cycle.

VKORC1L1 is also involved in interactions that influence its sensitivity to warfarin, a common anticoagulant. The protein binds warfarin at a common pocket overlapping with its active site, similar to VKORC1. However, the differences in sensitivity to warfarin between VKORC1L1 and VKORC1 are attributed to peripheral interactions that stabilize the cap domain of the warfarin-binding pocket (Shen2018Stabilization).

Additionally, VKORC1L1's expression and activity are upregulated in response to oxidative stress, such as exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This upregulation supports its role in reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitigating oxidative damage, indicating its involvement in intracellular redox homeostasis (Westhofen2011Human).
