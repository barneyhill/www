# CD209

## Overview
CD209, also known as the gene encoding the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), is a critical component of the immune system. This gene is responsible for producing a type II transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that belongs to the C-type lectin family. The CD209 protein is predominantly expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages, where it plays a vital role in pathogen recognition and immune response modulation. It functions as a high-affinity receptor for intercellular adhesion molecules and is involved in binding mannose, fucose, or galactose-containing structures on various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The protein's structure, characterized by a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a neck region, facilitates its role in mediating cell-cell adhesion and internalizing pathogens. CD209's interactions with pathogens such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 underscore its significance in infectious disease processes. Genetic variations in CD209 have been linked to susceptibility to diseases like dengue, leprosy, and tuberculosis, highlighting its importance in immune regulation and pathogen defense (Germano2022Association; Rahimi2020Ctype; Amraei2021CD209LLSIGN).

## Structure
The CD209 protein, also known as DC-SIGN, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein receptor characterized by its distinct structural domains. The ectodomain of CD209 includes a neck region composed of 23 amino acids repeated seven times, which is a hallmark of CD209 and its closely related protein CD209L (Rahimi2020Ctype). This neck region forms an α-helical coiled-coil fold, stabilizing the oligomerization of CD209 family proteins (Rahimi2020Ctype).

The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) is crucial for binding mannose, fucose, or galactose-containing structures on pathogens. It features a double-looped, two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet connected by two α-helices and a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The CRD typically contains two conserved disulfide bonds and up to four calcium ion (Ca2+) binding sites, coordinated by amino acid residues with carbonyl side chains (Rahimi2020Ctype). A conserved EPN motif (Glu-Pro-Asn) within the CRD is responsible for carbohydrate recognition (Rahimi2020Ctype).

CD209 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in variants that may lack the CRD or transmembrane domain, leading to soluble forms (Rahimi2020Ctype). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, influence the protein's function and stability (Amraei2021CD209LLSIGN).

## Function
The CD209 gene encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein receptor known as DC-SIGN, which is part of the C-type lectin family. In healthy human cells, CD209 is primarily expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages, where it functions as a high-affinity receptor for intercellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. This role is crucial for mediating cell-cell adhesion and facilitating interactions between dendritic cells and T cells, which are essential for initiating immune responses (Rahimi2020Ctype; Kashima2009DCSIGN).

CD209 is involved in the recognition of mannose, fucose, or galactose-containing structures on pathogens, utilizing its carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) to bind these glycoproteins. This domain is characterized by a specific structure that includes a double-looped, two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet connected by two α-helices and a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, with conserved disulfide bonds and calcium-binding sites that facilitate carbohydrate binding (Rahimi2020Ctype).

The protein plays a significant role in pathogen recognition and immune response modulation by potentially suppressing Toll-like receptor signaling, which influences the Th1/Th2 balance, thereby affecting pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses (Vannberg2008CD209). CD209 can also undergo internalization upon interaction with pathogens, delivering them inside target cells, which is mediated by specific motifs in the cytosolic N-terminus tail (Rahimi2020Ctype).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD209 gene, which encodes the DC-SIGN receptor, have been associated with various infectious diseases. The DCSIGN1-336 polymorphism in the CD209 promoter is linked to the severity of dengue disease. The G allele of this variant is associated with a protective effect against dengue fever but not against dengue hemorrhagic fever, suggesting distinct pathophysiological processes between these conditions (Sakuntabhai2005A). This polymorphism affects the Sp1 binding site, influencing the transcription level of CD209 and potentially altering susceptibility to dengue virus infection (Sakuntabhai2005A).

In the context of leprosy, the rs735240 single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the CD209 promoter is associated with the paucibacillary form of the disease. Carriers of the A allele exhibit reduced expression of CD209 and TGF-β1 in leprosy lesions, which correlates with a higher response to the Mitsuda test, indicating an altered immune response to Mycobacterium leprae (Germano2022Association).

CD209 polymorphisms have also been implicated in susceptibility to other infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, and atherosclerosis, highlighting its role in immune response modulation and pathogen recognition (Xue2021Proteus; Morenikeji2020CD209).

## Interactions
CD209, also known as DC-SIGN, is a C-type lectin receptor that participates in various interactions with proteins and pathogens. It is known to bind to the rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, facilitating the bacteria's invasion into human dendritic cells and mouse macrophages. This interaction is mediated by the hDC-SIGN receptor on human cells and mSIGNR1 on mouse cells, and can be inhibited by specific antibodies, mannan, and LPS core oligosaccharides (He2019Yersinia).

CD209 also interacts with the oligomannose structures on the surface of Toxoplasma gondii, enhancing the parasite's invasion and dissemination within the host. Blocking CD209 with antibodies or oligosaccharides like Mannan reduces the dissemination of T. gondii, indicating its role as a preferred target for the parasite (Njiri2020CD209).

In the context of viral infections, CD209 acts as a receptor for various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It can bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, facilitating viral entry into cells, even in the absence of ACE2, the primary receptor for the virus (Amraei2021CD209LLSIGN). CD209 is also involved in interactions with other viruses such as HIV-1, where it can bind to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, influencing viral transmission and infection (GranelliPiperno2005Dendritic).
