# ADPRS

## Overview
The ADPRS gene encodes the enzyme ADP-ribosylserine hydrolase, also known as ARH3, which is a critical hydrolase involved in the regulation of ADP-ribosylation, a reversible post-translational modification. This enzyme plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis by removing ADP-ribose units from serine residues in proteins, thereby participating in essential cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis (Beijer2021Biallelic; Ma2022ChildOnset). ARH3 is unique in its ability to hydrolyze serine-linked mono-ADP-ribose, a function crucial for DNA damage control and repair (Beijer2021Biallelic). The enzyme is active in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, where it prevents the harmful accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers, which can lead to cell death if not properly regulated (Ma2022ChildOnset). Mutations in the ADPRS gene are associated with a rare neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting the clinical significance of ARH3 in maintaining neurological health (Bannister2024A).

## Function
The ADPRS gene encodes the ADP-ribosylserine hydrolase, also known as ARH3, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating ADP-ribosylation, a reversible post-translational modification. This enzyme is involved in the removal of ADP-ribose units from serine residues in proteins, a process essential for various cellular functions, including DNA repair, transcription, telomere maintenance, and apoptosis (Beijer2021Biallelic; Ma2022ChildOnset).

ARH3 is active in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, where it helps prevent excessive accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers, which can lead to cell death through the parthanatos pathway if not properly regulated (Beijer2021Biallelic; Ma2022ChildOnset). The enzyme is the only known hydrolase capable of removing serine-linked mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) synthesized by the PARP1/2-HPF1 complex, which is vital for DNA damage control and repair (Beijer2021Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, ARH3's activity ensures the timely repair of DNA by allowing access to downstream repair factors and preventing the trapping of PARP1 and other DNA repair factors at damage sites (Beijer2021Biallelic). This function is critical for protecting cells from genotoxic and oxidative stress, thereby preventing neurodegenerative diseases associated with dysregulated ADP-ribosylation (Beijer2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADPRS gene, also known as ADP-ribosylhydrolase-like 2 (ADPRHL2), are linked to a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder known as Childhood-Onset NeuroDegeneration, Stress-Induced, with variable Ataxia and Seizures (CONDSIAS). This condition is characterized by symptoms such as developmental delays, seizures, ataxia, and respiratory failure (Bannister2024A). The ARH3 protein, encoded by the ADPRS gene, plays a crucial role in removing poly(ADP-ribose) polymers, and its dysfunction due to mutations can lead to the accumulation of these polymers, triggering cell death processes like parthanatos (Ma2022ChildOnset).

Specific mutations, such as the H182R variant, result in protein instability and mislocalization, leading to increased mono-ADP ribosylation levels and impaired ARH3 function (Bannister2024A). This variant has been associated with neurodegenerative symptoms in children from a Somali family, where it segregated with the CONDSIAS phenotype in a recessive manner (Bannister2024A). Other mutations, such as c.580C>T and c.803-1G>A, have been linked to cerebellar ataxia and seizures in a 30-month-old patient (Ma2022ChildOnset).

The clinical presentation of CONDSIAS can vary, with some cases showing overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders like Friedreich's ataxia (Tompa2024Clinical). The rarity and variability of the disease make establishing a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation challenging (Öz2024Delineation).
