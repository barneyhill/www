# PARD6A

## Overview
PARD6A, or par-6 family cell polarity regulator alpha, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the regulation of cell polarity. The protein is a member of the Par-6 family and plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of cell junctions, particularly in epithelial and neuronal cells. It is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain, a CRIB domain, and a semi-CRIB domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and small GTPases, such as Cdc42. These interactions are essential for the activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and the subsequent signaling pathways that influence cell structure and function (Cline2007Characterization; Gao2004Isoforms). PARD6A is integral to the PAR complex, which includes Par3 and aPKC, and is vital for processes such as tight junction assembly, neuronal polarization, and the maintenance of the blood-testis barrier (Wong2008Par3Par6; Joberty2000The). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular organization and its potential implications in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and diabetes (Cardoso2019Essential; PeñaChilet2019Using).

## Structure
PARD6A, a member of the Par-6 family, is a protein involved in cell polarity regulation. It contains several key domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins. The primary structure of PARD6A includes a PDZ domain, a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, and a semi-CRIB domain. These domains are crucial for binding to other proteins and small GTPases, such as Cdc42-GTP, which activates atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and initiates signaling cascades affecting cell structure and function (Cline2007Characterization; Gao2004Isoforms).

The PDZ domain of PARD6A is involved in interactions with the C-terminal sequences of target proteins, such as Par3, and is essential for the formation of the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, which is critical for cell polarity (Renschler2018Structural). The CRIB domain allows PARD6A to bind to RAC-family small GTPases, including CDC42, which is important for its role in neuronal polarization and axon specification (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical).

PARD6A is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions with other proteins (Cline2007Characterization). In mammals, there are multiple isoforms of Par6, including Par6A, Par6B, and Par6C, each with distinct functions and localization patterns in cells (Gao2004Isoforms).

## Function
PARD6A, also known as par-6 family cell polarity regulator alpha, plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity in epithelial cells. It is a component of the PAR complex, which includes Par3 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and is essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, a key feature of epithelial cell polarity (Joberty2000The). PARD6A interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42, forming a complex that is vital for cell polarization and tight junction assembly (Bruurs2018A; Joberty2000The).

In addition to its role in epithelial cells, PARD6A is involved in neuronal differentiation, where it contributes to axon specification and neuronal polarization. It is part of a signaling pathway that regulates microtubule stability and axon growth by interacting with proteins such as MARK2 (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical). PARD6A is also active in the blood-testis barrier dynamics during spermatogenesis, where it helps maintain the integrity and function of cell junctions in Sertoli cells (Wong2008Par3Par6).

PARD6A's interactions with Cdc42 and aPKC are crucial for its function, as these interactions facilitate the formation of a multiprotein complex that ensures the singularity of the apical domain in polarized cells (Bruurs2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PARD6A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A de novo dominant truncating mutation in PARD6A (p.Arg312Term) has been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). This mutation was discovered through whole exome sequencing in consanguineous families, suggesting a potential role for PARD6A in human neurodevelopment, although further studies are needed to confirm its functional impact (Cardoso2019Essential).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, PARD6A is part of the Rap1 signaling pathway, which shows significant activity differences between diabetic and non-diabetic samples. This pathway is associated with inflammation, a key consequence of diabetes. The study suggests that specific gene interactions within this pathway, including PARD6A, may have clinical significance in diabetes (PeñaChilet2019Using).

While the role of PARD6A in cancer is not directly addressed in the provided context, alterations in cell polarity proteins like PARD6A are known to impact cell migration and invasion, processes that are critical in cancer progression. However, specific evidence linking PARD6A mutations or expression changes to cancer was not detailed in the context provided.

## Interactions
PARD6A, also known as par-6 family cell polarity regulator alpha, is involved in several critical protein interactions that contribute to cell polarity and epithelial junction formation. PARD6A interacts with atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and ASIP/PAR-3, forming a ternary complex essential for the development of tight junctions and adherens junctions in epithelial cells. This complex is targeted to cell-cell contact regions in a calcium-dependent manner, which is crucial for epithelial cell polarity (Yamanaka2001PAR‐6; Suzuki2001Atypical).

PARD6A also interacts with small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 through CRIB-like motifs, linking them to aPKC. This interaction facilitates the formation of a ternary complex that plays a significant role in cell polarization (Noda2001Human). In the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian cancer, PARD6A interacts with the integrin β1-ILK-SNAIL1 pathway, influencing the expression of proteins such as SNAIL1, VIMENTIN, and E-cadherin, which are key markers of EMT (Lu2022Partitioning).

Additionally, PARD6A acts as a scaffold between aPKC and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptors, facilitating the phosphorylation of PARD6A by aPKC, which is crucial for regulating TGF-β receptor levels and cell migration (Gunaratne2013Atypical).
