# GPAT2

## Overview
GPAT2, or glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of GPAT2 is a mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of glycerolipids by converting glycerol-3-phosphate into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycerophospholipids (Cattaneo2012Glycerol3Phosphate). This enzyme is particularly significant in the testis, where it is highly expressed in spermatic germ cells and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis (GarciaFabiani2017Glycerol3phosphate). GPAT2 is distinct from other GPAT isoforms due to its sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and its preference for arachidonoyl-CoA as a substrate, which is essential for the synthesis of spermatogenic cell membranes (Cattaneo2012Glycerol3Phosphate; Wang2007Cloning). Beyond its enzymatic functions, GPAT2 is involved in piRNA biogenesis through interactions with proteins such as MILI and PIWIL2, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Shiromoto2013GPAT2; Shiromoto2019GPAT2).

## Structure


## Function
GPAT2 (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically catalyzing the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycerophospholipids (Cattaneo2012Glycerol3Phosphate). This enzyme is highly expressed in the testis, particularly in spermatic germ cells, where it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis (GarciaFabiani2017Glycerol3phosphate). GPAT2 is involved in the incorporation of arachidonic acid into TAGs, which is essential for the synthesis of spermatogenic cell membranes and the acrosomal reaction necessary for fertilization (Cattaneo2012Glycerol3Phosphate).

In healthy cells, GPAT2 is primarily active in the mitochondria and is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), distinguishing it from other GPAT isoforms (Wang2007Cloning). It shows a preference for arachidonoyl-CoA as a substrate, facilitating the conversion of arachidonic acid into storage lipids, which may play a role in cell survival by preventing apoptosis induced by high levels of unesterified arachidonic acid (Cattaneo2012Glycerol3Phosphate). Despite its role in lipid metabolism, GPAT2's canonical activity does not appear to be directly linked to its function in spermatogenesis, suggesting additional roles in testicular physiology (GarciaFabiani2017Glycerol3phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPAT2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. GPAT2 is characterized as a cancer testis gene, typically expressed in the testis and certain cancer cells. In breast cancer, especially in the aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line, GPAT2 overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and survival while reducing apoptosis. This overexpression is associated with higher histological grades of tumors and is detected in 37% of carcinoma samples, with higher expression in Grade III tumors compared to Grade I/II (PellonMaison2014Glycerol3Phosphate).

In vivo studies have shown that silencing GPAT2 inhibits tumorigenicity, as demonstrated by the lack of tumor development in nude mice injected with shRNA-GPAT2 (PellonMaison2014Glycerol3Phosphate). The gene's expression is also epigenetically regulated, with upregulation observed upon treatment with methyltransferase inhibitors, suggesting a potential mechanism for its aberrant expression in cancers (PellonMaison2014Glycerol3Phosphate).

In addition to breast cancer, high GPAT2 expression is noted in other cancers, including melanoma, lung, and prostate cancer, correlating with poorer clinical outcomes (GarciaFabiani2015Methylation). These findings suggest that GPAT2 plays a critical role in cancer progression and may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
GPAT2, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, is involved in several interactions crucial for piRNA biogenesis. It binds to MILI, a member of the PIWI protein family, which is essential for piRNA production in germline stem cells. This interaction was identified through mass spectrometric analysis and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in testis samples and HEK 293T cells (Shiromoto2013GPAT2). GPAT2 also interacts with PIWIL2 in male germ cells, acting as a scaffold protein that recruits factors necessary for piRNA production (Shiromoto2019GPAT2).

The protein is associated with the pi-body, or intermitochondrial cement (IMC), which is involved in piRNA biogenesis. GPAT2's role in the construction of the IMC/pi-body is crucial, as its deficiency leads to the absence of this structure in germ cells (Shiromoto2019GPAT2). Although GPAT2's enzymatic activity is not required for piRNA production, its interactions with proteins like MILI and PIWIL2 are vital for the primary processing of piRNAs and the silencing of retrotransposon genes through DNA methylation (Shiromoto2019GPAT2).
