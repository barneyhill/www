# BARD1

## Overview
BARD1 (BRCA1 Associated RING Domain 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair processes. The BARD1 protein is characterized as a multifunctional protein, primarily known for its interaction with BRCA1, forming a heterodimer that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex is essential for the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks through homologous recombination (McCarthy2003Loss; IrmingerFinger2016New). Beyond its partnership with BRCA1, BARD1 also has independent roles, including mediating p53-dependent apoptosis and regulating mRNA processing during DNA damage (IrmingerFinger2006Is; Kleiman1999Functional). The protein's structure includes several key domains, such as the RING finger domain, ankyrin repeats, and BRCT domains, which facilitate its diverse interactions and functions (Birrane2007Crystal; IrmingerFinger2016New). Mutations and alterations in the BARD1 gene are linked to an increased risk of various cancers, underscoring its significance as a tumor suppressor (Hawsawi2022BARD1; RATAJSKA2015Cancer).

## Structure
The BARD1 protein is composed of 777 amino acids and features several key structural domains. It includes an amino-terminal RING finger domain (residues 46-90), which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity when forming heterodimers with BRCA1 (IrmingerFinger2016New). The protein also contains three ankyrin repeats (residues 420-525) that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Birrane2007Crystal). At the carboxy-terminus, BARD1 has two tandem BRCT domains (residues 568-777), which are involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions (Birrane2007Crystal; IrmingerFinger2016New).

The BRCT domains of BARD1 are characterized by a central beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, with a unique short antiparallel beta-strand in BRCT2 (Birrane2007Crystal). These domains form a hydrophobic interface and a surface groove with two pockets, P1 and P2, which are involved in ligand binding (Birrane2007Crystal). The P2 pocket contains histidine residues that may regulate ligand interactions through pH-dependent protonation (Birrane2007Crystal).

BARD1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions (IrmingerFinger2016New). Multiple splice variants of BARD1 exist, some lacking the RING or ANK motifs, but retaining the BRCT domains, which are highly expressed in certain cell types (IrmingerFinger2016New).

## Function
The BARD1 gene encodes a protein that forms a heterodimer with BRCA1, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and DNA repair in healthy human cells. This complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is essential for the DNA damage response, particularly in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks (McCarthy2003Loss; IrmingerFinger2016New). BARD1 is involved in cell cycle regulation, centrosome duplication, and cytokinesis, acting as a chaperone for BRCA1 to facilitate its nuclear translocation and retention (IrmingerFinger2016New; Russi2022The).

BARD1 also has BRCA1-independent functions, such as mediating p53-dependent apoptosis by stabilizing and facilitating the phosphorylation of p53 (IrmingerFinger2006Is). It interacts with the mRNA polyadenylation factor CSTF1, inhibiting polyadenylation to regulate cellular proliferation and prevent premature mRNA processing during DNA damage (Kleiman1999Functional; Russi2022The). BARD1's role in telomere integrity involves interactions with shelterin components, contributing to chromosomal stability (Russi2022The). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to tumor suppression and the cellular response to DNA damage (McCarthy2003Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BARD1 gene are associated with an increased risk of several cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancers. BARD1 functions as a tumor suppressor, and its interaction with BRCA1 is crucial for DNA damage repair. Mutations in BARD1, especially those affecting the BRCT domain, can disrupt this interaction, leading to chromosomal instability and heightened cancer susceptibility (Hawsawi2022BARD1; RATAJSKA2015Cancer). Specific mutations, such as c.1690C>T and c.1361C>T, have been linked to breast and ovarian cancer risk by affecting exon splicing and resulting in the expression of incorrect isoforms (RATAJSKA2015Cancer).

BARD1 is also implicated in other cancers, including neuroblastoma, lung, and colorectal cancers. Variants like Cys557Ser have been associated with hereditary breast cancer susceptibility (Karppinen2004Mutation). The gene's oncogenic isoforms, such as BARD1β, lack the RING finger domain necessary for BRCA1 interaction and are implicated in various cancers, antagonizing the tumor suppressor function of full-length BARD1 (Hawsawi2022BARD1). Alterations in BARD1 expression levels can lead to a premalignant phenotype and are linked to chromosomal instability (Watters2020The). These genetic and epigenetic changes underscore BARD1's role in cancer predisposition and progression.

## Interactions
BARD1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and apoptosis. It forms a heterodimer with BRCA1, enhancing BRCA1's ubiquitin ligase activity, which is crucial for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression (Russi2022The). BARD1 also interacts with the NF-κB protein complex, modulating its transcriptional activity through the B-cell lymphoma 3 protein (BCL-3) and forming a BCL-3 interacting protein network (Russi2022The).

BARD1 binds to the polyadenylation factor CSTF1, inhibiting mRNA polyadenylation and processing in response to DNA damage (Kleiman1999Functional; Russi2022The). It also interacts with p53, stabilizing and promoting its phosphorylation, which is essential for apoptosis (IrmingerFinger2006Is; Russi2022The).

BARD1's interaction with shelterin components like TRF1 and TRF2, and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase tankyrase-1, is vital for telomere integrity (Russi2022The). It also associates with proteins involved in centrosome regulation, such as Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1) and RACK1, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Russi2022The).
