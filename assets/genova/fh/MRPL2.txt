# MRPL2

## Overview
The MRPL2 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2, which is a vital component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular ATP production (O’Brien2003Properties; Koc2012Regulation). As a ribosomal protein, MRPL2 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which are crucial for its function and regulation within the ribosome (Koc2012Regulation). The protein's strategic location near the peptidyl transferase center underscores its role in the translation process, akin to its bacterial homolog, L2, which is involved in peptidyl transferase activity and tRNA binding (Koc2012Regulation). Alterations in MRPL2 expression have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Elsadany2021Transcriptional; PerezMartinez2008Protein).

## Function
MRPL2 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process crucial for ATP production in cells (O’Brien2003Properties; Koc2012Regulation). 

MRPL2 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial translation through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. These modifications are important for the function of ribosomal proteins, influencing various stages of translation. MRPL2 is located near the peptidyl transferase center, suggesting its involvement in the translation process (Koc2012Regulation). The phosphorylation of MRPL2 is suggested to influence ribosomal activity, similar to its bacterial homolog, where phosphorylation leads to a decrease in protein synthesis activity (Koc2012Regulation).

In healthy human cells, MRPL2 contributes to cellular energy metabolism by supporting the synthesis of proteins necessary for the oxidative phosphorylation system, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cellular function and energy production (O’Brien2003Properties).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MRPL2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. MRPL2 is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and coordination, often accompanied by blindness and deafness (Elsadany2021Transcriptional; PerezMartinez2008Protein). In neurodegenerative disorders such as Friedreich's ataxia and multiple sclerosis, MRPL2 shows differential expression, suggesting its involvement in neuronal differentiation and development (Elsadany2021Transcriptional).

The expression of MRPL2 is also temporally regulated during development, with its absence noted in specific stages such as the E8.5 yolk sac, indicating its critical role in early embryonic development (Cheong2020Expression). Disruptions in MRPL2 expression can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a common feature in various neurodegenerative diseases, affecting organs with high energy demands like the brain (Elsadany2021Transcriptional).

Overall, MRPL2's role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and its expression patterns suggest that alterations in this gene can contribute to a range of disorders, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

## Interactions
MRPL2, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's large 39S subunit, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is involved in essential interactions within the ribosome, particularly near the peptidyl transferase center, which is vital for protein synthesis. MRPL2 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its interactions with other ribosomal proteins and nucleic acids. These modifications are thought to affect ribosome dissociation and protein synthesis by altering protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions (Koc2012Regulation).

MRPL2's bacterial homolog, L2, is known for its role in peptidyl transferase activity and tRNA binding, suggesting similar functions for MRPL2 in mitochondrial translation. The phosphorylation of MRPL2 at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is particularly significant, as it may regulate its interaction with other components of the ribosome, thereby influencing the overall translation process (Koc2012Regulation). While specific interactions of MRPL2 in multiprotein complexes are not detailed, its location and modifications indicate its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome (Koc2012Regulation).
