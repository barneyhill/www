# TASP1

## Overview
TASP1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme taspase 1, a threonine protease involved in the proteolytic processing of nuclear proteins, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. Taspase 1 is characterized by its ability to cleave specific substrates, such as mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins and the general transcription factor TFIIAα-β, thereby facilitating their maturation and functional activation. This enzyme plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including histone methylation and transcriptional activation, which are essential for normal development and cellular function (Niizuma2021Taspase1; Takeda2006Proteolysis). Mutations in TASP1 have been linked to developmental disorders such as Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Riedhammer2022SuleimanElHattab). The conservation of TASP1 across species underscores its fundamental role in biological systems (van2016Structural).

## Structure
Taspase 1 (TASP1) is a threonine protease that undergoes autoproteolysis to form a mature α28/β22 heterodimeric enzyme with an α/β/β/α structure (Dong2014Taspase1; Niizuma2015Taspase). The primary structure of TASP1 includes a sequence of 420 amino acids, which is initially synthesized as a proenzyme (Knauer2011Bioassays). The secondary structure of TASP1 features a helix-turn-helix motif in the loop at the C-terminus of the α-subunit, which is crucial for its function and is distinct from other type 2 asparaginases (van2016Structural). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of the polypeptide chain to form the active protease, which is essential for its proteolytic activity. TASP1's quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of its subunits into a heterodimeric form (Niizuma2015Taspase). TASP1 contains specific domains necessary for its enzymatic function, including an asparaginase_2 homology domain (Chen2012A). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. TASP1 is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (van2016Structural).

## Function
TASP1 encodes the enzyme taspase 1, a threonine protease that plays a critical role in the cleavage and regulation of nuclear proteins, particularly in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, taspase 1 is involved in the proteolytic activation of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins, which are essential for histone methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3, a marker of active transcription (Niizuma2021Taspase1; Takeda2006Proteolysis). This cleavage is crucial for the full functionality of MLL proteins as methyltransferases, influencing the expression of cyclin genes and cell cycle regulators (Takeda2006Proteolysis).

Taspase 1 also cleaves the general transcription factor TFIIAα-β, which is necessary for its maturation and function in the basal transcription machinery (Niizuma2021Taspase1; Zhou2006Uncleaved). This activity is particularly important for processes such as craniofacial development and fetal liver hematopoiesis (Niizuma2021Taspase1; Takeda2015Taspase1dependent). The enzyme is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the maturation of proteins necessary for cellular functions and organismal development (Nagaratnam2021Structural). Loss of TASP1 function can lead to developmental abnormalities, highlighting its essential role in normal cellular processes (Niizuma2021Taspase1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TASP1 gene are associated with Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome, a disorder characterized by developmental delay, severe speech and motor delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, and distinctive facial features such as thick and arched eyebrows, synophrys, and a broad nasal bridge. Congenital anomalies, including brain and cardiovascular malformations, limb deformities, and cryptorchidism in males, are also observed. These phenotypic characteristics are linked to biallelic loss-of-function variants in TASP1, which result in significant developmental and physical abnormalities (Riedhammer2022SuleimanElHattab).

TASP1 is crucial for the cleavage and activation of histone methyltransferases of the KMT2 protein family, which are important for gene expression regulation. Defects in TASP1 lead to syndromes with overlapping features, such as Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome and Kabuki syndrome 1, which share phenotypic similarities with Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome (Riedhammer2022SuleimanElHattab). In animal models, TASP1 deficiency results in growth defects, microcephaly, and craniofacial anomalies, mirroring the clinical features observed in humans (Riedhammer2022SuleimanElHattab).

Additionally, TASP1 mutations can lead to craniofacial anomalies, as seen in Taspase 1 knockout mice, which exhibit severe craniofacial malformations and impaired cell cycle progression (Balkin2019TASP1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TASP1 mutations in causing a recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome through disrupted epigenetic regulation (Riedhammer2022SuleimanElHattab).

## Interactions
Taspase1 (TASP1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. It cleaves and regulates nuclear proteins such as MLL1, MLL2, and TFIIAα-β, which are essential for transcription regulation and epigenetic modification (Niizuma2021Taspase1). Taspase1 interacts with topoisomerase IIβ (Topo IIβ) to facilitate DNA double-strand breaks, which are critical for estrogen-induced transcription. This interaction is transient and estrogen-dependent, suggesting Taspase1 acts as a co-regulator in the estrogen signaling pathway (Oelschläger2023Taspase1). Taspase1 also binds directly to DNA, forming complexes that enhance DNA cleavage and transcriptional activation (Oelschläger2023Taspase1).

In addition to its interactions with MLL proteins and TFIIA, Taspase1 is associated with proteins like Nucleolin, NPM1, and PARP1, which are involved in chromatin architecture and transcription regulation (Oelschläger2023Taspase1). It also interacts with USF2 and other transcription factors, influencing gene expression in response to hormonal stimuli (Oelschläger2023Taspase1). These interactions highlight Taspase1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control.
