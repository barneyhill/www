# HAUS1

## Overview
The HAUS1 gene encodes the HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 1 protein, which is a critical component of the augmin complex involved in microtubule organization during cell division. This protein is part of the TIII tetramer within the augmin complex, which plays a pivotal role in mitotic spindle assembly by facilitating the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to spindle microtubules. The HAUS1 protein, characterized by its extensive coiled-coil segments, forms a stable dimer with HAUS4, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the augmin complex (Zupa2022The). Through its interactions with various proteins, HAUS1 is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, thereby maintaining genomic stability and normal cell cycle progression (Habermann2012New; Yachie2016Pooled‐matrix). Dysregulation of HAUS1 has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Wang2023A; Tang2024The).

## Structure
The HAUS1 protein is a component of the augmin complex, specifically part of the TIII tetramer, which includes HAUS1, HAUS3, HAUS4, and HAUS5. The TIII tetramer is characterized by extensive coiled-coil segments, with HAUS1 forming a stable dimer with HAUS4. These proteins are aligned from N-to C-terminus almost over their full length, indicating a stable dimer formation (Zupa2022The). The structure features a central 'bulge' region composed of all four HAUS proteins, dividing the tetramer into two segments. The N-terminal segments of all HAUS proteins are located in the bulge region, while their C-terminal segments form the 4H-arm. The very C-termini of HAUS1 and HAUS4 are predicted to form a flexible kinked coiled-coil, which is not resolved in the cryo-EM reconstruction, suggesting high mobility (Zupa2022The).

The HAUS1 protein's structure and conformational plasticity have been elucidated using cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry, and neural network-based structure prediction, indicating a rigid structural scaffold for γ-TuRC binding (Zupa2022The). The augmin complex, including HAUS1, plays a crucial role in microtubule branching during mitosis by recruiting the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to spindle microtubules (Zupa2022The).

## Function
The HAUS1 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the HAUS Augmin-like complex, which is essential for microtubule organization during cell division. This complex plays a critical role in mitotic spindle assembly by facilitating the nucleation of microtubules at the spindle poles, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Habermann2012New; Tang2024The). The HAUS complex, consisting of eight proteins (HAUS1-8), interacts with the γ-Tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to increase microtubule density within the spindle, which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (Habermann2012New).

In healthy human cells, HAUS1 and the HAUS complex are involved in the maturation of kinetochore fibers and are required for the completion of cytokinesis (Habermann2012New). The complex localizes to interphase centrosomes and relocates to spindle microtubules during mitosis, playing a vital role in maintaining genomic stability and normal cell cycle progression (Habermann2012New). The HAUS complex's function in microtubule organization is essential for the structural integrity of the cell and its ability to divide properly, which is fundamental for organismal development and homeostasis (Giotti2018Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
The HAUS1 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HAUS1 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and increased risk of relapse and progression. Its high expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms in HCC (Tang2024The). HAUS1 mutations occur in approximately 6% of HCC patients, with missense mutations being the most common (Tang2024The).

In low-grade glioma (LGG), HAUS1 expression is elevated compared to normal brain tissue and is linked to tumor progression. Although alterations in HAUS1 do not correlate with overall survival in LGG, high expression is considered a risk factor for poor prognosis. HAUS1 is also associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, indicating its involvement in immune regulation (Wang2023A).

The gene's role in cell cycle regulation and microtubule organization suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to chromosomal instability, potentially leading to cancer development (Wang2023A; Tang2024The).

## Interactions
HAUS1, a subunit of the human Augmin complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for microtubule dynamics and centrosome function. It interacts with proteins that localize to centrioles or pericentriolar material, such as CEP55, CEP70, and POC5, and with proteins that promote microtubule dynamics like CETN3 and CLASP1 (Yachie2016Pooled‐matrix). HAUS1 also interacts with dynactin (DCTN2), which anchors microtubules to the centrosome and interacts with the microtubule regulator MAPRE3 (Yachie2016Pooled‐matrix). 

Within the Augmin complex, HAUS1 forms a stable dimer with HAUS4, and this pair is aligned from N-to C-terminus almost over their full length (Zupa2022The). The HAUS1-HAUS4 interaction is part of the TIII tetramer, which serves as a structural scaffold for the specific binding and positioning of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) relative to preexisting microtubules (Zupa2022The). HAUS1 also shows a high interaction score with the γ-TuRC protein TUBGCP4, aligning with the role of the Augmin complex in localizing γ-TuRC, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (Yachie2016Pooled‐matrix). These interactions highlight HAUS1's involvement in microtubule organization during cell division.
