# ZFR2

## Overview
ZFR2, or zinc finger RNA binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA binding and regulation. The protein encoded by ZFR2 is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are structural domains that facilitate binding to RNA molecules. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including RNA processing and gene expression regulation. As a member of the zinc finger protein family, ZFR2 is implicated in the modulation of RNA stability and translation, contributing to the intricate network of gene expression control. Understanding the function and interactions of ZFR2 is essential for elucidating its role in cellular physiology and its potential implications in disease states.
