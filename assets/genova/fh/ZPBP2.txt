# ZPBP2

## Overview
ZPBP2, or zona pellucida binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in reproductive biology, specifically in the process of fertilization. The protein, also named ZPBP2, is categorized as a binding protein due to its role in sperm-egg interaction. It is primarily expressed in the acrosome of sperm cells, where it facilitates the binding to the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein layer surrounding the egg, which is crucial for successful fertilization (Torabi2017Zona). Structurally, ZPBP2 is characterized by a Link-like hyaluronic acid-binding domain, suggesting a potential role in binding to hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix during fertilization (Torabi2017Zona). Beyond its reproductive functions, genetic variations in the ZPBP2 gene have been linked to several diseases, including asthma and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Verlaan2009AlleleSpecific).

## Structure
The zona pellucida-binding protein 2 (ZPBP2) is characterized by its potential hyaluronic acid (HA) binding properties, attributed to a Link-like HA-binding domain similar to that found in CD44, a known hyaladherin (Torabi2017Zona). The protein shares structural similarities with CD44, particularly in the HA-binding domain, which is stabilized by disulfide bonds (Torabi2017Zona). ZPBP2 contains a zona-binding homologous domain (ZBHD) with conserved cysteine residues, suggesting the presence of disulfide bridges that contribute to its structural stability (Torabi2017Zona).

ZPBP2 has at least two known isoforms, both containing the ZBHD, but differing in their amino acid sequences due to alternative splicing (Song2010Molecular). The primary structure of the pig ZPBP2 isoform 1 shows 82% identity with the human ZPBP2, indicating a high degree of conservation across species (Song2010Molecular). The protein also features several conserved motifs, including N-glycosylation sites, phosphorylation sites, and N-myristoylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that may influence its function and localization (Song2010Molecular). The presence of an immunoglobulin-like domain and overlapping epidermal growth factor-like domains in the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain further suggests a complex tertiary structure (Song2010Molecular).

## Function
ZPBP2 (zona pellucida binding protein 2) is primarily involved in sperm-egg interaction during fertilization. The protein is active in the acrosome of sperm cells, where it plays a crucial role in binding to the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein layer surrounding the egg, facilitating successful fertilization and subsequent embryonic development (Torabi2017Zona). ZPBP2 contains a Link-like hyaluronic acid-binding domain, suggesting it may participate in sperm-oocyte interactions by binding to hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix of the cumulus-oophorus complex during fertilization (Torabi2017Zona).

The protein is also implicated in acrosome formation and sperm morphology, with disruptions in ZPBP2 leading to fertility issues in mice (Torabi2017Zona). ZPBP2 is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids within seminiferous tubules, indicating its involvement in the later stages of spermatogenesis (Ghanami2021The). Additionally, ZPBP2 may have evolved from an ancestral hyaluronic acid-binding function, which could be partially conserved in its current role in zona pellucida recognition (Torabi2017Zona). The protein's expression is not limited to the testis; it is also found in human somatic cells, albeit at lower levels, suggesting potential roles beyond reproduction (Kanagaratham2018Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZPBP2 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly asthma and autoimmune conditions. Genetic variations in the ZPBP2 region, specifically within the 17q12-q21 locus, have been linked to an increased risk of asthma. These variations can lead to allele-specific chromatin remodeling, affecting the expression of nearby genes such as GSDMB and ORMDL3, which are implicated in immune response and inflammation (Verlaan2009AlleleSpecific). The SNP rs12936231, for example, is associated with differential expression of these genes, contributing to asthma susceptibility (Verlaan2009AlleleSpecific).

In addition to asthma, the ZPBP2 locus is also associated with autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease, type 1 diabetes, and primary biliary cirrhosis. These associations suggest that genetic variations in this region may have broader implications for immune system regulation and inflammation (Verlaan2009AlleleSpecific). Furthermore, studies in mouse models have shown that deletion of the Zpbp2 gene can impact airway hypersensitivity and lung lipid metabolism in a sex-dependent manner, indicating a potential role in asthma pathogenesis through the regulation of ceramide metabolism (Kanagaratham2018Loss).

## Interactions
ZPBP2 (zona pellucida binding protein 2) is implicated in interactions with hyaluronic acid (HA) due to its structural similarities with the HA-binding domain of CD44, a known hyaladherin. This suggests that ZPBP2 may possess HA-binding capabilities, potentially playing a role in sperm-egg recognition and binding (Torabi2017Zona). The protein contains a sequence motif similar to the Link module found in CD44, which is involved in HA binding, indicating that ZPBP2 might interact with HA or similar glycosaminoglycans (Torabi2017Zona).

ZPBP2 has been identified in HA-binding fractions of human sperm, supporting its potential role in HA recognition. This interaction is significant for sperm function and fertility, as HA is abundant in the female reproductive tract and plays a role in sperm selection during fertilization (Torabi2017Zona). The presence of conserved cysteine residues in ZPBP2, similar to those in CD44, further supports its potential involvement in HA interactions (Torabi2017Zona).

The protein's role in sperm morphology and fertility is also highlighted by its localization on the acrosome, a structure critical for sperm-egg interaction (Torabi2017Zona). However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific interactions and mechanisms involving ZPBP2.
