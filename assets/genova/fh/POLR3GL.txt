# POLR3GL

## Overview
POLR3GL is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit GL, a component of the RNA polymerase III enzyme complex. This complex is essential for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which are crucial for protein synthesis and cellular function (Terhal2019Biallelic). The POLR3GL protein is part of a detachable subcomplex within RNA polymerase III, playing a significant role in transcription initiation (Renaud2013Gene). It is more abundantly expressed in non-dividing, differentiated cells, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Renaud2013Gene). Mutations in POLR3GL have been linked to various clinical conditions, including skeletal and neurological abnormalities, underscoring its critical role in human health and development (Terhal2019Biallelic).

## Function
POLR3GL encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), a crucial enzyme complex responsible for the transcription of small housekeeping RNAs, including transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Terhal2019Biallelic). This transcription process is essential for protein synthesis and various cellular functions. POLR3GL is part of a detachable Pol III subcomplex that plays a significant role in transcription initiation, working alongside other subunits such as POLR3C and POLR3F (Terhal2019Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, POLR3GL is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Renaud2013Gene). The gene is more abundantly expressed in non-dividing, differentiated cells, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular functions in these contexts (Renaud2013Gene). POLR3GL is also implicated in the regulation of Pol III transcription, with its expression being essential for cell survival, as suppression of POLR3GL affects cell viability (Renaud2013Gene).

The presence of POLR3GL in the Pol III complex indicates its involvement in the transcription of genes with type 1, 2, and 3 promoters, although it does not confer different specificities to Pol III for target genes (Renaud2013Gene). This suggests that POLR3GL contributes to the general transcriptional activity of Pol III, maintaining baseline levels of RNA polymerase III activity necessary for cell survival (Renaud2013Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3GL gene are associated with a range of clinical manifestations, primarily involving skeletal, dental, and neurological abnormalities. Biallelic variants in POLR3GL have been linked to endosteal hyperostosis, characterized by increased bone density, and oligodontia, a condition where fewer teeth than normal develop. Affected individuals often present with short stature, mild facial dysmorphisms, and in some cases, hearing loss. Neurological symptoms such as hypotonia, spastic paresis, and neurogenic bladder dysfunction have also been observed (Terhal2019Biallelic).

The genetic analysis of affected individuals has revealed compound heterozygous variants in the splice acceptor sites of POLR3GL exons, leading to aberrant splicing and exon skipping. Despite these disruptions, the overall abundance of POLR3GL transcripts remains similar to that in unaffected individuals, suggesting that the variants are hypomorphic, retaining some essential function (Terhal2019Biallelic).

In mouse models, POLR3GL knockout results in postnatal growth defects and early death, indicating its critical role in development. The absence of POLR3GL leads to cerebellar function defects and locomotor ataxia, highlighting its importance in neurological development (Wang2020Functions). These findings underscore the gene's significance in both human health and disease.

## Interactions
POLR3GL is a subunit of RNA polymerase III and participates in various interactions within the complex. It is incorporated into the full Pol III enzyme, likely as part of a detachable trimeric subcomplex. Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that POLR3GL coimmunoprecipitates with other subunits such as POLR3A, POLR3G, and POLR3C, indicating its presence in the full enzyme complex (Renaud2013Gene). GST pull-down experiments have demonstrated that POLR3GL directly interacts with POLR3C, but not with POLR3F, BRF1, or BRF2, suggesting that its primary interactions within the trimeric complex are with POLR3C (Renaud2013Gene).

POLR3GL, along with POLR3G, POLR1C, and POLR3F, forms a subcomplex that plays a role in the initiation of transcription and can be selectively detached from RNA polymerase III (BeauregardLacroix2019A). Despite differences in expression patterns between POLR3GL and POLR3G, RNA polymerase III targets remain consistent regardless of which subunit is incorporated (BeauregardLacroix2019A). These interactions highlight the functional redundancy and importance of POLR3GL in the transcriptional activities of RNA polymerase III.
