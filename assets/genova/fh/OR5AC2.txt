# OR5AC2

## Overview
The OR5AC2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily AC member 2, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and perception of odorants, particularly those with ester functional groups. It is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in the combinatorial coding of olfactory signals, contributing to the complexity of odor perception. The receptor's activation by specific odorants such as maltyl isobutyrate and eugenyl acetate highlights its role in the perception of fruity odors. The evolutionary conservation of OR5AC2 between humans and chimpanzees underscores its significance in olfactory function (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

## Function
OR5AC2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odorants, specifically those containing ester functional groups. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a role in the perception of fruity odors by responding to ester odorants such as maltyl isobutyrate, fructone, manzanate, and eugenyl acetate (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The activation of OR5AC2 by these odorants suggests its involvement in the combinatorial coding of olfactory signals, where multiple receptors can be activated by a single odorant, contributing to the complexity of odor perception (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In terms of molecular processes, OR5AC2, like other olfactory receptors, is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Upon binding to its specific odorants, OR5AC2 initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves the accumulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP), leading to neuronal activation and the perception of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). This receptor is also shared between humans and chimpanzees, indicating its evolutionary significance in olfactory function (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).
