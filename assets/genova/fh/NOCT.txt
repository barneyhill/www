# NOCT

## Overview
The NOCT gene encodes the protein nocturnin, which is a member of the Exonuclease-Endonuclease-Phosphatase (EEP) superfamily. Nocturnin is primarily involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactors. Despite its structural similarity to other deadenylases, nocturnin does not exhibit in vitro ribonuclease activity, suggesting a unique functional role that may require additional factors or modifications (Abshire2018The). The protein is characterized by a conserved ribonuclease domain and a catalytic domain that spans residues 120-431, which is essential for its enzymatic activities (Abshire2018The). Nocturnin's function extends to its role as an NADP(H) phosphatase, influencing cellular NADP(H) levels and impacting metabolic processes such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Laothamatas2019Spatiotemporal; Abshire2020Differentiala). The gene's expression and activity are linked to various metabolic and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in energy homeostasis and circadian regulation (Estrella2019The; Green2007Loss).

## Structure
The human NOCT protein, or nocturnin, is characterized by a conserved ribonuclease domain that plays a crucial role in mRNA regulation. The primary structure of NOCT includes a catalytic domain that spans residues 120-431, encompassing the entire exonuclease, endonuclease, and phosphatase (EEP) domain (Abshire2018The). The secondary structure of NOCT features an α/β-sandwich fold, with two antiparallel β-sheets at its core, surrounded by several α-helices and 3_10 helices (Abshire2018The). 

The tertiary structure reveals a basic cleft adjacent to the active site, which is thought to interact with the phosphodiester backbone of RNA substrates (Abshire2018The). The active site of NOCT is highly conserved and includes residues such as Asn149, Glu195, His286, Asp324, and Asp377, which coordinate one or two Mg2+ ions essential for its function (Abshire2018The). 

NOCT shares structural homology with other CCR4-related deadenylases, such as CNOT6L and PDE12, but exhibits unique features, including a narrow active site pocket and distinct surface properties (Estrella2018Crystal). Despite its structural similarity to other deadenylases, NOCT lacks in vitro ribonuclease activity, suggesting it may require additional factors or post-translational modifications for full enzymatic activity (Abshire2018The).

## Function
The NOCT gene encodes the Nocturnin protein, which plays a significant role in the metabolism of mRNA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactors. Nocturnin is part of the Exonuclease-Endonuclease-Phosphatase (EEP) superfamily and is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. It functions as an exoribonuclease, reducing the abundance of hundreds of mRNAs, particularly those involved in signaling pathways and neurological functions, although it does not exhibit deadenylase activity in vitro (Abshire2020Differentiala).

Nocturnin also acts as an NADP(H) phosphatase, directly influencing cellular NADP(H) levels. It dephosphorylates NADP+ and NADPH, affecting cellular pools of NADH and NAD+ when over-expressed in the cytoplasm, and decreases NADP+ and NADPH levels when localized to mitochondria (Laothamatas2019Spatiotemporal; Abshire2020Differentiala). This activity is crucial for its role in oxidative stress response and metabolism, impacting processes like glycolysis, beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation (Laothamatas2019Spatiotemporal; Abshire2020Differentiala).

The localization of Nocturnin, whether in the cytoplasm or mitochondria, is essential for its function, as it modulates mRNA and NADP(H) metabolism based on its intracellular positioning (Abshire2020Differentiala).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOCT gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. NOCT is involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and its dysregulation can contribute to conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Studies have shown that NOCT knockout mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis, suggesting that NOCT plays a role in promoting lipid accumulation and adipogenesis (Abshire2018The; Green2007Loss). These mice also exhibit increased bone density and reduced bone marrow adiposity, indicating that NOCT negatively regulates osteogenesis while promoting adipogenesis (Abshire2020Differential; Kawai2010A).

NOCT's interaction with the circadian clock is significant, as it regulates the conversion of NADP+ to NAD+ and NADPH to NADH, processes crucial for energy metabolism. This interaction suggests that NOCT may influence metabolic processes in a circadian manner, potentially affecting conditions like insulin resistance and glucose metabolism (Estrella2019The). The gene's role in neuronal functions and its potential impact on neurological disorders such as intellectual disability and epilepsy have also been noted, although these associations require further investigation (Abshire2020Differentiala; Abshire2020Differential).

## Interactions
NOCT (nocturnin) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its function in cellular processes. NOCT has been shown to interact with proteins involved in metabolic processes rather than RNA-binding proteins, suggesting its role in metabolism across different cellular compartments such as the mitochondria, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum (Laothamatas2019Spatiotemporal). 

In terms of protein interactions, NOCT has been reported to physically interact with PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, potentially enhancing PPARγ2 nuclear entry, although the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear (Hughes2018Regulatory). NOCT may also interact with the CNOT complex, a multiprotein complex involved in mRNA decay, although the structural basis for this interaction is not fully understood (Hughes2018Regulatory).

NOCT's enzymatic activity is influenced by its interactions with other proteins, which may modulate its specificity and affinity for target mRNAs. This suggests that NOCT might require protein partners to fully exert its regulatory functions, similar to other deadenylases (Hughes2018Regulatory). Despite its structural similarity to other deadenylases, NOCT does not degrade poly-A RNA, indicating it may have unique substrate interactions or require additional factors for activity (Estrella2018Crystal).
