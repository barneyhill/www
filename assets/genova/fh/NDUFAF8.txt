# NDUFAF8

## Overview
NDUFAF8 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 8, which is integral to the assembly of Complex I (CI) in the electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial assembly factor and is part of the Cx9C protein family, characterized by a twin Cx9C motif that typically resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Alston2020Pathogenic; Formosa2018Building). NDUFAF8 interacts with NDUFAF5, a putative methyltransferase, playing a critical role in stabilizing this protein and facilitating the assembly and function of CI (Pei2021Human; Floyd2016Mitochondrial). Mutations or alterations in NDUFAF8 expression are linked to mitochondrial disorders, such as Leigh syndrome, due to its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (CabreraOrefice2022Complexome; Alston2021The).

## Structure
The NDUFAF8 protein is a mitochondrial assembly factor involved in the assembly of complex I of the electron transport chain. It belongs to the Cx9C protein family and contains a twin Cx9C motif, which is characteristic of proteins residing in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Alston2020Pathogenic; Formosa2018Building). The protein's structure includes a helical domain that forms part of a hairpin structure, which is important for its interaction with NDUFAF5 (Alston2020Pathogenic). 

The Phe55 residue within NDUFAF8 is critical for protein-protein interactions and stability, similar to other Cx9C family members (Alston2020Pathogenic). A likely pathogenic mutation, F55L, is located near its interaction site with NDUFAF5, indicating the importance of this residue in maintaining structural integrity (Pei2021Human). 

NDUFAF8 interacts with NDUFAF5, and this interaction is crucial for the stability and assembly of complex I. Structural models suggest that NDUFAF8 interacts with an α-helix before the last β-strand of NDUFAF5, far from the active site, indicating a specific interaction site that is essential for its function (Pei2021Human).

## Function
NDUFAF8, also known as C17orf89, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of Complex I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It interacts with the known CI assembly factor NDUFAF5, and this interaction is essential for maintaining CI activity. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing NDUFAF8 expression leads to a significant decrease in CI activity and subunit levels, as well as a reduction in oxygen consumption rates, indicating its crucial role in maintaining CI function (Floyd2016Mitochondrial). NDUFAF8 stabilizes NDUFAF5, suggesting that its role in CI assembly involves the direct stabilization of this protein (Formosa2018Building).

NDUFAF8 contains a twin CX9C motif, which is likely located in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. It is unclear how NDUFAF8 stabilizes the matrix-localized NDUFAF5, but it may exert a complex-stabilizing effect through the inner membrane (Formosa2018Building). The protein's involvement in CI assembly and function highlights its importance in cellular respiration and energy production, which are vital for the proper functioning of healthy human cells (Floyd2016Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NDUFAF8 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can lead to severe mitochondrial dysfunction. This deficiency is linked to conditions such as Leigh syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by symptoms like acute encephalopathy, seizures, and spasticity. In one study, a patient exhibited an 80% reduction in NDUFAF8 expression, presenting with Leigh syndrome symptoms and an isolated complex I defect in muscle biopsy (Floyd2016Mitochondrial). 

NDUFAF8 is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, and its disruption can result in a global reduction of complex I subunits, as demonstrated by proteomic analyses. This reduction affects the assembly of the respirasome, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Alston2021The). A recurrent deep intronic splicing variant in NDUFAF8 has been identified, which results in the loss of the predominant transcript and protein, further contributing to mitochondrial disease (Alston2021The).

Despite extensive sequencing efforts, no pathogenic mutations in NDUFAF8 were identified in some cohorts, suggesting that expression level alterations rather than direct mutations might be responsible for the clinical phenotypes observed (Formosa2018Building).

## Interactions
NDUFAF8, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 8, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of Complex I (CI) of the electron transport chain. It is known to interact with NDUFAF5, a putative methyltransferase essential for the early stages of CI assembly. This interaction is significant as it suggests that NDUFAF8 may facilitate the methyltransferase activity of NDUFAF5 or serve as its substrate (Pei2021Human; Floyd2016Mitochondrial). 

NDUFAF8 is also necessary for the stability of NDUFAF5, as knockdown of NDUFAF8 results in reduced complex I activity and decreased steady-state levels of NDUFAF5 (Formosa2018Building). The interaction between NDUFAF8 and NDUFAF5 has been confirmed through coevolution analysis and structure modeling, indicating distinct roles in CI assembly (Pei2021Human). 

Mutations in NDUFAF8 have been linked to mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome, which is characterized by isolated CI deficiency. Complexome profiling of patient fibroblasts with NDUFAF8 mutations showed decreased abundance of CI-containing supercomplexes, highlighting its role in early CI assembly (CabreraOrefice2022Complexome).
