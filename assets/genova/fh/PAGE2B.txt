# PAGE2B

## Overview
PAGE2B is a gene that encodes the protein PAGE family member 2B, which is part of the broader PAGE (P antigen family, member 2) family of proteins. These proteins are typically characterized by their expression in various cancer types and are considered cancer/testis antigens due to their restricted expression pattern in normal tissues, primarily in the testis, and aberrant expression in tumors. The PAGE2B protein is implicated in cellular processes related to tumorigenesis and may play a role in the regulation of gene expression within cancer cells. Its expression and potential involvement in cancer pathways make it a subject of interest for cancer research and potential therapeutic targeting (Qiu2020aarFDC).
