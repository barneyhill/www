# ACADL

## Overview
The ACADL gene encodes the enzyme long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the initial step in the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids, converting them into acetyl-CoA units for energy production. LCAD is a homotetrameric protein, with each subunit containing a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule essential for its activity. The enzyme's broad substrate specificity allows it to metabolize various fatty acids, including long, medium, unsaturated, and branched-chain types. ACADL's function is particularly vital in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart and muscles, where it helps maintain metabolic homeostasis and supports normal cardiac function (Narayanan2024Structural; Wang2023The).

## Structure
The ACADL protein, also known as long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), is a homotetrameric enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Each subunit of the tetramer is approximately 43 kDa and contains a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Narayanan2024Structural; Beck2020The). The protein structure is organized into three domains: an N-terminal α-helical domain, a β-sheet domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain (Narayanan2024Structural).

The catalytic residue Glu291 plays a crucial role in the enzyme's function by facilitating proton abstraction from the substrate. The presence of Pro132 near the start of the E helix causes helix unwinding, which allows the binding of bulky substrates and contributes to the enzyme's broad substrate specificity (Narayanan2024Structural). The LCAD enzyme has a large substrate-binding cavity, which is uncommon among eukaryotic acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, enabling it to metabolize a variety of substrates, including long, medium, unsaturated, and branched-chain fatty acids (Narayanan2024Structural).

A common polymorphism, K333Q, affects the stability and function of LCAD by impairing FAD binding, leading to reduced enzymatic activity (Beck2020The). Despite these structural insights, no LCAD-deficient patients have been reported, suggesting its essential role in human metabolism (Beck2020The).

## Function
ACADL (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway, which is essential for the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units. This process is vital for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and muscles (Wang2023The). ACADL is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it facilitates the conversion of fatty acids into energy, thereby maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Wang2023The).

In healthy human cells, ACADL is involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a crucial metabolic process that provides energy for cardiac cells. The enzyme's activity ensures a balance between glycolysis and FAO, which is important for maintaining cardiac metabolic balance and function (Wang2023The). ACADL's role in FAO is particularly significant in cardiomyocytes, where it helps regulate energy production and supports normal cardiac function (Wang2023The).

The expression of ACADL is regulated by the transcription factor KLF7, which can directly target ACADL to influence its expression. This regulation is important for maintaining proper fatty acid metabolism in the heart (Wang2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The ACADL gene, encoding the enzyme long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), plays a critical role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Alterations in ACADL expression or function can lead to significant clinical consequences. Although no specific pathogenic mutations in the human ACADL gene have been identified, its deficiency in mouse models has been linked to severe metabolic disturbances, including hypoglycemia, hepatic and cardiac lipidosis, and impaired insulin sensitivity (Kurtz1998Targeted; Zhang2007Mitochondrial). These models also exhibit fasting intolerance and increased serum free fatty acids, suggesting potential implications for similar conditions in humans (Kurtz1998Targeted).

ACADL is also implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers, such as breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. Its dysregulation can influence cancer development and outcomes, with its role varying depending on the specific cancer context (Gu2024Transcriptomic). Additionally, ACADL is involved in the TNF signaling pathway, which affects intramuscular adipocyte differentiation, indicating its broader impact on lipid metabolism and related disorders (Li2023ACADL). The gene's expression levels have been associated with atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for these conditions (Gu2024Transcriptomic).
