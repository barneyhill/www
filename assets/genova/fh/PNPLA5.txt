# PNPLA5

## Overview
PNPLA5 is a gene that encodes the protein patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 5, which is a member of the patatin-like phospholipase family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and autophagy, functioning as a triacylglycerol hydrolase. It is localized to lipid droplets within cells, where it plays a critical role in the mobilization of triglycerides, thereby regulating lipid storage and energy homeostasis. The protein's activity is essential for the formation of autophagosomes, as it facilitates the consumption of lipid droplets and the turnover of triglycerides, providing necessary components for autophagosomal membrane formation. PNPLA5's involvement in lipid metabolism and autophagy underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance (Dupont2014Neutral; Lulić2023The; Murugesan2013Identification).

## Structure
PNPLA5, also known as GS2-like, is a protein composed of 429 amino acids. It features a patatin domain located within the residues 12-181 of the N-terminal domain, which contains the active site. This domain includes a catalytic dyad formed by Serine 49 and Aspartic acid 168, with lipase motifs GSSSG and DGA (Lulić2023The). The protein structure is similar to other members of the PNPLA family, characterized by an α/β fold structure in the patatin-like domain, which is typical for enzymes in this family (Lulić2023The).

PNPLA5 binds to lipid droplets in cells through conserved arginine or positively charged amino acids located at positions 358-361 in its sequence (Lulić2023The). It is expressed in various tissues, with peak expression in the brain and pituitary gland, and its expression levels vary with nutritional states and during adipocyte differentiation (Lulić2023The). The protein exhibits triacylglycerol hydrolase activity and plays a role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the formation of autophagosome bilayer membranes (Lulić2023The). Specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PNPLA5 is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and autophagy in healthy human cells. It is a member of the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein family and is primarily localized to lipid droplets (LDs) within cells. PNPLA5 is involved in the mobilization of triglycerides stored in these lipid droplets, contributing to the regulation of lipid storage and energy homeostasis (Murugesan2013Identification).

The protein exhibits triacylglycerol hydrolase activity, which is essential for the optimal initiation of autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components. PNPLA5 facilitates the formation of autophagosomes by regulating lipid droplet consumption and triglyceride turnover, providing necessary components for autophagosomal membrane formation and growth (Lulić2023The; Dupont2014Neutral).

PNPLA5 also plays a role in generating diacylglycerol (DAG), which is crucial for the synthesis of phospholipids needed for autophagosomal membranes. This activity is associated with the Kennedy pathway and the Lands cycle, which are important for autophagy induction (Dupont2014Neutral). The protein's function in lipid metabolism and autophagy highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PNPLA5 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. Variants of PNPLA5 have been associated with dyslipidemia, particularly affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Specific mutations such as Cys68Phe, His87Asn, and others are linked to high LDL-C levels, while Gln99His and Phe150Leu are associated with low LDL-C levels, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism disorders (Mikhailova2019Genes).

PNPLA5 knockout studies in rats have demonstrated that the absence of this gene leads to significant changes in lipid profiles, including increased total cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreased LDL-C levels. These alterations suggest that PNPLA5 is crucial for maintaining normal lipid metabolism and its disruption can lead to metabolic imbalances (LIU2017PNPLA5knockout).

Additionally, PNPLA5 is implicated in autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis. Alterations in PNPLA5 expression can impact autophagosome formation, potentially affecting conditions related to lipid storage and metabolism, such as obesity and diabetes (Dupont2014Neutral). The gene's role in lipid droplet regulation and autophagy highlights its importance in preventing lipotoxicity and maintaining cellular lipid balance (Dupont2014Neutral).

## Interactions
PNPLA5 interacts with lipid droplets (LDs) through a charge-dependent lipid droplet targeting motif (LTM) located in its C-terminal domain. This motif is crucial for PNPLA5's binding to LDs and involves basic patches that may form part of an amphipathic helix, facilitating interaction with negatively charged membrane surfaces (Murugesan2013Identification). The localization of PNPLA5 to LDs is cell autonomous and may be influenced by the physiological state of the cell, although it is not affected by PKA activators or inhibitors (Murugesan2013Identification).

PNPLA5 also plays a role in autophagy, particularly in the biogenesis of autophagosomes. It is involved in the degradation of various autophagic substrates, including lipid droplets, and affects the degradation of the autophagic adaptor Sequestosome-1/p62 (Dupont2014Neutral). PNPLA5 colocalizes with ATG16L1 on lipid droplets, indicating a potential interaction or co-localization with this autophagy-related protein (Dupont2014Neutral). This suggests that PNPLA5 may interact with components of the autophagy machinery, particularly in the context of lipid droplet metabolism and autophagosome formation (Dupont2014Neutral).
