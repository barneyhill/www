# DTYMK

## Overview
DTYMK is a gene that encodes the enzyme deoxythymidylate kinase, a crucial component in nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a kinase, specifically involved in the phosphorylation of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) to deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP), a key step in the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), which is essential for DNA synthesis and repair (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate; Vanoevelen2021DTYMK). The activity of deoxythymidylate kinase is vital for maintaining a balanced pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), ensuring genomic stability and proper cell division, particularly in rapidly proliferating cells (Zhao2022Pancancer; Frisk2022Differential). Mutations in the DTYMK gene have been associated with severe neurodegenerative disorders, while its expression levels have implications in cancer prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance (He2021MiR148b3p; Vanoevelen2021DTYMK).

## Structure
DTYMK (deoxythymidylate kinase) is an enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism, specifically catalyzing the phosphorylation of deoxy-TMP to deoxy-TDP. The primary structure of DTYMK consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's stability and function. The tertiary structure of DTYMK is characterized by the three-dimensional folding of the protein, often stabilized by disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This folding is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity and substrate specificity.

DTYMK contains specific domains, such as the P-loop NTPase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic function. This domain is involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, playing a critical role in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in DTYMK, potentially affecting its activity and interactions with other molecules.

Splice variant isoforms of DTYMK may exist, leading to alterations in its structure and function. These isoforms can result in variations in the enzyme's activity, stability, and interaction with other cellular components, thereby influencing nucleotide metabolism pathways.

## Function
The DTYMK gene encodes the enzyme deoxythymidylate kinase, which plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) to deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP) (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate; Vanoevelen2021DTYMK). This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), an essential building block for DNA synthesis and repair (Zhao2022Pancancer; Vanoevelen2021DTYMK). DTYMK is involved in both the de novo and salvage pathways of dTTP synthesis, ensuring a balanced pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) necessary for maintaining genome integrity (Vanoevelen2021DTYMK; Frisk2022Differential).

In healthy human cells, DTYMK activity is vital for proper DNA replication and repair, supporting cell proliferation and survival (Vanoevelen2021DTYMK). The enzyme's function is particularly important in rapidly dividing cells, where the demand for DNA synthesis is high (Zhao2022Pancancer). DTYMK is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools, which is crucial for preventing genomic instability and ensuring proper cell division (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate; Vanoevelen2021DTYMK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DTYMK gene are linked to severe neurodegenerative disorders characterized by early-onset symptoms such as microcephaly, growth retardation, and minimal neurodevelopment. These mutations result in reduced activity of the deoxythymidine monophosphate kinase enzyme, leading to impaired DNA replication and increased genome instability. Affected individuals exhibit severe cerebral atrophy and disappearance of the basal ganglia, as observed in brain imaging studies (Vanoevelen2021DTYMK). 

In cancer, DTYMK expression is often upregulated and associated with poor prognosis in various types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. High DTYMK expression correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, affecting the tumor microenvironment and contributing to cancer progression (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate; He2021MiR148b3p). In hepatocellular carcinoma, DTYMK acts as an oncogene, with its knockdown significantly suppressing tumor growth and metastasis (He2021MiR148b3p).

The gene's expression levels also serve as a prognostic marker in several cancers, with higher expression linked to worse overall survival and shorter relapse-free survival in multiple cancer types (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DTYMK in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
DTYMK (deoxythymidylate kinase) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication. It interacts strongly with thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) as part of a protein-protein interaction network, which is significant in the context of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate). The STRING database has been used to generate a protein-protein interaction network for DTYMK, revealing interactions with proteins involved in pyrimidine metabolism, specifically in the synthesis of dUMP, dTTP, and dTMP (Zhou2022Relationship).

DTYMK also plays a role in DNA double-strand break repair through interactions with ribonucleotide reductase, which restricts dUTP incorporation into DNA, thereby maintaining genome stability (Lan2022Deoxythymidylate). In hepatocellular carcinoma, DTYMK interacts with miR-378a-3p, influencing the expression of MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) and affecting the phospho-heat shock protein 27 (phospho-HSP27)/nuclear factor NF-kappaB (NF-κB) axis, which contributes to drug resistance and tumor cell proliferation (Sun2021Inhibition). These interactions highlight DTYMK's involvement in complex regulatory networks that impact cancer progression and treatment response.
