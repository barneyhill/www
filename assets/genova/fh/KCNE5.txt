# KCNE5

## Overview
The KCNE5 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 5, a protein that plays a crucial role in cardiac electrophysiology by modulating the function of voltage-gated potassium channels. As a regulatory subunit, KCNE5 influences the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (I_Ks) in cardiac cells, primarily through its interaction with the KCNQ1 channel. This interaction is significant for cardiac repolarization and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm, as KCNE5 acts as a down-regulating β-subunit, suppressing the I_Ks current and thereby affecting the electrical excitability of cardiac cells (Ravn2008Gain; Abbott2016KCNE4). The protein is expressed in various regions of the heart, including the atria and ventricles, and is involved in modulating the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation, which is essential for preventing arrhythmias (David2018Deletion). Mutations in KCNE5 have been linked to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and Brugada syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Ravn2008Gain; Ohno2011KCNE5).

## Function
The KCNE5 gene encodes a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically influencing the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (I_Ks) in cardiac cells. In healthy human cells, KCNE5 coexpresses with KCNQ1, the gene encoding the α-subunit of the I_Ks channel, and acts to suppress the I_Ks current. This suppression is thought to occur through a competitive interaction with the KCNE1 β-subunit, which stimulates I_Ks. The function of KCNE5 as a down-regulating β-subunit suggests its role in modulating cardiac repolarization and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm (Ravn2008Gain).

KCNE5 is expressed in both the right and left atria and ventricles of the heart, with its mRNA levels believed to be higher than those of KCNE2. The protein is primarily active in the cell membrane, contributing to the regulation of cardiac action potentials and overall heart function (Ravn2008Gain). By modulating the activity of potassium channels, KCNE5 influences the electrical excitability of cells, altering the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac electrical activity and preventing arrhythmias (David2018Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNE5 gene are associated with several cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and Brugada syndrome (BrS). These conditions are linked to alterations in cardiac ion channel behavior, which can predispose individuals to arrhythmogenic conditions. For instance, the KCNE5-L65F mutation has been identified in patients with AF and is associated with a gain of function in the I_Ks current, potentially contributing to the development of AF (Ravn2008Gain). Other mutations, such as D92E/E93X, have been linked to BrS and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF), with studies showing that these variants can increase the transient outward current (I_to), potentially causing BrS and IVF, particularly in male patients (Ohno2011KCNE5).

The deletion of KCNE5 in mice has been shown to augment ventricular K_V currents, leading to ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular premature beats and increased susceptibility to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. This suggests that KCNE5 plays a critical role in maintaining normal cardiac electrical activity, and its disruption can lead to arrhythmias (David2018Deletion). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNE5 in cardiac arrhythmias and underscore the importance of understanding its role in cardiac electrophysiology.

## Interactions
KCNE5, also known as potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 5, is involved in modulating the function of various voltage-gated potassium channels. It interacts with the KCNQ1 channel, significantly shifting the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 activation by approximately +140 mV, which renders the channel nonfunctional at physiological membrane potentials. This interaction affects KCNQ1 gating kinetics in a temperature-dependent manner, slowing activation and accelerating deactivation at room temperature, while speeding both processes at 37°C (Abbott2016KCNE4).

KCNE5 also interacts with Kv4.3 channels, where it accelerates the inactivation of Kv4.3/KChIP2 currents. This interaction is significant in cardiac electrophysiology, as it modulates the transient outward current (I_to) crucial for myocardial repolarization (Ohno2011KCNE5). KCNE5's regulatory role extends to inhibiting KCNQ4 activity by approximately 65% in CHO cells, although no effects were observed in oocytes (Abbott2016KCNE4).

In the context of atrial fibrillation, a mutation in KCNE5 (L65F) is associated with a gain of function in the I_Ks current, indicating that KCNE5 can modulate the function of repolarizing K+ channels by acting as a down-regulating β-subunit to the KCNQ1 α-subunit (Ravn2008Gain).
