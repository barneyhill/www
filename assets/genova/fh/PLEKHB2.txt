# PLEKHB2

## Overview
PLEKHB2, or pleckstrin homology domain containing B2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to intracellular transport and cellular signaling. The protein, characterized by its pleckstrin homology domain, plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of recycling endosomes, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and membrane dynamics (Corsello2022Respiratory). This domain facilitates interactions with phosphoinositides and other proteins, implicating PLEKHB2 in cytoskeletal organization and signaling pathways. The gene has been associated with several clinical conditions, including neurological and developmental disorders linked to a recurrent microdeletion at chromosome 2q21.1 (Gimelli2013Recurrent). Additionally, PLEKHB2 is implicated in the host immune response to infections such as tuberculosis and respiratory syncytial virus, highlighting its potential role in immune regulation (Corsello2022Respiratory; Lesho2011Transcriptional). Furthermore, its involvement in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through differential expression of associated long non-coding RNAs suggests a broader impact on disease pathology (Durinck2014The).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The PLEKHB2 gene is implicated in various neurological and developmental disorders due to its involvement in a recurrent microdeletion at chromosome 2q21.1. This deletion, which includes PLEKHB2 among other genes, is associated with conditions such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and behavioral problems. The deletion is often inherited, as seen in a case where a 4-year-old boy with these symptoms inherited the deletion from his father, who also had a history of bipolar disorder (Gimelli2013Recurrent). 

In the context of tuberculosis, PLEKHB2 is one of the genes uniquely upregulated in individuals with active TB, suggesting a role in the host's transcriptional response to infection (Lesho2011Transcriptional). 

Additionally, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a long non-coding RNA associated with PLEKHB2, known as lnc-PLEKHB2-1, is differentially expressed, indicating a potential role in the disease's pathology through Notch signaling pathways (Durinck2014The). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both neurological disorders and immune responses, although its specific functions in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
PLEKHB2, or pleckstrin homology domain containing B2, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. One of its known roles is in the retrograde transport of recycling endosomes, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and membrane dynamics (Corsello2022Respiratory). The protein's pleckstrin homology domain is likely responsible for these interactions, as this domain is known for binding phosphoinositides and proteins, facilitating its involvement in cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal organization.

In the context of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, PLEKHB2 has been identified as a target of upregulated piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in airway epithelial cells. This suggests that PLEKHB2 may play a role in the cellular response to viral infections, potentially through its interactions with other proteins involved in endosomal and intracellular transport (Corsello2022Respiratory).

Additionally, PLEKHB2 is one of the genes uniquely upregulated in the active tuberculosis group, indicating its potential involvement in the host's immune response to infection (Lesho2011Transcriptional). However, specific protein interactions involving PLEKHB2 in these contexts have not been detailed in the available literature.
