# PLCD1

## Overview
Phospholipase C delta 1 (PLCD1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase C delta 1, a critical component in cellular signal transduction pathways. This enzyme belongs to the phospholipase family and is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which serve as secondary messengers in calcium signaling (Fukami2010Phospholipase). The protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including pleckstrin homology (PH), EF hand motifs, catalytic X and Y domains, and a C2 domain, which facilitate its interaction with cellular membranes and calcium ions (Nomikos2016Mutations). PLCD1 plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including keratinocyte differentiation and nail formation, and is expressed in multiple tissues such as the skin and brain (Fukami2010Phospholipase; Kiuru2011Hereditary). Additionally, PLCD1 functions as a tumor suppressor, interacting with several proteins to modulate pathways involved in cancer cell migration and invasion (Shao2017Phospholipase). Mutations in the PLCD1 gene are linked to hereditary conditions such as leukonychia and trichilemmal cysts, highlighting its clinical significance (Kiuru2011Hereditary; Hörer2019A).

## Structure
Phospholipase C delta 1 (PLCD1) is a multi-domain enzyme with a well-defined three-dimensional structure. It consists of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, two EF hand motifs, X and Y catalytic domains, and a C-terminal C2 domain (Nomikos2016Mutations). The PH domain is responsible for binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), anchoring PLCD1 to phospholipid membranes and enhancing PIP2 hydrolysis rates (Kanemaru2023Activation). The EF hand domains contain calcium-binding residues and are crucial for the enzyme's activity and structural stability (Nomikos2016Mutations). The catalytic domain features a unique split triose isomerase (TIM) barrel structure, with X and Y regions joined by an auto-inhibitory XY linker containing a calcium-binding site (Nomikos2016Mutations). The C2 domain is involved in calcium-dependent membrane binding, forming a ternary complex with phosphatidylserine to enhance enzymatic activity (Nomikos2016Mutations).

PLCD1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. The enzyme also has splice variants, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Nakamura2013Physiological). The molecular weight of the expressed PLCD1 isoform is approximately 85.5 kDa (Ghosh1997Phospholipase).

## Function
PLCD1 encodes the phospholipase C delta 1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in intracellular signal transduction by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These products act as secondary messengers in calcium signaling pathways, influencing various cellular functions such as cell growth, differentiation, and motility (Fukami2010Phospholipase). 

In healthy human cells, PLCD1 is involved in the differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. This process is regulated by extracellular calcium levels, with PLCD1 facilitating calcium mobilization necessary for proper epidermal differentiation (Nakamura2013Physiological; Fukami2010Phospholipase). PLCD1 is also implicated in nail formation, as it is localized in the nail matrix and nail bed, playing a role in nail health and growth (Kiuru2011Hereditary).

PLCD1's activity is not limited to the skin; it is also expressed in other tissues, such as the brain, where it may contribute to neuronal functions (Fukami2010Phospholipase). The enzyme's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its importance in normal physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLCD1 gene are associated with several hereditary conditions. Hereditary leukonychia, also known as porcelain nails, is a rare nail disorder caused by mutations in PLCD1. These mutations lead to reduced enzymatic activity of the phospholipase C delta 1 enzyme, which is crucial for nail matrix function and nail plate formation. Specific mutations identified include c.1309C>T, p.Arg437X, c.1792-10delTGTAGTGGCC, c.1720C>T, p.Ala574Thr, and c.625T>C, p.Cys209Arg, which have been observed in families with either autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant inheritance patterns (Kiuru2011Hereditary).

PLCD1 mutations are also implicated in hereditary trichilemmal cysts, a condition characterized by cyst formation in hair follicles. A monoallelic two-hit mechanism involving somatic mutations, such as c.2234C>T, p.Ser745Leu, has been identified as a genetic driver for cyst development (Hörer2019A).

In familial multiple pilomatricomas, a germline missense variant c.1186G>A (p.Glu396Lys) in PLCD1 leads to a gain-of-function, increasing enzymatic activity and contributing to the development of benign skin tumors through altered calcium signaling pathways (Liu2021Germline).

## Interactions
Phospholipase C delta 1 (PLCD1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor. PLCD1 interacts with KIF3A, a protein that promotes cell migration and invasion. This interaction is significant in breast cancer, where PLCD1 suppresses KIF3A expression, thereby inhibiting the ERK1/2/β-catenin/MMP7 signaling pathway, which is associated with cancer cell migration and invasion (Shao2017Phospholipase).

In renal cell carcinoma, PLCD1 interacts with components of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. It antagonizes this pathway by suppressing the transcriptional activities of downstream target genes such as MMP7, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1, and reducing active β-catenin levels (Xie2023Phospholipase).

PLCD1 also forms a complex with the DLC1 protein in lung cancer cells. This interaction involves the START domain of DLC1, which binds to PLCD1 and is essential for DLC1's tumor suppressor activity. The interaction is enhanced by phosphatidylserine (PS) binding, which increases the recruitment of DLC1 to the membrane and strengthens its interaction with PLCD1 (SanchezSolana2021The).
