# SLC22A2

## Overview
The SLC22A2 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), a transmembrane protein that is a member of the solute carrier family 22. This protein is primarily expressed in the kidneys, where it plays a critical role in the renal handling of organic cations, including various drugs and endogenous compounds. OCT2 is characterized by its 12 α-helical transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of substrates across cell membranes via an alternating-access mechanism (Volk2013OCTs; Jacobsson2007Identification). Beyond the kidneys, OCT2 is also expressed in other tissues such as the brain, where it influences neurotransmitter regulation and drug transport (Volk2013OCTs). The gene's polymorphisms have significant clinical implications, affecting drug disposition and toxicity, particularly in the context of medications like metformin and cisplatin (Filipski2009Contribution; Zazuli2020The).

## Structure
The SLC22A2 protein, also known as organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), is a transmembrane protein that is part of the solute carrier family 22. It is characterized by 12 α-helical transmembrane domains, which are typical of the major facilitator superfamily (Volk2013OCTs; Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein structure includes a large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane domains and a large intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (Volk2013OCTs; Jacobsson2007Identification). The extracellular loop is glycosylated, which may play a role in oligomerization and affect transport activity (Volk2013OCTs).

The SLC22A2 protein's tertiary structure has been modeled using homology modeling methods, as its structure has not been experimentally resolved. The predicted 3D structure was assessed using quality analysis tools, indicating reliability for simulations (AbrahamsOctober2022The). The protein's binding pocket is formed by several transmembrane domains and is involved in substrate binding and translocation, operating via an alternating-access mechanism (Volk2013OCTs). The protein is primarily expressed in the kidneys and liver, where it plays a crucial role in the transport of organic cations (Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Function
The SLC22A2 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is primarily expressed in the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubules. OCT2 plays a crucial role in the renal handling of organic cations, facilitating their uptake from the blood into renal tubular epithelial cells. This process is essential for the clearance of a wide array of compounds, including drugs like metformin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin, as well as endogenous bioactive amines such as dopamine and norepinephrine (fukushimaUesaka2004Fourteen; Volk2013OCTs; Yee2021Emerging).

OCT2 is also expressed in other tissues, including the brain, where it may help regulate extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations and facilitate drug transport across the blood-brain barrier (Volk2013OCTs). In the brain, OCT2 is involved in the transport of biogenic amines and neurotransmitters, impacting neurological processes and potentially influencing behavior (Nigam2018The). The transporter is also present in the lung, placenta, small intestine, thymus, and inner ear, where it contributes to various physiological processes (Volk2013OCTs).

OCT2's function in healthy human cells is primarily related to the transport and regulation of organic cations and neurotransmitters, impacting both kidney function and central nervous system activities (Nigam2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC22A2 gene, which encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), have significant clinical implications, particularly in drug disposition and toxicity. The rs316019 (A270S) polymorphism is associated with variable effects on metformin transport and renal clearance, with some studies indicating lower clearance and others higher clearance in different populations. This polymorphism is also linked to differing risks of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, with some studies suggesting a protective effect and others indicating increased risk (Filipski2009Contribution; Zazuli2020The).

The rs596881 polymorphism is noted for its renoprotective effect, preserving the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Zazuli2020The). Other less common polymorphisms, such as rs8177516 (R400S) and rs8177517 (K432Q), show reduced transporter activity, potentially affecting drug response (Cheong2011Screening).

SLC22A2 polymorphisms can influence the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of metformin, a drug used for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Individuals homozygous for the low activity variant, 270S, have significantly lower renal clearance rates and higher plasma concentrations of metformin compared to those with the active variant, 270A (Cheong2011Screening). Additionally, the 808G/T variant is associated with higher blood lactate levels and an increased incidence of hyperlactacidemia in metformin-treated patients (Li2010SLC22A2).

## Interactions
The SLC22A2 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is known to form homodimers. This dimerization has been demonstrated using techniques such as the two-hybrid system and Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), with interaction sites identified between amino acids 50 and 152 (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). The transporter also interacts with other proteins, including lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 4 alpha (LAPTM4A) and CD63. Interaction with LAPTM4A occurs in lysosomes and late endosomes, leading to the degradation of OCT2 via endocytosis. The interaction with CD63 is crucial for the proper expression of OCT2 at the plasma membrane and affects its trafficking (Zhang2019Proteinprotein).

In addition to these interactions, the cysteine residues in the extracellular loop of OCT2 are important for its oligomerization. These residues form disulfide bonds that contribute to the formation of stable dimers or higher oligomeric forms, as shown by Western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions (Brast2011The). These oligomeric forms are not artifacts of overexpression and occur naturally in human kidney tissue (Brast2011The).
