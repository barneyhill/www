# DRICH1

## Overview
DRICH1 is a gene that encodes the protein aspartate rich 1, which is notable for its high aspartate content. This protein is implicated in the regulation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), where it plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The aspartate rich 1 protein is thought to participate in protein-protein interactions and gene regulation, potentially through mechanisms involving DNA or RNA mimicry. The gene's influence extends to several key signaling pathways, including Wnt, cadherin, integrin, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), which are vital for maintaining pluripotency and directing cell fate decisions in hPSCs. The loss of DRICH1 leads to significant transcriptional changes, affecting the pluripotency phenotype and impacting both ectoderm and mesoderm lineages, underscoring its essential role in stem cell biology (Mair2019Essential).

## Function
The DRICH1 gene, also known as C22orf43, is a critical regulator of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). It plays a significant role in cell proliferation, as its loss leads to a strong proliferative defect in these cells. DRICH1 is characterized by a high content of aspartate residues, which suggests its involvement in protein-protein interactions and gene regulation through DNA or RNA mimicry (Mair2019Essential).

RNA sequencing of cells with reduced DRICH1 expression has shown significant changes in gene expression, with numerous differentially expressed genes. The upregulated genes are enriched in pathways such as Wnt, cadherin, and integrin signaling, which are crucial for the maintenance and pluripotency of hPSCs. DRICH1 also influences transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) signaling and affects the expression of several potential effector genes, including GREM1 and TBX6, which are involved in cell fate decisions and mesoderm differentiation, respectively (Mair2019Essential).

The loss of DRICH1 results in transcriptional changes that suggest a remodeling of the pluripotency phenotype, impacting both ectoderm and mesoderm lineages. This indicates that DRICH1 is essential for maintaining the pluripotency and differentiation potential of hPSCs, playing a role in major signaling pathways and cellular processes (Mair2019Essential).
