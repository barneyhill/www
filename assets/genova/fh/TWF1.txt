# TWF1

## Overview
The TWF1 gene encodes the twinfilin actin binding protein 1, a critical component in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. Twinfilin is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is characterized by its two actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domains, which facilitate its interaction with actin monomers. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as motility, shape maintenance, and division by promoting actin filament turnover and regulating actin dynamics at cellular structures like lamellipodia and endocytic actin structures (Hakala2021Twinfilin). Twinfilin's interactions with capping protein (CP) and other actin-associated proteins underscore its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of the actin cytoskeleton (Johnston2018A). The clinical significance of TWF1 is highlighted by its involvement in cancer progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Huo2021A; Bockhorn2013MicroRNA30c).

## Structure
Twinfilin actin binding protein 1 (TWF1) is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes two actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domains. These domains are crucial for binding actin monomers and play a significant role in actin filament dynamics (Vartiainen2000Mouse; Hakala2021Twinfilin). The protein adopts an elongated structure, with the two ADF-H domains connected by a linker region that includes an α-helix. This helix extends across the capping protein (CP) cap and contacts both actin subunits, stabilizing the complex (Mwangangi2021The).

The C-terminal tail of TWF1 contains a CPI-motif, which is essential for its high-affinity interaction with CP. This region is involved in binding to the CP β-subunit, a common site for proteins with CP interaction motifs (Falck2004Biological; Takeda2021Structural). The C-terminal tail is also critical for twinfilin's ability to uncap actin filament barbed ends, promoting actin filament turnover (Hakala2021Twinfilin).

TWF1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity. Additionally, splice variants of TWF1 can result in isoforms with different functional properties, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
Twinfilin actin binding protein 1 (TWF1) plays a crucial role in actin filament dynamics, which are essential for various cellular processes such as motility, shape maintenance, and division. TWF1 is involved in the regulation of actin filament turnover by promoting the disassembly of actin filaments at the lamellipodia, a region critical for cell movement and structural changes (Hakala2021Twinfilin). It achieves this by uncapping filament barbed ends, allowing for depolymerization, and sequestering actin monomers to inhibit polymerization (Mwangangi2021The; Hakala2021Twinfilin).

TWF1 interacts with capping protein (CP) to regulate actin dynamics. It binds to CP, affecting its localization and dynamics at the leading edge of lamellipodia, and facilitates CP dissociation from actin filaments, which is crucial for actin network turnover (Johnston2018A; Hakala2021Twinfilin). TWF1's activity is not limited to lamellipodia; it also plays a role in endocytic actin structures and other cellular processes, contributing to the organization and turnover of actin networks (Hakala2021Twinfilin). This regulation of actin dynamics by TWF1 is vital for maintaining cellular functions such as motility and structural integrity (Hakala2021Twinfilin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the TWF1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. Overexpression of TWF1 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including mesothelioma, lung adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This overexpression is linked to increased tumor progression and reduced overall survival, suggesting TWF1 as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis (Huo2021A). In breast cancer, TWF1 is involved in regulating chemoresistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are crucial for cancer metastasis and therapy resistance. The microRNA miR-30c targets TWF1, influencing chemotherapy resistance by modulating its expression (Bockhorn2013MicroRNA30c).

In esophageal cancer, TWF1 interacts with ATP6V0C, a gene that promotes cancer progression. The ATP6V0C/TWF1 regulatory axis is crucial for the metastatic ability of esophageal cancer cells, with TWF1 overexpression counteracting the effects of ATP6V0C knockdown (Qiao2023ATPase). Additionally, TWF1 expression is affected by obesity-related factors, such as miR-302a and miR-665-3p, which suppress TWF1 and impair myogenic differentiation, potentially contributing to muscle wasting conditions like sarcopenic obesity (Nguyen2023Mir302aTWF1; Nguyen2023Induction). These findings highlight the diverse roles of TWF1 in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Twinfilin, encoded by the TWF1 gene, is an actin-binding protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in actin dynamics. It binds to actin monomers, forming a stable complex with ADP-actin monomers, which inhibits nucleotide exchange and prevents filament assembly (Palmgren2001Interactions). Twinfilin also interacts with capping protein (CP), a protein that binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments. This interaction occurs through a conserved C-terminal tail region of twinfilin, which is crucial for its localization and function in actin dynamics (Falck2004Biological).

Twinfilin competes with CARMIL, another CPI-motif protein, for binding to CP. This competition protects CP from being displaced by CARMIL and accelerates the dissociation of the CP inhibitor V-1, thereby restoring CP to an active capping state (Johnston2018A). Twinfilin's interaction with CP is essential for its role in actin filament turnover, as it can promote processive depolymerization while blocking new assembly when bound to actin filaments at the barbed ends (Johnston2018A). These interactions highlight twinfilin's significant role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
