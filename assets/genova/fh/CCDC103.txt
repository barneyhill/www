# CCDC103

## Overview
The CCDC103 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 103 protein, which is integral to the assembly and function of motile cilia. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in stabilizing the axonemal structure of cilia. CCDC103 is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and a central RPAP3_C domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the assembly of outer dynein arms, essential components for ciliary motility (King2019The; King2015The). The protein's ability to oligomerize and form stable complexes is vital for its function in ciliary assembly and stability, impacting processes such as respiratory function and embryonic development (Casey2015A; King2019The). Mutations in the CCDC103 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder that affects ciliary function and can lead to respiratory issues, infertility, and laterality defects (Shoemark2017High; Fassad2019Clinical).

## Structure
The CCDC103 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains located at both the N- and C-termini, specifically at residues 6-46 and 224-240, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (King2015The). The central region of CCDC103 contains the RPAP3_C domain, spanning residues 96-189, which is associated with RNA polymerase II-associated protein 3 and is crucial for ciliary assembly (King2015The). This domain forms a six-helix bundle and is primarily α-helical (King2019The).

The protein's secondary structure includes ten discrete helices, with an unstructured region between residues approximately 60-100 (King2015The). The tertiary structure is not fully resolved due to multiple conformational states, but the protein can form dimers and higher-order oligomers (King2019The). The quaternary structure involves oligomerization, with the central region being necessary and sufficient for self-association, while the coiled-coil domains do not contribute to dimer formation (King2015The).

CCDC103 can form large complexes in the 400-500 kDa range and is tightly integrated within the axonemal superstructure, indicating a strong association with the axoneme (King2015The). The protein's ability to oligomerize and stabilize microtubules is essential for its function in ciliary assembly (King2019The).

## Function
The CCDC103 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the assembly and function of motile cilia in healthy human cells. This protein plays a critical role in the formation of the axoneme, the structural core of cilia, by facilitating the assembly of outer dynein arms, which are crucial for ciliary motility (King2015The). CCDC103 is tightly integrated within the ciliary axoneme and exhibits periodic binding to microtubules, forming linear arrays that stabilize the axonemal structure (King2015The). 

In the cytoplasm, CCDC103 is involved in the assembly of axonemal structures and is regulated by transcription factors such as FOXJ1 and RFX, which are important for motile ciliogenesis (Pereira2019Characterization). The protein's ability to oligomerize and form stable dimers or higher-order structures is thought to facilitate its role in axonemal growth and stability (Luongo2023Case; King2019The). 

CCDC103's function is vital for processes such as respiratory function and embryonic development, as it ensures proper ciliary motility, which is necessary for various physiological processes, including the establishment of left-right asymmetry during development (Casey2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC103 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in ciliary structure and function. These defects lead to respiratory issues, chronic ear infections, and infertility. The p.His154Pro mutation in CCDC103 is particularly prevalent in the South Asian population and is linked to PCD. This mutation disrupts protein oligomerization, which is crucial for the assembly of dynein arms on cilia, leading to impaired ciliary motility (Shoemark2017High; Fassad2019Clinical).

Patients with the p.His154Pro mutation may present with normal ciliary structure and function, complicating the diagnosis of PCD using standard tests. Genetic testing is recommended for accurate diagnosis, especially in South Asian patients (Shoemark2017High). The mutation is also associated with laterality defects, such as situs inversus totalis, due to its role in determining left-right asymmetry during embryonic development (Casey2015A).

In some cases, CCDC103 mutations can lead to infertility due to sperm immotility, as seen in a patient with a homozygous c.461A>C variant, which results in the absence of dynein arms in sperm axonemes (Luongo2023Case). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC103 mutations in PCD and related conditions.

## Interactions
CCDC103 is a protein that plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of ciliary structures by interacting with various proteins. It functions as a molecular scaffold, anchoring other proteins at the microtubule, and is involved in the assembly of outer dynein arms on ciliary axonemes. CCDC103 interacts with the C-termini of DYNC1H1 and SPAG6, with the interaction with SPAG6 being particularly notable due to their phenotypic and functional similarities, such as promoting microtubule stability (Falkenberg2020Ciliaindependent).

The protein forms oligomers and binds directly to polymerized microtubules, stabilizing them against depolymerization. This binding is attributed to the central RPAP3_C domain of CCDC103, which is crucial for its role in microtubule stabilization and dynein arm assembly (King2015The). CCDC103's oligomerization is essential for its function, and mutations like p.His154Pro can disrupt this process, leading to primary ciliary dyskinesia (Shoemark2017High).

CCDC103 is tightly integrated within the axonemal structure, requiring harsh conditions for solubilization, indicating strong interactions with axonemal components. It is present along the entire axonemal length and can be incorporated into the axoneme without other dynein assembly factors (King2015The).
