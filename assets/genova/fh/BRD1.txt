# BRD1

## Overview
BRD1 (bromodomain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, playing a pivotal role in various biological processes. The BRD1 protein is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and is integral to the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14), a modification associated with active transcription. This protein is crucial for erythropoiesis, particularly in the fetal liver, and is involved in brain development and function, with implications for mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. BRD1 forms part of several protein complexes, interacting with other proteins like HBO1 and ING4, and is involved in pathways that regulate gene expression and mitochondrial function (Paternoster2022The; Fryland2016Identification; Mishima2011The).

## Function
The BRD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling in healthy human cells. BRD1 is part of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and forms a complex with HBO1 and ING4, which is essential for the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14). This acetylation is associated with active transcription and is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, particularly in erythroid cells (Mishima2011The).

BRD1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of key erythroid regulator genes, such as GATA1, which is necessary for erythropoiesis in the fetal liver. The absence of BRD1 leads to reduced H3K14 acetylation and impaired erythroid differentiation, highlighting its role in maintaining proper acetylation levels and gene expression necessary for erythroid cell development (Mishima2011The).

In addition to its role in erythropoiesis, BRD1 is implicated in brain development and function. It is involved in pathways important for mental health, with its interaction network enriched for schizophrenia risk. BRD1 isoforms, BRD1-S and BRD1-L, are active in the nucleus and regulate gene expression by binding near transcription start sites (Fryland2016Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The BRD1 gene has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar affective disorder (BPD). Genetic studies have identified associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within BRD1 and these conditions. Notably, SNPs such as rs138880 and rs4468 have shown significant associations with SZ and BPD, with certain haplotypes being identified as 'risk' or 'protective' for these disorders (Severinsen2006Evidence; Nyegaard2010Support).

BRD1 is part of a histone acetyltransferase complex and interacts with proteins like PBRM1 and 14-3-3, which are associated with SZ and BPD. The BRD1 interaction network is enriched for schizophrenia risk, particularly the BRD1-S isoform, which shows more enrichment compared to BRD1-L (Fryland2016Identification).

Alterations in BRD1 expression levels have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting mitochondrial bioenergetics and potentially contributing to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as SZ, BPD, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Reduced BRD1 levels can lead to decreased mitochondrial respiration, impacting neuronal characteristics like neurogenesis and neuroactivity (Paternoster2022The). These findings suggest that BRD1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of these disorders through its involvement in transcriptional regulation and mitochondrial function.

## Interactions
BRD1 (bromodomain containing 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, forming part of various histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. It interacts with HBO1 and ING4 to form a complex responsible for the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14), which is crucial for fetal liver erythropoiesis (Mishima2011The). The interaction between BRD1 and HBO1 is mediated by the N-terminal 198 amino acids of BRD1, which are necessary for the stability of the BRD1 protein (Mishima2011The). BRD1 also interacts with TIP60 and MOZ, although it shows no interaction with CBP and p300 (Mishima2011The).

BRD1 is part of a complex with MOZ and HBO1, which acetylates histone H3 at lysines 9 and 14 (H3K9/14), necessary for the transcription of the integrin αv gene (Cai2018BRD1Mediated). It interacts with the transcription factor Sp1, enhancing the formation of a complex that binds to the promoter of the integrin αv gene (Cai2018BRD1Mediated).

BRD1 also interacts with non-histone proteins, including PDIA1, through its bromodomain, which recognizes acetylated lysine residues (Kuwik2022Hydrophobic). The protein is implicated in mental disorders, with interactions involving proteins like YWHAE, YWHAH, YWHAZ, and PBRM1, which are associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Fryland2016Identification).
