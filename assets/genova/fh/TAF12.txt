# TAF12

## Overview
TAF12 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 12, a critical component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, acting as a coactivator in various transcriptional processes. TAF12 is characterized by its histone-fold domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as ATF7, and contributes to the structural integrity of the TFIID complex (Hamard2005A). The protein is involved in maintaining the hypomethylated state of promoter regions, essential for active transcription, and participates in active DNA demethylation processes (Schmitz2009TAF12). TAF12's interactions extend to various transcription factors and coactivators, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals (Schmitz2009TAF12). Its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including glioma and choroid plexus carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Tong2015CrossSpecies; Guo2022Elevated).

## Structure
TAF12 is a component of the TFIID complex and contains a histone-fold domain (HFD), which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as ATF7. This domain is similar to the H2B histone fold and is essential for the structural organization of TAF12 within the TFIID complex (Hamard2005A). The HFD allows TAF12 to interact with ATF7, facilitating transcriptional activation. Mutations in the helical portions of this domain significantly disrupt its interaction and transcriptional properties (Hamard2005A).

TAF12 exists in different isoforms, with hsTAF12-1 being the largest and most functionally significant for transcriptional activation. The N-terminal region of hsTAF12-1 is particularly important for its role in transactivation and shares homologies with proteins like p38 and JNK, which interact with ATF (Hamard2005A). Specific residues, such as M33 and L35, are part of a D-site for kinases and are essential for TAF12's function (Hamard2005A).

TAF12 may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
TAF12 (TATA-box binding protein associated factor 12) is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, TAF12 plays a critical role in recruiting Gadd45a and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery to the promoters of active genes, including those transcribed by RNA polymerases I and II. This recruitment is crucial for maintaining the hypomethylated state of promoter regions, which is necessary for active transcription (Schmitz2009TAF12).

TAF12 is involved in the process of active DNA demethylation, particularly in the context of rRNA genes. It facilitates the removal of methylated cytosines by recruiting the NER machinery, thereby ensuring that rDNA remains in a transcriptionally active state (Schmitz2009TAF12). The interaction between TAF12 and Gadd45a is essential for the recruitment of the NER machinery to active gene promoters, maintaining their hypomethylated state and ensuring proper transcriptional activity (Schmitz2009TAF12).

TAF12 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the precise control of transcriptional activity, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals (Schmitz2009TAF12).

## Clinical Significance
TAF12 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, TAF12 is significantly upregulated compared to normal tissues. High TAF12 expression is associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics, such as higher WHO grade and IDH wildtype status, and correlates with shorter overall survival. It is considered an independent poor prognostic factor and a potential biomarker for prognosis and response to immunotherapy in glioma patients (Guo2022Elevated).

In choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), TAF12 is identified as an oncogene. Its upregulation, along with NFYC and RAD54L, accelerates CPC development in mouse models with deleted tumor suppressor genes. TAF12 is crucial for the maintenance and initiation of CPC cells, as its knockdown leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth (Tong2015CrossSpecies).

TAF12 also plays a role in Paget's Disease (PD) by enhancing the sensitivity of osteoclast precursors to vitamin D, contributing to abnormal osteoclast activity. This is mediated through its interaction with ATF7, which is crucial for increased vitamin D receptor responsivity in PD (Teramachi2013Role).

In colon cancer, TAF12 is involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulating E-cadherin expression. Its upregulation is linked to increased cancer cell migration and invasion, particularly in cells with RAS mutations (Pintzas2008Microarray).

## Interactions
TAF12 is a component of the TFIID complex, where it interacts with several other TAFs and plays a crucial role in transcription initiation. TAF12 forms interactions with TAF9, TAF6, and TAF4, contributing to a histone octamer-like structure within the TFIID complex (Matangkasombut2004Structure). It also interacts with TAF11 and TAF10, indicating its involvement in a complex network of protein interactions (Yatherajam2003Proteinprotein).

TAF12 interacts with ATF7, a member of the CREB/ATF family, enhancing ATF7-induced transcriptional activation. This interaction is modulated by TAF4, which can inhibit the TAF12-ATF7 interaction, affecting transcriptional activation (Hamard2005A). The interaction between TAF12 and ATF7 is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of certain genes, such as the cyclin A gene, and is influenced by the presence of TAF4b, a tissue-specific paralog of TAF4 (Hamard2005A).

In the context of Paget's disease of bone, TAF12 acts as a coactivator for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), enhancing its response to lower levels of its ligand. This interaction is potentiated by ATF7, which increases the expression of TAF12 in osteoclast precursors (Galson2014Pathobiology).
