# MMP14

## Overview
MMP14, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 14 or MT1-MMP, is a gene that encodes a membrane-bound enzyme belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. This family of enzymes is characterized by their ability to degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling, cell migration, and angiogenesis. The protein product of MMP14 is a transmembrane metalloproteinase that is involved in the activation of other MMPs, such as pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-13, which are essential for collagen degradation and ECM turnover (Ohuchi1997Membrane; Kuscu2011MMP14). MMP14's activity is tightly regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-2, which modulates its function in ECM remodeling and cellular processes (Snyman2015MMP14). The enzyme's interactions with cell adhesion molecules and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and tissue repair (Swayampakula2017The; GonzalezMolina2019MMP14).

## Structure
MMP14, also known as MT1-MMP, is a membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of MMP14 includes several distinct domains: a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain, a hinge region, a hemopexin domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Kuscu2011MMP14). The catalytic domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity and contains a zinc-binding motif essential for its function (Bode1999Structural). The hemopexin domain is crucial for substrate reorganization and protein-protein interactions, featuring a flat surface with four bladed beta-propeller structures (Kuscu2011MMP14).

The secondary structure of MMP14 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with a highly twisted five-stranded mixed β-pleated sheet flanked by surface loops and α-helices (FernandezCatalan1998Crystal). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, contributing to the enzyme's function and interaction with inhibitors like TIMP-2 (FernandezCatalan1998Crystal). MMP14 is known to form a complex with TIMP-2, which is crucial for the activation of progelatinase A (FernandezCatalan1998Crystal). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may affect its activity and localization. MMP14 is activated by furin, which cleaves between the propeptide and catalytic domains (Kuscu2011MMP14).

## Function
MMP14, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 14 or MT1-MMP, is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a critical role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells. It is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of ECM components, which is essential for processes such as tissue repair, cell migration, and angiogenesis (Ohuchi1997Membrane; Zhou2000Impaired). MMP14 is particularly important for activating pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-13, which are involved in collagen degradation, facilitating cell migration and invasion (Kuscu2011MMP14).

The enzyme consists of N-terminal, catalytic, and C-terminal domains, with the catalytic domain being responsible for its enzymatic activity. MMP14's activity is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-2, which forms a complex with MMP14 to activate proMMP-2 (Snyman2015MMP14; Ohuchi1997Membrane). This activation is crucial for ECM remodeling, which supports satellite cell movement and fusion with mature muscle fibers, promoting muscle hypertrophy and repair (Snyman2015MMP14).

MMP14 also interacts with cell adhesion molecules like CD44 and integrins, forming focal adhesions that mediate ECM degradation and facilitate cell migration (Snyman2015MMP14). Its role in ECM turnover is vital for normal muscle regeneration and maintaining muscle integrity (Snyman2015MMP14).

## Clinical Significance
MMP14, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 14, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the tumor microenvironment. In colorectal cancer, high MMP14 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes. It is associated with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), contributing to tumor aggressiveness and progression (Makutani2022Contribution). In pancreatic cancer, elevated MMP14 levels correlate with worse prognosis and are often found in conjunction with PKM2 expression, suggesting their combined potential as prognostic markers (Wang2020Identification).

MMP14 is also implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its overexpression is associated with poor overall survival. Specific polymorphisms in the MMP14 gene, such as ?6767 G/A and ?7096 C/C, are linked to a lower risk of HCC, indicating a genetic component to its clinical significance (Chen2011Role). In sarcomas, MMP14 is highly expressed and contributes to processes like extracellular matrix degradation, cell invasion, and metastasis, highlighting its role in sarcoma biology (GonzalezMolina2019MMP14).

These findings underscore the importance of MMP14 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker across various cancer types.

## Interactions
MMP14, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 14, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration. MMP14 forms a trimolecular complex with pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2, facilitating the activation of pro-MMP-2, which is essential for ECM degradation and cell invasion (Kuscu2011MMP14). It also interacts with pro-MMP-13 and directly cleaves ECM proteins such as collagen types I, II, and III, gelatin, fibronectin, laminin, fibrin, and proteoglycans (Kuscu2011MMP14).

MMP14 is enriched in exosomes derived from corneal fibroblasts, where it is necessary for the recruitment and activation of MMP2. This interaction is significant for processes like corneal angiogenesis and tumor metastasis (Han2014Evidence). In breast cancer cells, MMP14 interacts with carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), enhancing MMP14-mediated collagen degradation by providing hydrogen ions necessary for its catalytic activity. This interaction is crucial for tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Swayampakula2017The).

MMP14 also associates with integrins, such as β1 and α2, and CD98hc, forming complexes that facilitate cell migration and invasion (Swayampakula2017The). These interactions highlight MMP14's role in cellular processes related to cancer progression and tissue remodeling.
