# RWDD3

## Overview
The RWDD3 gene encodes the RWD domain-containing protein 3, commonly referred to as RSUME, which is a crucial modulator of the SUMOylation pathway. This protein is characterized by the presence of an RWD domain, which facilitates interactions with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, thereby enhancing the SUMOylation of target proteins (Alontaga2015RWD). RSUME is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability and function through post-translational modifications. It is expressed in multiple tissues and is upregulated under stress conditions, such as hypoxia, indicating its role in stress response and cellular homeostasis (CarbiaNagashima2007RSUME; Fuertes2022Impact). The protein's involvement in cancer progression, particularly in glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2018Knockdown; Diao2023SUMOylationtriggered).

## Structure
The RWDD3 protein, also known as RSUME, contains a single RWD domain located at its N-terminus, spanning residues 1-115. This domain is the only well-structured region of the protein, while the remainder appears to be disordered (Alontaga2015RWD). The RWD domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with Ubc9, an E2 enzyme in the SUMOylation pathway. The interaction between the RWD domain and Ubc9 is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, with key residues including Arg13, Lys14, Arg17, and Lys18 on Ubc9, and Glu7, Glu8, Glu97, and Glu102 on the RWD domain (Alontaga2015RWD).

The RWD domain forms a heterotrimeric complex with two Ubc9 molecules, highlighting its role in enhancing SUMOylation by stimulating the formation of Ubc9•SUMO thioester conjugates (Alontaga2015RWD). The interaction surface on Ubc9 overlaps with the non-covalent SUMO-binding surface, indicating that the RWD domain does not bind SUMO directly (Alontaga2015RWD). The RWDD3 protein's unstructured C-terminal extension is unlikely to affect its interaction with Ubc9, suggesting that the RWD domain is the primary functional unit in these interactions (Alontaga2015RWD).

## Function
The RWDD3 gene encodes the RSUME protein, which plays a significant role in enhancing SUMO conjugation, a post-translational modification process crucial for protein stability and function. RSUME interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, facilitating the formation of Ubc9-SUMO thioester conjugates, which are essential for the SUMOylation process (CarbiaNagashima2007RSUME; Alontaga2015RWD). This interaction enhances the sumoylation of various proteins, including HIF-1α, IκB, and PTEN, thereby influencing their stability and activity (Fuertes2022Impact).

RSUME is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the pituitary, pancreas, kidney, and heart, and is upregulated under stress conditions such as hypoxia and heat shock (CarbiaNagashima2007RSUME; Fuertes2022Impact). It is involved in regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and modulating glucocorticoid receptor activity, impacting transcriptional regulation and stress responses (Fuertes2022Impact). RSUME's activity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal stress resilience (CarbiaNagashima2007RSUME). The protein's role in enhancing SUMOylation and modulating post-translational modifications highlights its importance in cellular processes and stress response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The RWDD3 gene, encoding the RSUME protein, plays a significant role in various cancers and pathological conditions. In glioblastoma, RWDD3 is upregulated, correlating with shorter patient survival. Knockdown of RWDD3 in glioblastoma cells reduces proliferation, induces apoptosis, and inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2018Knockdown). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the circRNA circTLCD4-RWDD3 is overexpressed and associated with lymph node metastasis. It promotes lymphangiogenesis by upregulating PROX1 expression in lymphatic endothelial cells, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Diao2023SUMOylationtriggered).

RWDD3 is also implicated in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome-related tumors, such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). It is upregulated in RCC tumors with VHL mutations, contributing to tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis (Tedesco2019von). In endocrine-related cancers, RWDD3 modulates post-translational modifications, affecting tumor progression and metastasis (Fuertes2022Impact). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RWDD3 in cancer development and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The RWDD3 protein, also known as RSUME, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains an RWD domain, which interacts with the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. This interaction enhances the formation of Ubc9•SUMO thioester conjugates, playing a role in the SUMOylation process (Alontaga2015RWD). RWDD3 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL, suppressing ubiquitin conjugation to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, which is significant in the context of von Hippel-Lindau disease (Fuertes2022Impact).

In glioblastoma, RWDD3 is upregulated and interacts with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Knockdown of RWDD3 results in reduced phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, indicating its role in enhancing glioblastoma malignancy through this pathway (Chen2018Knockdown).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the circular RNA circTLCD4-RWDD3 interacts with the RNA-binding protein hnRNPA2B1, facilitating its SUMO2 modification. This interaction is crucial for lymphatic metastasis, as it promotes the packaging of circTLCD4-RWDD3 into extracellular vesicles, which are then internalized by lymphatic endothelial cells (Diao2023SUMOylationtriggered). These interactions highlight RWDD3's role in modulating post-translational modifications and influencing cancer progression.
