# PRAC1

## Overview
PRAC1, or Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 1, is a gene that encodes the PRAC1 small nuclear protein. This protein is primarily expressed in the prostate, rectum, and colon, suggesting a role in the normal physiological processes of these tissues. The PRAC1 small nuclear protein is involved in nuclear functions, although its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. It is categorized as a small nuclear protein due to its localization and size. Research has indicated that PRAC1 may be implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in tissues where it is highly expressed. Its expression pattern and potential involvement in cellular processes make it a subject of interest in studies related to prostate cancer and other diseases affecting the prostate and surrounding tissues.
