# PSMB7

## Overview
PSMB7 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 7, a critical component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The proteasome 20S subunit beta 7 is categorized as a proteolytic subunit with trypsin-like activity, playing a significant role in cleaving peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of basic amino acid residues (Kasahara2019Origin; Gomes2013Genetics). This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, antigen processing, and stress response. PSMB7's function is crucial in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its dysregulation has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and various cancers, where it serves as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Wu2015Amyloidβ; Wu2021PSMB7).

## Structure
The PSMB7 gene encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 7, which is a component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMB7 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that contribute to its function as a proteolytic subunit with trypsin-like activity, cleaving peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of basic amino acid residues (Kasahara2019Origin; Gomes2013Genetics).

The secondary structure of PSMB7 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common structural motifs in proteasome subunits (Coux1996STRUCTURE). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, forming a part of the inner rings of the 20S proteasome, where the active sites are located (Coux1996STRUCTURE). The quaternary structure of PSMB7 is characterized by its assembly into the larger 20S proteasome complex, which consists of four stacked rings, with PSMB7 being one of the beta subunits in the inner rings (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity and function of PSMB7, although specific modifications for this subunit are not detailed in the provided context (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

## Function
PSMB7 encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, which is a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. This degradation process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating various signaling pathways. PSMB7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to essential cellular functions such as antigen processing and stress response.

In the context of Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, PSMB7, along with other proteasome subunits, plays a role in the regulation of proteasome activity. Overexpression of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) has been shown to impair proteasome activity by downregulating the expression of PSMB7 and another subunit, PSMA5. This impairment leads to reduced degradation of proteins like RCAN1.1L, which is associated with increased neuronal apoptosis. The downregulation of PSMB7 by APP overexpression suggests that PSMB7 is crucial for maintaining proteasome function, and its impairment can contribute to cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Wu2015Amyloidβ). The study highlights the importance of PSMB7 in proteasome function and suggests potential therapeutic targets in APP-induced proteasomal impairment for treating neurodegenerative diseases (Wu2015Amyloidβ).

## Clinical Significance
The PSMB7 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in drug resistance and as a prognostic biomarker. In multiple myeloma (MM), PSMB7 expression is significantly elevated in newly diagnosed cases and in patients with advanced disease stages, particularly those classified as International Staging System (ISS) stage III. High PSMB7 expression correlates with shorter overall survival in patients treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that PSMB7 may contribute to bortezomib resistance in MM (Wu2021PSMB7).

In breast cancer, PSMB7 is overexpressed in doxorubicin-resistant cell lines. Silencing PSMB7 in these cells reduces their survival following doxorubicin treatment, indicating its role in anthracycline resistance. High PSMB7 expression is associated with shorter survival in breast cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Munkácsy2009PSMB7).

PSMB7 is also linked to poor survival outcomes in other cancers, such as adrenocortical carcinoma, and shows differential expression across various cancer stages. Its expression is associated with immune microenvironment interactions, suggesting a broader role in cancer pathogenesis (Li2021Integrated).

## Interactions
PSMB7, or proteasome 20S subunit beta 7, is a component of the 20S core proteasome complex, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation. In yeast, the human PSMB7 protein can integrate into the proteasome core, but this integration requires specific interactions with other proteasome subunits. The study by Sultana et al. highlights that the human β2 subunit (PSMB7) can incorporate into yeast proteasomes if the human β3 subunit is also present, emphasizing the importance of species-specific protein-protein interactions for proper assembly (Sultana2022Speciesspecific).

Mutations in PSMB7, particularly in the C-terminal tail, affect its ability to replace the orthologous PUP1 gene in yeast. These mutations facilitate interactions with neighboring yeast proteasome subunits, such as β1, β3, and β6 (Sultana2022Speciesspecific). The C-terminal tail of PSMB7 is crucial for interactions with the β3 subunit, and swapping this tail with yeast sequences allows functional replaceability in yeast (Sultana2022Speciesspecific).

The study also found that specific amino acid changes, such as the S214G mutation, enhance the ability of PSMB7 to complement the yeast PUP1 gene deletion, indicating the role of these mutations in facilitating critical protein-protein interactions (Sultana2022Speciesspecific).
