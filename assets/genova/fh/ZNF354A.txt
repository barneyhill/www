# ZNF354A

## Overview
ZNF354A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 354A, a transcription factor characterized by its 13 C2H2 zinc finger motifs and a KRAB-AB domain, which are typically associated with transcriptional repression (Shakib2005Proteomics). This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates gene expression, influencing various cellular processes such as rRNA synthesis, nucleolar structure, and apoptosis, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Shakib2005Proteomics). ZNF354A is implicated in erythroid differentiation and intracellular transport, with its expression closely linked to the JAK2 gene, suggesting a role in myeloproliferative diseases (Peller2009Identification). Additionally, ZNF354A has been associated with testicular cancer and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression levels correlate with patient survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Czerwinska2021Low; Shakib2005Proteomics).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF354A, also known as Kid-1, is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. It contains 13 C2H2 zinc fingers and a KRAB-AB domain, which are typically associated with transcriptional repression (Shakib2005Proteomics). ZNF354A is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences transcriptional activity, potentially affecting processes such as rRNA synthesis and nucleolar structure, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Shakib2005Proteomics).

In the context of erythroid differentiation, ZNF354A is part of a gene cluster that includes JAK2, and its expression is highly correlated with JAK2, suggesting a role in erythroid differentiation and possibly in intracellular transport and apoptosis regulation (Peller2009Identification). The protein's involvement in apoptosis is further supported by its interaction with the LC8 dynein light chain, which is linked to the nuclear translocation of p53 in response to DNA damage (Peller2009Identification).

ZNF354A is also implicated in testicular cancer, indicating its potential role in cellular processes such as cell death, hypoxia response, and germ cell function (Shakib2005Proteomics).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF354A has been studied in the context of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression levels have been associated with patient survival outcomes. High expression levels of ZNF354A are linked to better survival rates in KIRC patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. The gene is rarely mutated in KIRC tumors, with alterations occurring in more than 10% of patients, but the study does not provide specific details on the clinical significance of these mutations beyond their association with expression levels and patient survival (Czerwinska2021Low).

In the context of erythroid differentiation, ZNF354A, also known as Kid-1, is part of a gene cluster that shows a high correlation with the JAK2 gene, which is significant in erythroid differentiation and myeloproliferative diseases. Although the clinical significance of ZNF354A mutations or expression alterations is not directly addressed, its potential role in intracellular transport and apoptosis regulation is highlighted (Peller2009Identification).

Overall, while ZNF354A's expression levels have been linked to cancer prognosis, particularly in KIRC, the specific clinical implications of its mutations or interaction changes remain to be fully elucidated.
