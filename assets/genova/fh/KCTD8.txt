# KCTD8

## Overview
KCTD8 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 8, which is a member of the KCTD family characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. This protein is primarily involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability within the central nervous system. As an auxiliary subunit of the GABA_B receptor, KCTD8 plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of voltage-activated calcium and inward-rectifier potassium channels, as well as modulating local cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby influencing neurotransmission (Esposito2022Alphafold; Skoblov2013Protein). The gene is notably associated with potassium ion transport and is coexpressed with other genes involved in neurotransmission and brain development, underscoring its importance in brain-related functions (Paus2011KCTD8). The structural features of the protein, including its unique C-terminal domain, suggest a flexible modulatory role in receptor interactions and synaptic processes, contributing to its involvement in mood regulation and cognitive function (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted).

## Structure
KCTD8 is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing family, characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and typically facilitates the formation of oligomeric structures, such as pentamers (Balasco2024A). The BTB domain in KCTD8, however, does not facilitate binding with Cullin 3 (Cul3) due to specific structural features. Notably, the α2β3 loop in KCTD8 is too long, which prevents the stable formation of complexes with Cul3 (Balasco2024A).

KCTD8, along with KCTD12 and KCTD16, forms a subcluster that interacts with the GABA B receptor rather than Cul3, indicating a distinct functional role within the KCTD family (Balasco2024A). The protein also contains a C-terminal H2 homology domain, which is involved in inhibiting receptor desensitization, a feature shared with KCTD16 but not with KCTD12 (Skoblov2013Protein). The structural characteristics of KCTD8 suggest its involvement in synaptic transmission regulation, particularly through its role as an auxiliary subunit of the GABAb receptor (Skoblov2013Protein).

## Function
KCTD8 is a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of the GABA_B receptor, which plays a critical role in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in the central nervous system. It influences the activity of voltage-activated calcium (Ca2+) channels and inward-rectifier potassium (K+) channels, and it decreases local cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby affecting neurotransmission (Skoblov2013Protein). KCTD8 is part of a family of proteins characterized by a conserved BTB domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, forming pentamers that facilitate receptor binding, particularly with the GABA_B2 receptor (Esposito2022Alphafold).

The gene is associated with potassium ion transport and is coexpressed with genes involved in neurotransmission and brain development, suggesting its enrichment in brain-related functions (Paus2011KCTD8). KCTD8's structural features include a unique C-terminal domain that may act as a flexible modulator of its activity, potentially influencing its role in receptor interactions and synaptic processes (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). These molecular activities contribute to its involvement in processes like mood regulation and cognitive function, highlighting its significance in the central nervous system.

## Interactions
KCTD8 is known to participate in several protein interactions, particularly within the KCTD protein family. It forms part of a subcluster with KCTD12 and KCTD16, which are auxiliary subunits of the GABA B receptor. These interactions influence synaptic transmission by regulating voltage-activated Ca2+ and inward-rectifier K+ channels, and by decreasing local cAMP levels (Skoblov2013Protein). The BTB domain of KCTD8 is involved in binding the GABA B receptor, which is crucial for its function in neuronal signaling (Balasco2024A).

KCTD8 also interacts with KCTD5, another member of the KCTD family. The interaction between KCTD8 and KCTD5 is mediated by the C-terminal domain of KCTD5, rather than its BTB domain. This suggests a specific role for the C-terminus in facilitating these interactions (Liao2023KCTD5).

Despite its involvement in these interactions, KCTD8 does not bind to Cullin 3 (Cul3) due to structural constraints, specifically the long α2β3 loop, which prevents stable complex formation with Cul3 (Balasco2024A). This highlights the specificity of KCTD8's interactions within the protein family and its functional roles.
