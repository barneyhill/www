# WNT10A

## Overview
WNT10A is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 10A, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are integral to various developmental processes, particularly in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Hsu2012WNT10A). The WNT10A protein is characterized by a conserved pattern of cysteine residues and is involved in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its structural integrity (Miller2001Thewnts). Functionally, WNT10A plays a significant role in the development of ectodermal structures such as skin, hair, and teeth, and is implicated in the maintenance of dental mesenchyme and hair follicles (Xu2017WNT10A). Mutations in the WNT10A gene are associated with ectodermal dysplasias, including odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia and Schöpf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human development and disease (Bohring2009WNT10A; Yu2018Distinct).

## Structure
The WNT10A protein is a member of the Wnt family and consists of 417 amino acids, encoded by the WNT10A gene located on human chromosome 2q35 (Kirikoshi2001WNT10A). The primary structure of WNT10A includes a WNT core domain and shares 59.2% amino acid identity with WNT10B, indicating a significant level of homology (Kirikoshi2001WNT10A). WNT10A proteins are characterized by a conserved pattern of 23 or 24 cysteine residues, which suggests that their folding may depend on the formation of multiple intramolecular disulfide bonds (Miller2001Thewnts).

The WNT10A protein lacks an N-terminal hydrophobic region typically associated with signal peptides and does not contain an RGD motif, which is often involved in cell adhesion (Kirikoshi2001WNT10A). However, it does have two N-linked glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that can affect protein folding and stability (Kirikoshi2001WNT10A). The protein is involved in the WNT-β-catenin-TCF signaling pathway, which plays a role in human carcinogenesis (Kirikoshi2001WNT10A). The specific secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of WNT10A are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
WNT10A is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes secreted signaling proteins that play a crucial role in various developmental processes. In healthy human cells, WNT10A is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This pathway is activated when WNT ligands bind to Frizzled receptors, leading to the activation of Dishevelled proteins. This activation inhibits the degradation of β-catenin, allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a transcriptional coactivator, promoting the expression of target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc, which are important for cell proliferation and tumor formation (Hsu2012WNT10A).

WNT10A is particularly important in the development of ectodermal structures, including skin, hair, and teeth. It plays a significant role in the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells, as evidenced by its involvement in dental mesenchyme and hair follicle maintenance (Xu2017WNT10A). In the context of tooth development, WNT10A regulates the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein, a marker of odontoblast differentiation, highlighting its role in odontogenesis (Liu2013Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WNT10A gene are associated with a variety of ectodermal dysplasias, which are disorders affecting the development of skin, hair, nails, teeth, and glands. These mutations are a frequent cause of conditions such as odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia (OODD) and Schöpf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome (SSPS) (Bohring2009WNT10A; Yu2018Distinct). OODD is characterized by symptoms including severe hypodontia, nail dystrophy, smooth tongue, dry skin, keratoderma, and hyperhidrosis of palms and soles (Nawaz2009WNT10A). SSPS features include eyelid cysts, palmoplantar keratoderma, hypodontia, hyperhidrosis, hypotrichosis, and onychodystrophy (Nagy2010SchöpfSchulzPassarge).

WNT10A mutations can lead to a range of dental anomalies, such as oligodontia, which is the absence of six or more permanent teeth, and other conditions like non-syndromic tooth agenesis (Tardieu2017Dental; Yuan2017Role). The mutations can result in both nonsense and missense changes, affecting conserved protein regions and leading to phenotypic variability among affected individuals (Bohring2009WNT10A). The gene's role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is crucial for ectodermal organogenesis, including tooth development, and its disruption can lead to the clinical manifestations observed in these syndromes (Yu2018Distinct).

## Interactions
WNT10A interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in different biological processes. In the context of male-pattern baldness (MPB), WNT10A interacts with the transcription factor EBF1. This interaction occurs at a specific locus on chromosome 2q35, where EBF1 binds to a recognition sequence within the WNT10A gene, activating its expression. The binding affinity of EBF1 is influenced by the allelic expression of the MPB-associated variant rs3856551, with the risk allele decreasing EBF1's binding affinity, leading to reduced WNT10A expression (Hochfeld2021Evidence).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), WNT10A interacts with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. TGF-β1 induces WNT10A expression in fibroblast cells, promoting collagen production and fibrosis. This interaction highlights WNT10A's role in the pathogenesis of IPF, where it contributes to increased collagen synthesis and fibrotic processes (Oda2016Profibrotic).

In the context of cancer, WNT10A is involved in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and migration. In papillary thyroid carcinoma, WNT10A interacts with components of this pathway, such as LEF1 and MYC, promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation and migration (Dong2017WNT10Aβcatenin).
