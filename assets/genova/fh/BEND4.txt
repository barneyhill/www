# BEND4

## Overview
BEND4 is a gene that encodes the BEN domain containing 4 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a BEN domain, a conserved DNA-binding motif involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. The BEND4 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and reproductive organs (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). It is implicated in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in transcriptional processes and chromatin organization (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). Mutations in the BEND4 gene have been associated with infection-induced acute encephalopathy, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). Despite its identified functions, the specific physiological roles and target genes of BEND4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>).

## Function
The BEND4 gene encodes a protein containing a BEN domain, which is a conserved DNA-binding domain involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. BEND4 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and reproductive organs, and is primarily localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). The BEN domain of BEND4 is implicated in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role in chromatin organization and transcriptional processes (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>).

Bioinformatic analysis indicates that BEND4 may interact with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as Ribonuclease T2 and Zinc finger protein 583, supporting its potential role in these processes (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). Immunofluorescence microscopy has shown nuclear localization of BEND4, further supporting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). The expression of wild-type BEND4 specifically alters the level of Rab GDIÎ², a protein involved in membrane trafficking and related to tumorigenicity, development, and invasion, indicating a possible role in these cellular processes (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). However, the specific physiological role of BEND4 and the endogenous target genes it modulates in healthy human cells remain not fully understood (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BEND4 gene have been implicated in infection-induced acute encephalopathy (IIAE), a condition characterized by neurological deterioration following infections, pontine cysts, calcification, and cerebellar atrophy. A study identified a homozygous c.1297G>A (p.Gly433Ser) mutation in BEND4 in three siblings from a Turkish family, which was associated with severe neurological symptoms and developmental regression following infections (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). This mutation is located in the BEN domain, which is involved in DNA-binding and neural transcription, suggesting a potential role in the observed phenotype (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>).

The mutation was predicted to be deleterious and led to changes in the localization pattern of the BEND4 protein, from a network-like to a juxtanuclear distribution, potentially causing cellular stress and chronic damage (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). Proteomic analysis revealed increased levels of reticulocalbin-1 and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein-29, which are involved in protein processing and folding, indicating that the mutation may affect protein localization and cellular processes (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>). Despite these findings, the rarity and novelty of the variant make it challenging to establish a definitive cause-and-effect relationship, necessitating further research and functional studies (Kara2021<i>BEND4<i>).
