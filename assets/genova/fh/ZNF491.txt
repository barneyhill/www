# ZNF491

## Overview
ZNF491 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 491, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 491 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to DNA and influencing gene expression. The specific functions and interactions of ZNF491 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with other proteins and DNA sequences. Understanding the precise mechanisms and pathways involving ZNF491 could have significant implications for understanding its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
