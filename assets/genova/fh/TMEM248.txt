# TMEM248

## Overview
TMEM248 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 248, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Transmembrane proteins like TMEM248 play crucial roles in facilitating communication between the cell's internal and external environments by spanning the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. The specific functions and interactions of TMEM248 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in pathways that are critical for cellular function and development. Understanding the role of TMEM248 in these processes may provide insights into its potential implications in human health and disease.
