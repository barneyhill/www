# KCNK17

## Overview
KCNK17 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 17, also known as K2P 17.1 or TASK-4/TALK-2. This protein is part of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating action potential repolarization in excitable cells, such as cardiac myocytes. The KCNK17-encoded protein is characterized by its four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which facilitate the selective passage of potassium ions across the cell membrane. These channels are sensitive to changes in extracellular pH and can be modulated by pharmacological agents, making them potential therapeutic targets for conditions like atrial fibrillation and heart failure (Staudacher2018Cardiovascular; Staudacher2018Identification). The expression of KCNK17 is widespread, with significant presence in the heart, brain, and pancreas, underscoring its importance in ion homeostasis across various tissues (Staudacher2018Identification).

## Structure
The KCNK17 gene encodes a protein that is part of the two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P), specifically known as K2P 17.1 or TASK-4/TALK-2. These channels are characterized by having four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which contribute to their function as background potassium channels influencing cell membrane potential (Staudacher2018Identification).

The primary structure of the human KCNK17 protein includes a sequence that allows for the formation of these characteristic domains. The secondary structure likely involves the formation of transmembrane helices, which are typical for ion channels, facilitating the passage of potassium ions across the cell membrane (Staudacher2018Identification).

In terms of post-translational modifications, phosphorylation is a common modification that can regulate the activity of K2P channels, including KCNK17, although specific phosphorylation sites on KCNK17 are not detailed in the provided context (Staudacher2018Cardiovascular).

The quaternary structure of KCNK17 involves the assembly of subunits to form functional channels, which are selective for potassium ions and exhibit specific regulatory properties, such as sensitivity to pH changes and pharmacological agents (Seyler2014Vernakalant; Staudacher2018Identification).

## Function
KCNK17 encodes a potassium channel protein that is part of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, specifically known as K2P 17.1 or TASK-4. These channels are involved in stabilizing the resting membrane potential and facilitating action potential repolarization in excitable cells, such as cardiac myocytes (Staudacher2018Cardiovascular). K2P 17.1 channels are predominantly expressed in the atria of the heart and play a significant role in cardiac electrophysiology, contributing to the regulation of heart rhythm and potentially influencing conditions like atrial fibrillation and heart failure (Staudacher2018Cardiovascular; Seyler2014Vernakalant).

In healthy human cells, K2P 17.1 channels help maintain potassium ion selectivity and membrane potential, which are crucial for cellular excitability and function (Staudacher2018Identification). These channels are activated by changes in extracellular pH and are sensitive to pharmacological modulation by various antiarrhythmic drugs, indicating their potential as therapeutic targets (Staudacher2018Cardiovascular). The expression of KCNK17 is widespread in multiple organs, including the heart, brain, and pancreas, highlighting its importance in maintaining ion homeostasis across different tissues (Staudacher2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The KCNK17 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). Variants within this gene, particularly the rs10947803 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), have been associated with an increased risk of IS. The A allele of this SNP is linked to higher KCNK17 mRNA levels and an increased risk of IS, with an odds ratio of 1.48 after correction for multiple testing (DominguesMontanari2010KCNK17). This association is observed across various stroke subtypes, including cardioembolic and undetermined strokes (DominguesMontanari2010KCNK17). 

In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, KCNK17 mRNA levels are significantly elevated compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential role in the acute response to stroke, although these levels normalize in the chronic phase (DominguesMontanari2010KCNK17). The gene's expression is also influenced by genetic variants, with the rs10947803 SNP showing a significant association with IS risk factors such as smoking (DominguesMontanari2010KCNK17). 

These findings suggest that KCNK17 may serve as a biomarker for ischemic stroke and highlight the need for further research to determine whether changes in its expression are a cause or consequence of stroke (DominguesMontanari2010KCNK17).
