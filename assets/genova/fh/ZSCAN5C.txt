# ZSCAN5C

## Overview
ZSCAN5C is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 5C, which is part of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain is a protein-protein interaction domain that may facilitate the formation of protein complexes. ZSCAN5C is implicated in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, and has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Mutations in this gene are associated with a poorer prognosis in OSCC, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and its importance as a target for further research (Kuk2022Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZSCAN5C gene have been associated with a worse prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Specifically, ZSCAN5C is identified as a risk gene with significant mutations in stages 2 and 3 of OSCC, where mutant-type cases exhibit a 4.27 times worse prognosis compared to wild-type cases. These findings were determined through multivariate Cox regression models, which adjusted for major clinical variables, indicating that ZSCAN5C mutations have a statistically significant impact on patient survival outcomes (Kuk2022Prognostic). The study by Kuk et al. highlights ZSCAN5C as one of the four stage-independent risk genes in low-stage OSCC, suggesting that its mutations confer a risk similar to that of stage 4 mutations (Kuk2022Prognostic). The research emphasizes the potential of ZSCAN5C as a prognostic marker, particularly in low-stage OSCC cases, and suggests the need for further studies to understand its specific role in cancer progression (Kuk2022Prognostic). While the broader implications of ZSCAN5C mutations in other diseases are not detailed in the provided context, its involvement in OSCC underscores its clinical significance in cancer prognosis.
