# OR2K2

## Overview
The OR2K2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily K member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are typically involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. The protein encoded by OR2K2 is a transmembrane receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. This structural feature allows the receptor to traverse the cell membrane and participate in signal transduction processes by interacting with G-proteins. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, variations in the OR2K2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and prostate cancer, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction (Chen2014Screening; Alves2017[P1–214]:).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2K2 gene has been studied in the context of several diseases, although its clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), alterations in the expression of OR2K2 have been observed, particularly in female patients. The gene's mRNA levels are significantly decreased at early AD Braak stage I compared to age-matched controls, and this decrease persists in later stages V and VI when normalized to certain reference genes. This suggests a potential role of OR2K2 in the pathogenesis of AD, especially in females, although the findings are not statistically significant in all comparisons, indicating the need for further research (Alves2017[P1–214]:).

In prostate cancer, a specific variant of OR2K2, rs2418135, has been associated with aggressive cases, showing a minor allele frequency of 0.618 in aggressive cases compared to 0.480 in non-aggressive cases, with an odds ratio of 1.82 and a P-value of 2.20E-05. This suggests a potential association with prostate cancer aggressiveness, although OR2K2 is not highlighted as a significant gene in all studies (Chen2014Screening). In schizophrenia, a GWAS study identified a strong association at SNP rs11999864, which spans OR2K2, but these SNPs were not related to disease susceptibility (Zhan2023The).
