# SLC25A6

## Overview
The SLC25A6 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 6, also known as adenine nucleotide translocator 3 (ANT3), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein functions as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the exchange of ADP and ATP across the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process essential for cellular energy metabolism (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Palmieri2004The). SLC25A6 is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues, with significant expression in cardiac muscle, underscoring its role in cardiac function and energy homeostasis (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of cardiac electrical activity, particularly influencing the QTc interval, which is a measure of the heart's electrical cycle (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). As such, SLC25A6 is not only vital for mitochondrial function but also plays a significant role in maintaining cardiac rhythmicity and potentially in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias (Skakkebæk2023Dosage).

## Structure
The SLC25A6 protein, also known as adenine nucleotide translocator 3 (ANT3), is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family involved in the exchange of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Structurally, SLC25A6 is characterized by a tripartite sequence structure, consisting of three homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids long. These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that span the membrane as alpha-helices, separated by hydrophilic regions (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational; Palmieri2004The). 

The secondary structure of SLC25A6 includes six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a funnel-shaped structure that facilitates nucleotide transport (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). The tertiary structure is a six-helix bundle, creating a channel for the transport of ADP and ATP. This structure is stabilized by salt bridges formed by conserved motifs, which are crucial for the conformational changes between cytoplasmic and matrix states (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

SLC25A6 typically functions as a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the formation of 12 transmembrane segments in the dimeric state (Palmieri2004The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of SLC25A6, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the available literature.

## Function
The SLC25A6 gene encodes a mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) protein, specifically known as ADP/ATP translocase 3. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the exchange of ADP and ATP between the mitochondria and the cytosol (Skakkebæk2023Dosage; Palmieri2004The). This exchange is vital for maintaining the energy balance within cells, as it allows ATP produced in the mitochondria to be exported to the cytosol, where it is used in various energy-dependent cellular processes (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

SLC25A6 is expressed in almost all human tissues, with notable expression in cardiomyocytes, indicating its importance in cardiac function (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of the QTc interval, a measure of cardiac electrical activity, with higher expression levels associated with shorter QTc intervals (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). This suggests that SLC25A6 not only contributes to cellular energy homeostasis but also plays a role in cardiac rhythmicity and potentially in arrhythmias (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). The gene's expression and function are crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial and cardiac function, highlighting its significance in human health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SLC25A6 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator, have been implicated in various cardiac conditions. The gene's expression levels are associated with QTc interval duration, a measure of the heart's electrical cycle. Studies have shown a significant negative correlation between SLC25A6 expression and QTc interval duration, suggesting that higher expression levels are linked to shorter QTc intervals. This relationship indicates that SLC25A6 dosage may influence cardiac electrical activity and contribute to conditions such as those observed in Turner Syndrome (TS) and Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) (Skakkebæk2023Dosage).

In zebrafish models, downregulation of slc25a6 resulted in prolonged QTc intervals, while overexpression led to shortened intervals. These findings suggest that SLC25A6 plays a role in cardiac function and that its altered expression can impact the QTc interval (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). The gene's involvement in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on K ATP channels in cardiomyocytes further underscore its clinical significance in cardiac phenotypes (Skakkebæk2023Dosage). However, specific diseases directly caused by mutations in SLC25A6 are not detailed in the provided context.
