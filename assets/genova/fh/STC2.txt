# STC2

## Overview
STC2 is a gene that encodes the protein stanniocalcin 2, a secreted glycoprotein involved in various physiological processes, including calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone metabolism, and cellular stress responses. The STC2 protein is characterized by its all-helical structure and forms a dimer, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) (Kobberø2022Structure). As a member of the stanniocalcin family, STC2 plays a significant role in modulating insulin-like growth factor signaling by inhibiting PAPP-A, thereby influencing growth and development (Zhong2022Structural). Additionally, STC2 is implicated in cancer progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Qie2022Stanniocalcin).

## Structure
The STC2 protein in humans is composed of 302 amino acids, with the first 24 residues predicted to be a signal peptide, and the remaining residues forming the mature hormone (Joshi2020New). The primary structure includes 15 cysteine residues, with the first 10 conserved within the stanniocalcin family (Joshi2020New). The secondary structure of STC2 is characterized by a bundle of 11 antiparallel α-helices, connected by short loops (Kobberø2022Structure). 

In terms of tertiary structure, STC2 adopts an all-helical conformation and forms a dimer, with the dimerization interface formed by residues between E169 and C211 (Kobberø2022Structure). The quaternary structure involves a 2:2 stoichiometry in the PAPP-A•STC2 complex, where STC2 interacts with PAPP-A subunits through intra- and inter-subunit contacts (Kobberø2022Structure).

STC2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 on serine residues, specifically between Ser-285 and Ser-298, with Ser-288 being the most likely candidate (JELLINEK2000Stanniocalcin). Although STC2 has a potential N-glycosylation site, it is not occupied in the PAPP-A•STC2 complex (Kobberø2022Structure).

## Function
Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) is a protein involved in several critical physiological processes in human cells. It plays a significant role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, primarily by inhibiting phosphate transport. This is achieved through the downregulation of type II sodium phosphate transporters in kidney proximal tubules, which affects phosphate metabolism (Joshi2020New; JELLINEK2000Stanniocalcin). STC2 is also involved in bone metabolism, where it promotes osteoblast differentiation and mineralization via ERK phosphorylation, contributing to bone health (Joshi2020New).

In terms of cellular localization, STC2 is a secreted protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, suggesting its role in secretion and potential autocrine or paracrine functions (Joshi2020New). It is also associated with the plasma membrane, indicating its involvement in extracellular signaling (JELLINEK2000Stanniocalcin).

STC2 is implicated in glucose homeostasis, as it co-localizes with glucagon-secreting alpha cells in pancreatic islets (Joshi2020New). Additionally, it plays a role in cytoprotection by being upregulated in response to stressors like ER stress and oxidative stress, protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis through pathways involving pAKT and pERK1/2 signaling (Joshi2020New).

## Clinical Significance
STC2 (stanniocalcin 2) is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression and prognosis. High STC2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including bladder, colon, esophagus, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, mesothelioma, sarcoma, and thymoma, while it indicates a favorable prognosis in breast cancer and lower-grade glioma (Jiang2022A). In osteosarcoma, STC2 expression is significantly higher compared to normal bone, correlating with high Ki67 values and tumor recurrence, suggesting its potential as a disease risk indicator (Wang2023Osteosarcoma).

STC2 is also involved in drug resistance, particularly in lung cancer, where its upregulation is linked to resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). It modulates the c-Jun/AXL/ERK signaling pathway, contributing to resistance, and its suppression can restore sensitivity to these inhibitors (Liu2019Acquired). In colorectal cancer, STC2 expression is induced by bevacizumab, promoting cell proliferation and migration under hypoxic conditions (Qie2022Stanniocalcin). These findings highlight STC2's potential as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance and its role as a prognostic marker in various cancers.

## Interactions
Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with the proteolytic enzyme pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). STC2 forms a complex with PAPP-A, inhibiting its ability to cleave insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4), thereby modulating IGF signaling. This interaction is facilitated by a disulfide bond between Cys120 of STC2 and Cys652 of PAPP-A, which stabilizes the complex and prevents dissociation (Kobberø2022Structure; Zhong2022Structural). The STC2 dimer interacts noncovalently with the C domain of PAPP-A, involving electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, with specific residues such as Lys104 of STC2 playing a crucial role (Kobberø2022Structure; Zhong2022Structural).

STC2 also interacts with other proteins, such as Ran-binding protein M (RanBPM), to stimulate androgen receptor activation, and it negatively regulates postnatal growth by inhibiting PAPP-A activity (Joshi2020New). In cancer, STC2 is associated with resistance to therapies and tumor progression, interacting with pathways like PI3K-Akt and c-Jun signaling, which contribute to drug resistance and cell survival under stress conditions (Qie2022Stanniocalcin).
