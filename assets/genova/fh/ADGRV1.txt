# ADGRV1

## Overview
ADGRV1, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor V1, is a gene that encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, specifically the protein VLGR1. This receptor is characterized by its large extracellular domain and seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, which are integral to its role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. ADGRV1 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining glutamate homeostasis and supporting synaptic development and function. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as PDZ domain-containing proteins, underscore its involvement in complex signaling pathways essential for neural health. Mutations in ADGRV1 are linked to significant clinical conditions, including Usher syndrome type 2C and various forms of epilepsy, highlighting its importance in sensory and neurological processes (Folts2019Adhesion; Myers2017ADGRV1; Güler2024The).

## Structure
The ADGRV1 protein, also known as VLGR1, is a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It features a large extracellular domain (ECD) with multiple protein-protein and calcium interaction domains, including the GAIN domain, which contains a G protein receptor proteolytic site (GPS) that facilitates autoproteolysis (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering). This cleavage results in an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF), which can function independently or remain associated as a dimer (Knapp2022Affinity).

The CTF includes a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain and a cytoplasmic region with a PDZ binding motif (PBM) that interacts with PDZ-containing proteins such as whirlin and PDZD7, crucial for regulating GPCR activity (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering). The cytoplasmic domain is predominantly disordered, lacking stable secondary structures (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering).

ADGRV1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants, with 37 identified variants and 129 exons, the highest among aGPCR genes (Kuhn2024The). These variants can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's function in various tissues (Kuhn2024The). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
The ADGRV1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, playing significant roles in cell adhesion and signal transduction. It is highly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in astrocytes, which are crucial for maintaining glutamate homeostasis in the brain. ADGRV1 interacts with glutamate transporters such as EAAT3 and EAAT1, facilitating the regulation of glutamate uptake processes. This function is vital for preventing glutamate toxicity and maintaining neural tissue health (Güler2024The).

In astrocytes, ADGRV1 supports neuron development by influencing synaptogenesis and synaptic strength, particularly affecting excitatory synapses. It is involved in the regulation of key enzymes in the glutamate-glutamine cycle and the TCA cycle, which are essential for glutamate metabolism (Güler2024The). The protein also plays a role in astrocyte morphology, with deficiencies leading to altered astrocyte structure and reduced numbers in certain brain regions (Güler2024The).

ADGRV1 is active in cell membranes, where it facilitates cell-cell communication and maintains cellular structure, contributing to the development and maintenance of the central nervous system (Güler2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADGRV1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Usher syndrome type 2C and various forms of epilepsy. Usher syndrome type 2C is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive vision loss condition. The disorder is autosomal recessive and often involves loss of function mutations in ADGRV1, which are crucial for the development and maintenance of cochlear and photoreceptor cells (Folts2019Adhesion; Fakin2021Characteristics). 

In addition to Usher syndrome, ADGRV1 variants have been implicated in epilepsy, including myoclonic epilepsy and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). Studies have identified rare and ultra-rare variants of ADGRV1 in patients with epilepsy, suggesting a potential pathogenic role. These variants are significantly overrepresented in epilepsy cohorts compared to control groups, indicating a genetic predisposition (Myers2017ADGRV1; Dahawi2021Involvement). 

The gene's involvement in both auditory-visual disorders and epilepsy highlights its critical role in neurological function. The presence of ADGRV1 variants in these conditions suggests that alterations in its expression or function can disrupt normal cellular signaling and adhesion processes, leading to disease (Zhou2022ADGRV1).

## Interactions
ADGRV1, also known as VLGR1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the Usher syndrome scaffold proteins whirlin (USH2D) and harmonin (USH1C) through its PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which binds to the PDZ domains of these proteins (Knapp2022Affinity). ADGRV1 also interacts with PDZD7, another PDZ-containing protein, where the PDZ domains of PDZD7 bind to the C-terminal PBM of ADGRV1. This interaction is important for regulating the signaling associated with the Usher2 complex (ColcombetCazenave2022Deciphering).

ADGRV1 is part of a shared interactome with CIB2, involving the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex and BBS proteins, which are essential for ciliary function and protein folding (Linnert2023Usher). The C-terminal fragment of ADGRV1 specifically interacts with the CCT3 protein, a component of the TRiC/CCT complex, in the ciliary region of photoreceptor cells (Linnert2023Usher). ADGRV1 also interacts with proteins involved in neuron projection guidance and retinal development, such as ephrin beta 1 (EFNB1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting its role in neurogenesis and synapse formation (Knapp2022Affinity).
