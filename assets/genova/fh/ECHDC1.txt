# ECHDC1

## Overview
ECHDC1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase 1, which is involved in the metabolic process of decarboxylating ethylmalonyl-CoA, a potentially harmful metabolite. This enzyme is categorized as a decarboxylase and plays a critical role in metabolite proofreading, ensuring the proper processing of metabolic intermediates to maintain cellular homeostasis (Dewulf2021ECHDC1; Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA). Ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase 1 is primarily located in the cytosol and is particularly abundant in tissues such as brown adipose tissue and liver, where it helps prevent the accumulation of ethyl-branched fatty acids that could disrupt membrane fluidity and function (Dewulf2021ECHDC1; Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA). The gene's function is crucial for preventing metabolic disturbances that could lead to conditions such as ethylmalonic aciduria, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic balance (Fogh2021Variants).

## Function
ECHDC1 (ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in metabolite proofreading by decarboxylating ethylmalonyl-CoA, a potentially toxic metabolite. This process prevents the accumulation of ethylmalonyl-CoA, which can interfere with fatty acid synthesis by replacing malonyl-CoA, leading to the formation of ethyl-branched fatty acids (Dewulf2021ECHDC1; Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA). ECHDC1 is primarily located in the cytosol and is involved in maintaining metabolic balance by ensuring the correct processing of specific metabolic intermediates (Dewulf2021ECHDC1; Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA).

In healthy cells, ECHDC1 helps limit the accumulation of branched-chain dicarboxyl-CoA compounds, thus preventing disturbances in fatty acid metabolism. This function is particularly important in tissues like brown adipose tissue and liver, where the enzyme is abundant (Dewulf2021ECHDC1; Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA). The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing the synthesis and accumulation of ethyl-branched lipids, which could otherwise affect membrane fluidity and function (Dewulf2021ECHDC1). ECHDC1's role in metabolite proofreading is analogous to DNA proofreading, as it eliminates non-classical metabolites that could accumulate and disrupt cell physiology (Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ECHDC1 gene have been implicated in ethylmalonic aciduria, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of ethylmalonic acid (EMA). This condition is associated with symptoms such as hypotonia, developmental delay, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and cyclic vomiting, with onset typically occurring in infancy or childhood. Genetic analysis has identified heterozygous variants in ECHDC1 in individuals with unexplained high levels of EMA, suggesting a loss-of-function effect due to reduced mRNA expression and enzyme activity (Fogh2021Variants).

ECHDC1 deficiency may also contribute to the clinical phenotype of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD), a condition linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuromuscular symptoms. The gene's role in metabolite proofreading is crucial for preventing the accumulation of ethylmalonyl-CoA, which can interfere with fatty acid synthesis and lead to the formation of branched fatty acids. This accumulation is expected to cause an increase in ethylmalonic acid concentration, leading to ethylmalonic aciduria (Linster2011EthylmalonylCoA).

In ECHDC1 knockout mice, the absence of this enzyme results in the accumulation of ethyl-branched fatty acids and abnormal intermediates of branched-chain fatty acid metabolism, which could potentially lead to toxic effects, although the mice did not exhibit overt clinical symptoms (Dewulf2021ECHDC1).
