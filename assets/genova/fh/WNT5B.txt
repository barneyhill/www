# WNT5B

## Overview
WNT5B is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 5B, which is part of the Wnt protein family known for its involvement in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. These pathways are crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The Wnt family member 5B protein is a secreted signaling molecule that interacts with several receptors, such as ROR2, ROR1, and Frizzled (FZD) receptors, to mediate its effects. It plays significant roles in different tissues, contributing to processes such as chondrocyte proliferation in bone development, epithelial differentiation in the lung, and neural differentiation in the nervous system. Dysregulation of WNT5B expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including several types of cancer, bone diseases, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Suthon2021WNT5B; Yang2003Wnt5aandWnt5bexhibit; Jiang2019WNT5B).

## Function
WNT5B is a member of the Wnt protein family, primarily involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, WNT5B plays significant roles in different tissues and developmental stages. In the mammary gland, WNT5B is expressed in differentiated luminal epithelial cells during mid-pregnancy, where it inhibits mammosphere formation by downregulating genes associated with proliferation and differentiation (Suthon2021WNT5B). In the lung, WNT5B is secreted by fibroblasts and promotes epithelial differentiation while repressing alveolar organoid formation (Suthon2021WNT5B).

In bone physiology, WNT5B is involved in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, promoting the formation of highly proliferative chondrocytes and inhibiting hypertrophy, which is essential for proper bone development (Yang2003Wnt5aandWnt5bexhibit). It also plays a role in osteoblast and osteoclast function, influencing bone formation and resorption through various signaling pathways (Suthon2021WNT5B).

WNT5B is also active in the nervous system, where it contributes to the differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes, and is involved in retinal and optic nerve development (Suthon2021WNT5B). These diverse functions highlight WNT5B's critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting tissue-specific functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WNT5B gene are implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly Triple Negative/Basal-Like Breast Cancer (TNBC), WNT5B is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of WNT5B in these cancer cells reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Suthon2021WNT5B; Jiang2019WNT5B; 1). In lung cancer, WNT5B is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is linked to poor survival. Its knockdown induces cell-cycle arrest and affects cell metabolism, suggesting its involvement in cancer cell proliferation (Zhang2019WNT5B; 1). 

WNT5B is also involved in pancreatic cancer, where it is highly expressed in the PANC-1 cell line and contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Suthon2021WNT5B; 1). In colorectal cancer, a polymorphism in the 3' UTR of WNT5B, rs2010851, is associated with tumor recurrence, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Suthon2021WNT5B). 

Beyond cancer, WNT5B is linked to bone diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, where its expression affects bone mineral density and disease progression (Suthon2021WNT5B; 1). In type 2 diabetes mellitus, SNP rs2270031 in WNT5B is associated with the disease, indicating its role in regulating adipocytes and pancreatic cells (Suthon2021WNT5B).

## Interactions
WNT5B is involved in various interactions with proteins and receptors, influencing multiple signaling pathways. It binds to the extracellular domains of ROR2 and ROR1, although these interactions are considered weak and often require over-expression techniques to be detected (1 page 14 of 33). WNT5B also interacts with Frizzled (FZD) receptors, with binding affinities varying depending on the specific FZD member and cellular context. For example, it has a high binding affinity with FZD1 in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor cell lines and signals through FZD7 in rat chondrocytes and FZD8 in human lung fibroblasts (1 page 14 of 33).

WNT5B is known to signal through the non-canonical Wnt pathways, including the Wnt/PCP pathway, by interacting with proteins such as CDC42, RAC1, and JNK, which are involved in cell migration and invasion (1 page 15 of 33). It also interacts with RYK, a receptor with a Wnt inhibitory factor-like domain, acting as a co-receptor in certain contexts (1 page 13 of 33). In osteoblasts, WNT5B physically interacts with ROR2, suggesting that its signal transduction may be mediated via this receptor (1 page 23 of 33). These interactions highlight WNT5B's role in modulating cellular processes through diverse signaling pathways.
