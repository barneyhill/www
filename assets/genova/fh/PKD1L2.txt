# PKD1L2

## Overview
The PKD1L2 gene encodes the polycystin-1-like 2 (PC1L2) protein, which is a member of the polycystin family and is characterized by its role as a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with potential ion channel functions. The protein is distinguished by its structural features, including a receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, a G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS domain), an LH2/PLAT domain, and 11 transmembrane domains, which suggest its involvement in membrane signaling and transport (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2; Li2003Identification). PC1L2 is expressed in various tissues such as the heart, kidney, brain, and testis, indicating its potential roles in mechanosensation and ion transport, akin to other polycystin family members (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with colorectal cancer risk, particularly in specific populations, where copy number variations in PKD1L2 have been linked to increased susceptibility (Park2016A).

## Structure
The PKD1L2 gene encodes the polycystin-1L2 (PC1L2) protein, which is a member of the polycystin family. The protein is characterized by several distinct domains, including a small receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, a G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS domain), and an LH2/PLAT domain. It also contains 11 predicted transmembrane domains, suggesting a role in membrane signaling or transport (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2; Li2003Identification).

The primary structure of PC1L2 includes a sequence of 2,460 amino acids in its long form, while the short form consists of 1,775 amino acids. The protein is encoded by 43 exons in the long form and 32 exons in the short form (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2; Li2003Identification). The secondary and tertiary structures are not explicitly detailed, but the presence of multiple transmembrane domains and extracellular regions suggests a complex folding pattern typical of membrane proteins.

Post-translational modifications of PC1L2 include multiple phosphorylation sites, such as protein kinase C and casein kinase sites, as well as N-glycosylation sites, which may influence its function and interactions (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2). The protein's ability to interact with specific G-protein subunits indicates a potential role as a G-protein-coupled receptor (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2).

## Function
The PKD1L2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the polycystin-1-like subfamily, which is involved in cellular signaling processes. PKD1L2 is characterized by several domains, including a small receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, a G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS), an LH2/PLAT domain, and 11 putative transmembrane domains. These structural features suggest that PKD1L2 may function as a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and potentially as a component of cation channel pores (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2; Li2003Identification).

PKD1L2 is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, kidney, brain, and testis, with the short form of the protein being more prevalent in the heart and kidney (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2). The protein's ability to bind specific G-protein subunits indicates its role in G-protein signaling pathways, which are crucial for regulating cellular functions (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2).

PKD1L2 may also play a role in mechanosensation and ion transport, as it shares structural similarities with other polycystin family members known to function as mechanoreceptors and ion channels (Li2003Identification). Understanding PKD1L2's function could provide insights into its involvement in cellular processes and its potential impact on conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PKD1L2 gene have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in specific populations. A study conducted on a Korean population found that copy number variations (CNVs) in PKD1L2, particularly copy number loss, are significantly associated with CRC predisposition. This CN loss was observed in 6.3% of CRC patients compared to 4.8% of controls, with an odds ratio of 1.436, indicating a statistically significant association (Park2016A). The risk is notably higher in younger patients under 50 years old and in males, with odds ratios of 2.138 and 1.519, respectively (Park2016A). 

The study also highlighted that individuals with a body mass index (BMI) above 25 and PKD1L2 CN loss have a significantly increased risk of CRC, with an odds ratio of 2.287. This risk is even more pronounced in younger individuals with a high BMI, where the odds ratio increases to 5.238 (Park2016A). The CN loss in PKD1L2 results in an in-frame deletion in the mRNA, affecting two transmembrane domains, which may alter signaling pathways or ion channel activity, contributing to cancer susceptibility (Park2016A).

## Interactions
Polycystin-1L2 (PC1L2), encoded by the PKD1L2 gene, is involved in interactions with G-protein subunits, suggesting a role as a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The C-terminal cytosolic domain of PC1L2 shows a preference for binding to Gαs and Gαi1 subunits, while it has little detectable binding to Gα12 or Gαi2. This interaction pattern is distinct from other polycystin proteins like PC1 and PC1L1, which can bind to a broader range of G-protein subunits (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2).

PC1L2 is part of the PCREJ subfamily, which includes PCREJ, PC1L2, and PC1L3. This subfamily is characterized by the presence of an ion transport domain but lacks a coiled-coil domain, differentiating it from the PC1 subfamily. The protein's structure includes 11 transmembrane domains, a small REJ domain, a GPS domain, and an LH2/PLAT domain, which are common features in PC1 homologs (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2).

The potential for PC1L2 to function as an ion channel is suggested by its structural features, although this has not been confirmed. Its expression in various tissues, including the kidney and heart, indicates possible roles in cardiac development and function, as well as implications in conditions related to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Yuasa2004Polycystin1L2).
