# CBLL1

## Overview
CBLL1, also known as Cbl proto-oncogene like 1, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitination process. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation by tagging proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (FernandezGarcia2011Appraising). CBLL1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing proliferation and apoptosis, and is a key player in the ubiquitination of E-cadherin, which is crucial for cell adhesion and communication (FernandezGarcia2011Appraising). Additionally, CBLL1 is a component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, impacting mRNA methylation and processing (Fernández2023CBLL1). Its interactions with various proteins, including the alpha estrogen receptor and N-MYC, underscore its involvement in diverse cellular pathways and its potential implications in cancer progression (Fernández2023CBLL1; Jiménez2021MYCN).

## Function
The CBLL1 gene, also known as Cbl proto-oncogene like 1, encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process. This process involves tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as signal transduction pathways related to cell growth and differentiation (FernandezGarcia2011Appraising). In healthy human cells, CBLL1 is involved in the ubiquitination of E-cadherin, a key protein in cell adhesion and signaling. This ubiquitination regulates the endocytosis of the E-cadherin complex, which is essential for maintaining proper cell adhesion and communication (FernandezGarcia2011Appraising).

CBLL1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Its activity in these cellular compartments underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various cellular signals (FernandezGarcia2011Appraising). The protein's involvement in these fundamental processes highlights its importance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in pathological conditions when dysregulated. While the specific function of CBLL1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in ubiquitination and cellular signaling is well recognized (FernandezGarcia2011Appraising).

## Clinical Significance
The CBLL1 gene, also known as Hakai, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in ubiquitination and degradation of proteins, which are crucial for processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. Alterations in CBLL1 expression have been linked to several malignancies, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC) (Guo2020The; Alfonsín2024Stratification).

In colorectal cancer, CBLL1 is particularly associated with the consensus molecular subtype 2 (CMS2). High expression of CBLL1 in CMS2 tumors correlates with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival, similar to the aggressive CMS4 subtype. This suggests that CBLL1 could serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis in CMS2 patients, aiding in patient stratification and personalized therapy (Alfonsín2024Stratification).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased CBLL1 expression is associated with larger tumor size and promotes cell cycle transition, leading to cell proliferation and invasion. Interfering with CBLL1 expression can inhibit cell invasion by affecting adhesion proteins and reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) (Guo2020The). These findings highlight the potential of CBLL1 as a target for cancer therapy and its role in cancer progression and immune interactions (Guo2020The).

## Interactions
CBLL1, also known as Cbl proto-oncogene like 1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions and plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It is a component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, which includes METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP, and is involved in mRNA methylation processes that affect RNA splicing and processing (Fernández2023CBLL1; Lambert2024Comparative). CBLL1 interacts with the alpha estrogen receptor (ERα), modulating its transactivation by competing with coactivators SRC1 and SRC2 (Fernández2023CBLL1).

CBLL1 is also known to form dimers that create an HYB domain for phosphotyrosine substrate binding, with its RING domains facilitating ubiquitination (Cooper2015Cell). In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CBLL1 is targeted by miR-545-3p, and its expression is modulated by the circ_0072083/miR-545-3p axis, influencing cancer cell growth and motility (Li2020Circ0072083).

Additionally, CBLL1 has been identified as a novel interactor of N-MYC in Wilms tumor, suggesting its involvement in oncogenic pathways (Jiménez2021MYCN). These interactions highlight CBLL1's role in various cellular processes, including mRNA metabolism, protein ubiquitination, and cancer progression.
