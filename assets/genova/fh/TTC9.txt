# TTC9

## Overview
TTC9 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 9 (TTC9A), which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. TTC9A is involved in interactions with proteins such as tropomyosin Tm5NM-1 and co-chaperones FKBP38 and FKBP51, which are significant for cytoskeletal organization and hormone signaling pathways, respectively (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide; Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide). The gene's expression is hormonally regulated and has been implicated in breast cancer, where it is often over-expressed, suggesting a potential role in cancer development and progression (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide). Additionally, TTC9A is involved in modulating estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity, influencing estrogen responsiveness and mammary development (Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide). Beyond its role in cancer, TTC9A has been linked to neuroplasticity and mood regulation, with deficiencies in the protein associated with anxiety-like behaviors in mice (Guan2020TTC9A).

## Structure
The TTC9 protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically form an antiparallel α-helical hairpin structure, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide; Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide). The TPR domains in TTC9 are located at the carboxyl terminus and are crucial for its function in facilitating specific protein interactions (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide; Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide).

The TTC9 protein contains three TPR domains, each consisting of a 34 amino acid consensus motif. These domains are positioned at amino acid residues 57-90, 128-161, and another unspecified position within the protein, which is 222 amino acids in length (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide). The TPR domains form a domain with a grooved surface, which is essential for its role in protein-protein interactions (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications and exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications and isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TTC9A gene have been implicated in breast cancer. TTC9A is over-expressed in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in breast cancer development (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide). The gene is hormonally regulated and interacts with proteins such as tropomyosin Tm5NM-1, which stabilizes actin filaments and may influence cell shape, motility, and cancer cell invasion (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide). Despite its over-expression, no correlation has been found between TTC9A expression and clinical pathological data such as tumor size or hormone receptor status (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide).

TTC9A also plays a role in modulating estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity. It negatively regulates ERα activity, and its absence leads to increased estrogen responsiveness, which could impact breast cancer biology (Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide). In mice, the absence of TTC9A results in enhanced mammary development and increased sensitivity to estrogen, suggesting a feedback mechanism that regulates estrogen function (Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide).

In the context of neuroplasticity and mood regulation, TTC9A deficiency in mice leads to anxiety-like behaviors and changes in neuroplasticity-related gene expressions, particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala, which may have implications for understanding anxiety disorders (Guan2020TTC9A).

## Interactions
TTC9A, a protein encoded by the TTC9 gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function. One of the primary interactions of TTC9A is with tropomyosin Tm5NM-1, a protein that stabilizes actin filaments. This interaction is crucial for cell shape and motility, and it has been confirmed through GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. The first tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and the linker fragment between the first two TPR domains of TTC9A are essential for this interaction, while the second and third TPRs may inhibit it (Cao2008Tetratricopeptide).

TTC9A also interacts with co-chaperone proteins FKBP38 and FKBP51, which are part of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) chaperone complex. Although TTC9A does not directly bind to ERα or Hsp90, its interaction with FKBP38 and FKBP51 suggests a role in modulating ERα activity. This interaction is thought to influence the assembly or maturation of the ERα-chaperone complex, thereby affecting ERα activity in breast cancer cells (Shrestha2015Tetratricopeptide). These interactions highlight TTC9A's role in cellular processes related to hormone signaling and cytoskeletal organization.
