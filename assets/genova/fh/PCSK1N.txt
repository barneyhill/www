# PCSK1N

## Overview
PCSK1N is a gene that encodes the protein proSAAS, which functions as an inhibitor of the enzyme proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PC1/3). This protein is categorized as an enzyme inhibitor, specifically targeting PC1/3, which is essential for the processing of prohormones and neuropeptides. The regulation of PC1/3 by proSAAS is crucial for maintaining metabolic and neuroendocrine functions, particularly in the processing of proinsulin to insulin, thereby influencing glucose metabolism (Liu2012Pax6). The expression of PCSK1N is modulated by the transcription factor Pax6, which plays a significant role in ensuring proper insulin maturation and metabolic balance (Liu2012Pax6). Dysregulation of PCSK1N has been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance in glucose homeostasis and endocrine function (Wang2017Weighted; Liu2012Pax6).

## Structure


## Function
PCSK1N encodes a protein known as proSAAS, which functions as an inhibitor of the enzyme proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PC1/3). This enzyme is crucial for the processing of prohormones and neuropeptides, which are essential for various metabolic and neuroendocrine functions. In healthy human cells, proSAAS modulates the activity of PC1/3 by inhibiting its C-terminal cleavage, thereby regulating the maturation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides (Liu2012Pax6).

The activity of proSAAS is primarily located in the secretory pathway of cells, where it plays a significant role in the processing of proinsulin to insulin. This regulation is vital for maintaining normal glucose metabolism, as proper insulin processing is essential for glucose homeostasis (Liu2012Pax6). In pancreatic islets, proSAAS co-localizes with insulin, indicating its involvement in insulin processing regulation (Liu2012Pax6).

The expression of PCSK1N and its product proSAAS is tightly controlled by the transcription factor Pax6, which directly down-regulates PCSK1N expression to ensure proper PC1/3 activity and insulin maturation (Liu2012Pax6). This regulatory mechanism highlights the importance of PCSK1N in maintaining metabolic balance in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PCSK1N gene, which encodes the proSAAS protein, have been implicated in various metabolic disorders. PCSK1N acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), which is crucial for the processing of prohormones. Dysregulation of PCSK1N can lead to impaired proinsulin processing, contributing to conditions such as obesity and diabetes. In particular, increased expression of PCSK1N has been associated with elevated fasting serum glucose levels, suggesting its role in glucose metabolism and potential contribution to diabetes (Liu2012Pax6).

In the context of obesity, PCSK1N has been identified as a gene potentially associated with obesity risk, as seen in studies involving BMI-discordant monozygotic twins (Wang2017Weighted). Additionally, alterations in PCSK1N expression have been observed in conditions like adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, where its high expression is linked to obesity and diabetes in mice (Ainiwan2022Adamantinomatous).

Furthermore, PCSK1N has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) through its role in regulating the proliferation of CD34+ hematopoietic cells via the PIM2/HIF-1α pathway, suggesting its involvement in hematopoietic malignancies (Liu2023LncRNA).

## Interactions
PCSK1N, also known as proSAAS, is known to interact with proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), acting as an inhibitor of this enzyme. This interaction is crucial for regulating the activity of PC1/3, which is involved in the processing of prohormones. In pancreatic islets, proSAAS inhibits PC1/3 activity by affecting its cleavage and activity, leading to altered proinsulin processing. This interaction is significant in the context of glucose metabolism and insulin regulation, as demonstrated in studies involving Pax6 mutant mice, where elevated levels of proSAAS resulted in compromised PC1/3 activity and impaired proinsulin processing (Liu2012Pax6).

The regulation of PCSK1N expression by Pax6 further highlights the interaction between these proteins. Pax6 directly down-regulates Pcsk1n expression, thereby influencing PC1/3 activity. This regulatory mechanism is supported by evidence showing that Pax6 binds to the Pcsk1n promoter, reducing its transcriptional activity and consequently decreasing proSAAS levels (Liu2012Pax6). These interactions underscore the role of PCSK1N in the endocrine system, particularly in the regulation of insulin processing and glucose metabolism.
