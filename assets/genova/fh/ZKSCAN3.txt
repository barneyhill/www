# ZKSCAN3

## Overview
ZKSCAN3 is a human gene that encodes the protein zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 3, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and its KRAB and SCAN domains, which are involved in transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interactions, respectively. As a transcriptional regulator, ZKSCAN3 plays a crucial role in repressing autophagy-related genes under nutrient-rich conditions, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is also involved in maintaining heterochromatin stability and genomic organization, particularly in human mesenchymal stem cells. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including nuclear lamina proteins and heterochromatin-associated proteins, underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in cancer pathogenesis, where it is often upregulated and associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Hu2020ZKSCAN3; Chauhan2013ZKSCAN3; Cho2022Role).

## Structure
ZKSCAN3 is a human gene encoding a protein that features zinc finger motifs, which are small structural motifs that stabilize the protein's fold. The protein is characterized by the presence of KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) and SCAN domains, both of which play significant roles in transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger motifs contribute to the protein's ability to bind DNA, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator.

The KRAB domain is typically involved in transcriptional repression, interacting with other proteins to form complexes that modulate gene expression. The SCAN domain is known for mediating protein-protein interactions, which can influence the assembly of transcriptional complexes. These domains contribute to the protein's tertiary structure by facilitating specific interactions that stabilize its conformation.

ZKSCAN3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. These modifications can play a role in regulating the protein's function and stability. Additionally, splice variants of ZKSCAN3 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in proteins with distinct functions or regulatory capabilities. These isoforms may vary in their domain composition or structural features, influencing their role in cellular processes.

## Function
ZKSCAN3 is a transcription factor that functions as a master transcriptional repressor of autophagy in human cells. It is involved in regulating a network of genes essential for autophagy and lysosome biogenesis, including those responsible for autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis, transport, and fusion. ZKSCAN3 represses genes such as Ulk1, Wipi2, Dfcp1, and Map1lc3b, which are crucial for autophagosome biogenesis and maturation (Chauhan2013ZKSCAN3). Under nutrient-rich conditions, ZKSCAN3 is localized in the nucleus, where it represses autophagy-related genes to maintain cellular homeostasis. During starvation, ZKSCAN3 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, allowing autophagy to proceed (Chauhan2013ZKSCAN3).

In addition to its role in autophagy, ZKSCAN3 is involved in maintaining heterochromatin stability in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). It interacts with nuclear lamina proteins and heterochromatin components, playing a role in preventing cellular senescence by stabilizing heterochromatin and maintaining genomic organization (Hu2020ZKSCAN3). ZKSCAN3 deficiency leads to epigenetic changes, including the detachment of lamina-associated domains from the nuclear lamina and increased chromatin accessibility, which can accelerate cellular senescence (Hu2020ZKSCAN3).

## Clinical Significance
ZKSCAN3 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colon cancer, ZKSCAN3 is upregulated and linked to chromosomal instability (CIN) through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It acts as a transcriptional repressor of spindle checkpoint proteins, leading to CIN by inhibiting MAD2L2 expression. This upregulation is observed in early stages of colon cancer, such as adenomas, and is associated with β-catenin expression (Cho2022Role).

In prostate cancer, ZKSCAN3 is overexpressed in metastatic cells and enhances cell migration and invasion. Its knockdown reduces cell motility, while overexpression increases tumorigenicity, suggesting its role in promoting metastasis (Zhang2012The).

ZKSCAN3 is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it contributes to tumor growth and progression. It is associated with reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy and is considered a potential therapeutic target (Yang2008The).

In breast cancer, ZKSCAN3 expression correlates with poor prognosis, including lymph node metastasis and shorter overall survival (Chi2018ZKSCAN3). In hepatocellular carcinoma, it promotes tumor metastasis through the integrin β4/FAK/AKT signaling pathway and is linked to poor survival outcomes (Li2020ZKSCAN3).

## Interactions
ZKSCAN3 is known to participate in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms complexes with heterochromatin-associated proteins such as KAP1 and HP1α, which are crucial for maintaining heterochromatin stability and counteracting cellular senescence in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (Hu2020ZKSCAN3). ZKSCAN3 also interacts with nuclear lamina proteins, including Lamin B1 and the Lamin B receptor (LBR), contributing to the organization of heterochromatin and genomic stability (Hu2020ZKSCAN3).

In the context of cancer, ZKSCAN3 is involved in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it acts as a transcriptional target of the β-catenin/TCF4 complex. This interaction is significant in colorectal cancer, where ZKSCAN3 is upregulated by WNT pathway activation (Cho2022Role). ZKSCAN3 also binds to the MAD2L2 promoter, repressing its expression and influencing chromosomal stability in colon cancer cells (Cho2022Role).

ZKSCAN3's interaction with genomic repetitive sequences, such as LINE1 and Satellite 2, is essential for silencing their transcription and maintaining heterochromatin integrity (Hu2020ZKSCAN3). These interactions highlight ZKSCAN3's role as an epigenetic regulator and its involvement in various cellular and pathological processes.
