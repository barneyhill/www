# APPBP2

## Overview
APPBP2, or amyloid beta precursor protein binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. The protein, characterized by its HEAT repeat domain, facilitates protein-protein interactions and is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the cell. APPBP2 is known to interact with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), playing a role in neuronal development and function. It also acts as a substrate receptor in the CUL2-RING E3 ligase complex, impacting protein degradation pathways. The gene's expression is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, where it is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Gong2019APPBP2; Monni2001Comprehensive).

## Structure
APPBP2, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding protein 2, is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including protein transport and signal transduction. The protein structure of APPBP2 includes several domains, notably the HEAT repeat domain, which plays a crucial role in mediating protein-protein interactions. This domain is composed of tandemly repeated units that form a superhelical structure, facilitating the binding of other proteins.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to occur in APPBP2, potentially influencing its functional activity and interactions within the cell. These modifications can alter the protein's conformation and its ability to participate in signaling pathways.

APPBP2 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for the generation of protein variants with potentially distinct functions or regulatory properties. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of complexity in the regulation and function of APPBP2, as different isoforms may be expressed in response to specific cellular conditions or developmental stages. The structural diversity provided by these isoforms and post-translational modifications underscores the protein's versatile role in cellular processes.

## Function
APPBP2, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding protein 2, plays a significant role in intracellular transport and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is crucial for neuronal development and function. APPBP2 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signal transduction.

In healthy human cells, APPBP2 is involved in the regulation of intracellular transport mechanisms, which are essential for the proper distribution of proteins and organelles within the cell. This function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring that cellular components are correctly localized to perform their functions effectively. Additionally, APPBP2's role in cell cycle regulation is vital for controlling cell division and ensuring that cells replicate accurately and at the appropriate times.

The interaction of APPBP2 with APP suggests its involvement in neuronal development, potentially affecting processes such as synaptic formation and maintenance. This interaction may also have implications for signal transduction pathways that are important for neuronal communication and plasticity. Overall, APPBP2 contributes to the proper functioning of cellular and organismal processes through its diverse roles in transport, regulation, and interaction with key proteins.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the APPBP2 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer. In NSCLC, APPBP2 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness while inhibiting apoptosis. This upregulation is associated with the regulation of PPM1D and SPOP pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Silencing APPBP2 in NSCLC cells results in reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gong2019APPBP2).

In breast cancer, APPBP2 is located within the 17q23 chromosomal region, which is frequently amplified in aggressive tumors. The overexpression of APPBP2 in breast cancer cell lines with 17q23 amplification suggests its role in the aggressive clinical course of the disease. This amplification is associated with poor prognosis and is more common in high-grade tumors and those from BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers (Monni2001Comprehensive). The involvement of APPBP2 in these cancers highlights its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
APPBP2, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding protein 2, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. APPBP2 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is associated with microtubules and is involved in the transport and processing of APP. This interaction is crucial for cell viability, proliferation, migration, and aggressiveness in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Gong2019APPBP2; Dilsizoglu2019Protein).

In the context of NSCLC, APPBP2 has been shown to interact with PPM1D, a protein phosphatase, through co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a physical interaction that enhances NSCLC proliferation and invasiveness. However, APPBP2 does not bind with SPOP, another protein involved in the same signaling pathway (Gong2019APPBP2).

APPBP2 also functions as a substrate receptor in the CUL2-RING E3 ligase complex, interacting with elongin B (ELOB) and elongin C (ELOC) to facilitate the polyubiquitination and degradation of the PRDM16 protein. This interaction is crucial for regulating PRDM16 stability and function in adipocytes, influencing beige fat biogenesis (Wang2022Posttranslational).
