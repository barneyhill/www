# DRP2

## Overview
The DRP2 gene encodes dystrophin-related protein 2, a member of the dystrophin protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional integrity of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. This protein is characterized by its spectrin-like repeats, WW domain, EF domain, and ZZ and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its interactions with various cellular components (Yang2015Retracted). DRP2 is integral to the formation of the periaxin-Drp2-dystroglycan (PDG) complex, essential for the development of Cajal bands that maintain myelin sheath structure (Sherman2012Drp2). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its recruitment and interaction dynamics within Schwann cells (Sherman2012Drp2). Mutations in the DRP2 gene have been implicated in neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and may have potential associations with other conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (Simone2021Autism; Stavrou2021Genetic).

## Structure
DRP2 (dystrophin related protein 2) is a member of the dystrophin protein family, characterized by its structural domains and interactions. The protein contains two spectrin-like repeats, which are involved in signal transduction and interactions with membrane channels, adhesion molecules, receptors, and transporters (Yang2015Retracted). These spectrin-like domains are described as three-helix bundle structures, serving as important interaction sites for structural and signaling proteins (Yang2015Retracted). DRP2 also features a unique 75-residue random-coiled amino terminus (Roberts2001Dystrophinsanddystrobrevins).

The protein includes a WW domain in the N-terminal region, an EF domain, and ZZ and coiled-coil domains in the C-terminal region (Yang2015Retracted). These domains are crucial for DRP2's role in forming complexes with other proteins, such as L-periaxin in the peripheral nervous system (Yang2015Retracted). DRP2 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its interactions and functional roles in Schwann cells (Sherman2012Drp2).

DRP2 is expressed in various isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may result in different functional properties and tissue-specific expressions (Jin2007The). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its involvement in maintaining cellular architecture and signaling pathways.

## Function
Dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of Schwann cells, which are essential for the myelination of peripheral nerves. In Schwann cells, DRP2 forms a complex with periaxin and dystroglycan, known as the periaxin-Drp2-dystroglycan (PDG) complex, which is crucial for the formation of Cajal bands. These bands are cytoplasmic channels that contribute to the structural integrity and function of myelin, the protective sheath around nerve fibers (Sherman2012Drp2).

DRP2 is involved in the stabilization and limitation of radial myelin growth, ensuring proper myelin structure. It is phosphorylated at specific sites, which is necessary for its recruitment to appositions in Schwann cells, although phosphorylation is not strictly required for apposition assembly (Sherman2012Drp2). The loss of DRP2 disrupts the organization of Cajal bands and appositions, leading to focal hypermyelination and demyelination, but does not affect internodal lengths (Sherman2012Drp2).

In the absence of DRP2, other dystrophin family members like Dp116 and utrophin are upregulated, but they cannot functionally replace DRP2 in forming appositions (Sherman2012Drp2). This highlights DRP2's unique role in maintaining the structural integrity of Schwann cells and their associated myelin sheaths.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DRP2 gene are associated with X-linked neuropathy, a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies. DRP2 interacts with periaxin in a complex crucial for the formation of Cajal bands, which are important for the structural integrity and function of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Disruptions in this complex can lead to impaired nerve function, contributing to the development of neuropathies (Stavrou2021Genetic).

In the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), DRP2 is suggested to play a compensatory role in dystrophin-deficient muscle. Although specific diseases directly linked to DRP2 mutations are not detailed, its upregulation may serve as a compensatory mechanism in the absence of dystrophin, potentially influencing muscle pathology (Erbe2023Exome).

There is also preliminary evidence suggesting a potential association between DRP2 mutations and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whole-exome sequencing studies have indicated a possible link, although the evidence remains limited and requires further investigation (Simone2021Autism).

## Interactions
DRP2 (dystrophin related protein 2) is known to interact with several proteins, forming important complexes in Schwann cells. One of the primary interactions of DRP2 is with periaxin and dystroglycan, forming the periaxin-Drp2-dystroglycan (PDG) complex. This complex is crucial for the formation of appositions and Cajal bands in myelinating Schwann cells, which are essential for proper nerve function (Sherman2012Drp2). The interaction between DRP2 and periaxin is particularly significant as it is necessary for the phosphorylation of DRP2, although phosphorylation is not required for apposition assembly (Sherman2012Drp2).

The loss of DRP2 leads to disrupted appositions and Cajal bands, resulting in focal hypermyelination and demyelination. Despite these disruptions, DRP2-null Schwann cells show increased levels of other dystrophin family members, such as utrophin and dystrophin Dp116, suggesting a compensatory mechanism, although these proteins cannot functionally replace DRP2 in forming appositions (Sherman2012Drp2).

DRP2 is also part of the myelin proteome, indicating its role in myelin biogenesis and structural organization, although specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed (Patzig2011Quantitative).
