# HNRNPH2

## Overview
The HNRNPH2 gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H2, a member of the hnRNP family involved in RNA metabolism. This protein plays a pivotal role in pre-mRNA processing, including alternative splicing and polyadenylation, by binding to G-tract RNA sequences. Structurally, hnRNPH2 contains three quasi-RNA-recognition motifs (qRRMs) and auxiliary domains that facilitate its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and protein interactions. Mutations in HNRNPH2, particularly those affecting its nuclear localization signal, are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. These mutations can lead to altered protein localization and function, impacting RNA processing and cellular homeostasis (Korff2024A; Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific; Korff2023A).

## Structure
The HNRNPH2 protein is an RNA-binding protein that is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. It contains three quasi-RNA-recognition motifs (qRRMs) that are involved in binding to G-tract RNA sequences, which play a role in pre-mRNA processing, including alternative splicing and polyadenylation (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific). The protein also features a central glycine-tyrosine-arginine-rich (GYR) auxiliary domain, which includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that facilitates its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific). The C-terminal glycine-tyrosine-rich (GY) auxiliary domain is thought to mediate protein interactions (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific).

Mutations in the proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of HNRNPH2 can lead to cytoplasmic accumulation and recruitment to stress granules, affecting its interaction with the nuclear transport receptor Kapβ2 (Korff2024A; Korff2023A). These mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and can result in a toxic gain of function or impaired compensation by HNRNPH1, a paralog of HNRNPH2 (Korff2024A; Korff2023A). The protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in RNA processing and cellular localization.

## Function
The HNRNPH2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, specifically the hnRNP H/F subfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, particularly in pre-mRNA processing, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation. HNRNPH2 recognizes G-tract RNA sequences and is involved in regulating alternative splicing and polyadenylation, which are essential for the development and function of complex neuronal circuits (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific).

In healthy human cells, HNRNPH2 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is part of the large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), a multimeric complex that regulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing. This nuclear localization is crucial for its role in splicing regulation, ensuring proper splicing and gene expression regulation, which is critical for normal cellular and neural function (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific).

The protein consists of three RNA-binding domains known as quasi-RNA-recognition motifs (qRRMs), a central glycine-tyrosine-arginine-rich (GYR) auxiliary domain with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and a C-terminal glycine-tyrosine-rich (GY) auxiliary domain that may mediate protein interactions (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNRNPH2 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, motor function deficits, tone abnormalities, and seizures. This disorder is linked to missense mutations within or adjacent to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of hnRNPH2, with common variants being R206W and R206Q. These mutations lead to reduced interaction with the nuclear transport receptor Kapβ2, resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNPH2 (Korff2024A; Korff2023A). The disorder may be driven by a toxic gain of function or a complex loss of HNRNPH2 function with impaired compensation by its paralog, HNRNPH1 (Korff2024A; Korff2022A).

In males, HNRNPH2 mutations can lead to a range of symptoms, including mild developmental delay, autistic features, psychiatric co-morbidities, and severe neurodevelopmental delay with seizures. These variant-specific effects suggest that the disorder may be a spliceopathy at the molecular level, affecting nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and interaction with splicing regulators (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific). The mislocalization of hnRNPH2 to cytosolic RNA granules is also implicated in the disorder, suggesting a gain of function related to RNA dynamics (Kelvington2023hnRNPH2).

## Interactions
HNRNPH2 interacts with the nuclear transport receptor Kapβ2 through a proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS). This interaction is crucial for the nuclear import of hnRNPH2, and mutations such as R206W, R206Q, and P209L impair this interaction, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNPH2 (Korff2024A). The interaction with Kapβ2 is enhanced when the PY-NLS peptide includes longer N- and C-terminal flanking sequences (Korff2024A).

HNRNPH2 is also part of the large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), a multimeric complex involved in alternative pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with components such as DDX5, HNRNPC, HNRNPM, and RBFOX. Variants like p.Arg114Trp show reduced interaction with these components, particularly with DDX5, which may affect splicing regulation (Kreienkamp2021Variantspecific).

HNRNPH2, along with hnRNPH1, binds to a G-run motif in exon 4i of the U11-48K pre-mRNA, influencing splicing by potentially blocking the 3' splice site or interfering with splicing enhancers. This interaction is part of a feedback regulation mechanism involving U1 snRNP and U11/U12 di-snRNP (Turunen2013HnRNPH1H2).
