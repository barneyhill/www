# CXCR1

## Overview
CXCR1 is a gene that encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. The receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a hallmark of class A GPCRs, and is primarily expressed on neutrophils and certain lymphocyte subsets. CXCR1 plays a pivotal role in the chemotactic response to interleukin-8 (IL-8), guiding neutrophils to sites of inflammation and infection, which is essential for host defense (Berkamp2017Structure; Park2012Structure). The receptor's interaction with IL-8 involves complex binding dynamics, including electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which facilitate its high-affinity binding and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Liou2014In; Park2011Interactions). CXCR1's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including cancer and fibrotic conditions, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2018Identification; Yang2021CXCR1).

## Structure
CXCR1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), exhibits a canonical structure with seven transmembrane helices, typical of class A GPCRs. The primary structure of CXCR1 includes a flexible N-terminal region, which is crucial for binding specificity to its ligand, interleukin-8 (IL-8) (Berkamp2017Structure). The secondary structure involves these transmembrane helices, which are integral to the receptor's function and stability (Kufareva2017What).

The tertiary structure of CXCR1 is characterized by conserved motifs such as CWxP, PIF, NPxxY, and DRY, which are essential for receptor activation. Upon agonist binding, significant conformational changes occur, particularly in transmembrane helices TM5 and TM6, facilitating the receptor's transition to an active state (Ishimoto2023Structural). The N-terminal tail of CXCR1 forms an extended conformation through interactions with the chemokine, and the structure includes two disulfide bonds on its external surface, contributing to its stability (Ishimoto2023Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, CXCR1 can form homodimers or heterodimers, although in the studied complex with CXCL8, it was found in a monomeric form (Ishimoto2023Structural). The receptor's interaction with G proteins involves the C-terminal residues of the G protein making apolar contacts with the N-terminus of TM6 and the C-terminal end of TM3 (Ishimoto2023Structural).

## Function
CXCR1, a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a critical role in immune and inflammatory responses by binding to the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) with high affinity. This interaction is essential for the chemotactic response of neutrophils, guiding them to sites of inflammation and infection, which is crucial for host defense (Park2012Structure; Tikhonov2001Downregulation). CXCR1 is primarily expressed on neutrophils and certain lymphocyte subsets, such as CD8+ T cells, but not on eosinophils, which correlates with the non-responsiveness of eosinophils to IL-8 (Petering1999The).

The receptor is involved in intracellular signaling pathways that lead to calcium mobilization, chemokine-mediated migration, and cell adhesion, which are vital for neutrophil migration and activation (Park2012Structure). CXCR1's structure, particularly the intracellular loop 3, is important for G-protein binding and activation, facilitating these cellular processes (Park2012Structure). The receptor is also involved in the internalization and recycling processes, regulated by specific motifs and actin-related kinases, which are crucial for maintaining receptor function and responsiveness (Matityahu2002Intracellular). CXCR1's activity is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it interacts with IL-8 to initiate these signaling cascades (Park2012Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The CXCR1 gene, encoding the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in immune response and cancer progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high CXCR1 expression is associated with poor outcomes, particularly in patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). This is attributed to CXCR1's role in activating pathways such as chemokine and JAK/STAT, which contribute to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Yang2021CXCR1). 

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CXCR1 expression is elevated compared to normal tissues, although its direct impact on prognosis is less clear. Genetic alterations in CXCR1 are linked to worse overall survival and progression-free survival in ccRCC patients (Wu2020Characterization). 

CXCR1 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of keloid scars, where a novel missense mutation, c.574G > A (p.Gly192Glu), has been identified. This mutation, along with increased CXCR1 expression, suggests a role in the excessive collagen deposition characteristic of keloids (Zhang2018Identification). 

These findings highlight CXCR1 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers and fibrotic conditions.

## Interactions
CXCR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor, primarily interacts with the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), also known as CXCL8. This interaction is crucial for immune responses, particularly in neutrophil chemotaxis. The binding of IL-8 to CXCR1 involves multiple steps and types of interactions. Initially, the N-loop of IL-8 binds to the N-terminal domain of CXCR1 through electrostatic interactions. This is followed by hydrophobic interactions that bring the ELR motif of IL-8 closer to the extracellular loops of CXCR1, with electrostatic interactions dominating the final binding phase (Liou2014In).

The N-terminal domain of CXCR1 is primarily responsible for binding IL-8, as demonstrated by NMR studies showing strong interactions that immobilize IL-8 in lipid bilayers (Park2011Interactions). The binding affinity of the CXCR1 N-terminal domain with IL-8 is significantly weaker than that of the full-length receptor, highlighting the importance of the entire receptor structure for high-affinity binding (Park2011Interactions).

CXCR1 also forms heterodimers with CXCR2 and interacts with other proteins like beta-arrestins, which influence receptor desensitization and internalization. These interactions are essential for the receptor's role in signal transduction and cellular responses (Joseph2018DynamicsDerived).
