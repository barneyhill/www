# CCL13

## Overview
C-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CCL13) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine family, which plays a pivotal role in immune response and inflammation. The protein product, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-4 (MCP-4), is characterized by its ability to attract and activate various immune cells, including eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and T cells, through interactions with chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3 (Li2023CCL13; MendezEnriquez2013The). Structurally, CCL13 features a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and an α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges, which are crucial for its function and potential dimerization (Barinka2008Structure). The gene is expressed in a wide range of tissues, contributing to leukocyte circulation and homeostasis under normal conditions, while its dysregulation is implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including asthma, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (Li2023CCL13; MendezEnriquez2013The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the human CCL13 protein, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-4 (MCP-4), has been elucidated through crystallographic analysis. The protein is part of the CC chemokine family and features a primary structure consisting of 75 amino acid residues (Barinka2008Structure). The secondary structure includes an extended N-terminal segment, a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet forming part of a 'Greek key' motif, and a C-terminal α-helix (Barinka2008Structure). Two disulfide bridges, Cys11-Cys35 and Cys12-Cys51, stabilize the protein's tertiary structure, with the Cys11-Cys35 bridge specifically supporting the β-structure (Barinka2008Structure).

The protein's quaternary structure suggests the potential for dimerization, with a dimerization interface similar to those of MCP-1 and MCP-2 (Barinka2008Structure). The C-terminal region of CCL13 includes an amphipathic α-helix rich in basic residues, contributing to its antimicrobial activity (CossioAyala2017In). This region can transition from an unordered to a helical conformation, particularly in the presence of lipopolysaccharides (CossioAyala2017In). The structural insights into CCL13 provide a foundation for understanding its role in chemokine receptor interactions and potential therapeutic applications.

## Function
CCL13, also known as MCP-4, is a chemokine that plays a significant role in immune responses and inflammation. In healthy human cells, CCL13 is involved in normal immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis by regulating cell migration and activation during immune responses. It acts as a chemoattractant for various immune cells, including eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, macrophages, immature dendritic cells, and T cells, facilitating their recruitment to sites of inflammation (Li2023CCL13; MendezEnriquez2013The).

CCL13 binds to several chemokine receptors, such as CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3, allowing it to exert diverse effects on target cells (MendezEnriquez2013The). It is broadly expressed across various tissues, including the small bowel, colon, lung, heart, placenta, thymus, liver, muscle, kidney, pancreas, prostate, testis, and ovary, where it plays a crucial role in leukocyte circulation under homeostatic conditions (MendezEnriquez2013The).

Structurally, CCL13 contains 98 amino acids, with a mature form of 75 amino acids after cleavage. It features a central three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and an alpha-helix, with a large positively charged surface that may be important for interacting with negatively charged bacterial membranes, indicating its antimicrobial activity (MendezEnriquez2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL13 gene are associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In obesity, CCL13 levels are elevated in the sera of patients and correlate with body mass index and insulin resistance, suggesting a role in metabolic dysregulation (Li2023CCL13; MendezEnriquez2013The). In atherosclerosis, CCL13 contributes to monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions, implicating it in cardiovascular disease (MendezEnriquez2013The). 

In multiple sclerosis (MS), CCL13 is involved in the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the central nervous system, contributing to neuro-inflammation. A specific haplotype of CCL13 is associated with increased susceptibility to MS (MendezEnriquez2013The). In rheumatoid arthritis, elevated CCL13 levels in synovial tissue and fluid contribute to joint inflammation and destruction (Li2023CCL13; MendezEnriquez2013The).

CCL13 is also implicated in respiratory conditions such as asthma, where it is overexpressed in the bronchial epithelium and linked to eosinophil accumulation and airway inflammation (Li2023CCL13; MendezEnriquez2013The). In atopic dermatitis, CCL13 is a Th2-associated marker with increased expression in lesional skin, contributing to inflammation (Li2023CCL13). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCL13 in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, where its altered expression and interactions contribute to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
CCL13, also known as MCP-4, interacts with several chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CCR11, facilitating the migration of immune cells such as eosinophils, monocytes, T cells, and immature dendritic cells (Barinka2008Structure; Li2023CCL13). The chemokine can form dimers, such as CCL13-CCL8 and CCL2-CCL13, although the in vivo relevance of these dimers remains unclear (MendezEnriquez2013The). 

CCL13 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like heparin, which can inhibit its chemotactic responses by competing with receptor binding (Culley2003Proteoglycans). This interaction is dose-dependent, with higher concentrations of heparin leading to greater inhibition of CCL13-induced migration (Culley2003Proteoglycans). 

Synthetic peptides derived from CCL13, such as CDIP-2, have been shown to antagonize chemokine-mediated functions by interacting with CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3, reducing leukocyte recruitment and inflammation in models of allergic airway inflammation (MendezEnriquez2008CDIP2). These interactions highlight the potential for therapeutic applications targeting CCL13 in inflammatory diseases.
