# SLC7A10

## Overview
The SLC7A10 gene encodes the solute carrier family 7 member 10 (Asc-1), a transmembrane protein that functions as a sodium-independent transporter of small neutral amino acids. This protein is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a pivotal role in neurotransmitter regulation by modulating the levels of amino acids such as glycine and D-serine, which are co-agonists of NMDA receptors (Ehmsen2016The; Rosenberg2013Neuronal). Structurally, Asc-1 is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices forming a LeuT-fold, and it operates as part of a heterodimeric complex with the heavy subunit 4F2hc (SLC3A2), which is essential for its transport activity (Li2024CryoEM). Beyond its neurological functions, SLC7A10 is also involved in metabolic processes in adipose tissue, influencing energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Jersin2022The). Mutations in SLC7A10 have been linked to neurological disorders such as hyperekplexia, highlighting its clinical significance (Drehmann2023Dual).

## Structure
The SLC7A10 gene encodes the Asc-1 transporter, a member of the solute carrier family involved in the sodium-independent transport of small neutral amino acids. The Asc-1 protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices forming a LeuT-fold, a common structural motif in this protein family (Li2024CryoEM). The transmembrane helices are organized in a 5+5 inverted topology fold, with TM1 and TM6 being discontinuous and consisting of two short alpha-helices connected by a conserved unwound segment crucial for substrate binding (Mikou2020Asc1).

The Asc-1 transporter forms a heterodimeric complex with the heavy subunit 4F2hc (SLC3A2), linked by a disulfide bond between Cys154 of Asc-1 and Cys211 of 4F2hc (Li2024CryoEM). This quaternary structure is essential for its function in amino acid transport across cell membranes. The interaction between Asc-1 and 4F2hc involves non-covalent interactions at various regions, contributing to the structural stability and transport activity of the complex (Li2024CryoEM).

The protein undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, transitioning between inward open, occluded, and outward open states, which are critical for its transport mechanism (Li2024CryoEM). Specific residues such as Phe243, Glu257, and Arg339 play key roles in substrate binding and transport activity (Li2024CryoEM). However, detailed information on primary, secondary, tertiary structures, specific domains, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of SLC7A10 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The SLC7A10 gene encodes the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter-1 (Asc-1), a sodium-independent transporter involved in the uptake and release of small neutral amino acids, including glycine, D-serine, L-serine, L-alanine, and L-cysteine. This transporter is primarily active in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons and astrocytes, where it plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter regulation and maintaining amino acid homeostasis (Galluccio2023OverProduction; Ehmsen2016The; Rosenberg2013Neuronal).

Asc-1 is essential for modulating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic activity by mediating the release of D-serine and glycine, which are co-agonists of NMDA receptors. This function is critical for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission (Rosenberg2013Neuronal). In astrocytes, particularly in the spinal cord and brainstem, SLC7A10 is involved in glycinergic inhibition by maintaining glycine levels necessary for proper inhibitory neurotransmission (Ehmsen2016The).

In adipose tissue, SLC7A10 influences energy metabolism by regulating amino acid transport, which affects oxidative stress and insulin sensitivity. It is involved in the transport of serine, crucial for one-carbon metabolism and glutathione production, impacting mitochondrial function and thermogenesis (Jersin2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC7A10 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, most notably human startle disease, also known as hyperekplexia. This condition is characterized by an exaggerated startle response and muscle stiffness. A specific missense mutation, G307R, in the SLC7A10 gene has been identified in patients with hyperekplexia, leading to a loss of function in the Asc-1 transporter, which is crucial for maintaining glycine levels in the brain (Drehmann2023Dual). This mutation results in structural changes that impair the transport function of Asc-1, contributing to the disease phenotype (Drehmann2023Dual).

In addition to its role in hyperekplexia, SLC7A10 has been associated with developmental delays. The dysfunction of the Asc-1 transporter affects glycinergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, which are essential for normal neurological development (Drehmann2023Dual). The gene's expression levels in adipose tissue are inversely correlated with metabolic disease risk factors, suggesting a role in metabolic health and insulin resistance (Jersin2022The).

Animal studies have further supported the gene's significance, with SLC7A10-null mice exhibiting a hyperekplexia-like phenotype, underscoring its critical role in glycinergic inhibition (Ehmsen2016The).

## Interactions
The SLC7A10 gene encodes the Asc-1 transporter, which is involved in the transport of neutral amino acids. Asc-1 forms a heterodimeric complex with the heavy chain protein 4F2hc (SLC3A2), which is essential for its function. This interaction is crucial for the trafficking of Asc-1 to the plasma membrane, where it performs its transporter activity (Drehmann2023Dual; Rosenberg2013Neuronal). The Asc-1 transporter is involved in the release of D-serine and glycine, which are important for NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic activity. It operates as both a facilitative transporter and an antiporter, mediating the non-vesicular release of these coagonists (Sason2016Asc1; Rosenberg2013Neuronal).

The Asc-1 transporter also interacts with various substrates and inhibitors. For instance, Lu AE00527 is a selective inhibitor of Asc-1, which blocks the transport of D-serine and glycine, affecting synaptic activity (Sason2016Asc1). Additionally, D-isoleucine (D-Ile) acts as a selective activator of Asc-1, enhancing the release of D-serine and influencing long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (Rosenberg2013Neuronal). These interactions highlight the critical role of Asc-1 in neurotransmission and synaptic regulation.
