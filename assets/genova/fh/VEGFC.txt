# VEGFC

## Overview
Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the platelet-derived growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (PDGF/VEGF) family, which plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The VEGFC protein is a secreted growth factor that primarily interacts with the VEGFR-3 receptor, and to a lesser extent, VEGFR-2, facilitating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, crucial for the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system (Makinen2001Isolated; Joukov1996A). The gene undergoes complex post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing, which is essential for its biological activity (Joukov1997Proteolytic). VEGFC is expressed in various tissues, indicating its role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and fluid balance (Joory2006Vascular). Alterations in the VEGFC gene have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Tung2014Associations; Dai2019VEGFC).

## Structure
The VEGFC protein is initially synthesized as a precursor polypeptide consisting of 419 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 46.9 kDa (Eriksson1999Structure). The primary structure includes an N-terminal signal sequence, a VEGF homology domain, and a C-terminal pro-peptide (Eriksson1999Structure). The VEGF homology domain is encoded by exons 3 and 4, while exons 5 and 7 encode cysteine-rich motifs (Chilov1997Genomic). 

VEGFC undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing and glycosylation. It contains three putative N-glycosylation sites, with two remaining in the mature form (Eriksson1999Structure). Proteolytic processing involves cleavages that result in various molecular forms, including a mature 21 kDa form that is a high-affinity ligand for VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 (Joukov1997Proteolytic). 

The quaternary structure of VEGFC involves dimerization, forming disulfide-bonded homodimers (Eriksson1999Structure). The protein's structure is characterized by eight conserved cysteine residues that form intra- and interchain disulfide bonds, creating an antiparallel dimeric molecule (Joukov1996A). 

VEGFC also has splice variant isoforms, such as VEGF-C 184, VEGF-C 129, and VEGF-C 62, which result from alternative splicing events and have distinct C-terminal sequences (Wang2010Characterization). These isoforms may have unique roles due to their specific structural differences (Wang2010Characterization).

## Function
VEGFC is a critical protein involved in the processes of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, which are essential for the formation and maintenance of blood and lymphatic vessels. It functions primarily by binding to the VEGFR-3 receptor, which is predominantly expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, and to a lesser extent, VEGFR-2, which is involved in blood vessel formation (Makinen2001Isolated; Joukov1996A). 

In healthy human cells, VEGFC promotes the proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells. It plays a significant role in protecting these cells from apoptosis, particularly under conditions of serum starvation, by activating signaling pathways such as the PI3-kinase/Akt and MAPK pathways (Makinen2001Isolated). This signaling is crucial for the growth and maintenance of lymphatic vessels, as well as for the remodeling of primary capillary vasculature during embryonic development (Makinen2001Isolated).

VEGFC is widely expressed in various normal human tissues, including the large intestine, mammary ducts, and muscles, indicating its role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and fluid balance across different tissue environments (Joory2006Vascular). Its activity in the extracellular space underscores its importance in intercellular communication and tissue adaptation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VEGFC gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VEGFC gene, such as rs1485766, have been associated with an increased risk of developing the disease, especially in non-smokers. In smokers, other SNPs like rs7664413 and rs2046463 are linked to higher UCC risks and advanced tumor status, suggesting a gene-smoking interaction that influences UCC susceptibility and tumor growth (Tung2014Associations).

In oral cancer, the VEGFC rs7664413 TT genotype and rs2046463 polymorphisms are significantly associated with a higher risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The interaction between these genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors, such as smoking, significantly increases the risk of developing oral cancer (Chien2013Impact).

VEGFC polymorphisms also play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The rs1485766 A/A genotype is linked to a higher risk of HCC, and certain haplotypes are associated with increased HCC risk. The rs7664413 polymorphism is suggested as a predictive factor for advanced-stage HCC (Hsieh2014Role).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), VEGFC polymorphisms, such as rs11947611, are associated with increased susceptibility to the disease, highlighting the gene's potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Dai2019VEGFC).

## Interactions
VEGFC interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. It primarily binds to the VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 receptors, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation, which promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Joukov1997Proteolytic). The proteolytic processing of VEGFC is essential for its activity, allowing it to preferentially signal through VEGFR-3, which is important for lymphatic development (Joukov1997Proteolytic).

VEGFC also interacts with neuropilin receptors, particularly NP2, which acts as a co-receptor enhancing its signaling capabilities. This interaction is crucial for lymphangiogenesis, as NP2 cointernalizes with VEGFR-3 in lymphatic endothelial cells upon VEGFC stimulation (Karpanen2006Functional). The binding of VEGFC to NP2 is heparin-independent, although heparin can enhance this interaction (Karpanen2006Functional).

Additionally, the CCBE1 gene enhances the proteolytic activation of VEGFC by promoting its cleavage by the ADAMTS3 protease, which is necessary for VEGFC to reach its full signaling potential (Jeltsch2014CCBE1). This interaction underscores the importance of VEGFC in lymphatic development and its potential as a therapeutic target for lymphatic-related diseases.
