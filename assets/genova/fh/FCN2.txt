# FCN2

## Overview
The FCN2 gene encodes ficolin-2, a crucial protein in the innate immune system, specifically involved in the lectin pathway of complement activation. Ficolin-2 is a soluble pattern recognition molecule that is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in human serum. It is characterized by a collagen-like domain and a fibrinogen-like domain, which enable it to bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This binding facilitates the activation of the complement system, promoting opsonization and phagocytosis of pathogens. Ficolin-2 forms complexes with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which are essential for its function in immune defense (Garred2009MBL2; Kilpatrick2012Human). Variations in the FCN2 gene can influence the concentration and functional activity of ficolin-2, impacting susceptibility to infections and other immune-related conditions (Munthe‐Fog2007The; Smolnikova2022Proteins).

## Structure
Ficolin-2, encoded by the FCN2 gene, is a protein involved in the lectin pathway of innate immunity. The primary structure of ficolin-2 includes a signal peptide, a short N-terminal region, a collagen-like domain, and a fibrinogen-like (Fbg) domain (Kilpatrick2012Human; Endo2015New). The collagen-like domain is characterized by Gly-X-Y triplet repeats, forming a triple helix structure (Endo2015New). 

The secondary structure of ficolin-2 involves these collagen-like repeats, which contribute to the formation of a helical tail (Kilpatrick2012Human). The Fbg domain is globular and ellipsoidal, consisting of three subdomains (A, B, and P), with a calcium ion binding site located in the P subdomain (Endo2015New).

In terms of tertiary structure, ficolin-2 forms a bouquet-like shape with a triple helical tail and three globular heads, resembling the structure of complement component C1q (Kilpatrick2012Human). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homooligomer, typically a 12-mer, through the association of these subunits via disulfide bridges in the N-terminal region (Kilpatrick2012Human; Endo2006Structure).

Post-translational modifications of ficolin-2 include glycosylation, which contributes to its molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa (Kilpatrick2012Human).

## Function
The FCN2 gene encodes Ficolin-2, a protein that plays a significant role in the innate immune system. Ficolin-2 is a soluble pattern recognition molecule primarily expressed in the liver and found in human serum. It is involved in the immune response by binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as carbohydrates, lipoteichoic acid, and acetylated groups on the surface of pathogens, including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (Hummelshoj2005Polymorphisms; Munthe‐Fog2007The). This binding facilitates phagocytosis and activates the complement system through the lectin pathway, using serine proteases similar to those used by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (Garred2009MBL2; Munthe‐Fog2007The).

Ficolin-2 contains a collagen-like domain and a fibrinogen-like domain, which are crucial for its function. The fibrinogen-like domain allows Ficolin-2 to bind carbohydrates, facilitating the recognition of pathogens and apoptotic cells (Garred2009MBL2). The collagen-like domain interacts with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), enabling the activation of the complement system, which leads to opsonization, inflammation, and lysis of pathogens, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms (Garred2009MBL2). Variations in the FCN2 gene can influence the concentration and affinity of Ficolin-2, potentially affecting its role in immune responses (Munthe‐Fog2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the FCN2 gene, which encodes ficolin-2, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. Variations in the FCN2 gene can lead to differences in ficolin-2 plasma concentrations, potentially affecting susceptibility to infections. For instance, the rs17549193*T allele is linked to lower avidity and higher plasma levels of ficolin-2, which may increase susceptibility to diseases such as visceral leishmaniasis (Smolnikova2022Proteins). Conversely, the rs7851696*T allele is associated with higher prevalence in certain populations, such as the Nenets, and may influence disease susceptibility (Smolnikova2017The).

In the context of hematological malignancies, specific FCN2 polymorphisms have been observed more frequently in patients with multiple myeloma and lymphomas compared to controls. For example, heterozygosity for the -857 C>A polymorphism and G/G homozygosity for the -557 A>G polymorphism are more prevalent in these patient groups (Świerzko2020Associations). Additionally, altered ficolin-2 levels have been noted in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where higher serum concentrations are observed compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology (Sokołowska2020Associations). These findings indicate that FCN2 gene variations may contribute to the risk and progression of certain infectious and hematological diseases.

## Interactions
Ficolin-2, encoded by the FCN2 gene, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in the immune system. It forms complexes with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), specifically MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3, as well as small MBL-associated protein (sMAP). These complexes are essential for activating the lectin pathway of the complement system, leading to the cleavage of complement proteins C2 and C4, and subsequently forming the C3 convertase (Garred2009MBL2; Matsushita2000Cutting; Kilpatrick2012Human).

Ficolin-2 also interacts with various ligands, including acetylated structures and neutral sugars, through its multiple binding sites. It can bind to viral envelope glycoproteins, human DNA, elastin, and pentraxins such as C-reactive protein and pentraxin 3. These interactions facilitate the recognition and clearance of pathogens and apoptotic cells (Kilpatrick2012Human).

The protein's ability to bind to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi and protozoa, highlights its role in enhancing phagocytosis and cooperating with other immune molecules to amplify antimicrobial recognition (Kilpatrick2012Human).
