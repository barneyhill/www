# CA8

## Overview
The CA8 gene encodes the carbonic anhydrase 8 protein, a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, which is distinctively acatalytic. Unlike other carbonic anhydrases, CA8 does not facilitate the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide due to the absence of zinc-binding histidine residues, which are crucial for catalytic activity (Sanyanga2020Structural; Aspatwar2013Carbonic). Instead, CA8 functions as a regulatory protein, primarily expressed in the cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in modulating intracellular calcium signaling. This modulation is achieved through its interaction with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), influencing calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (Aspatwar2010Carbonic; Chi2020Expression). The CA8 protein is crucial for maintaining motor coordination and balance, and mutations in the CA8 gene are linked to neurological disorders such as congenital ataxia and disequilibrium syndrome, underscoring its importance in neuromuscular function and development (Huang2014Roles; Türkmen2009CA8).

## Structure
The human carbonic anhydrase 8 (CA8) protein is characterized by a structure that includes a central core domain with a classical architecture typical of mammalian carbonic anhydrases. This core domain features a 10-stranded central beta-sheet surrounded by several short alpha-helices and beta-strands, closely resembling the structures of cytosolic isozymes CA II and CA XIII, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.3 Å (Picaud2009Crystal). Despite its structural similarity to catalytically active carbonic anhydrases, CA8 is acatalytic due to the absence of essential zinc-coordinating histidines, which are replaced by other residues, leading to its catalytic inactivity (Sanyanga2020Structural; Aspatwar2013Carbonic).

The protein consists of 290 amino acids and includes an N-terminal Glu-rich region, known as the E loop, which contributes to an extensive electronegative surface (Picaud2009Crystal). This region is longer in mammals compared to non-mammalian vertebrates (Aspatwar2013Carbonic). CA8 is highly expressed in the cerebellum and plays a role in calcium homeostasis by interacting with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1) (Sanyanga2020Structural). The protein's structure and function are influenced by single nucleotide variations, which can affect its stability and interaction capabilities (Sanyanga2020Structural).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 8 (CA8) is a non-catalytic member of the carbonic anhydrase family, primarily expressed in the cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells. Unlike other carbonic anhydrases, CA8 lacks the ability to catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 due to the absence of zinc-binding histidine residues (Picaud2009Crystal; Chi2020Expression). Instead, CA8 plays a crucial role in modulating intracellular calcium signaling by inhibiting the binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to its receptor, IP3R1, on the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is essential for regulating calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is vital for various cellular processes, including synapse recycling, proliferation, learning, memory, and apoptosis (Aspatwar2010Carbonic; Wang2014Effects).

CA8 is involved in motor coordination and balance, as evidenced by its high expression in the cerebellum and its association with motor control disorders when deficient. Mutations in CA8 have been linked to congenital ataxia and mild cognitive impairment, highlighting its importance in neuromuscular function and development (Huang2014Roles; Kaya2011Phenotypical). The protein's protective role against apoptotic stress further underscores its significance in maintaining neuronal health (Chi2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CA8 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily affecting cerebellar function. These include cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and disequilibrium syndrome subtype 3 (CAMRQ3), which is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability, and sometimes quadrupedal gait (Paternoster2020Novel; Türkmen2009CA8). Specific mutations, such as the homozygous missense mutation S100P, lead to proteasome-mediated degradation of the CA8 protein, resulting in reduced levels and improper modulation of calcium signaling in the cerebellum (Türkmen2009CA8). This disruption in calcium signaling is crucial for cerebellar functions and contributes to the observed phenotypes, including ataxia and quadrupedal gait (Aspatwar2012Abnormal).

Other mutations, like CA8-S100P and CA8-G162R, exhibit gain-of-function effects, affecting neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation, and are linked to neuron hypoplasia and cerebellar atrophy (Chi2020Expression). These mutations also impact calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, further contributing to the neurological symptoms (Chi2020Expression). The CA8 gene's role in modulating calcium ion release through its interaction with the ITPR1 protein is critical, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to excessive calcium release, exacerbating the conditions associated with CA8 mutations (Aspatwar2012Abnormal).

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 8 (CA8) is known to interact with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), a ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling. This interaction inhibits IP3 binding to IP3R1, thereby modulating calcium release from intracellular stores, particularly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Aspatwar2010Carbonic; Chi2020Expression). The binding of CA8 to IP3R1 occurs within the modulatory domain of IP3R1, specifically between amino acids 1387-1647, and requires amino acids 45-291 of CA8 for effective interaction (Aspatwar2010Carbonic).

Despite the evidence of interaction from yeast two-hybrid systems and GST pull-down assays, some studies have not detected a direct interaction between CA8 and IP3R1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells using co-immunoprecipitation and Duolink proximity ligation assays (Shimobayashi2015Carbonic). This suggests that while CA8 and IP3R1 are co-expressed and may have a functional relationship, the physical interaction might be context-dependent or not easily detectable with certain methods. CA8's interaction with IP3R1 is significant for its role in regulating intracellular calcium signaling, which is essential for various neuronal functions (Wang2014Effects).
