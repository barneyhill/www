# KDM3A

## Overview
KDM3A is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 3A, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing histone demethylases. This enzyme is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by specifically demethylating lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression. By removing these repressive marks, KDM3A plays a crucial role in activating gene expression, which is essential for various biological processes, including embryonic stem cell maintenance, spermatogenesis, and smooth muscle cell differentiation (Nottke2009Developmental; Verde2017LysineSpecific). The protein's involvement in androgen receptor-mediated transcription further underscores its significance in tissue-specific functions and its potential impact on cancer progression (Nottke2009Developmental). KDM3A's diverse roles in cellular processes and disease states make it a significant focus of research in epigenetics and oncology.

## Function
KDM3A, also known as JMJD1A, is a lysine-specific histone demethylase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It demethylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a modification typically associated with transcriptional repression, thereby activating gene expression. This activity is crucial for maintaining embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal by preventing H3K9 dimethylation at pluripotency-associated gene promoters, such as the Tcl1 gene (Nottke2009Developmental; Verde2017LysineSpecific).

KDM3A is also essential for spermiogenesis, where it binds to and positively regulates the expression of transition nuclear protein 1 (Tnp1) and protamine 1 (Prm1) by removing repressive H3K9 marks from their promoters. This function is critical for sperm chromatin maturation and the histone replacement process, with its absence leading to defects in spermatogenesis, such as azoospermia and globozoospermia (Nottke2009Developmental; Verde2017LysineSpecific).

In smooth muscle cells, KDM3A contributes to differentiation by interacting with the myocardin transcription factor and demethylating H3K9me3 at specific gene promoters, regulating their TGFß-mediated activation (Verde2017LysineSpecific). Additionally, KDM3A is involved in androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation, influencing genes important for tissue-specific functions, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate tissue (Nottke2009Developmental).

## Clinical Significance
KDM3A is implicated in various cancers due to its role in epigenetic regulation. Overexpression of KDM3A is observed in several cancers, including bladder, lung, and prostate cancer, where it promotes oncogenic transformation by activating genes like HOXA1 and interacting with androgen receptors (Yoo2020Advances; Cho2011The). In breast cancer, KDM3A contributes to cell invasion, drug resistance, and stemness by demethylating histone and non-histone proteins such as p53, which affects apoptosis and chemoresistance (Ramadoss2016Lysine; Yoo2020Advances).

In colorectal cancer, KDM3A is crucial for cell proliferation and migration, interacting with the Hippo pathway and YAP1, which are essential for tumor formation (Wang2019Histone). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, KDM3A is part of a regulatory axis with miR-335 and YAP1, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Zhang2021Downregulation). KDM3A also plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma by contributing to tumor formation through the PI3K pathway (Nakatsuka2017Impact).

Beyond cancer, KDM3A is involved in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, where its upregulation exacerbates pathological remodeling, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in heart disease (Zhang2018Histone). These findings highlight KDM3A's clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various diseases.

## Interactions
KDM3A, also known as lysine demethylase 3A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in gene regulation and cancer progression. In breast cancer, KDM3A acts as a coregulatory protein in estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, facilitating the recruitment of ER to target gene promoters. It interacts with KDM4B in an auto-regulatory loop to regulate ER functions, and both proteins are enriched at estrogen response elements of ER target genes (Yoo2020Advances). KDM3A also interacts with forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), which is involved in chromatin binding and activation of ER target genes (Yoo2020Advances).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, KDM3A interacts with hypoxia-inducible factors, particularly HIF1α, to regulate hypoxia-induced stemness by upregulating DCLK1 expression (Dandawate2019The). This interaction is crucial for tumor initiation and progression. KDM3A also forms a complex with activated CDC42 kinase 1 (ACK1), which phosphorylates KDM3A, influencing HOXA1 transcription (Yoo2020Advances).

In colorectal cancer, KDM3A is associated with the p300 protein, necessary for p300 recruitment to enhancers, which is crucial for enhancer activation and transcription of Hippo target genes (Wang2019Histone). These interactions highlight KDM3A's involvement in multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression and cancer progression.
