# ZNF792

## Overview
ZNF792 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 792, a member of the KRAB-zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is characterized by its role in transcriptional regulation through DNA binding and interaction with other proteins. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) during germline development and the maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells (Otsuka2023KRABzincfinger; Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). ZNF792 has been implicated in several medical conditions, such as asthma and schizophrenia, through its influence on gene expression and potential mutations that may affect its function (Tang2017Wholegenome; Banerjee2021Network). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific molecular interactions and pathways involving ZNF792 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF792 has been implicated in several medical conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In asthma, ZNF792 is identified as a significant transcription factor with a regulatory impact on gene expression. The study by Banerjee et al. highlights its role in the rewiring of gene networks in asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells, suggesting that these changes may contribute to asthma exacerbations. The research indicates that ZNF792 may influence pathways such as TGF-β signaling and ferroptosis, which are over-represented in asthmatics (Banerjee2021Network).

In the context of schizophrenia, a study on monozygotic twins discordant for the condition identified a mutation in ZNF792 (p.N522S) that is predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2. Although the study does not specifically highlight ZNF792 in protein-protein interactions related to schizophrenia, it suggests a potential involvement of this gene in the disease (Tang2017Wholegenome).

In benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), ZNF792 was analyzed but found to have no expression in the brain, and in silico predictions suggested the variant is benign, indicating no direct association with the disease (Usluer2017Association).

## Interactions
ZNF792 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the KRAB-zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is known for its role in regulating gene expression through interactions with DNA and other proteins. While specific interactions involving ZNF792 are not detailed extensively, it is mentioned in the context of several studies.

In the context of schizophrenia research, ZNF792 has been identified with a nonsynonymous mutation (p.N522S) that could potentially alter its protein structure or function, suggesting a possible role in protein interactions relevant to the disorder (Tang2017Wholegenome). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving ZNF792 in this context are not detailed (Tang2017Wholegenome).

ZNF792 is also noted for its role in targeting endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in humans, particularly those specific to Eutheria, indicating its involvement in the regulation of these elements during germline development (Otsuka2023KRABzincfinger). This suggests that ZNF792 may interact with ERV sequences, although specific binding partners or complexes are not described.

In pluripotent stem cells, ZNF792 is upregulated, indicating a potential role in maintaining pluripotency, but again, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). Overall, while ZNF792 is implicated in several biological processes, detailed interaction partners remain to be elucidated.
