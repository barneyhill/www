# APCDD1L

## Overview
The APCDD1L gene encodes the protein APC down-regulated 1 like, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. APCDD1L is known to play a role in the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer. The protein's function and interactions suggest it may have potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of its involvement in signaling pathways that are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
