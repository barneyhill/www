# DHODH

## Overview
The DHODH gene encodes the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone), a mitochondrial enzyme integral to the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in catalyzing the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. This reaction is essential for the synthesis of uridine monophosphate (UMP), a precursor for RNA and DNA synthesis, thereby linking pyrimidine biosynthesis with cellular respiration and energy production (Boukalova2020Dihydroorotate; Löffler2020The). The activity of DHODH is crucial for cell proliferation, particularly in rapidly dividing cells, and its function is integrated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain through its interaction with ubiquinone (Boschi2019Dihydroorotate). Mutations in the DHODH gene are associated with Miller syndrome, and alterations in its expression have significant implications in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Li2019Identification; Balasubramaniam2014Inborn).

## Structure
The human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an integral protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and plays a crucial role in pyrimidine biosynthesis. The primary structure of DHODH includes a mitochondrial signal peptide and a transmembrane domain at the N-terminus, which are essential for its import and insertion into the IMM (Rodriguez2020Preparation). The secondary structure features N-terminal alpha helices that are important for interaction with the IMM and ubiquinone Q10 (Rodriguez2020Preparation).

The tertiary structure of DHODH is characterized by a TIM barrel fold, a common structural motif in enzymes, which facilitates its enzymatic function. This structure includes a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding domain, which is critical for its catalytic activity. DHODH functions as a monomer, indicating that it lacks a quaternary structure (Rodriguez2020Preparation).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The structural insights into DHODH, particularly the role of its transmembrane domain and N-terminal alpha helices, are significant for understanding its stable binding to the IMM and its interaction with substrates and inhibitors (Rodriguez2020Preparation).

## Function
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis in proliferating cells. Located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, DHODH catalyzes the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, a key step in the production of uridine monophosphate (UMP), a precursor for RNA and DNA synthesis (Boukalova2020Dihydroorotate; Löffler2020The). This enzyme is linked to the mitochondrial respiratory chain through its use of ubiquinone as an electron acceptor, integrating pyrimidine biosynthesis with cellular respiration and energy production (Boschi2019Dihydroorotate; Löffler2020The).

In healthy human cells, DHODH's activity is vital for cell proliferation and survival, as pyrimidines are necessary for DNA replication and repair (Löffler2020The). The enzyme's function is particularly important in rapidly dividing cells, where the demand for nucleic acid precursors is high (Boukalova2020Dihydroorotate). DHODH also plays a role in maintaining the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, especially under varying oxygen conditions, such as hypoxia (Löffler2020The). Its activity is essential for adapting cell proliferation to these conditions, linking respiration to tumorigenesis and other cellular processes (Löffler2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHODH gene are associated with Miller syndrome, also known as postaxial acrofacial dysostosis syndrome (POADS). This rare genetic disorder is characterized by severe craniofacial abnormalities, limb deformities, and other physical malformations. The condition was identified as a Mendelian disorder through whole exome sequencing, and the loss of DHODH activity is linked to these phenotypic characteristics (Balasubramaniam2014Inborn).

Alterations in DHODH expression levels have significant implications in various cancers. In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), DHODH is overexpressed, and its inhibition can suppress tumor growth and enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy (Li2019Identification). Similarly, in neuroblastoma, high DHODH expression is an unfavorable prognostic marker, particularly in MYCN amplified tumors, and its inhibition can suppress tumor growth (Olsen2021DHODH). In endometrial cancer, DHODH overexpression is linked to increased genomic instability and high-grade tumors, suggesting that targeting DHODH could be a therapeutic strategy (Zhao2023Inhibition).

DHODH inhibitors are also explored for their potential in treating autoimmune diseases and viral infections due to their immunosuppressive effects (Zhou2021DHODH).

## Interactions
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. It is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and interacts with ubiquinone to facilitate electron transfer. DHODH physically interacts with mitochondrial respiratory complexes, specifically complexes II and III, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. These interactions are essential for the enzyme's function in electron production by converting dihydroorotate to orotate. Inhibition of DHODH can impair the function of these complexes, affecting oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis, particularly under hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions (Zhou2021DHODH).

DHODH is also a target for various inhibitors, such as PTC299 and brequinar, which bind to the same site on the enzyme. These inhibitors primarily interact with DHODH through hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for their binding affinity. The binding of these inhibitors can affect the enzyme's activity, with PTC299 showing species selectivity by not binding to rat DHODH (Cao2019Targeting). The enzyme's interaction with inhibitors and its role in mitochondrial function highlight its importance in cellular metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target.
