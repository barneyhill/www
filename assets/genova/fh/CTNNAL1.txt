# CTNNAL1

## Overview
CTNNAL1 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin alpha-like 1, also known as α-catulin, which is a member of the alpha-catenin family. This protein plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signal transduction, particularly within epithelial tissues. Structurally, α-catulin shares similarities with vinculin and alpha-catenin, and it functions as a cytoskeletal linker protein, interacting with various components such as β-catenin, talin, and the actin cytoskeleton. It is involved in the Rho signaling pathway, acting as a scaffold protein for Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which are essential for actin cytoskeleton organization and focal adhesion formation. The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with notable expression in the adrenal gland, and is implicated in maintaining epithelial integrity and polarity. Additionally, α-catulin has been associated with various cellular processes, including wound repair and tumorigenesis, through its interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Xiang2012Identification; Kahm2023Regulation; Janssens1999Human).

## Structure
The CTNNAL1 gene encodes a protein known as K-catulin, which is involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of the CTNNAL1 protein consists of 734 amino acids (Xiang2012Identification). The protein shares sequence similarity with human vinculin and alpha-catenin, particularly in the N-terminal region, which contains binding sites for beta-catenin, talin, and alpha-actinin (Xiang2012Identification). The C-terminal region of CTNNAL1 contains amphipathic helices that have potential binding sites for the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting its role as a cytoskeletal linker protein (Xiang2012Identification).

CTNNAL1 is part of the Rho signaling pathway, acting as a scaffold protein for Lbc, a member of the dbl family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (Xiang2012Identification). The protein is expressed ubiquitously, with the highest expression in the adrenal gland and low levels in neural tissues (Janssens1999Human). Alternative splicing of the last exon in CTNNAL1 generates a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein with a new carboxy-terminus (Janssens1999Human). This alternative splicing suggests the existence of splice variant isoforms, which may lead to different functional versions of the protein.

## Function
The CTNNAL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the alpha-catenin family, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. It is structurally similar to alpha-catenin and is a key component of adherens junctions, which mediate cell-to-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues (Kahm2023Regulation). CTNNAL1 interacts with cadherins, transmembrane proteins that facilitate intercellular adhesion, by binding to their cytoplasmic tails and linking them to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and dynamic adhesion during processes such as wound repair (Xiang2007Wound).

In healthy human cells, CTNNAL1 is involved in preserving epithelial polarity and intercellular contacts, which are vital for the structural integrity of epithelial tissues. The protein's N-terminal region can bind β-catenin, talin, and α-actin, while its C-terminal region contains potential binding sites for the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton (Tan2018CTNNAL1). CTNNAL1 is also implicated in the Rho signaling pathway, serving as a scaffold protein for Lbc, a member of the dbl family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which are crucial for organizing the actin cytoskeleton and forming focal adhesions (Xiang2012Identification).

## Interactions
CTNNAL1, encoding the protein α-catulin, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. α-catulin interacts with the Lbc Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), acting as a scaffold protein to facilitate RhoA signaling, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton regulation (Gielata2022Emerging). It also binds to the dystrophin complex through dystrobrevin, a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which is significant in the context of muscular dystrophies (Gielata2022Emerging). 

α-catulin interacts with β-catenin, although this interaction is less robust compared to α-catenin's association with β-catenin, suggesting α-catulin may bind a different fraction of β-catenin (Gielata2022Emerging). It also modulates the NF-κB pathway by binding to IKK-β, potentially linking NF-κB and RhoA signaling pathways, both implicated in tumorigenesis (Gielata2022Emerging). 

In cancer, α-catulin interacts with KLF5, a transcription factor, protecting it from WWP1-mediated degradation, thereby enhancing KLF5's stability and promoting cancer stemness in lung cancer (Tung2022αCatulin). This interaction is crucial for maintaining cancer stem cell-like properties by preventing KLF5 degradation (Tung2022αCatulin).
