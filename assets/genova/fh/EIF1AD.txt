# EIF1AD

## Overview
The EIF1AD gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A domain containing protein, which is structurally similar to the well-characterized eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (eIF1A). While EIF1AD shares significant structural features with eIF1A, including a conserved oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold and helical subdomains, its precise biological functions in humans remain largely undefined. Unlike eIF1A, which is a key player in translation initiation, EIF1AD is localized to the nucleus, suggesting it may have distinct roles, potentially in ribosome biogenesis or translation regulation (Yu2018Comparative). The protein is involved in various protein-protein interactions, including with STAT1 and GAPDH, and is essential in certain species like C. elegans but not in others such as S. pombe, indicating species-specific functional roles (Yu2018Comparative). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular activities and cellular roles of EIF1AD in human biology.

## Structure
The EIF1AD protein, encoded by the human gene EIF1AD, shares significant structural similarities with its paralog eIF1A. The structure of EIF1AD includes a folded domain composed of an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold and helical subdomains, flanked by intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal tails (Yu2018Comparative). The folded domain is highly conserved and features a hydrophobic surface that likely serves as a site for protein-protein interactions, similar to the ribosome-binding surface in eIF1A (Yu2018Comparative).

The N-terminal tail of EIF1AD is positively charged but not well conserved, while the C-terminal tail contains conserved sequence motifs such as 'NTNR' and 'LPPS', which are potential protein-protein interaction sites (Yu2018Comparative). The most conserved residue in EIF1AD, W62, corresponds to W69 in eIF1A, suggesting a similar role in promoting conformational changes necessary for ribosome interactions (Yu2018Comparative).

While EIF1AD is typically annotated as an RNA-binding protein and a translation initiation factor, there is limited experimental evidence supporting these functions. The protein is essential in C. elegans but not in S. pombe, indicating species-specific roles (Yu2018Comparative). Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of EIF1AD is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The EIF1AD gene encodes a protein that is structurally similar to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (eIF1A), which is involved in translation initiation. Despite its homology to eIF1A, the specific biological functions of eIF1AD in human cells remain unclear. The protein is localized to the nucleus in humans, suggesting it may not participate in canonical translation initiation, which typically occurs in the cytoplasm (Yu2018Comparative). 

eIF1AD shares significant structural conservation with eIF1A, particularly in the ribosome-binding surfaces, indicating that it may bind to the ribosome and potentially play roles in ribosome biogenesis or translation regulation (Yu2018Comparative). The protein is involved in protein-protein interactions, as evidenced by its interaction with STAT1 and GAPDH in humans (Yu2018Comparative). 

The NMR solution structure of human eIF1AD reveals similarity to eIF1A, suggesting conservation of interaction surfaces that may be functionally important (Yu2018Comparative). Despite these insights, the precise molecular activities and cellular roles of eIF1AD in healthy human cells are not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its functions.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
EIF1AD, a homolog of eIF1A, is involved in various protein interactions, although its specific roles remain largely unexplored. In humans, EIF1AD interacts with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Yu2018Comparative). In C. elegans, it interacts with ferritin heavy chains 1 and 2, and in Drosophila melanogaster, it binds to the transcription factor Extradenticle (Exd) (Yu2018Comparative). EIF1AD is also noted for its potential involvement in ribosome biogenesis or translation regulation due to its structural similarity to eIF1A, which is known for its role in translation initiation (Yu2018Comparative).

The protein is present in late pre-40S ribosomal particles and is in direct contact with RIO1, a ribosome biogenesis factor. Depletion of RPS26, a ribosomal protein, results in a significant decrease in EIF1AD's association with RIO1, suggesting that RPS26 may influence EIF1AD's interactions (Plassart2020The). Despite these findings, the exact nature of EIF1AD's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids requires further investigation to fully elucidate its functional roles.
