# CLHC1

## Overview
The CLHC1 gene encodes the protein clathrin heavy chain linker domain containing 1, which is involved in cellular processes related to vesicular trafficking and membrane dynamics. This protein is categorized as a cytosolic protein that plays a role in the assembly and function of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for the transport of molecules within cells. The clathrin heavy chain linker domain containing 1 protein is implicated in the regulation of endocytosis and intracellular signaling pathways, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Its function is critical for various physiological processes, and alterations in its expression or function may have implications for human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
