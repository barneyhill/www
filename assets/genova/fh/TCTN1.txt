# TCTN1

## Overview
TCTN1 is a gene that encodes the protein tectonic family member 1, which is a crucial component of the ciliary membrane involved in cellular signaling and development. This protein is integral to the formation and function of primary cilia, acting as a key player in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for embryonic development and cellular communication. Tectonic family member 1 is part of a larger protein complex that maintains the integrity of the ciliary transition zone, interacting with various other proteins to regulate ciliary assembly and trafficking. Mutations in TCTN1 are linked to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and its expression levels have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including glioblastoma and thyroid cancer (Alazami2012Molecular; Xu2017Silencing; Meng2014Expression).

## Function
The TCTN1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the formation and function of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling pathways. TCTN1 is involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a critical pathway for transmitting information to embryonic cells necessary for proper development. It functions as both an activator and inhibitor of the Hh pathway, playing a role in the patterning of the neural tube. TCTN1 helps fully activate the Hh pathway in the presence of high Hh levels, which is necessary for forming the most ventral cell types, and represses the pathway by modulating Hh signal transduction downstream of Smoothened (Smo) and Rab23 in the absence of Hh signals (Li2015LentivirusMediated).

TCTN1 is also part of a ciliopathy-associated protein complex that modulates ciliary assembly and trafficking. The primary cilium, where TCTN1 is active, plays a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication by sensing Hedgehog and Wingless signaling pathways (Chai2019MiR216a5p). This protein is primarily localized in the ciliary membrane, contributing to the maintenance of ciliary structure and function, which is crucial for normal development and cellular communication (Meng2014Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TCTN1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. TCTN1 has been identified as a disease gene for Joubert syndrome, specifically linked to the subtype JBTS13. Mutations in TCTN1, such as a splice variant detected in certain families, lead to protein truncation due to missplicing, contributing to the clinical manifestations of Joubert syndrome (Alazami2012Molecular). Additionally, TCTN1 mutations are implicated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome, highlighting a theme in ciliopathies where related genes are linked to disorders with overlapping features (Alazami2012Molecular).

In cancer, TCTN1 expression is significantly elevated in glioblastoma (GBM) tissues compared to normal brain tissues. High TCTN1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and progression-free survival in GBM patients, making it an independent prognostic factor (Meng2014Expression). TCTN1 is also overexpressed in thyroid cancer, where its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, suggesting its role as a proto-oncogene (Xu2017Silencing). In prostate cancer, TCTN1 contributes to cell viability and migration, with its silencing resulting in suppressed cell growth and migration (WANG2015Tectonic1). These findings indicate that TCTN1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of various cancers.

## Interactions
TCTN1 is a component of the tectonic complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the ciliary transition zone. This complex includes other proteins such as TCTN2, TCTN3, and interacts with members of the MKS module, including MKS1, TMEM216, TMEM67, B9D1, and CC2D2A, as well as CEP290 from the NPHP module. These interactions are essential for the proper sorting and enrichment of ciliary membrane proteins, acting as a diffusional barrier at the transition zone (Truong2023Tectonic).

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), TCTN1 is targeted by miR-216a-5p, which suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis by directly interacting with the 3′-UTR of TCTN1. This interaction results in decreased TCTN1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, highlighting a regulatory relationship between miR-216a-5p and TCTN1 (Chai2019MiR216a5p).

TCTN1 also interacts with proteins involved in ciliary assembly and trafficking, which are important for signaling pathways such as Hedgehog and Wingless. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the proper function and structure of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular communication and signaling (Chai2019MiR216a5p).
