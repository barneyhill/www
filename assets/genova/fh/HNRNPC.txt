# HNRNPC

## Overview
The HNRNPC gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C), a pivotal RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation regulation. As a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, hnRNP C is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and its ability to form tetramers, which are essential for its function in RNA processing (Geuens2016The; Wippel2021Deciphering). The protein plays a critical role in maintaining transcriptome integrity by preventing the exonization of Alu elements and enhancing mRNA translation through interactions with internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) (Zarnack2013Direct; Han2010Functional). Clinically, aberrant expression of HNRNPC has been linked to various cancers, where it acts as an oncogene, influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis (Guo2021Elevated; Wu2018Function).

## Structure
The HNRNPC gene encodes the hnRNP C protein, which is a key component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins involved in mRNA processing. The protein exists as a stable tetramer in solution, organized in a (C1)3C2 configuration, where C2 is the canonical form and C1 is an alternatively spliced variant differing by 13 amino acids (Geuens2016The; Wippel2021Deciphering). The hnRNP C protein contains a single RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is crucial for its RNA-binding specificity. This RRM includes conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs, essential for binding to RNA (Geuens2016The; Wippel2021Deciphering).

The protein also features an acid-rich auxiliary domain and a leucine zipper motif, which facilitates oligomerization into tetramers necessary for its function in RNA interaction (Geuens2016The). The hnRNP C protein is involved in sorting transcripts based on size by binding to unstructured RNA stretches longer than 200-300 nucleotides (Geuens2016The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, affecting its function and localization (Geuens2016The). The protein's structure has been modeled using Phyre2, aligning with the crystal structure of the splicing factor SFPQ, suggesting an antiparallel dimer organization (Wippel2021Deciphering).

## Function
The HNRNPC gene encodes the hnRNP C protein, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing and regulation in healthy human cells. hnRNP C is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, where it is essential for the formation and function of the 60S splicing complex, facilitating both the first and second endonucleolytic cleavage reactions during splicing (Choi1986Heterogeneous). It acts as a splicing enhancer, promoting exon inclusion and influencing splice site selection (Venables2008Multiple).

In addition to its role in splicing, hnRNP C is critical in maintaining transcriptome integrity by preventing the exonization of Alu elements. It binds to U-tracts within Alu elements, competing with the splicing factor U2AF65, thereby repressing their inclusion as exons in mRNA transcripts (Zarnack2013Direct). This function is vital for preventing frameshifts or stop codons that could impair protein function (Zarnack2013Direct).

hnRNP C also enhances mRNA translation by binding to internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) of specific mRNAs in the cytoplasm, a process often triggered during mitosis (Han2010Functional). This highlights its involvement in both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, particularly in mRNA packaging and translation regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HNRNPC gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, elevated HNRNPC expression is essential for tumor growth and proliferation. Repression of HNRNPC in breast cancer cell lines such as MCF7 and T47D inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth by activating the interferon response through the accumulation of endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Wu2018Function). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a genetic variant in the 3'UTR region of HNRNPC, rs7495, disrupts a binding site for has-miR-183-3p, leading to increased HNRNPC mRNA expression and associated PDAC risk (Ying2021Identification).

HNRNPC is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with factors such as age, sex, smoking history, and TNM staging (Guo2021Elevated). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), HNRNPC is part of the CYTOR-HNRNPC-ZEB1 axis, which is involved in mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis regulation, with elevated levels linked to poor survival rates (Zhu2022lncRNA). These findings suggest that HNRNPC acts as an oncogene in several cancers, influencing tumor progression through its role in RNA metabolism processes.

## Interactions
HNRNPC, a component of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA processing. It competes with the splicing factor U2AF65 for binding to uridine-rich sequences on RNA, particularly at long U-tracts. This competition is significant in regulating splicing patterns and preventing the exonization of Alu elements by blocking U2AF65 from accessing cryptic splicing signals (Zarnack2013Direct).

HNRNPC also interacts with other RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2/B1, and RALY. These interactions involve specific lysine residues, suggesting a coordinated role in mRNA processing and export (Wippel2021Deciphering). In the context of heart failure, HNRNPC interacts with components of the spliceosome complex and proteins related to cardiac muscle contraction, indicating its involvement in the structural and functional dynamics of the heart's contractile machinery (Martino2022The).

The protein's RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains contribute to its sequence-specific binding to uridine tracts, while its basic leucine zipper-like RNA-binding motif (bZLM) domains may facilitate sequence-independent interactions, organizing long pre-mRNAs for efficient splicing (König2010iCLIP).
