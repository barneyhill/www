# SGMS2

## Overview
The SGMS2 gene encodes the enzyme sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the synthesis of sphingomyelin from ceramide and phosphatidylcholine. This enzyme is primarily localized in the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane, where it contributes to the maintenance of membrane integrity and lipid homeostasis (Kim2023Lipid; Sokoya2022Pathogenic). SMS2 is integral to cellular processes such as cholesterol distribution and organelle repair, and it is particularly important in bone tissue for normal bone formation and mineralization (Sokoya2022Pathogenic; Pihlström2023SGMS2). Mutations in SGMS2 are associated with calvarial doughnut lesions with bone fragility, highlighting its clinical significance in bone health (Merkuryeva2023Clinical; Pihlström2023SGMS2).

## Structure
The SGMS2 gene encodes the sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) protein, which is a multi-membrane spanning protein involved in sphingomyelin synthesis and homeostasis at the plasma membrane (Pihlström2023SGMS2). The SMS2 protein consists of 365 amino acids and includes several transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its localization and function within cellular membranes (Pihlström2023SGMS2). 

Pathogenic variants of SMS2, such as p.Arg50*, p.Ile62Ser, and p.Met64Arg, are located in the N-terminal part of the protein, upstream of the first transmembrane domain. These variants affect the protein's ability to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and reach the plasma membrane, leading to mislocalization and disrupted sphingomyelin synthesis (Pihlström2023SGMS2). The p.Arg50* variant results in a truncated enzyme, while the p.Ile62Ser and p.Met64Arg variants are associated with a lack of a functional ER export signal (Sokoya2022Pathogenic; Pihlström2023SGMS2).

The SMS2 protein's role in bone mineralization involves the breakdown of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphocholine, which are crucial for the mineralization process (Pihlström2023SGMS2). The structure and function of SMS2 are integral to its role in maintaining lipid distribution and cellular membrane integrity.

## Function
Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM), a major sphingolipid in mammalian cells. SGMS2 is primarily active in the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, where it catalyzes the transfer of the phosphorylcholine head group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) onto ceramide, producing SM and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Kim2023Lipid; Sokoya2022Pathogenic). This process is essential for maintaining the sphingomyelin/sterol gradient along the secretory pathway, which influences membrane properties such as bilayer thickness, lipid packing density, and surface charge, thereby affecting organelle identity and function (Sokoya2022Pathogenic).

In healthy cells, SGMS2 contributes to the asymmetric distribution of SM across late secretory and endolysosomal bilayers, which is important for the repair of damaged organelles and cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Sokoya2022Pathogenic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the lipid order and cholesterol distribution in cellular membranes, particularly in the plasma membrane, where SM is a preferred binding partner of cholesterol (Sokoya2022Pathogenic). SGMS2 is also highly expressed in bone tissue, where its proper function is necessary for normal bone formation and maintenance (Sokoya2022Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SGMS2 gene, which encodes sphingomyelin synthase 2, are linked to a rare autosomal dominant bone disorder known as calvarial doughnut lesions with bone fragility (CDL). This condition is characterized by low bone mineral density, sclerotic doughnut-shaped lesions in the skull, neonatal fractures, long-bone deformities, and short stature. Some patients also experience neurological symptoms, such as transient cranial nerve palsies (Merkuryeva2023Clinical; Pihlström2023SGMS2). 

Three specific heterozygous variants of SGMS2 have been identified: a nonsense variant c.148C>T (p.Arg50*), and two missense variants, c.185T>G (p.Ile62Ser) and c.191T>G (p.Met64Arg). The p.Arg50* variant is associated with a milder phenotype, while the missense variants are linked to more severe clinical manifestations, including neonatal fractures and disproportionate dwarfism (Merkuryeva2023Clinical; Pihlström2023SGMS2). 

These mutations disrupt sphingomyelin metabolism, affecting lipid distribution and bone mineralization processes. The p.Arg50* variant leads to defective bone mineralization due to decreased enzyme activity, while the missense variants cause significant disruptions in lipid composition within the secretory pathway, impacting bone formation (Sokoya2022Pathogenic).

## Interactions
SGMS2, or sphingomyelin synthase 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of B cell tolerance, SGMS2 interacts with Protein Kinase C delta (PKCd) to facilitate its nuclear translocation, which is crucial for maintaining B cell tolerance in the germinal center. This interaction is significant in the regulation of autoimmune conditions such as lupus, where SGMS2 deficiency leads to impaired PKCd-regulated B cell tolerance (Ou2021SMS2).

In breast cancer, SGMS2 is implicated in promoting an aggressive cancer phenotype by interacting with the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. SGMS2 enhances the secretion of TGF-β1 and activates this pathway, which is crucial for the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. This interaction involves the promotion of Smad2 phosphorylation and increased expression of Snail, a key trigger of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Zheng2019Sphingomyelin).

In colorectal cancer, SGMS2 is part of the LARP6/ZNF267/SGMS2 axis, where it is negatively regulated by LARP6 through ZNF267. This interaction affects sphingomyelin synthesis and is linked to the suppression of cancer metastasis and the regulation of autophagy (Long2023LARP6).
