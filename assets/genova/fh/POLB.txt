# POLB

## Overview
The POLB gene encodes DNA polymerase beta, a critical enzyme involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic integrity by repairing small base lesions and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA. DNA polymerase beta is a monomeric enzyme characterized by its bifunctional structure, comprising an N-terminal lyase domain and a C-terminal polymerase domain, which together facilitate the excision of damaged bases and the subsequent filling of single-nucleotide gaps (Prasad1998Human; Beard2019DNA). This enzyme is categorized as a DNA polymerase and plays a pivotal role in cellular responses to DNA damage, interacting with various proteins to enhance its repair functions and stability (Fang2019Stability). Mutations in the POLB gene can lead to genomic instability and are associated with an increased risk of cancer, highlighting the enzyme's significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing carcinogenesis (Yamtich2012A; Zhao2019Mutation).

## Structure
DNA polymerase beta (POLB) is a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of POLB consists of a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its functional conformation (Beard2019DNA).

The tertiary structure of POLB features two main domains: an 8-kDa amino-terminal lyase domain and a 31-kDa carboxyl-terminal polymerase domain. These domains are essential for processing single-nucleotide gaps in DNA. The polymerase domain is further divided into three subdomains: the C-(Catalytic), D-(Duplex DNA binding), and N-subdomains (Nascent base pair binding), which correspond to the palm, thumb, and fingers subdomains in other DNA polymerases. This structure allows POLB to interact specifically with the DNA backbone and the nascent base pair (Beard2019DNA).

POLB lacks a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. Common post-translational modifications of POLB include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity and stability. The enzyme's structure is adapted to facilitate its role in DNA repair, with specific motifs and residues critical for its catalytic function (Beard2019DNA).

## Function
DNA polymerase beta (POLB) is a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing small base lesions and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA. POLB is composed of two main domains: an N-terminal lyase domain and a C-terminal polymerase domain. The lyase domain excises the 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) group, creating a one-nucleotide gap, which the polymerase domain subsequently fills (Prasad1998Human; Beard2014Structure). This process is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer (Fang2019Stability).

POLB operates in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins such as XRCC1, FEN1, APE1, PCNA, and p53 to enhance its repair functions (Fang2019Stability). These interactions are vital for its stability and function, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (Fang2019Stability). The enzyme's activity is indispensable for both single-nucleotide and long-patch BER, as demonstrated by significant repair defects in cells lacking POLB (Thapar2019Deployment). The absence of POLB results in embryonic lethality in mouse models, underscoring its critical role in cellular viability (Beard2014Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLB gene, which encodes DNA polymerase beta, are associated with genomic instability and increased cancer risk. The L22P mutation in POLB, found in gastric cancer, leads to chromosomal instability and inflammation-associated carcinogenesis in mice. This mutation results in the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and chromosomal segregation defects, contributing to tumorigenesis (Zhao2019Mutation). The L22P variant compromises the catalytic efficiency of Pol β, affecting nucleotide insertion and binding, and results in insufficient dRP lyase and low polymerase activity, which may provoke an alternative long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) pathway (Zhao2019Mutation).

Another variant, the P242R polymorphism, is linked to genomic instability and cellular transformation. This variant, resulting from the rs3136797 SNP, is associated with a slower catalytic rate, leading to increased chromosomal aberrations and cancer predisposition (Yamtich2012A). The P242R variant is characterized by a slower rate of single nucleotide gap filling, leading to the accumulation of single-strand breaks (SSBs) and DSBs, particularly under conditions of DNA damage (Yamtich2012A). This variant is also linked to poor prognosis in lung cancer and lymphoma patients (Yamtich2012A).

## Interactions
DNA polymerase beta (POLB) is a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, interacting with several proteins to maintain genomic stability. POLB forms a critical heterodimer with XRCC1, which is essential for DNA repair processes. This interaction regulates the ubiquitylation and degradation of POLB, with mutations such as T304I significantly impacting its binding affinity and stability (Fang2019Stability). POLB also interacts with NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), which stabilizes POLB by preventing its degradation through a ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. This interaction is NADH-dependent and is crucial for regulating POLB stability in the cytosol (Fang2019Stability).

Under oxidative stress, the interaction between POLB and NQO1 is disrupted, leading to a decrease in POLB bound to NQO1 and an enhanced association with XRCC1. This shift suggests a dynamic regulation of POLB interactions in response to cellular redox states (Fang2019Stability). POLB's interactions with these proteins are vital for its sub-cellular localization and stability, influencing its role in DNA repair and cellular response to oxidative stress (Fang2019Stability).
