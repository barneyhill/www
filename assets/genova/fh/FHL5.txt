# FHL5

## Overview
FHL5 is a gene that encodes the protein four and a half LIM domains 5, which is a member of the LIM domain protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural composition, including one half LIM domain and four complete LIM domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. FHL5 is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as a coactivator for the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein (CREB), thereby influencing gene expression related to cell proliferation and survival. The protein's interactions with actin filaments and its role in cytoskeletal organization further underscore its functional versatility. FHL5 is implicated in various physiological processes, including vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and spermiogenesis, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as vein graft intimal hyperplasia and migraine susceptibility (Nakanishi2013Cyclic; Jiang2021Common; Mistry2004FHL5).

## Structure
The FHL5 protein, encoded by the FHL5 gene, is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes a sequence of 1698 nucleotides and an open reading frame encoding a protein of 280 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 32 kDa (Mistry2004FHL5). The primary structure of FHL5 features a single NH2-terminal zinc finger, representing a half LIM domain, followed by four complete LIM domains. These LIM domains are defined by conserved spacing patterns between zinc-coordinating cysteine and histidine residues, forming zinc-binding pockets that stabilize the protein's tertiary structure (Mistry2004FHL5). 

The protein is involved in protein-protein interactions, as LIM domains are known for their role in such interactions. FHL5 also contains two potential cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, suggesting possible post-translational modifications that could influence its function (Mistry2004FHL5). 

FHL5 is expressed in both the cytosol and nucleus of cells, and it colocalizes with actin fibers, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal organization (Mistry2004FHL5). The protein's expression is sensitive to environmental and physiological changes, which may affect its structural dynamics and functional roles (Mistry2004FHL5).

## Function
The FHL5 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with various transcription factors. In healthy human cells, FHL5 is involved in the activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. FHL5 facilitates CREB activation by increasing its phosphorylation at serine 133, which is crucial for its transcriptional activity (Nakanishi2013Cyclic). This activation process is independent of the classical requirement for CREB-binding protein, highlighting FHL5's unique role as a coactivator (Nakanishi2013Cyclic).

FHL5 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with CREB, enhancing its ability to bind to the CRE DNA sequence and regulate gene expression (Nakanishi2013Cyclic). This nuclear activity is essential for processes such as vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, contributing to vascular remodeling and repair (Nakanishi2013Cyclic). The protein's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and response to physiological stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the FHL5 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of vascular diseases, FHL5 plays a significant role in vein graft intimal hyperplasia (IH), a major cause of vein graft failure after bypass surgery. The gene is involved in the activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein (CREB), which is crucial for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Overexpression of FHL5, along with MAPKAPK3, leads to increased CREB activity, contributing to IH. Targeting CREB activation through FHL5 interactions has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for IH (Nakanishi2013Cyclic).

FHL5 is also associated with migraine susceptibility. A study in a Han Chinese population identified a significant association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7775721 in the FHL5 gene and an increased risk of migraine without aura. The T allele of this SNP was linked to decreased expression and alternative splicing of FHL5, suggesting a role in migraine pathogenesis (Jiang2021Common). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FHL5 in both vascular and neurological conditions, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FHL5, a member of the four-and-a-half LIM domain protein family, is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. FHL5 interacts with actin filaments in the cytosol of eel gill pillar cells, suggesting a role in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics (Mistry2004FHL5). In vascular smooth muscle cells, FHL5 binds to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein (CREB), facilitating its activation and enhancing CREB-DNA binding activity. This interaction is crucial for the proliferation of these cells, as FHL5 acts as a coactivator of the CREB family, independent of the CREB-binding protein (Nakanishi2013Cyclic).

FHL5 also interacts with the transcriptional regulator CREM, which is essential for spermiogenesis in mammals. This interaction is mediated through FHL5's LIM domains, which are protein-protein interaction motifs. FHL5's dynamic localization between the nucleus and cytoplasm during spermiogenesis is facilitated by its interaction with the Kif17b kinesin motor protein (Lardenois2009Fhl5Act). These interactions highlight FHL5's role in forming multiprotein complexes and modulating cellular processes through its binding capabilities.
