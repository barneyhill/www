# PIGT

## Overview
The PIGT gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is responsible for the post-translational modification of proteins through the attachment of GPI anchors. This process is essential for the proper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell membrane, impacting various cellular activities such as signal transduction and immune response (Lam2015Expanding; Nakashima2014Novel). The PIGT protein is categorized as a type-I transmembrane protein, characterized by a large luminal domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, and plays a crucial role in stabilizing the GPI transamidase complex (Ohishi2001PIGS). Mutations in the PIGT gene are linked to multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 3 (MCAHS3), a disorder marked by severe neurological impairments and developmental delays (Nakashima2014Novel; Bayat2019PIGTCDG).

## Structure
The PIGT gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is crucial for attaching GPI anchors to proteins. The PIGT protein is a type-I transmembrane protein with a large luminal domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. It contains a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a transmembrane domain near the C-terminus (Ohishi2001PIGS). The human PIGT protein consists of 578 amino acids (Kvarnung2013A).

PIGT is central to the GPI transamidase complex, interacting with other components such as GAA1, GPI8, and PIG-S. The stability of GPI8 and GAA1 is dependent on their association with PIGT, while PIG-S can be stable on its own but also associates with PIGT (Ohishi2001PIGS). The protein's structure suggests it is involved in the transfer of GPI to proteins on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (Ohishi2001PIGS).

PIGT homologues in yeast, such as S. cerevisiae, have di-lysine ER retention signals at the C-terminus, although this feature is not explicitly mentioned for the human protein (Ohishi2001PIGS). The PIGT gene has multiple predicted mRNA splice variants, with some encoding proteins of unknown functions (Lam2015Expanding).

## Function
The PIGT gene encodes a subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is essential for the post-translational attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is crucial for the proper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell membrane (Lam2015Expanding; Nakashima2014Novel). PIGT plays a critical role in stabilizing the GPI transamidase complex, ensuring the correct surface expression of GPI-APs, which include proteins such as CD16, CD24, and alkaline phosphatase (Nakashima2014Novel; Yang2018Homozygous).

The GPI transamidase complex, of which PIGT is a part, facilitates the cleavage of the GPI attachment signal peptide at the C-terminal of precursor proteins and the subsequent transfer of GPI anchors to these proteins (Nakashima2014Novel). This attachment is vital for the proteins to be positioned on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, where they participate in processes such as signal transduction and immune response (Lam2015Expanding). The highest expression of PIGT is found in the central nervous system, which may explain the severe neurological symptoms observed in PIGT mutations (Yang2018Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGT gene are associated with multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 3 (MCAHS3), a disorder characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, epilepsy, and other neurological impairments (Nakashima2014Novel; Bayat2019PIGTCDG). The PIGT gene encodes a subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is crucial for attaching GPI anchors to proteins. Mutations in PIGT lead to a deficiency in GPI-anchored proteins, impacting various cellular functions (Nakashima2014Novel; Kvarnung2013A).

Clinical manifestations of PIGT mutations include distinct facial features, seizures, and abnormal skeletal, endocrine, and ophthalmologic findings (Kvarnung2013A). The onset of epilepsy in affected individuals can range from birth to two years, with varying severity (Bayat2019PIGTCDG). Some patients exhibit skeletal hypomineralization, premature tooth loss, and nephrocalcinosis, which are not commonly documented in other GPI synthesis deficiencies (Kvarnung2013A).

Studies have identified both homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in PIGT, such as c.547A>C, c.250G>T, and c.1342C>T, which impair the function of the GPI transamidase complex, leading to reduced expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface (Nakashima2014Novel; Kvarnung2013A). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of PIGT in maintaining normal cellular processes and its impact on human health when mutated.

## Interactions
PIGT is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is essential for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. It interacts with several other proteins within this complex, including GPI8, GAA1, PIG-S, and PIG-U. PIGT forms a stable complex with GPI8 through an intermolecular disulfide bond, specifically between Cys 92 of GPI8 and Cys 182 of PIGT. This bond is vital for the full activity of the GPI transamidase complex, although not necessary for its basic formation (Ohishi2003Two).

PIGT also plays a role in stabilizing the expression of GAA1 and GPI8 by binding to them, forming a complex with PIG-S. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of the GPI transamidase complex (Ohishi2001PIGS). The complex is stable in 1% NP-40, indicating that PIGT is a central component of the enzyme's core (Ohishi2001PIGS).

In bladder cancer, PIGT is regulated by m6A modification, which is mediated by WTAP and the m6A reader IGF2BP2. This modification stabilizes PIGT mRNA, enhancing its expression and promoting interactions that lead to increased cell proliferation and glycolysis (Tan2024PIGT).
