# ZNF717

## Overview
ZNF717 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 717, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. ZNF717, in particular, has been implicated in various biological functions and pathological conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests its potential role in modulating gene expression patterns that are critical for normal cellular function and development (Burns2016Colorectal; Drozd2021A).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF717 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), de novo changes in ZNF717 have been identified, with the gene located within the copy number variation (CNV) region in several patients suffering from these neurodevelopmental disorders (Drozd2021A). The gene has also been associated with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), where it is suggested to play a role due to its involvement in osteogenic differentiation and its link to ASD, which shares clinical features with HSD (AlanisFunes2022Genomic).

In cancer research, ZNF717 has been identified as having loss-of-function mutations associated with colorectal cancer, where these mutations correlate with specific microbial communities in the tumor microenvironment (Burns2016Colorectal). Additionally, ZNF717 mutations have been found in calcifying fibrous tumors of the pleura, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Mehrad2018Wholeexome). The gene has also been implicated in uterine leiomyosarcoma, with deleterious mutations identified in several cancer types, indicating a possible role in carcinogenesis (Chen2021Identification). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of ZNF717 mutations across different conditions.
