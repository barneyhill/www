# BRAP

## Overview
BRAP, or BRCA1 associated protein, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The BRAP protein, also known as RNF52, is characterized by its central catalytic domain, which includes a RING domain crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition in neural progenitor cells by modulating the degradation of Skp2, a key component of the SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Additionally, BRAP is involved in the negative regulation of nuclear import, interacting with several proteins to influence cell proliferation and apoptosis. Clinically, mutations and altered expression of the BRAP gene have been linked to cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, and various cancers, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Fatima2015Interactome; Liao2011BRAP; Ju2020BRCA1Associated; Lanctot2017Loss).

## Structure
The BRAP protein, also known as RNF52, is characterized by a central catalytic domain composed of four subdomains: the nucleotide-binding α/β plait (NBP), the really interesting new gene zinc finger (RING), the deubiquitinase-like zinc finger (ZfUBP), and the coiled-coil (CC) motif (Shoji2017Central). This domain architecture is conserved across RNF52 orthologs and is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The RING domain is particularly important for protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin ligase activity (Shoji2017Central).

BRAP's RNF52-domain binds to ubiquitin chains, showing a preference for M1- and K63-linked di-ubiquitin chains, while it does not bind to ubiquitin monomers or K6-, K11-, and K48-linked chains (Shoji2017Central). The protein's ability to recognize and utilize various ubiquitin chains is essential for its role in ubiquitylation (Shoji2017Central).

The tertiary structure of BRAP involves the overall 3D conformation of these domains, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate BRAP's activity, but specific modifications are not detailed in the context. There is no information on splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The BRAP gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly the G1/S phase transition in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). BRAP functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Skp2, a component of the SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Skp2 is responsible for recruiting p27 Kip1 for degradation, a process essential for cell cycle progression. By regulating Skp2 levels and activity, BRAP indirectly controls the levels of p27 Kip1, ensuring proper cell cycle progression by maintaining low levels of Skp2 before S phase entry (Lanctot2017Loss).

BRAP also influences the subcellular localization of Skp2, retaining and degrading it in the cytoplasm to prevent its nuclear activity. The loss of BRAP results in increased Skp2 levels, leading to premature G1/S phase transition and impaired differentiation of NPCs. Inhibiting Skp2 activity in BRAP knockout cells can restore normal levels of p27 Kip1 and other cell cycle regulators, highlighting BRAP's importance in cell cycle regulation and neural progenitor differentiation (Lanctot2017Loss).

BRAP modulates Ras-Erk signaling, which is crucial for the G1-to-S phase transition, and interacts with Lis1 and Nde1, essential for neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex (Lanctot2017Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the BRAP gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cardiovascular and cancer-related conditions. In cardiovascular diseases, the BRAP gene is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and carotid atherosclerosis. The polymorphism rs11066001 in BRAP is significantly linked to MI risk, with the GG genotype associated with a higher risk of carotid plaque and increased intima-media thickness (IMT) (Liao2011BRAP). This polymorphism is also linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) in East Asian populations, with studies showing a significant association between the GG genotype and increased CAD risk (Hinohara2009Validation).

In cancer, BRAP overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with immune infiltration and immune checkpoint markers, suggesting a role in tumor immunity (Ju2020BRCA1Associated). BRAP mutations have also been identified in neurofibromin-deficient tumors, where they may contribute to malignant progression by affecting the RAS-ERK signaling pathway (Harigai2022Mutation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of BRAP in both cardiovascular and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
BRAP (BRCA1 associated protein) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as a negative regulator of nuclear import, interacting with proteins such as PHLPP1, DNMT1, and AKAP3 in the testis. These interactions suggest BRAP's role in modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis by inhibiting the nuclear localization of PHLPP1 and DNMT1, which are retained in the cytoplasm in certain testicular cells where BRAP is abundant (Fatima2015Interactome).

BRAP also functions as a cytoplasmic retention factor for proteins like HMG20A, NuMA1, and SYNE2 in mammalian testis cells. It affects their subcellular localization, suggesting a role in transcription regulation and nuclear structure maintenance (Davies2013The). In viral contexts, BRAP inhibits the nuclear localization of viral proteins such as the T-antigen and HCMV ppUL44, with its interaction dependent on phosphorylation sites flanking the nuclear localization signals of these proteins (Fulcher2009The).

BRAP interacts with the cell cycle inhibitor p21, retaining it in the cytoplasm during monocyte differentiation. This interaction is crucial for monocyte survival and differentiation, as it prevents the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by reactive oxygen species (Asada2004Brap2).
