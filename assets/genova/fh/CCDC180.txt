# CCDC180

## Overview
CCDC180, or coiled-coil domain containing 180, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within motile cilia and certain cancer types. The protein, also referred to as CFAP76, is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. In motile cilia, CCDC180 is a component of the central apparatus, where it interacts with proteins such as adenylate kinases AK7 and AK9, suggesting a role in ciliary function and structure (McCafferty2023An). Additionally, CCDC180 has been identified as a potential biomarker in liposarcoma and prostate cancer, with its expression linked to tumor progression and malignancy (MatosFilipe2024Integration; Aoyama2019Identification). Despite its emerging significance in these contexts, the full spectrum of CCDC180's biological roles and interactions remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC180 has been identified as a potential immunohistochemical marker for atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL). Its expression is associated with dedifferentiation in liposarcoma cells, and knockdown of CCDC180 has been shown to decrease the malignant potential of these cells, affecting proliferation, invasion, migration, and resistance to apoptosis (Aoyama2019Identification). The gene's expression is not correlated with clinicopathological features, possibly due to a small sample size in studies (Aoyama2019Identification).

In prostate cancer, CCDC180 has been noted for its potential as a biomarker, achieving a precision mark of 0.80 in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade prostate cancer when included in datasets with patients having a Gleason Score of 7 (MatosFilipe2024Integration).

CCDC180 has also been implicated in intracranial aneurysms (IA) through genome-wide linkage analysis, although its role remains unclear. A variant in CCDC180 was identified in large families with IA, but no significant association was found in a larger cohort, suggesting limited clinical significance beyond specific familial cases (Bakker2022Genomewide).

In the context of motile ciliopathies, CCDC180, also known as CFAP76, is a component of the C1c structure of the central apparatus in motile cilia, potentially interacting with adenylate kinases like AK7, which are linked to ciliopathies (McCafferty2023An).

## Interactions
CCDC180, also known as coiled-coil domain containing 180, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the context of motile cilia and liposarcoma. In motile cilia, CCDC180 is associated with the central apparatus protein CFAP76, as revealed by cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL/MS) studies. These studies suggest that CCDC180 interacts with adenylate kinases AK7 and AK9, potentially forming a complex that plays a role in the central apparatus of motile axonemes (McCafferty2023An).

In the context of liposarcoma, CCDC180 has been identified as a potential immunohistochemical marker. Its expression is up-regulated in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells, and knockdown experiments have shown that reducing CCDC180 levels decreases the malignant potential of these cells. This suggests that CCDC180 may interact with other proteins involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis, although specific interaction partners in this context are not detailed (Aoyama2019Identification).

Despite these findings, the specific physical interactions of CCDC180 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in these processes.
