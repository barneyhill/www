# FAM90A22

## Overview
FAM90A22 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A22. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although the specific functional role of FAM90A22 within this family remains to be fully elucidated. Proteins in this family are often involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of gene expression, but FAM90A22's precise biological functions and interactions are still under investigation. The gene's expression and potential involvement in disease pathways highlight its clinical significance, warranting further research to understand its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
