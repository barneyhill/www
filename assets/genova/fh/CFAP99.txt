# CFAP99

## Overview
CFAP99, or cilia and flagella associated protein 99, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural and functional integrity of ciliary and flagellar axonemes. The protein is predominantly associated with the central apparatus (CA) of the axoneme, specifically interacting with the C1 microtubule, and plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of these structures. CFAP99 is characterized by its long α-helices and N-terminal globular domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins such as ANKMY1 and GRK3, contributing to the formation of the 32 nm periodic structure within the axoneme (Zhao2019Proteome; Zhu2024Incell). These interactions are essential for maintaining normal ciliary function, impacting processes such as cellular motility and signaling, and are implicated in respiratory and reproductive health (Zhao2019Proteome).

## Function
CFAP99 is a protein associated with the central apparatus (CA) of ciliary axonemes, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. In the axoneme, CFAP99 is predicted to be associated with the C1 microtubule, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the ciliary axoneme (Zhao2019Proteome). The protein is involved in the assembly and stability of axonemes, impacting processes such as respiratory function and reproductive health. CFAP99 serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins, such as ANKMY1 and GRK3, which are situated close to the heads of radial spokes RS8 and RS9, indicating its potential involvement in CA-radial spoke interactions (Zhu2024Incell).

In studies involving mutants, the absence or reduction of CFAP99 in axonemes resulted in slower swimming speeds, suggesting its role in maintaining normal ciliary function (Zhao2019Proteome). Although the specific molecular interactions of CFAP99 within the CA remain unclear, its presence is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the ciliary axoneme, which is vital for cellular motility and signaling (Zhao2019Proteome).

## Interactions
CFAP99, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 99, is involved in the structural organization of the central apparatus of the ciliary axoneme. In mammalian sperm axonemes, CFAP99 is predominantly composed of long α-helices and is distributed along the longitudinal axis of the microtubule on the outer wall of the C1 microtubule. It interacts with other proteins through its N-terminal globular domains. Specifically, the N-terminal domain of CCDC180 interacts with the N-terminal globular domains of CFAP99, as well as with ANKMY1 and GRK3. These interactions suggest that CFAP99 plays a role in the formation of the 32 nm periodic structure and may serve as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins (Zhu2024Incell).

In contrast, studies on the Chlamydomonas model have not identified specific physical interactions of CFAP99 with other proteins or nucleic acids under the experimental conditions used. The lack of detected interactions in these studies may be due to the dissociation of CFAP99 from its interacting partners during the extraction process (Zhao2019Proteome). This suggests that CFAP99's interactions might be context-dependent or sensitive to experimental conditions.
