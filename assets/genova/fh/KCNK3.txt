# KCNK3

## Overview
KCNK3 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 3, commonly referred to as TASK-1. This protein is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, characterized by its four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which facilitate the passage of potassium ions across the cell membrane (Lopes2000Proton; Fan2022Advances). TASK-1 plays a critical role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in various tissues, including the heart and lungs (Decher2011KnockOut; Olschewski2017TASK1). The channel's function is modulated by various factors, including extracellular pH and protein-protein interactions, which influence its localization and activity (Jang2021A; Fan2022Advances). Mutations in KCNK3 have been implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension and other disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Sörmann2022Gainoffunction; Ma2013A).

## Structure
The KCNK3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, specifically known as TASK-1. The molecular structure of the KCNK3 protein includes four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which is characteristic of the K2P channel family (Lopes2000Proton; Fan2022Advances). Each subunit of the channel contains four transmembrane α-helices (M1-M4) and two pore helices (PH1 and PH2), with selectivity filters (SF1 and SF2) that determine ionic selectivity (Fan2022Advances).

The channel exhibits a two-fold symmetry, forming a dimer that contributes to its quaternary structure (Fan2022Advances). The extracellular caps formed by conserved M1-P1 linkers create tunnel-like side gates for potassium ion exit, and the extracellular ion pathway regulates the channel's sensitivity to extracellular pH levels (Fan2022Advances). The protein also features a carboxyl-terminal PDZ consensus motif and several internal kinase sites, including those for protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and calcium-calmodulin kinase II, which are involved in post-translational modifications (Lopes2000Proton). These structural features are crucial for the channel's function in stabilizing resting membrane potential and regulating action potentials in excitable cells.

## Function
The KCNK3 gene encodes the TASK-1 channel, a two-pore domain potassium channel that plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in various tissues, including the lungs and heart. In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), TASK-1 channels contribute to the resting membrane potential, which is essential for controlling pulmonary vascular tone and minimizing calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (Olschewski2017TASK1). This function is vital for preventing excessive vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, processes associated with pulmonary hypertension (Olschewski2017TASK1).

TASK-1 channels are sensitive to hypoxia and can be activated by treprostinil, a prostacyclin analogue, through a protein kinase A-dependent pathway, enhancing their vasorelaxing properties (Olschewski2017TASK1). In endothelial cells, KCNK3 channels help maintain normal cell proliferation rates and mitochondrial integrity, with their inhibition leading to increased cell proliferation and mitochondrial depolarization (Lambert2019Characterization).

In the cardiac context, TASK-1 channels are involved in stabilizing the membrane potential of sinoatrial node cells and modulating cardiac electrical activity, particularly under resting conditions (Decher2011KnockOut). They contribute to the steady-state outward current in cardiac muscle, affecting the QT interval and QRS complex (Decher2011KnockOut).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNK3 gene are associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a severe condition characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These mutations lead to a loss of function in the potassium channel, resulting in depolarization of the resting membrane potential and potential pulmonary artery vasoconstriction (Ma2013A). The mutations identified in KCNK3, such as G203D, G97R, and V221L, are found in both familial and idiopathic PAH cases, although they are present in a small percentage of these cases (Ma2013A). The dysfunction of KCNK3 channels contributes to increased muscularization of small pulmonary vessels and enhanced collagen crosslinking, which are characteristic features of PAH (Lambert2019Characterization).

KCNK3 mutations also impact immune function in PAH patients, leading to altered immune cell populations and chronic immune activation, which may exacerbate the condition (West2021KCNK3). In addition to PAH, gain-of-function mutations in KCNK3 have been linked to a developmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, structural malformations, and sleep apnea (Sörmann2022Gainoffunction). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNK3 in various disorders.

## Interactions
KCNK3, also known as TASK-1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function and localization. In the cochlea, KCNK3 interacts with TMEM43, a protein associated with deafness. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, indicating a direct binding between TMEM43 and KCNK3, which may play a role in maintaining K+ ion homeostasis and hearing (Jang2021A).

KCNK3 also interacts with connexin proteins, specifically Cx26, but not with Cx30, suggesting selective binding within the connexin family (Jang2021A). The protein 14-3-3beta is crucial for the PKC-dependent internalization of KCNK3 channels, highlighting a regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions (Lvov2011KCNK3).

Additionally, KCNK3 interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin-8 (stx8), which affects its endocytosis and surface expression. This interaction involves endocytosis signals in both proteins, regulating KCNK3 currents (Kilisch2015The). The protein p11 also interacts with KCNK3, retaining it in the endoplasmic reticulum and modulating its trafficking (Kilisch2015The). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory network governing KCNK3's cellular functions.
