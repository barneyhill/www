# HOXD1

## Overview
HOXD1 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D1 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is renowned for its role in regulating developmental processes by controlling gene expression patterns that establish the body plan and positional identity during embryogenesis. The HOXD1 protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain, which facilitates its binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. This binding is crucial for processes such as cell differentiation and tissue patterning, particularly in the development of the central nervous system and limbs (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection; Appukuttan2000IsolationandcharacterizationofthehumanhomeoboxgeneHOXD1). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and follows a spatial and temporal collinearity, ensuring precise developmental outcomes (Tarchini2006Control). Additionally, HOXD1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression and methylation patterns contribute to disease progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Brotto2020Contributions; Paço2020Methylation).

## Structure
The human HOXD1 gene encodes a protein that is 328 amino acids long, consisting of two exons separated by a 354 bp intron (Appukuttan2000IsolationandcharacterizationofthehumanhomeoboxgeneHOXD1). The primary structure of the HOXD1 protein includes a highly conserved 60 amino acid homeodomain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding specificity (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection). This homeodomain contains a helix-turn-helix motif, with the third helix acting as the recognition helix that interacts with the major groove of DNA (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection).

The secondary structure of the HOXD1 protein is characterized by a high content of α-helical structures, as confirmed by circular dichroism analysis, indicating that more than 85% of the renatured protein adopts this conformation (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection). The tertiary and quaternary structures of the HOXD1 protein have not been detailed in the available literature, nor have specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms been described (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection; Appukuttan2000IsolationandcharacterizationofthehumanhomeoboxgeneHOXD1).

## Function
HOXD1 (homeobox D1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the central nervous system and limbs. It is part of the HOX gene family, which is known for its involvement in regulating gene expression patterns that dictate the body plan and positional identity along the anterior-posterior axis during development (Tarchini2006Control; Steens2022HOX).

In healthy human cells, HOXD1 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes. This binding influences cell differentiation and tissue patterning, essential processes for proper organismal development (Steens2022HOX). The expression of HOXD1, like other HOX genes, follows a spatial and temporal collinearity, meaning its activation is tightly regulated in a sequence that corresponds to its position on the chromosome and the specific body regions it influences (Tarchini2006Control).

HOXD1's role in limb development is particularly notable, as it is involved in the early stages of limb bud formation, contributing to the growth and patterning necessary for proper limb structure (Tarchini2006Control). The gene's expression is modulated by various signaling pathways, including Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is crucial for digit morphogenesis (Tarchini2006Control).

## Clinical Significance
HOXD1 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression and methylation patterns contributing to disease progression. In ovarian cancer, increased expression of HOXD1 is associated with the development of ovarian carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Brotto2020Contributions). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2072590, located between HOXD1 and HOXD3, may influence ovarian cancer susceptibility by regulating HOXD1 expression (Li2019The).

In gastric cancer, hypermethylation of HOXD1 is part of a signature that predicts lymph node metastasis, indicating its role in cancer prognosis (Paço2020Methylation). HOXD1 is also noted as a biomarker for breast cancer detection and prognosis (Paço2020Methylation).

HOXD1 is involved in the inflammatory process in cancer through the JAK/STAT pathway, with 53 out of 1945 HOXD1 targets implicated in this pathway, suggesting a role in tumor inflammation (Brotto2020Contributions). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, HOXD1 is downregulated, and its high expression is linked to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and TGF-β signaling (Wang2024Role).

## Interactions
The HOXD1 protein, a member of the homeobox gene family, primarily interacts with DNA through its homeodomain, which is crucial for binding specific DNA sequences. The optimal DNA-binding site for HOXD1 has been identified as 5'-T/AT/gTAATTGTA-3', featuring a TAAT core motif common among homeodomain proteins. This interaction is characterized by a strong affinity, with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range, indicating a stable protein-DNA complex (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection).

The carboxy terminal region of HOXD1 enhances its DNA-binding affinity by counteracting the effects of nonbasic residues at positions 2 and 3 of the homeodomain, which are typically associated with weaker DNA-binding activity in labial Hox proteins (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection). Specific interactions between amino acids in the HOXD1 protein and the DNA sequence have been proposed, such as Ile47 making contact with the DNA, and other residues like Tyr25, Arg53, Met54, and Gln50 interacting with specific nucleotides (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection).

While the study primarily focuses on the interaction of HOXD1 with DNA, it does not provide detailed information on direct physical interactions with other proteins (Kumar2001CharacterizationofHoxd1protein–DNAbindingspecificityusingaffinitychromatographyandrandomDNAoligomerselection).
