# ORAI2

## Overview
ORAI2 is a gene that encodes the ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator 2 protein, which is a critical component of calcium signaling pathways in human cells. The protein is a member of the ORAI family and functions as a pore-forming subunit of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). ORAI2 is characterized by its four transmembrane segments and cytosolic N- and C-termini, allowing it to form tetrameric assemblies that can be either homomeric or heteromeric, influencing ion selectivity and channel function (Derler2012Structure). The protein plays a significant role in modulating calcium entry by interacting with STIM1, a key regulator of CRAC channels, and forming heteromeric complexes with other ORAI proteins, such as ORAI1 and ORAI3, to diversify calcium signaling events (Yoast2020The; Vaeth2017ORAI2). ORAI2's involvement in calcium signaling is crucial for various cellular processes, including immune cell function, gene expression, and cellular responses to physiological stimuli. Additionally, the gene has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sekaran2023Bioinformatics; Singh2020Orai1).

## Structure
The ORAI2 protein is a member of the ORAI family, which forms the pore-forming subunits of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. ORAI2 shares structural features with other ORAI proteins, including four transmembrane segments and cytosolic N- and C-termini (Derler2012Structure). The transmembrane architecture of ORAI2 allows it to form tetrameric assemblies, which can be homomeric or heteromeric, influencing ion selectivity (Derler2012Structure). The presence of negatively charged residues in the first and third transmembrane segments is crucial for attracting calcium ions, and mutations in these regions can alter ion selectivity (Derler2012Structure).

ORAI2, like other ORAI proteins, is highly selective for calcium ions and is activated upon store depletion via coupling to STIM1 (Derler2012Structure). The protein also contains a C-terminal putative coiled-coil domain, which is important for its interaction with STIM1 (Derler2012Structure). ORAI2 has a higher coiled-coil probability compared to ORAI1, affecting its interaction with STIM1 (Derler2012Structure). Although specific post-translational modifications for ORAI2 are not detailed, it is known that ORAI proteins can undergo such modifications, potentially affecting their function.

## Function
ORAI2 is a protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling in human cells by modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). It forms part of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are essential for various cellular functions, including signal transduction and gene expression. ORAI2 can form heteromeric channels with ORAI1 and ORAI3, contributing to the diversity of calcium signaling events. These heteromeric channels are crucial for the differential activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) isoforms, which are important for gene transcription (Yoast2020The).

In T cells and other immune cells, ORAI2 acts as a negative regulator of ORAI1-mediated CRAC channel function, attenuating calcium entry by enhancing calcium-dependent inactivation (Vaeth2017ORAI2). This modulation is important for maintaining calcium homeostasis and regulating immune cell function. ORAI2's interaction with STIM1, a key component of CRAC channels, is stronger than that of ORAI1, influencing the channel's activation and activity (Yoast2020The).

ORAI2 is also involved in regenerative calcium oscillations, which are critical for cellular responses to physiological receptor activation. It helps expand the sensitivity range of receptor-activated calcium signals, ensuring proper cellular responses to varying agonist concentrations (Yoast2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The ORAI2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in calcium signaling pathways. In oral cancer, ORAI2 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, contributing to increased store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is crucial for cancer cell migration and proliferation. Silencing ORAI2, along with ORAI1, reduces cancer cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in oral cancer (Singh2020Orai1). 

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), ORAI2 has been identified as a significant biomarker associated with disease progression. It is consistently expressed across different brain regions affected by AD, such as the frontal, hippocampal, and temporal areas. The gene's expression is linked with other AD-related markers, suggesting its involvement in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease (Sekaran2023Bioinformatics).

ORAI2 is also implicated in breast cancer, where it contributes to cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance, potentially leading to chemoresistance. Its expression in certain breast cancer subtypes suggests a role in the pathophysiology of these cancers (Rubaiy2023ORAI).

## Interactions
ORAI2 is known to interact with other proteins to form functional complexes that modulate calcium signaling. It forms heteromeric channel complexes with ORAI1, which are crucial for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in various cell types, including T cells and chondrocytes. These heteromeric complexes can attenuate the function of ORAI1 by enhancing fast calcium-dependent inactivation, thereby limiting SOCE (Inayama2015Orai1–Orai2; Vaeth2017ORAI2). 

In chondrocyte cell lines, ORAI2 interacts with ORAI1 to form hetero-tetramers, which are less efficient in conducting calcium compared to ORAI1 homomers. This interaction is suggested to reduce the function of ORAI1, thereby modulating calcium entry (Inayama2015Orai1–Orai2). In T cells, the deletion of ORAI2 results in increased SOCE, indicating its role in attenuating calcium influx when forming complexes with ORAI1 (Vaeth2017ORAI2).

ORAI2 also interacts with STIM1, a key regulator of SOCE, which senses calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum and activates ORAI channels. This interaction is crucial for sustaining calcium oscillations, especially at low agonist concentrations (Yoast2020The). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of ORAI2 in calcium signaling pathways across different cell types.
