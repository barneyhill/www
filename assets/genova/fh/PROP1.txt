# PROP1

## Overview
The PROP1 gene encodes the PROP paired-like homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor critical for the development and function of the pituitary gland. This protein is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding homeodomain and a transactivation domain, which are essential for its role in regulating the growth and differentiation of hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. PROP1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like process necessary for the differentiation of pituitary progenitor cells, influencing the expression of key genes such as Zeb2, Notch2, and Gli2 (Pérez2016PROP1). Mutations in the PROP1 gene are a leading cause of combined pituitary hormone deficiency, affecting multiple anterior pituitary hormones and leading to clinical manifestations such as short stature and delayed puberty (Fang2016Genetics; Correa2019Combined). The protein's function is modulated through interactions with corepressors and its ability to bind specific DNA sequences, highlighting its complex regulatory role in pituitary development (Carvalho2010Corepressors; Nakayama2009Dimeric).

## Structure
The PROP1 protein in humans is composed of 226 amino acids and is encoded by three exons. It features a highly conserved DNA-binding homeodomain and a transactivation domain at the C-terminus (Ward2007Comparative). The homeodomain, consisting of 60 amino acid residues, includes three helices, with the third helix being crucial for DNA recognition (Nakayama2009Dimeric). This domain is involved in nuclear localization and DNA binding, and its conservation across species underscores its functional importance (Ward2007Comparative).

The transactivation domain at the carboxyl terminus is well conserved among mammals, with identity percentages ranging from 97%-98% between humans and other hominoids to 76.5% between humans and mice (Ward2007Comparative). The carboxyl terminus contains potent transcriptional activation domains, while the amino termini and homeodomains have repressive activities (Showalter2002Differential).

The PROP1 protein is known to form dimers, which is essential for its transcriptional activity. Dimerization is facilitated by specific amino acid interactions, such as the side chain of Ile-28, which is involved in dimerization (Nakayama2009Dimeric). The presence of Pro-10, distinct from other paired-class homeodomains, is a unique feature of PROP1 (Nakayama2009Dimeric).

## Function
The PROP1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is essential for the development and function of the pituitary gland. In healthy human cells, PROP1 is involved in the regulation of anterior pituitary gland growth and the differentiation of hormone-producing cells. It plays a critical role in the migration and differentiation of anterior pituitary progenitors from the perilumenal region of Rathke's pouch to form the anterior lobe, which is crucial for the expansion of the anterior lobe after birth (Ward2005Role). PROP1 is necessary for the transition of progenitor cells from a high-proliferation state to differentiation, particularly affecting the development of somatotropes, lactotropes, and thyrotropes (Raetzman2004Developmental).

The gene is involved in triggering an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process, which is essential for the normal transition of progenitor cells to differentiated states during embryogenesis and postnatal pituitary expansion. This process involves the down-regulation of E-cadherin and a reduction in cell adhesion, facilitating differentiation (Pérez2016PROP1). PROP1 also influences the expression of genes such as Zeb2, Notch2, and Gli2, which are important for pituitary progenitor proliferation and normal pituitary morphology (Pérez2016PROP1). The gene's activity is modulated by WNT signaling, which enables it to suppress Hesx1 and activate Pou1f1 expression (Pérez2016PROP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PROP1 gene are the most common genetic cause of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by deficiencies in multiple anterior pituitary hormones, including growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Correa2019Combined; Penta2019Identification). These mutations impair the gene's ability to bind DNA and activate transcription, leading to pituitary dysmorphogenesis and failure to activate Pit1 gene expression (Correa2019Combined). 

Patients with PROP1 mutations often present with short stature due to GH deficiency and may exhibit delayed or absent puberty due to LH and FSH deficiencies. Over time, some patients may also develop adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency (Moalla2022Analysis; Fang2016Genetics). The most common mutation is a two-base-pair deletion (c.301_302delAG), which leads to a frameshift and early termination of the protein (Dusatkova2015Genesis). 

The clinical presentation of PROP1 mutations can vary, with some patients showing pituitary gland abnormalities such as hypoplasia or hyperplasia on MRI (ValletteKasic2001PROP1). Genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis and management, as it helps guide therapeutic decisions and avoid unnecessary interventions (Penta2019Identification).

## Interactions
PROP1 (PROP paired-like homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in pituitary development through its interactions with various proteins and DNA sequences. PROP1 interacts with corepressors TLE1 and TLE3, which enhance its repressive activity on transcription factors like HESX1. HESX1 itself is a strong repressor of differentiation, and its activity is further enhanced by TLE1 and TLE3, which act as corepressors to repress PROP1 activity (Carvalho2010Corepressors).

PROP1 can bind to DNA sequences, specifically preferring AT-rich sequences with a TAAT motif. It binds dimerically to inverted TAAT motifs separated by three nucleotides, which promotes its transcriptional activity. This dimeric binding is crucial for its function as a transcription factor, as monomeric binding does not result in significant transcriptional activation (Nakayama2009Dimeric).

The interaction between PROP1 and TLE proteins is significant, as TLE1 and TLE3 can repress PROP1 activation independently of HESX1. This repression likely involves protein-protein interactions, as TLE proteins do not bind directly to the PROP1 consensus recognition sequence but can coimmunoprecipitate with PROP1 (Carvalho2010Corepressors).
