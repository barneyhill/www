# OR4N4

## Overview
The OR4N4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily N member 4, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR4N4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is also notably present in human spermatozoa and testis, suggesting potential specialized functions beyond olfaction (Flegel2016Characterization; Raka2021Human). Despite its expression in these tissues, the protein has not been detected in spermatozoa, indicating possible low expression levels or alternative regulatory mechanisms (Flegel2016Characterization). The gene's involvement in various biological processes and its association with certain genetic conditions highlight its significance, although its precise roles in non-olfactory tissues and clinical contexts require further investigation (Abaffy2015Human).

## Function
The OR4N4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. These receptors initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4N4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection. In addition to its role in the olfactory system, OR4N4 is highly expressed in human spermatozoa and testis, suggesting a specialized function in these tissues (Flegel2016Characterization; Raka2021Human). However, despite the presence of OR4N4 transcripts in spermatozoa, the protein itself has not been detected, indicating that it may not be expressed or is present at levels below detection limits (Flegel2016Characterization). The specific molecular activities and functional roles of OR4N4 in non-olfactory tissues remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential contributions to cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Abaffy2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4N4 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in several medical conditions through genetic alterations. In the context of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, OR4N4 is part of a common focal deletion region at 15q11.2, detected in 90% of studied trio families. This deletion, which includes OR4N4, is considered a significant genomic alteration potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of MRKH syndrome (Pan2019Detection).

In undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma induced by high-dose radiation, OR4N4 is among the genes with altered expression levels. It is involved in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, which plays a role in various biological processes, including apoptosis and immune response (Bang2016Gene).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of OR4N4 mutations in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is considered unlikely. Although OR4N4 is located within a genomic region containing de novo deletions implicated in ASDs, it is not deemed important in this context (Erickson2016The).

Overall, while OR4N4 is associated with certain genetic alterations, its direct clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.
