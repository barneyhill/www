# IFNB1

## Overview
The IFNB1 gene encodes the cytokine interferon beta-1, a critical component of the immune system's response to viral infections. As a monomeric cytokine, interferon beta-1 is involved in the regulation of antiviral defense mechanisms, primarily through the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by a compact α-helical bundle structure, stabilized by disulfide bonds and hydrogen networks, and plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immunity. The expression of IFNB1 is tightly regulated by a complex enhanceosome assembly, which includes various transcription factors and DNA elements, ensuring precise control over its activity. Clinically, alterations in IFNB1 expression or function have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, where it can influence processes such as autophagy and apoptosis, highlighting its dual role in promoting both cell survival and death (Ambjørn2013IFNB1interferonβinduced; Ford2010The; HOSOI1988Structural; Ejlerskov2020IFNBinterferonβ).

## Structure
The IFNB1 gene encodes the interferon beta-1 protein, which is characterized by a specific molecular structure. The primary structure of IFN-β1 consists of a complete amino acid sequence that matches the sequence deduced from its cDNA nucleotide sequence, with no proteolytic cleavages at the carboxy-terminal residues (HOSOI1988Structural). The secondary structure is predominantly composed of α-helices, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy and circular dichroic data, with specific bands in the Raman spectra suggesting the presence of both α-helical and β-sheet structures (HOSOI1988Structural). 

The tertiary structure of IFN-β1 includes a disulfide bond between Cys-31 and Cys-141, with an unpaired cysteine at position 17 (HOSOI1988Structural). The protein also features an N-glycosylation site at Asn-80, confirmed by the presence of glucosamines (HOSOI1988Structural). The mature protein is described as forming a compact α-helical bundle, consisting of five α-helices (Meager1998Interferons). 

IFN-β1 is a monomeric cytokine, and its structure is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and a disulfide bridge (Wittling2021Shared). The protein lacks a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits, as it functions as a single protein species (Meager1998Interferons).

## Function
The IFNB1 gene encodes interferon beta-1, a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the antiviral immune response. In healthy human cells, particularly dendritic cells, IFNB1 is induced as part of the innate immune response to viral infections. This induction is essential for initiating a coordinated cellular program that leads to widespread viral resistance. The expression of IFNB1 is vital for both the induction of innate immunity and the maturation of dendritic cells, which subsequently leads to the induction of adaptive immunity (Hu2007Chromosomespecific).

The transcriptional activation of the IFNB1 gene requires the cooperative assembly of a multi-subunit enhanceosome. This complex includes various transcription factors such as the AP1 complex, IRF dimers, NFkB, and HMGI(Y), which work together to facilitate the gene's expression (Hu2007Chromosomespecific). The secreted interferon beta-1 protein binds to specific cell surface receptors on both infected and uninfected cells, activating the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway. This activation leads to the transcriptional activation of many antiviral genes, which are primary targets for viral inhibition of the antiviral signaling pathway (Ford2010The). The IFNB1 gene's expression is tightly regulated to prevent misfiring, highlighting its critical role in the immune response (Ford2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IFNB1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In neurodegenerative diseases, the loss of IFNB1 function is associated with a Parkinson's disease-like phenotype in mice, characterized by the accumulation of proteins such as α-synuclein and tau. This accumulation results from a late-stage block in autophagic flux, highlighting the gene's role in preventing the buildup of aggregation-prone proteins, which are hallmarks of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Ejlerskov2020IFNBinterferonβ).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, IFNB1 is known to induce autophagy, which can contribute to treatment resistance by promoting cell survival. While IFNB1 has antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, its ability to induce autophagy can counteract these effects, complicating its therapeutic use. This dual role suggests that targeting autophagy could enhance the efficacy of IFNB1 in cancer treatment (Ambjørn2013IFNB1interferonβinduced). The gene's involvement in autophagy and apoptosis underscores its complex role in cancer therapy, where it can activate both growth inhibition and survival pathways (Ambjørn2013IFNB1interferonβinduced).

## Interactions
The IFNB1 gene, encoding interferon beta 1, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that regulate its expression and function. The transcription factor ThPOK plays a significant role in mediating interchromosomal interactions necessary for IFNB1 expression in response to viral induction. ThPOK interacts with NF-kB, and this interaction is enhanced by specific DNA elements, such as the WT NRC21 DNA. This cooperative binding is crucial for the stochastic assembly of the IFNB1 enhanceosome, leading to gene expression (Nikopoulou2018The).

ThPOK can oligomerize and bind to DNA, facilitating the physical association of separate DNA elements like NRC21 and the IFNB1 enhancer. This interaction is strengthened by NF-kB, which enhances the binding at low ThPOK concentrations, indicating cooperative DNA binding (Nikopoulou2018The). The presence of intact GAGA and kB sites is essential for these interactions, as mutations can disrupt the cooperative binding and reduce IFNB1 activation (Nikopoulou2018The).

In addition to these interactions, the bromodomain protein Brd3 enhances the formation and recruitment of the IRF3/p300 complex to the Ifnb1 promoter, promoting transcriptional activation in macrophages. Brd3 acts as a coactivator by facilitating the acetylation of IRF3 through p300, which is crucial for IFNB1 transcription (Ren2017Bromodomain).
