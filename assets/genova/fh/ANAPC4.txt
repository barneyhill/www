# ANAPC4

## Overview
ANAPC4 is a gene that encodes the protein anaphase-promoting complex subunit 4, which is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle by targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase. ANAPC4, as part of the platform sub-complex, contributes to the structural integrity and functional activation of the APC/C, interacting with other subunits to modulate its ubiquitin ligase activity (Watson2019Posing; Melloy2019The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which enhance its function in chromosomal alignment and segregation (Eifler2018SUMO). ANAPC4's role in maintaining genomic stability underscores its importance in cell cycle progression and its potential implications in cancer biology.

## Structure


## Function
ANAPC4 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates cell cycle progression by targeting specific proteins for degradation. This process is essential for the transition from metaphase to anaphase, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell division. ANAPC4 is part of the platform sub-complex of the APC/C, which includes other subunits such as APC1, APC5, and APC15. This platform serves a scaffolding role, facilitating the structural integrity and conformational changes necessary for APC/C activation (Watson2019Posing; Melloy2019The).

ANAPC4 interacts with several other subunits, including APC2 and APC11, forming connections that influence the position and activity of the catalytic module of the APC/C. This interaction is crucial for modulating the ubiquitin ligase activity of the complex (Watson2019Posing). ANAPC4 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which enhances the ubiquitylation activity of the APC/C, particularly affecting the recruitment of specific targets like KIF18B, thereby playing a role in chromosomal alignment and segregation (Eifler2018SUMO). These molecular processes underscore the importance of ANAPC4 in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANAPC4 gene have been associated with various cancers. ANAPC4 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a key regulator of mitosis. Mutations in APC/C subunits, including ANAPC4, have been identified in several cancer types, with some subtypes of ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma showing mutation frequencies over 20% (Melloy2019The). High copy number alterations of ANAPC4 are linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as glioma, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene in certain contexts (Melloy2019The).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low expression of ANAPC4 is associated with resistance to TTK inhibitors, a class of drugs targeting mitotic kinases. Disruption of ANAPC4, along with other APC/C components, confers resistance to these inhibitors, indicating its importance in drug response (Thu2018Disruption). ANAPC4 has also been implicated in familial cancer predispositions, with non-coding variants potentially affecting its regulatory functions, although its role as a significant cancer driver is not highly ranked in some computational analyses (Derpoorter2022Whole; Melloy2019The).

## Interactions
ANAPC4, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation through its interactions with other proteins. ANAPC4 interacts with several APC/C subunits, including APC1, APC2, APC5, APC8, and APC15, serving as a scaffolding subunit within the complex (Eifler2018SUMO). These interactions are essential for the structural integrity and function of the APC/C, facilitating its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Sumoylation of ANAPC4, particularly at lysine residues K772 and K798, is crucial for its function and the regulation of the APC/C. This post-translational modification enhances the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC/C, particularly towards substrates like Hsl1 and KIF18B (Eifler2018SUMO). The interaction between sumoylated ANAPC4 and the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) on APC2 is vital for stabilizing the catalytic core of the APC/C, promoting efficient substrate ubiquitylation and timely mitotic progression (Lee2018Sumoylation).

ANAPC4's interactions are modulated by phosphorylation and sumoylation, which influence its binding to other proteins and the overall activity of the APC/C during mitosis (Eifler2018SUMO). These interactions underscore the importance of ANAPC4 in maintaining proper cell cycle progression and mitotic regulation.
