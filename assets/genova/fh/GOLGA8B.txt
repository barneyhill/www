# GOLGA8B

## Overview
GOLGA8B is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member B, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. Golgin A8 family member B is implicated in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating vesicular transport processes. The gene is located on chromosome 15 and is notable for its involvement in genomic instability, particularly in the 15q13.3 region, which is associated with various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (Antonacci2014Palindromic). Additionally, GOLGA8B has been studied for its role in cancer biology, where its expression levels are linked to tumor progression and drug resistance in certain cancers (Ma2019Clinical; Li2024Exploration).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The GOLGA8B gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or involvement in genomic instability. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GOLGA8B is overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels, particularly in late-stage tumors, suggesting its role as an oncogene. However, no correlation between GOLGA8B expression and patient survival has been established (Ma2019Clinical). In prostate cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), GOLGA8B is upregulated and associated with resistance to chemotherapy drugs like cabazitaxel and docetaxel. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, impacting disease progression and patient prognosis (Li2024Exploration).

GOLGA8B is also linked to genomic instability, particularly in the 15q13.3 region of chromosome 15, where it contributes to microdeletions associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy (Antonacci2014Palindromic). In Alzheimer's disease, GOLGA8B shows differential expression in neurons, with rare coding changes associated with dementia, although large genome-wide association studies have not confirmed a significant link (Blue2020Non‐coding).
