# CNTN6

## Overview
The CNTN6 gene encodes the protein contactin 6, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs). This protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes six immunoglobulin-like domains and four fibronectin type III domains, anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage (OguroAndo2017A; Mercati2013Contactin). Contactin 6 plays a pivotal role in neural development, particularly in processes such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and neuronal network establishment. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, with significant expression in regions like the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and thalamus during early postnatal development (OguroAndo2017A). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as latrophilin-1 and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor gamma, underscore its importance in neuronal survival and circuit development (Zuko2016Association; Mercati2013Contactin). Mutations and variations in the CNTN6 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance (Repnikova2020CNTN6; Mercati2016CNTN6).

## Structure
Contactin 6 (CNTN6) is a member of the immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule superfamily (IgCAMs) and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. The protein consists of six N-terminal immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, which are tethered to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (OguroAndo2017A; Mercati2013Contactin). These domains contribute to a horseshoe-shaped conformation at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (Ptpra) (OguroAndo2017A).

The Ig domains of CNTN6 are involved in its binding interactions, with specific structural features such as the V loop at the Ig2-Ig3 interface, which shows conformational flexibility and can adopt multiple positions (Mercati2013Contactin). This flexibility may influence the protein's binding properties and functional interactions, although it does not significantly alter its binding affinity with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) (Mercati2013Contactin).

Post-translational modifications of CNTN6 likely include glycosylation, a common feature in cell adhesion molecules, which may affect its stability and interactions (OguroAndo2017A). The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its role in neural development and cell adhesion.

## Function
Contactin-6 (CNTN6) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, playing a critical role in neural development. It is involved in several molecular processes, including neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and neuronal network establishment. CNTN6 is expressed in specific brain regions such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, with its expression peaking in the early postnatal period (OguroAndo2017A).

CNTN6 interacts with latrophilin-1 (Lphn1) to form a cis-complex that regulates neuronal apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for preventing apoptosis, as the absence of CNTN6 leads to increased Lphn1-induced apoptosis, highlighting its protective role in neuronal survival (Zuko2016Association). CNTN6 also interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor gamma (PTPRG), influencing neurite outgrowth and branching, which are essential for proper neuronal circuit development (Mercati2013Contactin).

In addition to its role in apoptosis and neuritogenesis, CNTN6 is involved in maintaining neuronal structure and function, particularly in the cerebellum and cortex. It forms complexes with other proteins, such as Chl1 and PTPα, which influence axonal regrowth and cortical morphology (OguroAndo2017A). These interactions suggest that CNTN6 is integral to maintaining neuronal integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CNTN6 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and other developmental conditions. Studies have shown that both copy number variations (CNVs) and rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in CNTN6 are more frequent in individuals with ASD compared to the general population, suggesting a significant association with the disorder (Mercati2016CNTN6). These genetic alterations are linked to abnormal auditory sensory perception, such as hyperacusis, and changes in neuronal connectivity, which are relevant to ASD pathophysiology (Mercati2016CNTN6).

CNTN6 CNVs have also been implicated in a range of clinical phenotypes, including developmental delay, speech and language delays, and sensory processing issues. However, the clinical significance of these CNVs remains uncertain due to variability in clinical presentations and the fact that they are often inherited from unaffected parents (Repnikova2020CNTN6). In some cases, CNTN6 duplications have been associated with conditions like Tourette syndrome and bipolar disorder, though the mechanisms are not fully understood (Repnikova2020CNTN6). Overall, while CNTN6 mutations and CNVs are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, their exact role and pathogenicity require further investigation.

## Interactions
Contactin-6 (CNTN6) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in neural development and function. CNTN6 interacts with latrophilin-1 (Lphn1), forming a heteromeric cis-complex that regulates neuronal apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for mitigating the neurotoxic effects of Lphn1, such as reduced neurite branching and increased apoptosis, by coexpression with CNTN6 (Zuko2016Association). 

CNTN6 also engages in interactions with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG), sharing identical binding sites with other contactins like CNTN4 and CNTN5. These interactions are implicated in neuritogenesis, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear (Mercati2013Contactin). 

Additionally, CNTN6 forms complexes with neural cell adhesion molecules such as CHL1 and PTPσ, which are involved in axonal guidance and synaptic formation. These interactions suggest that CNTN6 participates in multimodal cis and trans interactions, influencing neurobiological processes (Burbach2019Latrophilin’s; OguroAndo2017A). 

CNTN6 also interacts with Notch1, where it binds to specific EGF repeats, triggering Notch receptor processing and influencing neural progenitor cell differentiation (Cui2004NB3Notch1).
