# ADAM22

## Overview
ADAM22 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 22 protein, a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family. Unlike other members of this family, ADAM22 functions primarily as a neural adhesion receptor rather than a metalloproteinase, due to its lack of proteolytic activity. The protein is characterized by a unique structure comprising a metalloproteinase-like domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and an epidermal growth factor-like domain, which collectively form a compact four-leaf clover shape (Liu2009Structural; Yamagata2018Structural). ADAM22 plays a crucial role in the nervous system, particularly in synaptic function and neuronal communication, by interacting with proteins such as LGI1 and integrins. These interactions are essential for synapse maturation, maintenance, and myelination processes (Hsia2019Functions; Sagane2005AtaxiaandperipheralnervehypomyelinationinADAM22deficientmice). Mutations in the ADAM22 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, including epilepsy, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal nervous system function (Fukata2021Transsynaptic).

## Structure
ADAM22 is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a unique structure that supports its role as a neural adhesion receptor rather than a metalloproteinase. The ectodomain of ADAM22 is composed of four domains: a metalloproteinase-like domain (residues 233-435), a disintegrin domain (residues 445-529), a cysteine-rich domain (residues 530-676), and an epidermal growth factor-like domain (residues 677-718) (Liu2009Structural; Yamagata2018Structural). The overall structure forms a compact four-leaf clover shape, with the metalloproteinase-like domain held in the concave face of a rigid module formed by the disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and EGF-like domains (Liu2009Structural).

ADAM22 lacks proteolytic activity due to the absence of critical catalytic residues and the filling of the substrate groove, which is further hindered by the cysteine-rich domain (Liu2009Structural). The protein is monomeric in solution, as supported by gel filtration results (Liu2009Structural). The structure includes three putative calcium-binding sites, with one in the metalloproteinase-like domain serving a regulatory role and two in the disintegrin domain providing structural stability (Liu2009Structural).

Post-translational modifications of ADAM22 include N-linked glycosylation at specific asparagine residues (Liu2009Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, particularly in the EGF-like domain (Liu2009Structural). ADAM22 interacts with LGI1, forming a complex that is significant in synaptic function and linked to epilepsy (Yamagata2018Structural).

## Function
ADAM22 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) family, which plays a crucial role in the nervous system, particularly in synaptic function and neuronal communication. Although ADAM22 is catalytically inactive, it is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, primarily through its disintegrin domain, which interacts with integrins (Sagane2005AtaxiaandperipheralnervehypomyelinationinADAM22deficientmice; Gödde2007Differential).

In the central nervous system, ADAM22 is expressed in neurons and astrocytes, where it functions as a receptor for the ligand LGI1. This interaction is essential for synapse maturation and maintenance, as it forms a multiprotein complex with PSD-95 and stargazin, crucial for AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission (Hsia2019Functions; Gödde2007Differential). ADAM22 is also involved in the clustering of Kv1 channels and membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) at juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons, contributing to the spatial organization of these proteins and proper neuronal excitability (Ogawa2010ADAM22).

In the peripheral nervous system, ADAM22 interacts with LGI4, a Schwann cell-derived factor, playing a significant role in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. This interaction is crucial for proper myelin formation, as evidenced by hypomyelination in ADAM22-deficient mice (Sagane2005AtaxiaandperipheralnervehypomyelinationinADAM22deficientmice; Özkaynak2010Adam22). Overall, ADAM22 is vital for maintaining normal nervous system function, influencing processes such as synaptic transmission, myelination, and cellular proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAM22 gene are linked to several neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy. ADAM22 interacts with the neuronal protein LGI1, and mutations in either gene can disrupt this interaction, leading to synaptic dysfunction. For instance, mutations such as C401Y and p.Ser799-IlefsTer96 in ADAM22 impair its ability to bind LGI1, contributing to conditions like infantile epilepsy and severe encephalopathy with intractable seizures and intellectual disability (Yamagata2019Insights; Fukata2021Transsynaptic). 

ADAM22 deficiency in mice results in severe ataxia, peripheral nerve hypomyelination, and premature death due to seizures, highlighting its critical role in neurological function (Sagane2005AtaxiaandperipheralnervehypomyelinationinADAM22deficientmice). In humans, compound heterozygous mutations in ADAM22 have been associated with rapidly progressing cortical atrophy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability (Fukata2017The). 

The LGI1-ADAM22 complex is crucial for synaptic regulation, and disruptions in this complex can lead to epilepsy and memory impairment. The loss of function in this interaction is linked to reduced AMPAR function, which may cause epileptic seizures through mechanisms like disinhibition of hippocampal networks and dysfunction of Kv 1 channels (Fukata2021Transsynaptic).

## Interactions
ADAM22 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the 14-3-3 protein family through its cytoplasmic domain, a phosphorylation-dependent interaction crucial for ADAM22's surface expression. This interaction involves two 14-3-3 binding motifs, with the first site being essential for binding. Mutations that disrupt these motifs result in ADAM22 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, indicating the necessity of 14-3-3 binding for proper membrane localization (Gödde2006Efficient).

ADAM22 also interacts with integrins, including αvβ3 and those containing α6 or α9, through its disintegrin domain. This interaction is implicated in cell adhesion and may influence cellular proliferation (D’Abaco2006ADAM22; Gödde2006Efficient).

Additionally, ADAM22 serves as a receptor for the secreted neuronal protein LGI1. This interaction is crucial for synaptic transmission and is involved in the formation of macromolecular complexes with voltage-gated potassium channels and AMPA receptors, which are essential for synaptic function (Benarroch2012ADAM; EDWARDS2008The). The LGI1-ADAM22 complex is important for the maturation of excitatory synapses, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to neurological disorders (Muona2016Dysfunctional).
