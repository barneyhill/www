# ETV7

## Overview
ETV7, or ETS variant transcription factor 7, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, which are critical regulators of gene expression involved in various biological processes. The protein encoded by ETV7 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, influencing the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. ETV7 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and plays a significant role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and immune responses. It is known to interact with specific DNA sequences and other proteins, forming complexes that modulate transcriptional activity. ETV7's involvement in various cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma, highlights its clinical significance, particularly in the context of cancer progression and resistance to therapies (Meškytė2023ETV7; Harwood2018ETV7; Rasighaemi2017ETV6).

## Structure


## Function
ETV7, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, plays a significant role in hematopoiesis and immune response regulation in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in hematopoietic tissues, such as bone marrow, and is involved in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and the control of lineage-specific differentiation (Numata2018Establishment; Rasighaemi2017ETV6). ETV7 functions as a transcriptional repressor, modulating the expression of various genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Rasighaemi2017ETV6).

In the nucleus, ETV7 binds to specific DNA sequences, particularly the core ccG-GAAgt sequence, to regulate target gene expression (Rasighaemi2017ETV6). It has been shown to down-regulate genes such as RARA, BMP6, and IL6, while up-regulating others like TMSB4X, indicating its complex role in transcriptional regulation (Rasighaemi2017ETV6). ETV7 also interacts with other proteins, potentially antagonizing the transcriptional activity of its sibling gene, ETV6, which is crucial for hematopoietic stem cell survival (Numata2018Establishment).

Despite its involvement in hematopoietic processes, the specific physiological role of ETV7 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, as its expression does not significantly alter hematopoietic homeostasis in transgenic mouse models (Numata2018Establishment).

## Clinical Significance
ETV7, also known as ETS variant transcription factor 7, plays a significant role in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, ETV7 is upregulated and contributes to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation and stemness. It is also associated with chemo- and radio-resistance. ETV7 reduces inflammatory responses by repressing the TNFR1/NF-κB axis, which may help cancer cells evade the immune response, potentially affecting the efficacy of immunotherapies (Meškytė2023ETV7).

In colorectal cancer, ETV7 is upregulated and promotes cancer progression by enhancing the expression of IFIT3, a protein involved in cell proliferation and migration. This suggests that the ETV7/IFIT3 axis could be a target for therapeutic intervention (Chai2024ETV7).

In melanoma, ETV7 is downregulated, and its low expression is linked to poor prognosis. It is involved in immune-related processes, including T cell activation and differentiation, indicating its potential role in regulating the immune microenvironment (Qu2020Integrated).

ETV7 is also implicated in drug resistance in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma by maintaining mTORC1/2-like signaling, contributing to rapamycin resistance (Harwood2018ETV7).

## Interactions
ETV7, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. It forms a unique complex with the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), known as mTORC3, which is distinct from the well-characterized mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of mTORC3, which is resistant to rapamycin, a common anticancer drug. ETV7's interaction with mTOR does not involve the auxiliary components Raptor and Rictor, which are part of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively (Harwood2018ETV7).

ETV7 also interacts with DNA by binding to ETS family DNA motifs, specifically the GGAA sequence, to repress the expression of interferon-induced genes. This binding is essential for its role as a transcriptional repressor, as demonstrated by its inability to bind DNA when mutated (Froggatt2019ETV7).

In breast cancer cells, ETV7 interacts with the TNFRSF1A gene, repressing its expression and thereby modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction involves direct binding to the regulatory elements of TNFRSF1A, reducing chromatin accessibility and competing with STAT3 for binding sites (Meškytė2023ETV7).
