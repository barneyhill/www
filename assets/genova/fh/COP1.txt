# COP1

## Overview
COP1 is a gene that encodes the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, a RING finger ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of protein degradation. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, by tagging specific transcription factors for proteasomal degradation. COP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the stability of transcription factors such as c-Jun, influencing cellular homeostasis and acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Ouyang2020Erk12; Newton2018Ubiquitin). The protein's activity is intricately regulated by signaling pathways, such as the MEK1/2-Erk1/2 pathway, which affects its subcellular localization and function (Ouyang2020Erk12). COP1's interactions with various proteins, including DET1 and TRB3, further underscore its role in protein stability and lipid metabolism (Baert2010The; Qi2006TRB3). Clinically, COP1 is implicated in cancer biology, exhibiting dual roles as both a tumor promoter and suppressor, depending on the cellular context and interacting partners (Marine2012Spotlight).

## Structure
The human COP1 protein, also known as RFWD2, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a WD40 domain, which forms a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure crucial for substrate recognition and binding. This domain interacts with the Trib1 protein, utilizing a shallow binding pocket on the top face of the propeller to accommodate specific sequences, such as the V-P sequence of Trib1 (Uljon2016Structural). Key residues involved in this interaction include F595, T568, C509, and W467, which contribute to the formation of a ridge between the V-P pocket and a larger central cavity (Uljon2016Structural).

The WD40 domain is stabilized by an N-terminal helix and a loop enriched in acidic residues, which are important for maintaining the structural integrity of the propeller (Uljon2016Structural). COP1 also shares structural similarities with other E3 ligases, such as bTrCP1, both featuring seven-bladed propellers with similar charge profiles, although COP1 possesses a unique shallow pocket that enhances its substrate selectivity (Uljon2016Structural). The protein's structure is further defined by its ability to bind Trib1 with high affinity, influencing COP1's substrate specificity and regulatory functions (Uljon2016Structural).

## Function
COP1, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a crucial role in regulating protein degradation in healthy human cells. It is involved in tagging specific transcription factors for proteasomal degradation, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, and differentiation (Ouyang2020Erk12). COP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the stability of transcription factors like c-Jun, a member of the AP-1 family, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival (Newton2018Ubiquitin; Bianchi2003Characterization).

The activity of COP1 is regulated by the MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which affects its subcellular localization. When this pathway is active, COP1 is sequestered at the nuclear envelope, allowing the accumulation of transcription factors necessary for cell proliferation. Upon inactivation of the pathway, COP1 translocates to the nucleoplasm, promoting the degradation of its target transcription factors and leading to cell growth arrest (Ouyang2020Erk12).

COP1 also functions as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of proteins like c-Jun, thereby preventing excessive cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ouyang2020Erk12). Its role in neuroinflammation is highlighted by its regulation of c/EBPb in microglia, preventing excessive pro-inflammatory responses that could lead to neurodegenerative diseases (Ndoja2020Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
COP1 (COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its dual function as both a tumor promoter and suppressor. Overexpression of COP1 is frequently observed in breast and ovarian adenocarcinomas, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to decreased p53 activity and reduced levels of its downstream target, p21 (Dornan2004COP1). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), increased COP1 expression correlates with disease progression and is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenicity (FU2015Expression).

In bladder cancer, high COP1 expression is linked to poor differentiation and recurrence, serving as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Li2016High). Similarly, in gastric cancer, elevated COP1 levels are associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Li2012High).

COP1's interaction with other proteins, such as c-Jun and ETV1, further complicates its role in cancer. While it can promote tumorigenesis by degrading tumor suppressors, it also has the potential to act as a tumor suppressor by targeting oncogenic proteins for degradation (Marine2012Spotlight). This complex role highlights the importance of COP1 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
COP1, a RING finger ubiquitin ligase, interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity and protein stability. It forms complexes with Jun family transcription factors, specifically c-Jun and JunD, through a conserved COP1-binding motif. This interaction is crucial for suppressing AP-1-dependent transcription, although it does not lead to c-Jun degradation, indicating that COP1's inhibitory effect is independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity (Bianchi2003Characterization).

COP1 also interacts with DET1 to regulate the ubiquitylation and degradation of ERM, a member of the PEA3 group, highlighting its role in protein stability (Baert2010The). In the context of lipid metabolism, COP1 binds to TRB3, which acts as an adaptor to recruit COP1 to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), enhancing ACC ubiquitination and inactivation (Qi2006TRB3).

COP1 is part of the DCX hDET1-hCOP1 complex, which includes CUL4A and regulates c-Jun degradation. This complex promotes UPS-mediated c-Jun degradation, a process blocked by proteasome inhibitors (Wertz2004Human). COP1's interaction with FIP200, a key regulator of autophagy, suggests its involvement in autophagy-related processes (Kobayashi2013The).
