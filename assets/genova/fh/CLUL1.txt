# CLUL1

## Overview
The CLUL1 gene encodes the retinal clusterin-like protein 1, a glycoprotein primarily expressed in the retina. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including photoreceptor differentiation and light-dependent translocation within cone photoreceptors, suggesting its critical role in retinal health and function. Structurally, CLUL1 is characterized by a sequence of 338 amino acids and includes conserved cysteine residues that contribute to its conformation, resembling that of clusterin proteins. The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its cellular activity and interactions. CLUL1's expression is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated, with notable expression in the retina, and to a lesser extent, in the liver and brain. While the gene has been studied for its potential involvement in retinal disorders like age-related macular degeneration and progressive retinal atrophy, its direct role in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated (Winkler2018Investigating; Zhang2000Molecular).

## Structure
The CLUL1 protein is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 338 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 39,389 Da (Zhang2000Molecular). The sequence includes four conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for the protein's structure (Zhang2000Molecular). These cysteine residues are located in the 'clusterin signature 2' region, suggesting a potential similarity in folded conformation with clusterin proteins (Zhang2000Molecular).

The protein is predicted to be a glycoprotein, with seven N-glycosylation sites, three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and two N-myristoylation sites, indicating common post-translational modifications (Zhang2000Molecular). These modifications suggest that CLUL1 may function as a secreted protein or within cell organelles, supported by the presence of signal peptides at its N-terminus (Zhang2000Molecular).

The CLUL1 gene exhibits tissue-specific expression, with high levels in the retina and lower levels in the liver and brain, and is developmentally regulated during photoreceptor differentiation (Zhang2000Molecular). The presence of multiple transcripts, including a 2.9 kb variant, suggests the existence of splice variant isoforms (Zhang2000Molecular).

## Function
The CLUL1 gene encodes a protein known as retinal clusterin-like protein 1, which is primarily expressed in the retina and plays a significant role in retinal health and function. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including photoreceptor differentiation and light-dependent translocation within cone photoreceptors. In light-adapted retinas, CLUL1 is localized in the outer segment of cone photoreceptors, while in dark-adapted retinas, it is found in the contact region between cone pedicles and second-order neurons, indicating its role in normal cone function and adaptation to light conditions (Winkler2018Investigating).

CLUL1 is suggested to function as a glycoprotein, with potential sites for N-glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions within the cell. The presence of signal peptides at its N-terminus suggests that it may function in cell organelles or as a secreted protein (Zhang2000Molecular). The protein's sequence homology to clusterin, particularly towards the C-terminal end, implies a similarity in folded conformation and potentially related functions, such as involvement in apoptosis, regulation of complement activation, and tissue remodeling (Zhang2000Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The CLUL1 gene has been investigated for its potential role in retinal disorders, particularly age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). In a study involving 376 patients with AMD, three sequence variations in the CLUL1 gene were identified, including one isocoding change and two intronic changes. Notably, one intronic change was significantly less frequent in patients with severe AMD compared to control subjects, suggesting it may reduce the risk for AMD or be linked to a nearby protective variant. However, none of these variants are considered pathogenic or predicted to affect splice sites (Sturgill2006Mutation).

In dogs affected by progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd), a form of PRA, CLUL1 expression is significantly lower compared to normal retinas, particularly during the photoreceptor development phase. Despite this altered expression, CLUL1 is not causally associated with prcd, as the prcd locus maps to a different chromosome than CLUL1 (Zhang2000Molecular). The gene's expression is developmentally regulated, with a significant increase during photoreceptor differentiation, indicating its potential involvement in retinal disorders (Zhang2000Molecular). These findings suggest that while CLUL1 may play a role in retinal health, its direct involvement in specific diseases remains unclear.
