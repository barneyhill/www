# EYA1

## Overview
The EYA1 gene encodes the EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 1, a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. As a member of the EYA family, this protein is characterized by its dual role as a transcriptional coactivator and a phosphatase, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including sensory organ development and kidney formation. The EYA1 protein contains a conserved eya-homologous region (eyaHR) that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as the Six and Dach families, and is essential for its nuclear translocation and function. Mutations in the EYA1 gene are linked to several congenital disorders, most notably Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome, which manifests as hearing loss, branchial cleft anomalies, and renal malformations. The gene's role in development and disease underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing developmental abnormalities (Azuma2000Mutations; Liu2015The; Gigante2013BranchioOtoRenal).

## Structure
The EYA1 protein is characterized by a conserved carboxy terminal eya-homologous region (eyaHR) and a divergent proline-serine-threonine-rich transactivation domain, known as the eya variable region (Orten2008Branchiootorenal). The eyaHR domain is crucial for mediating interactions with other proteins, such as sine oculis (so) and dachshund (dac), and is involved in nuclear translocation when bound to the six gene family proteins (Orten2008Branchiootorenal). This domain is conserved among EYA family members and is implicated in various developmental processes, including sensory neurogenesis and kidney development (Azuma2000Mutations; Dressler2006The).

Mutations in the EYA1 gene, particularly in the eyaHR region, can affect protein folding and function, potentially altering exonic splice enhancers (ESEs) or RESCUE-ESEs (Orten2008Branchiootorenal). The EYA1 protein is involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its function as a transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase (Azuma2000Mutations). The protein has multiple splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its diverse roles in transcriptional regulation and developmental processes (Azuma2000Mutations).

## Function
The EYA1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. EYA1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator and possesses phosphatase activity, which is essential for cell differentiation and development. In healthy human cells, EYA1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly by enhancing the transcription of cyclin D1, a key regulator of cell cycle progression. This activity is mediated through its recruitment to the chromatin of the cyclin D1 promoter, where it influences transcriptional activity (Liu2015The).

EYA1 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA damage repair by dephosphorylating the histone protein H2AX, a critical step in the DNA damage response (Mentel2018WDR1). The protein's phosphatase activity is also involved in modulating phosphorylation states within cells, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing apoptosis (Azuma2000Mutations).

EYA1 is part of the conserved retinal determination gene networks (RDGNs) and interacts with other proteins such as the Six and Dach families, playing a significant role in tissue growth and specification, including the development of the eyes, ears, and kidneys (Liu2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EYA1 gene are primarily associated with Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hearing loss, branchial cleft anomalies, and renal malformations. EYA1 mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including branchial fistulae, preauricular pits, and renal anomalies such as hypoplasia or bilateral renal agenesis (Sanggaard2007Branchio–oto–renal; Gigante2013BranchioOtoRenal). The gene's mutations often result in non-functional proteins due to frameshifts, premature stop codons, or aberrant splicing, which disrupt the protein's phosphatase domain and its ability to interact with other proteins like SIX1 and DACH (Sanggaard2007Branchio–oto–renal; Gigante2013BranchioOtoRenal).

EYA1 mutations are also implicated in Branchio-Otic (BO) syndrome, which shares some features with BOR syndrome but lacks renal involvement (Song2013Mutational). The variability in clinical presentation among individuals with EYA1 mutations suggests a complex genotype-phenotype correlation, with some patients exhibiting only mild symptoms (Zhang2024Novel). Additionally, alterations in EYA1 expression or interactions may contribute to tumorigenesis in certain cancers, although this aspect requires further research (Cho2024Genomic).

## Interactions
EYA1, a transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase, engages in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in gene regulation and developmental processes. It interacts with Six family transcription factors, such as Six2, to regulate gene expression essential for maintaining nephron progenitor cell (NPC) identity. This interaction is significant for transcriptional activation and repression, as EYA1 co-occupies sites with Six2 to regulate genes necessary for NPC maintenance (Li2022The).

EYA1 also interacts with REST corepressors and REST-binding sequences, playing a role in transcriptional repression. Approximately 76% of EYA1-occupied sites without H3K27ac-deposition possess the REST motif, indicating EYA1's involvement in a REST-dependent gene repression network (Li2022The). This interaction is crucial for preventing NPCs from differentiating into other cell types by repressing genes encoding non-NPC signature proteins.

In addition to these interactions, EYA1 is involved in DNA replication and repair processes. It interacts with proteins such as RFC1 and MCM proteins, which are essential for DNA replication and repair, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Li2022The). EYA1's interactions with chromatin remodeling factors and transcription factors, including DACH1, further underscore its multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and developmental processes (Li2022The).
