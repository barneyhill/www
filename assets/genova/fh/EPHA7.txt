# EPHA7

## Overview
EPHA7 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A7, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is the largest subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EPH receptor A7 is characterized by its involvement in cell signaling processes that regulate cell positioning and tissue architecture during development. This receptor is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the nervous system and muscle differentiation by mediating cell-cell communication through interactions with ephrin ligands. The EPHA7 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including corticogenesis, dendrite morphogenesis, and synaptic function, and has been implicated in the regulation of cancer progression and immune response (Oricchio2011The; Arnold2020EphA7; Beuter2016Receptor). The gene's expression and mutations have clinical significance, particularly in the context of cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a prognostic marker depending on the cellular environment (Zhang2021EPHA7; Oricchio2011The).

## Structure
The EPHA7 protein is a member of the Eph receptor family, characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes several key domains. The extracellular region of EPHA7 contains a ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich region, and two fibronectin Type III domains, which are crucial for its interaction with ephrin ligands (Zhou1998The). The intracellular portion of EPHA7 features a highly conserved kinase domain, which is the catalytic core responsible for its enzymatic activity. This domain has a bilobed structure, with an N-lobe composed of beta sheets and helical regions, and a C-lobe with an alpha-helical structure. The hinge region connects these lobes and plays a role in the conformational changes necessary for kinase activity (Chakraborty2021Crystal).

EPHA7 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Liang2019Eph). The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, some of which lack the kinase domain and may act as dominant-negative inhibitors or signaling molecules (Liang2019Eph; Zhou1998The). These structural features and modifications enable EPHA7 to participate in various cellular processes, including developmental signaling and cancer progression.

## Function
EPHA7 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells and the development of the nervous system. In skeletal muscle, EPHA7 is involved in promoting myogenic differentiation through cell-cell contact, acting as a mediator of the 'community effect' where a sufficient number of cells are required for efficient differentiation. It is expressed on myocytes during embryonic and fetal myogenesis and on nascent myofibers during muscle regeneration, facilitating the commitment of adjacent myoblasts to terminal differentiation (Arnold2020EphA7).

EPHA7 interacts with ephrin-A5 to facilitate cell-cell contact-mediated signaling, which is crucial for the differentiation of myogenic cells. This interaction promotes a rapid and coordinated differentiation process, known as synergistic commitment, in myoblasts (Arnold2020EphA7). In the nervous system, EPHA7 is involved in corticogenesis, influencing brain size and shape, and is crucial for dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic function. It regulates cell-cell adhesion and repulsion, contributing to the development of the central nervous system and potentially playing a role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Lévy2021EPHA7).

## Clinical Significance
EPHA7 mutations and alterations in its expression are implicated in various cancers. In multiple cancer types, EPHA7 mutations (EPHA7-MUT) serve as predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, showing better clinical outcomes such as higher objective response rates and longer overall survival compared to EPHA7 wild-type (WT) patients (Zhang2021EPHA7). These mutations are associated with increased tumor mutational burden and enhanced anti-tumor immunity, suggesting their potential to complement existing biomarkers like PD-L1 expression (Zhang2021EPHA7).

In follicular lymphoma (FL), EPHA7 acts as a tumor suppressor, frequently silenced due to hemizygous 6q deletions and promoter methylation. This loss of expression is linked to lymphomagenesis, and reactivation of EPHA7 has shown antitumor effects in lymphoma models (Oricchio2011The). In prostate cancer, EPHA7 downregulation is associated with tumor progression, and its overexpression can inhibit tumor growth and promote apoptosis (Li2017Liganddependent).

In glioblastoma multiforme, overexpression of EPHA7 correlates with adverse outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2008Increased). These findings highlight the complex role of EPHA7 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a factor in tumor progression depending on the context.

## Interactions
EPHA7, a member of the Eph receptor family, engages in various physical interactions that are crucial for its function. The truncated form of EPHA7, known as EPHA7 TR, interacts with the EPHA2 receptor, leading to decreased phosphorylation of EPHA2 and inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways such as ERK and SRC family kinases. This interaction suggests that EPHA7 TR acts as a decoy receptor, blocking oncogenic signals in lymphoma cells (Oricchio2011The). EPHA7 also interacts with ephrin ligands, including ephrin A1, A4, and A5, but not A2 and A3, indicating selective binding properties (Oricchio2011The).

In the context of prostate cancer, EPHA7 interacts with ephrinA5, which enhances its tumor-suppressing activity through increased phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting prostate cancer cell migration and invasion (Li2017Liganddependent). EPHA7 also plays a role in gephyrin clustering, essential for GABAergic synapse stabilization, through interactions with the postsynaptic scaffolding molecule gephyrin. This process is dependent on the protein kinase activity of EPHA7 and involves the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway (Beuter2016Receptor). Additionally, EPHA7 interacts with Nicalin, which regulates its expression and secretion, affecting its stability and function (Wang2020Identification).
