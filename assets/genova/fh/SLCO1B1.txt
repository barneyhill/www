# SLCO1B1

## Overview
The SLCO1B1 gene encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (OATP1B1), a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the liver. OATP1B1 is a member of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) family and plays a critical role in the hepatic uptake of a variety of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, including drugs, hormones, and bile acids. The protein's structure, characterized by 12 transmembrane helices and significant glycosylation, facilitates its function in transporting compounds across the hepatocyte membrane (Hagenbuch2004Organic; Ciută2023Structure). Genetic polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of medications, particularly statins, influencing drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects (Nies2013Genetics; Zaïr2008Pharmacogenetics). Understanding the genetic variations and regulatory mechanisms of SLCO1B1 is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies and minimizing drug-related toxicities.

## Structure
The SLCO1B1 gene encodes the OATP1B1 protein, a member of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) family, primarily expressed in the liver. OATP1B1 is a glycoprotein consisting of 691 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 84 kDa, which reduces to 54 kDa after deglycosylation, indicating significant glycosylation as a post-translational modification (Hagenbuch2004Organic). The protein features 12 transmembrane helices, characteristic of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold, forming two pseudo-symmetrical bundles (Ciută2023Structure). 

The structure of OATP1B1 includes a large central cavity in an inward-open conformation, facilitating substrate transport. The extracellular domain contains a Kazal-like domain, which is cysteine-rich and unique to OATPs (Ciută2023Structure). The substrate-binding pocket is funnel-shaped, formed by transmembrane helices TM7, TM8, TM9, and TM10, with specific residues such as Tyr422, Tyr425, Gln541, and Asn544 forming hydrogen bonds with substrates like estrone-3-sulfate (Ciută2023Structure). 

The protein's structure is crucial for its function in hepatic uptake of various compounds, and polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 can significantly affect its transport function (Hagenbuch2004Organic).

## Function
The SLCO1B1 gene encodes the OATP1B1 protein, a crucial transporter located on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes in the human liver. OATP1B1 is involved in the hepatic uptake of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, including bile salts, bilirubin, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones, and various drugs such as statins, methotrexate, and rifampicin (Oshiro2010PharmGKB; Hagenbuch2004Organic). This protein plays a significant role in drug metabolism and clearance, affecting the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of medications, particularly statins, which are used to lower cholesterol levels (Nies2013Genetics; Zaïr2008Pharmacogenetics).

OATP1B1 facilitates the active transport of these compounds from the blood into hepatocytes, thereby contributing to their clearance from the bloodstream and maintaining normal physiological levels of these substances (Hagenbuch2013The). The expression of OATP1B1 is regulated by the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1α, and its activity can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which may lead to variability in drug response and susceptibility to adverse effects (Nies2013Genetics; Zaïr2008Pharmacogenetics). The protein's function is essential for maintaining metabolic balance and ensuring the effective clearance of potentially toxic compounds from the body (Hagenbuch2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLCO1B1 gene, particularly the c.521T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), have significant clinical implications. This SNP is associated with increased plasma concentrations of statins, leading to a higher risk of statin-induced myopathy, a condition characterized by muscle pain and weakness. The risk is especially pronounced in individuals taking high doses of simvastatin, with the c.521C allele linked to a markedly increased risk of myopathy (Niemi2011Organic; Unknownauthors2008SLCO1B1VariantsandStatinInducedMyopathy—AGenomewideStudy). The SLCO1B1*5 variant, another polymorphism, is also associated with an increased risk of statin-induced side effects, including myalgia and elevated creatine kinase levels, particularly in females and those taking simvastatin (Voora2009The).

In addition to statin-related effects, SLCO1B1 variants can influence the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. For instance, certain SLCO1B1 variants are linked to enhanced clearance of methotrexate, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Niemi2011Organic). These genetic variations underscore the importance of SLCO1B1 genotyping in personalizing treatment strategies to mitigate adverse drug reactions.

## Interactions
The SLCO1B1 gene encodes the OATP1B1 protein, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. OATP1B1 can form homo-oligomers through disulfide bonds, with the Gly-Xxx-Xxx-Xxx-Gly motif in transmembrane domain 5 being crucial for this oligomerization. This oligomerization may also occur as hetero-oligomers with other OATP transporters, although the specific interactions and their implications require further investigation (Zhang2019Proteinprotein; Lee2020Posttranslational).

The activity and expression of OATP1B1 are modulated by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, which can trigger internalization and reduce OATP1B1 levels in hepatocytes (Mayati2017Protein; Lee2020Posttranslational). This suggests a regulatory mechanism where PKC influences the localization and function of OATP1B1.

OATP1B1 also interacts with other proteins that affect its trafficking and stabilization at the plasma membrane. For instance, interactions with proteins like PDZK1 are known to modulate the expression and function of OATP1B1 and other OATPs (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network governing OATP1B1's role in hepatic drug transport.
