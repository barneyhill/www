# TPRX1

## Overview
TPRX1 is a gene that encodes the tetrapeptide repeat homeobox 1 protein, a member of the PRD-class homeodomain transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its role in early embryonic development, where it functions as a transcriptional regulator. The TPRX1 protein is distinguished by its divergent homeodomain, which is involved in DNA-binding and specificity, and a unique C-terminal region containing repeated tetrapeptide motifs. These structural features enable TPRX1 to participate in the regulation of gene expression during critical stages of embryogenesis, such as embryonic genome activation and preimplantation development. The gene is expressed in various reproductive tissues and early developmental stages, highlighting its importance in the preparation of totipotent stages and subsequent cell fate specialization. TPRX1's interactions with other transcription factors and its regulation by factors like DUX4 suggest its involvement in complex regulatory networks, with potential implications for neurodevelopmental and muscular disorders (Dunwell2016Diversity; Madissoon2016Characterization; Booth2007Annotation).

## Structure
The TPRX1 gene encodes a protein characterized by a divergent PRD-class homeodomain, which is a common feature of homeobox genes involved in regulating development (Booth2007Annotation). The homeodomain of TPRX1 shows 46-50% identity to human Otx-family homeodomains, indicating a degree of divergence (Booth2007Annotation). This domain is crucial for DNA-binding and specificity-determining functions, with the N-terminal arm and recognition helix playing significant roles in interacting with DNA (Lewin2021Dynamic).

The TPRX1 protein contains 58 repeated copies of a four-amino acid motif, variants of Pro-Ile-Pro-Gly, located C-terminal to the homeodomain (Booth2007Annotation). The primary structure of TPRX1 includes these motifs, but the full amino acid sequence and the N-terminal portion, including the start methionine, cannot be fully deduced from available data (Booth2007Annotation). The secondary structure of the homeodomain typically consists of an N-terminal arm and three alpha-helices, which are implicated in DNA-binding specificity (Madissoon2016Characterization).

The TPRX1 gene has multiple splice variants, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided (Madissoon2016Characterization). The protein's molecular structure has been shaped by positive selection, potentially altering its DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction properties (Lewin2021Dynamic).

## Function
The TPRX1 gene encodes a PRD-class homeodomain protein that functions as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in early embryonic development. It is expressed in early embryos and pluripotent stem cells, where it is involved in the regulation of embryonic genome activation (EGA) and preimplantation development (Madissoon2016Characterization). TPRX1 acts as either an activator or repressor of gene expression, with its specific targets influenced by the amino acid sequence in its homeodomain (Madissoon2016Characterization). The gene is expressed in reproductive tissues such as the testis and placenta, as well as in early developmental stages like the oocyte and preimplantation embryos (Dunwell2016Diversity).

In terms of molecular activity, TPRX1 is likely active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the expression of other genes. This regulation is crucial for the preparation of totipotent stages of embryonic development, facilitating subsequent cell fate specialization (Dunwell2016Diversity). The expression of TPRX1 is tightly regulated and peaks during the 8-cell to morula stage of embryo development, suggesting its importance in early developmental processes (Dunwell2016Diversity).

## Clinical Significance
The TPRX1 gene, encoding a PRD-like homeobox transcription factor, has been implicated in various developmental processes, particularly during early embryogenesis. Alterations in TPRX1 expression or gene dosage changes, such as those resulting from copy number variations (CNVs), have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. A study identified a 19q13.32q13.33 copy number gain encompassing TPRX1, which was classified as likely pathogenic due to its gene-rich nature and previous associations with neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Quintela2017Copy).

While TPRX1 itself has not been directly linked to specific diseases, its potential regulation by distal enhancers or indirectly by factors like DUX4 suggests a role in conditions such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). In this context, TPRX1 is mentioned as a gene likely regulated by DUX4, a key player in FSHD, although the direct impact of TPRX1 on the disease remains to be fully elucidated (Yao2014DUX4-induced).

Overall, the clinical significance of TPRX1 is primarily related to its involvement in early developmental processes and its potential contribution to neurodevelopmental and muscular disorders through gene dosage changes and regulatory interactions.

## Interactions
TPRX1 is involved in transcriptional regulation and interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to localize predominantly in the nucleus, where it plays a role in regulating gene expression during early human embryonic development. TPRX1, along with LEUTX, significantly down-regulates a set of genes, indicating a partial overlap in function between these two transcription factors (Maeso2016Evolutionary). The interaction between TPRX1 and ARGFX is antagonistic, as genes down-regulated by TPRX1 are often up-regulated by ARGFX, suggesting a complex regulatory network (Maeso2016Evolutionary).

TPRX1 has undergone episodic positive selection, with changes in its homeodomain that may affect DNA-binding specificity. The N-terminal arm of the TPRX1 homeodomain is suggested to interact with the minor groove of DNA, influencing its binding properties. Additionally, residues in homeodomain helices 1 and 2 are proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions, indicating that TPRX1's binding properties are influenced by both DNA and protein interactions (Lewin2021Dynamic).

TPRX1 is also involved in the induction of the 8-cell program in embryonic stem cells, where its derepression partially mediates the transition to 8-cell-like cells, highlighting its role in early developmental processes (Zhang2024LINE1).
