# CYP2J2

## Overview
CYP2J2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily J member 2, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the human heart and is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to produce epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which play crucial roles in cardiovascular health by modulating blood pressure and protecting against hypertension-induced damage (Murray2016CYP2J2). The CYP2J2 enzyme is characterized by its typical cytochrome P450 fold, which includes a heme group essential for its catalytic activity (Cong2013Structural). It interacts with various proteins, such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, to facilitate its function (Das2020CYP2J2). Alterations in the CYP2J2 gene have been associated with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiang2005Cytochrome; Askari2013Roles).

## Structure
CYP2J2 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme primarily expressed in the human heart, with a sequence encoding a 502-amino acid protein and a molecular mass of approximately 57,653 Da (Wu1996Molecular). The protein exhibits a typical cytochrome P450 fold, consisting of 12 alpha-helices (A to L) and three beta-sheets (β1 to β3), with the heme group deeply embedded in the core (Cong2013Structural). The core region is formed by helices C, E, F, I, and L, along with B′, F′, and K helices, which together create the active site pocket (Cong2013Structural).

The active site is hydrophobic and smaller than those of other mammalian CYP enzymes, with a volume of approximately 320 cubic angstroms. Key residues forming the active site cavity include Ala 311 and Thr 315 on the I helix, as well as Arg 117, Ile 127, Met 128, Ile 376, Val 380, and Ile 487 (Cong2013Structural). The enzyme's structure is stabilized by a hydrophobic clamp composed of residues I127, F310, A311, V380, and I487, which restricts substrate access to the active site (Xu2020Molecular). The N-terminal region allows CYP2J2 to attach to membranes, facilitating interactions with redox partners essential for electron transfer (Xu2020Molecular). The protein's interactions with lipid bilayers are mediated by hydrophobic residues in the F-G loop, such as Trp-235, Ile-236, and Phe-239, which act as membrane anchors (McDougle2015Incorporation).

## Function
CYP2J2 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily involved in the epoxidation of arachidonic acid to produce epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). These EETs play significant roles in cardiovascular health by acting as vasodilators or vasoconstrictors depending on the vascular bed, thus modulating blood pressure and protecting against hypertension-induced damage (Murray2016CYP2J2). In the heart, CYP2J2 is highly expressed in ventricular cardiomyocytes, where it contributes to maintaining cardiomyocyte homeostasis by regulating diverse transcriptional programs involved in ion channel signaling, development, extracellular matrix, and metabolism (Evangelista2020CYP2J2).

CYP2J2 also plays a role in protecting against ischemic injury and arrhythmias by activating mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels and ERK MAPK pathways (Murray2016CYP2J2). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been linked to reversing pathological processes like hypertension and insulin resistance (Murray2016CYP2J2). Additionally, CYP2J2 and its metabolites have cytoprotective roles, preventing endothelial injury by reducing endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte adhesion, which are key early events in atherosclerosis (Murray2016CYP2J2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYP2J2 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. The CYP2J2*7 polymorphism, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region, is associated with a reduced promoter activity and has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and hypertension in certain populations (Solanki2018Cytochrome; Das2020CYP2J2; Askari2013Roles). However, the association is not consistent across all studies, with some research indicating a protective effect in specific populations, such as African-Americans (Askari2013Roles).

CYP2J2 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression is upregulated in various human tumors, promoting the neoplastic phenotype of carcinoma cells. This overexpression enhances the migratory and proliferative properties of carcinoma cells, making them more resistant to apoptosis. Inhibiting CYP2J2 expression or its epoxygenase activity can enhance apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in carcinoma cells, suggesting its potential as a target for antitumor therapies (Jiang2005Cytochrome).

Additionally, CYP2J2 polymorphisms can affect drug metabolism, influencing therapeutic outcomes and adverse drug reactions, particularly in the context of cardiovascular health (King2002Cloning).

## Interactions
CYP2J2, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is essential for its catalytic activity. This interaction is facilitated by a positively charged surface near the membrane-bound CYP heme, serving as the binding interface (Das2020CYP2J2). The N-terminus hydrophobic residues of CYP2J2 are critical for its association with CPR, affecting electron transfer rates. This association is significantly faster in the full-length protein compared to a truncated version, highlighting the importance of the N-terminus in these interactions (Das2020CYP2J2).

CYP2J2 also interacts with microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) in living cells, as demonstrated by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis and proximity ligation assay (PLA). These studies suggest a complex formation between CYP2J2 and mEH in the endoplasmic reticulum, although this interaction is not essential for catalysis, it may help control reactive intermediates (Orjuela2017Evidence).

Additionally, CYP2J2 is involved in the metabolism of various substrates and inhibitors, including cardiotoxic drugs like doxorubicin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism (Das2020CYP2J2).
