# SEZ6L

## Overview
SEZ6L (seizure related 6 homolog like) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in neural development and synaptic function. The SEZ6L protein is characterized by its multiple CUB and complement control protein (CCP) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its role in the complement system and neural processes (Qiu2021The). As a substrate for the protease BACE1, SEZ6L undergoes ectodomain shedding, a process significant for synaptic development and function (Pigoni2016Seizure). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, where it influences motor coordination, learning, and memory (OngPålsson2021The; Nash2019Lack). SEZ6L's interactions with BACE1 and its altered distribution in Alzheimer's disease models highlight its potential involvement in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders (OngPålsson2021The; Dominko2022Amyloidß).

## Structure
The SEZ6L protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple domains that contribute to its function in neural development and complement regulation. Structurally, SEZ6L contains 2-3 CUB domains and 5 complement control protein (CCP) domains, also known as sushi repeats. These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are common in proteins of the complement system (Qiu2021The). The CCP domains are composed of 60-70 amino acids with four invariant cysteines forming disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Qiu2021The).

SEZ6L is a transmembrane protein with a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, indicating its role in cell signaling and interaction with other cellular components (Qiu2021The). The protein is N-glycosylated, with a major band at 160 kDa identified as complex N-glycosylated, suggesting post-translational modifications that may affect its function and localization (Pigoni2016Seizure).

The SEZ6L protein undergoes ectodomain shedding, primarily mediated by the enzyme BACE1, which cleaves SEZ6L near its transmembrane domain, resulting in the release of its soluble ectodomain (Pigoni2016Seizure). This process is significant for its role in synaptic development and function (Nash2019Lack).

## Function
SEZ6L (seizure related 6 homolog like) is a protein involved in synaptic function and neuronal development. It is a substrate for the protease BACE1, which is known for its role in Alzheimer's disease pathology. In neurons, SEZ6L is primarily cleaved by BACE1, which regulates its surface levels and function as a receptor (Pigoni2016Seizure). The cleavage of SEZ6L by BACE1 results in the shedding of its soluble ectodomain into the extracellular space, a process that is crucial for its role in cell biology (Pigoni2016Seizure).

SEZ6L is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, where it is found in Purkinje and granule cells and interneurons (OngPålsson2021The). It plays a significant role in motor coordination and learning, as evidenced by altered motor functions in SEZ6L knockout mice (OngPålsson2021The). The protein is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes, impacting learning and memory (Nash2019Lack). SEZ6L's involvement in these processes suggests its potential contribution to movement disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases in humans (OngPålsson2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The SEZ6L gene is implicated in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations or altered expression of SEZ6L have been associated with conditions such as autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (OngPålsson2021The; Nash2019Lack). SEZ6L knockout mice exhibit enhanced anxiety-like behavior and motor coordination deficits, indicating its role in controlling motor functions and anxiety-related behaviors (OngPålsson2021The). These findings suggest that SEZ6L dysfunction may contribute to movement disorders and psychiatric conditions due to its involvement in motor coordination and anxiety regulation (OngPålsson2021The).

SEZ6L is also a substrate of the Alzheimer's disease protease BACE1, which is involved in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Altered distribution of SEZ6L in the presence of amyloid-beta plaques has been observed in Alzheimer's disease models, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression (Dominko2022Amyloidß). The altered distribution of SEZ6L, rather than its proteolysis, is associated with amyloid-beta plaque formation, which is a primary pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (Dominko2022Amyloidß). These alterations may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease (Dominko2022Amyloidß).

## Interactions
SEZ6L, a protein encoded by the SEZ6L gene, is known to interact with the β-secretase enzyme BACE1. This interaction is significant as SEZ6L is a neuronal substrate of BACE1, which is involved in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a process linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OngPålsson2021The). SEZ6L, along with its family members SEZ6 and SEZ6L2, is cleaved by BACE1, and this cleavage is crucial for its function in neurons (Pigoni2016Seizure). The cleavage of SEZ6L by BACE1 results in the production of soluble ectodomains, which could serve as biomarkers for BACE1 activity in cerebrospinal fluid (Pigoni2016Seizure).

In the context of AD, SEZ6L's distribution is altered in the presence of amyloid-ß (Aß) plaques, although its proteolysis is not significantly affected. This suggests that SEZ6L may have distinct roles in AD pathology, potentially related to its localization rather than its cleavage (Dominko2022Amyloidß). SEZ6L is also involved in synaptic functions, as it is primarily located in dendritic cell membranes, playing roles in dendritic development and synapse maturation (Dominko2022Amyloidß). These interactions highlight SEZ6L's involvement in neurological functions and its potential impact on neurodegenerative diseases.
