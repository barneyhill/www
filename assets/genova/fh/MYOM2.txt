# MYOM2

## Overview
The MYOM2 gene encodes myomesin 2, a structural protein that plays a critical role in the organization and function of muscle cells. Myomesin 2 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and fast skeletal muscles, where it is integral to the M-band of the sarcomere, the contractile unit of muscle fibers. As a member of the myomesin family, myomesin 2 is involved in maintaining the mechanical stability of muscle cells by cross-linking thick filaments and interacting with other sarcomeric proteins such as titin and myosin. This protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, which includes immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, contributing to its elastic properties and ability to withstand mechanical stress. Additionally, myomesin 2 is implicated in signaling pathways essential for muscle contraction and cardiac function, highlighting its multifaceted role in muscle physiology (Lamber2022The; Lange2020The).

## Structure
Myomesin-2, encoded by the MYOM2 gene, is a protein primarily expressed in cardiac and fast skeletal muscles. It is a member of the myomesin family and plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of the M-band in muscle fibers. The protein consists of 13 distinct domains, including a unique N-terminal domain, two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, five fibronectin type III (Fn) domains, and five additional Ig domains (Lamber2022The). The C-terminal region of myomesin-2 comprises five Ig domains, similar to myomesin-1, but no dimerization has been observed in domain Mp13, suggesting a unique interaction or auto-inhibitory mechanism (Lamber2022The).

The structural analysis of myomesin-2 reveals a tail-to-tail filament structure with a zigzag-type arrangement and a superhelical coil towards the ends. The Ig domains are connected by α-helices, forming a conserved Ig domain/helix interface, known as the 'IgH' segment, which is unique to myomesin (Pinotsis2012Superhelical). Myomesin-2 interacts with myosin through the Ig domains Mp2-Mp3, and this interaction can be modulated by phosphorylation (Lamber2022The). The protein's elastic properties contribute to muscle elasticity, allowing it to stretch and return to its original state (Pinotsis2012Superhelical).

## Function
Myomesin 2, encoded by the MYOM2 gene, is a crucial structural protein in the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle cells. It is primarily expressed in cardiac and fast skeletal muscles, where it plays a significant role in maintaining muscle integrity and function (Lamber2022The; Lange2020The). Myomesin 2 is localized at the M-band of the sarcomere, where it contributes to the mechanical stability of the muscle by cross-linking thick filaments, such as myosin, and interacting with titin (Obermann1996The; Lange2020The). This structural role is essential for the proper alignment and centering of the A-band during muscle contraction and relaxation, acting as a shock absorber to manage force imbalances (Lamber2022The; Lange2020The).

In addition to its structural functions, myomesin 2 is involved in signaling pathways that are crucial for muscle contraction and cardiac health. It interacts with proteins like the ryanodine receptor, which is important for calcium release in muscle cells, indicating a role in calcium signaling pathways (Lamber2022The). These interactions are vital for muscle contraction and the overall stability and function of the sarcomere in healthy human cells (Lamber2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYOM2 gene have been associated with various cardiac conditions. In consanguineous Turkish families, homozygous variants of MYOM2 have been linked to arthrogryposis and cardiac abnormalities, suggesting a potential role in these conditions (Lamber2022The). A specific MYOM2 missense variant, p.Ser207Arg, may affect sarcomere integrity by disrupting the myosin-myomesin-2 assembly, potentially leading to cardiomyopathy or ventricular fibrillation (Lamber2022The). Another rare MYOM2 variant, p.Asp921Asn, was reported in a patient with sudden cardiac death, indicating its possible involvement in severe cardiac events (Lamber2022The).

In a Chinese family, a novel heterozygous missense variant in MYOM2, c.3097C>T, was identified in individuals with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect. This variant was found in affected twins and their unaffected father, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The variant is rare in East Asian populations and predicted to be deleterious, highlighting its potential role in TOF (Wang2022Case). These findings underscore the importance of MYOM2 in cardiac development and its potential contribution to congenital heart defects. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which MYOM2 mutations contribute to these conditions.

## Interactions
Myomesin-2 (MYOM2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for muscle function. It interacts with myosin at the N-terminus through the Ig domains Mp2-Mp3, which are highly conserved with myomesin-1's My2-My3 domains. This interaction is concentration-dependent and can be disrupted by phosphorylation on Ser76 (Lamber2022The). Myomesin-2 also interacts with MM-CK through the domains Mp6-Mp8, although with different binding affinity compared to myomesin-1 (Lamber2022The). 

In skeletal muscle, myomesin-2 is part of the dysferlin complex, interacting directly with dysferlin, as confirmed by FLIM-FRET analysis (Flix2013Dysferlin). This interaction is significant, with a lifetime average decay of 3.68% (p < 0.05), indicating a direct interaction (Flix2013Dysferlin). Myomesin-2 is also hypothesized to interact with an unknown protein in the M-band, as it does not interact with obscurin, unlike myomesin-1 (Lamber2022The). 

The interactions of myomesin-2 with other proteins, such as titin, remain unclear. While earlier studies suggested a general interaction, later research indicated that the myomesin-2 domains Mp4-Mp8 do not associate with myofibrils, suggesting that if myomesin-2 binds to titin, it does not do so through these central domains (Lamber2022The).
