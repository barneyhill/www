# HS3ST5

## Overview
HS3ST5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 5, which is a sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS). This enzyme is responsible for the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues, a critical modification in the formation of anticoagulant-active HS domains that interact with antithrombin-III, thereby playing a significant role in blood coagulation regulation (Denys2019The; Hellec2018Thea). The enzyme is characterized by its broad substrate specificity and is active within the Golgi apparatus, where it influences cell signaling and interactions with various biomolecules (Meneghetti2020Heparan). HS3ST5's activity is essential for numerous biological processes, including angiogenesis and cell proliferation, and its expression has been linked to the pathology of colorectal cancer, where it is notably downregulated (FernándezVega2015Heparan; Crespo2018Heparan).

## Structure


## Function
HS3ST5 encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 5, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) by catalyzing the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues. This modification is the final step in the classic biosynthetic pathway of HS chains and is essential for the generation of anticoagulant-active HS domains that bind antithrombin-III, contributing to the regulation of blood coagulation (Denys2019The; Hellec2018Thea). HS3ST5 exhibits broad substrate specificity, transferring sulfate groups to glucosamine linked to either glucuronic acid (GlcUA) or iduronic acid (IdoUA), regardless of 2-O-sulfation (Hellec2018Thea).

In healthy human cells, HS3ST5 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies HS chains, influencing cell signaling and interactions with growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components (Meneghetti2020Heparan). This activity is crucial for various biological processes, including angiogenesis and cell proliferation. The enzyme's dynamic localization within the cell, particularly its trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, is vital for its function in HS biosynthesis (Meneghetti2020Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
HS3ST5, or heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 5, is implicated in the pathology of colorectal cancer (CRC). In non-metastatic colorectal cancers, HS3ST5 is significantly downregulated, with transcript levels reduced by over 90% in 80% of cases analyzed. This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathology, as alterations in HS3ST5 expression may affect the structure of heparan sulfate (HS) chains, influencing cancerous phenotypic changes (FernándezVega2015Heparan). The underexpression of HS3ST5 in non-metastatic right-sided colorectal cancers further supports its involvement in cancer progression (FernándezVega2015Heparan; Crespo2018Heparan).

While the specific implications of HS3ST5 alterations in other diseases are not fully understood, the gene is part of a group of tissue-restricted sulfotransferases that are not essential for normal development but may influence susceptibility to pathological conditions (Ouidja2022Variability). Despite its potential significance, no specific diseases or conditions have been directly linked to HS3ST5 mutations or expression changes outside of cancer, according to the available literature (Ouidja2022Variability).
