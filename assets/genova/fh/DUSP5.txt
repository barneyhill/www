# DUSP5

## Overview
DUSP5 (dual specificity phosphatase 5) is a gene that encodes a nuclear phosphatase protein involved in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, specifically targeting extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2. As a member of the dual specificity phosphatase family, DUSP5 is characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues, which is crucial for its role in modulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Mandl2005Specific). The protein's structure includes a catalytic domain with a unique double arginine motif and a nuclear localization signal, facilitating its exclusive nuclear localization and function as a negative feedback regulator of ERK signaling (Jeong2006Crystal; Mandl2005Specific). DUSP5's activity and expression are tightly regulated, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and vascular anomalies, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Shin2013DownRegulation; Pramanik2009Dusp5).

## Structure
The DUSP5 protein is characterized by a compact structure consisting of a central twisted five-stranded beta sheet surrounded by six alpha helices, forming its catalytic domain (Jeong2006Crystal). The active site of DUSP5 includes a phosphate binding loop (P-loop) and an aspartate residue that functions as a general acid, which is typical of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (Jeong2006Crystal). DUSP5 forms dimers through a novel head-to-tail association, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, involving a central 10-stranded beta sheet (Jeong2006Crystal). This dimerization is reminiscent of antioxidant proteins like peroxiredoxin (Jeong2006Crystal).

The protein also features a unique double arginine motif that coordinates an extra sulfate ion near the active site, which may play a role in phosphothreonine binding or mRNA capping (Jeong2006Crystal). DUSP5's structure is sensitive to reducing environments, as indicated by increased phosphatase activity in the presence of DTT (Nayak2014Protein). The protein's molecular weight suggests dimerization in solution, with a hydrodynamic radius corresponding to a molecular weight of 132 kDa, despite the predicted monomeric weight of 42 kDa (Nayak2014Protein).

## Function
DUSP5 (dual specificity phosphatase 5) is a nuclear phosphatase that plays a critical role in the regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. DUSP5 specifically dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1 and ERK2, but not other MAP kinases such as JNK or p38, making it a highly selective ERK-specific phosphatase (Mandl2005Specific). This specificity allows DUSP5 to act as a classical negative feedback regulator of the ERK signaling pathway, as its expression is induced by ERK activity (Seternes2019Dualspecificity).

DUSP5 is localized exclusively in the nucleus, where it anchors inactive ERK2, preventing its translocation to the cytoplasm and further signaling (Mandl2005Specific). This nuclear sequestration is facilitated by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within DUSP5, which functions independently of its kinase interaction motif (KIM) (Mandl2005Specific). By maintaining ERK2 in the nucleus, DUSP5 contributes to the spatial-temporal regulation of MAP kinase signaling, which is crucial for various cellular responses, including growth factor and stress responses (Mandl2005Specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DUSP5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In gastric cancer, DUSP5 is often inactivated due to promoter CpG island hypermethylation, leading to its transcriptional silencing. This inactivation correlates with increased ERK signaling and cell proliferation, contributing to cancer progression and poor prognosis (Shin2013DownRegulation). In basal-like breast cancer, low DUSP5 expression is associated with paclitaxel resistance and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Liu2018The).

In skin cancer, the loss of DUSP5 results in increased nuclear phospho-ERK levels and upregulation of SerpinB2, a gene linked to carcinogenesis. This loss enhances tumor multiplicity, indicating DUSP5's role in suppressing oncogenic signaling (Rushworth2014Dualspecificity). In BRAF V600E-driven cancers, DUSP5 expression is retained or elevated, suggesting its involvement in maintaining ERK activity within a range that prevents tumor suppression (Kidger2017Dualspecificity).

Mutations in DUSP5, such as the S147P mutation, have been identified in vascular anomalies, indicating a potential role in these conditions. These mutations may disrupt the MAPK pathway, affecting vascular development and function (Pramanik2009Dusp5).

## Interactions
DUSP5 interacts specifically with the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2. This interaction is highly selective, as DUSP5 does not significantly interact with other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as JNK and p38 (Talipov2016Critical; Mandl2005Specific). The interaction with ERK2 is direct and involves a functional kinase interaction motif (KIM) within the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of DUSP5. This motif includes conserved arginine residues essential for MAP kinase recognition, and mutations in these residues abolish the ability of DUSP5 to interact with ERK2 (Mandl2005Specific).

DUSP5's interaction with ERK2 is crucial for its role in dephosphorylating ERK, thereby regulating the MAPK signaling pathway. The phosphatase domain of DUSP5 contains a highly conserved HCXXGXXRS motif, where the cysteine acts as an enzymatic nucleophile, facilitating the dephosphorylation process (Talipov2016Critical). The interaction with ERK2 also stabilizes DUSP5, increasing its half-life by reducing ubiquitination through steric hindrance (Kucharska2009Regulation). This stabilization is unique to ERK2, as other kinases like p38 or JNK do not have the same effect.
