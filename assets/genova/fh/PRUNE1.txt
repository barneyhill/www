# PRUNE1

## Overview
PRUNE1 is a gene that encodes the protein prune exopolyphosphatase 1, a member of the DHH phosphoesterase superfamily. This protein is characterized by its exopolyphosphatase activity, which involves the breakdown of polyphosphates into inorganic phosphate, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and energy regulation (Scoma2023Human). PRUNE1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the central nervous system during fetal development, indicating its importance in neurodevelopment (Nistala2020NMIHBA). The protein is involved in several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and is particularly significant in enhancing microtubule polymerization, essential for neuronal proliferation and migration (Zollo2017PRUNE). PRUNE1's interactions with other proteins, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β and β-tubulin, further underscore its role in neurodevelopment and cellular signaling pathways (Nistala2020NMIHBA). Additionally, mutations in the PRUNE1 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Bibbò2021Functional; Nistala2020NMIHBA).

## Structure
The PRUNE1 protein is a member of the DHH (Asp-His-His) superfamily, characterized by a conserved N-terminal DHH domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes four highly conserved motifs with five invariant aspartates and two conserved histidine residues, although in PRUNE1, one histidine is replaced by arginine (R128) (Nistala2020Functional). These conserved residues are crucial for binding divalent cations necessary for catalytic activity and forming a charge-relay system (Nistala2020Functional).

The secondary and tertiary structures of PRUNE1 have been analyzed using circular dichroism spectroscopy, revealing differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins, indicating changes in alpha-helical content and tertiary structure due to mutations (Nistala2020NMIHBA; Nistala2020Functional). These structural changes are associated with a loss of function, particularly affecting substrate binding and catalytic activity (Nistala2020NMIHBA).

PRUNE1 is ubiquitously expressed across multiple tissues, with significant expression in the central nervous system during fetal development, suggesting its role in neurodevelopment (Nistala2020NMIHBA). The protein's structure and function are critical for its role in cellular processes, including cell proliferation and migration (Nistala2020Functional).

## Function
The PRUNE1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the DHH phosphoesterase superfamily, which plays a significant role in cell motility and proliferation. In healthy human cells, PRUNE1 is involved in crucial cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. It is particularly important for normal brain development, as it enhances microtubule polymerization, which is essential for neuronal proliferation and migration (Zollo2017PRUNE). PRUNE1 interacts with microtubules and promotes their polymerization, a critical function during cell division (Zollo2017PRUNE).

PRUNE1 also exhibits exopolyphosphatase activity, breaking down polyphosphates into inorganic phosphate, which is important for cellular metabolism and energy regulation (Scoma2023Human). This activity is linked to its role in maintaining polyphosphate homeostasis and influencing ATP synthase activity, thereby affecting cellular energy levels (Scoma2023Human). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in signal transduction pathways that influence cell migration and development (Nistala2020NMIHBA). PRUNE1's interactions with proteins like glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-tubulin further underscore its role in neurodevelopment and cellular processes (Nistala2020NMIHBA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRUNE1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. One such condition is Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, hypotonia, and variable brain anomalies (NMIHBA), which is caused by biallelic variants in PRUNE1. This disorder is characterized by global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, progressive cortical atrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia, and delayed myelination (Nistala2020NMIHBA). Specific mutations, such as missense and nonsense mutations, result in a loss of exopolyphosphatase activity, which is crucial for normal PRUNE1 function (Nistala2020NMIHBA).

PRUNE1 mutations also lead to a rare childhood neurodegenerative disease in Manitoba Cree families, characterized by cerebellar atrophy, axon degeneration, and APP-immunoreactive inclusions in brainstem neurons. Clinical features include seizures, spasticity, developmental delay, and respiratory insufficiency (Hartley2018A). In some cases, PRUNE1 mutations result in a neurodevelopmental syndrome with prominent dystonia, as observed in two consanguineous Sudanese families (Koko2021An).

Alterations in PRUNE1 expression are linked to cancer progression, particularly in medulloblastoma, where high expression levels are associated with metastasis and poor prognosis (Bibbò2021Functional). These findings highlight the significant role of PRUNE1 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and oncogenesis.

## Interactions
PRUNE1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to cancer metastasis. It forms a complex with NME1 (also known as NDPK-A), a metastasis suppressor, which is crucial for regulating cell migration and proliferation. This interaction is mediated by phosphorylated regions of NME1 and is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cell physiology (Ferrucci2018A). PRUNE1 also interacts with NM23-H1, another metastasis suppressor, enhancing its phosphodiesterase activity, which promotes cancer cell motility and metastasis (D’Angelo2004Prune).

PRUNE1 is involved in microtubule dynamics by interacting with alpha- and beta-tubulins, which is significant for cell division and neural development (Ferrucci2024PRUNE1). It also associates with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β), influencing pathways like Wnt signaling (Tammenkoski2008Human). Additionally, PRUNE1 has been shown to interact with nucleic acids, impacting RNA processing and stability, although specific details of these interactions are less well-documented in the provided context. These interactions highlight PRUNE1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
