# SRSF8

## Overview
SRSF8, or serine and arginine rich splicing factor 8, is a gene that encodes a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, which is integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. The protein encoded by SRSF8, also referred to as SRp46, is characterized by RNA recognition motifs and a C-terminal RS domain, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions and nuclear localization. As a splicing factor, SRSF8 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, contributing to mRNA diversity and gene expression regulation. It is functionally distinct from other SR proteins, such as SRSF2, and plays a role in various aspects of mRNA processing, including transcription, export, translation, and decay. SRSF8 has been implicated in cancer-related processes, with altered expression observed in certain cancers, although its role as a prognostic marker remains limited (Wang2023Systematic; Wegener2019View; Howard2014The).

## Function
SRSF8, also known as SRp46, is a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, which plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing and other cellular processes. These proteins are characterized by RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal RS domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions and nuclear localization (Wegener2019View). SRSF8 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process that contributes to mRNA diversity and gene expression regulation. While SR proteins generally act redundantly in constitutive splicing, they have specific roles in regulating alternative exons and post-splicing steps (Wegener2019View).

SRSF8 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in spliceosome assembly and splicing regulation, impacting cellular processes and organismal development. Although the specific functions of SRSF8 in healthy human cells are not detailed extensively, it is known to be functionally distinct from SRSF2, despite being encoded by a functional SRSF2 pseudogene (Wegener2019View). The SR protein family, including SRSF8, is involved in various aspects of mRNA processing, such as transcription, export, translation, and decay, highlighting their multifaceted roles in gene expression (Howard2014The).

## Clinical Significance
SRSF8, a member of the serine-arginine rich splicing factor family, has been implicated in various cancer-related processes due to its altered expression levels. In Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), SRSF8 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and tumorigenesis (Wang2023Systematic). However, its expression does not significantly correlate with overall survival in DLBCL patients, indicating that while it may be involved in tumor biology, it is not a strong prognostic marker for this disease (Wang2023Systematic).

In oral cancer, SRSF8 is upregulated in early cancer stages compared to controls, but it does not show significant differential expression across different stages of cancer progression (Sharma2023Differential). This suggests that while SRSF8 may play a role in the initial stages of oral cancer, its expression does not continue to increase as the disease progresses.

The dysregulation of SRSF8 and other SR proteins is linked to tumorigenesis through their roles in RNA splicing and other RNA-processing mechanisms, which are crucial for maintaining genome stability and proper gene expression (Wan2022SR).
