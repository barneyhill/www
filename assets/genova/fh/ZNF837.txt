# ZNF837

## Overview
ZNF837 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 837, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. The specific functions and interactions of zinc finger protein 837 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in various cellular processes through its potential role as a transcription factor. Further research is needed to understand its precise biological functions and implications in human health and disease.
