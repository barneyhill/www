# ZRSR2

## Overview
The ZRSR2 gene encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2 protein, which is a critical component of the U12-dependent spliceosome. This protein is primarily involved in the splicing of U12-type introns, a minor class of introns that play significant roles in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and RNA processing. ZRSR2 is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities and its interactions with other spliceosomal components, such as U12 snRNA and the U2AF heterodimer, facilitating the precise excision of U12-type introns from pre-mRNA. The protein's function is essential for maintaining normal cellular activities and development, as it ensures the correct splicing of genes involved in vital cellular pathways (Madan2015Aberrant; Kwon2023Global). Mutations in the ZRSR2 gene are associated with hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (Madan2015Aberrant; Togami2021SexBiasedZRSR2Mutations).

## Function
The ZRSR2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the splicing of U12-type introns, a minor class of introns in human cells. This protein is an essential component of the U12-dependent spliceosome, which is responsible for recognizing and excising U12-type introns from pre-mRNA. These introns, although less common than U2-type introns, are involved in critical cellular functions such as DNA replication, RNA processing, DNA repair, and translation (Madan2015Aberrant; Kwon2023Global).

In healthy human cells, ZRSR2 ensures the proper splicing of U12-type introns by binding specifically to U12 snRNA and U12-type introns, facilitating the recognition of the 3' splice site and the second catalytic step of splicing (Kwon2023Global). The protein's activity is confined to the nucleus, where it interacts with components of the pre-spliceosome assembly, including the U2AF2/U2AF1 heterodimer and SRSF2 (Madan2015Aberrant).

ZRSR2's function is critical for maintaining normal cellular processes and development. Its proper activity ensures the correct splicing of U12-type introns, which is vital for the expression of genes involved in essential cellular pathways (Madan2015Aberrant). The gene's role is specific to U12-type introns, as U2-type intron splicing remains largely unaffected by its absence (Kwon2023Global).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZRSR2 gene are implicated in several hematological malignancies, most notably myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These mutations often result in aberrant splicing, particularly affecting U12-type introns, which is a hallmark of ZRSR2 mutant MDS. This splicing defect leads to intron retention and mis-splicing events that disrupt normal hematopoiesis (Madan2015Aberrant). ZRSR2 mutations are predominantly found in males due to its location on the X chromosome, and they are associated with a loss of function, often resulting in inactivating mutations such as nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations (Togami2021SexBiasedZRSR2Mutations).

In addition to MDS, ZRSR2 mutations have been reported in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). In BPDCN, these mutations impair the activation and apoptosis of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, contributing to leukemic transformation by altering immune responses and providing protection from apoptosis (GarciaRuiz2022Concurrent; Togami2021SexBiasedZRSR2Mutations). The concurrent mutation of ZRSR2 and loss of TET2 in mice has been shown to promote MDS, characterized by cytopenias, splenomegaly, and multi-lineage dysplasia, suggesting a synergistic effect in disease progression (GarciaRuiz2022Concurrent).

## Interactions
ZRSR2 is a protein involved in RNA splicing, primarily interacting with U12 snRNA and U12-type introns. It binds predominantly to U12 snRNA at the stem-loop structure downstream of the Sm-binding site, which accounts for a significant portion of the recovered U12 RNA sequences (Kwon2023Global). ZRSR2 also copurifies with the 18S U11-U12 di-snRNP, suggesting it may contact the 5' splice site of U12-type introns (Kwon2023Global). 

ZRSR2 is structurally related to U2AF1 and is associated with the U2AF heterodimer in nuclear extracts, indicating it might be part of a larger U2AF complex. However, its role is distinct as it is not included in the cryo-EM structure of the human U2-type spliceosome and primarily affects U12-type intron splicing (Kwon2023Global). 

ZRSR2 is identified as having a U2AF homology motif (UHM), which is a protein-protein interaction motif. This motif is involved in interactions with other proteins, although specific interactions involving ZRSR2 are not detailed (Loerch2016Unmasking). The protein's interactions are crucial for recognizing and processing specific splice site configurations, particularly those lacking AG at critical positions (Kwon2023Global).
