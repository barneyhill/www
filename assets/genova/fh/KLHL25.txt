# KLHL25

## Overview
KLHL25 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 25, which is a part of the kelch-like family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as a substrate-specific adaptor within the CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, such as ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). The degradation of ACLY is significant for regulating lipid metabolism and maintaining cellular homeostasis, as well as for processes like tumor suppression and immune cell differentiation (Tian2021ACLY; Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25). Structurally, the protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs, which facilitate its interactions and functional roles (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). The activity of KLHL25 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other cellular components to regulate protein turnover and maintain cellular function (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

## Structure
KLHL25 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by specific structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein typically contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs. The BTB/POZ domain is involved in dimerization and interaction with other proteins, while the BACK domain acts as a linker. The Kelch motifs form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for substrate binding (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike).

KLHL25 functions as a substrate adaptor in the CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the interaction between CUL3 and its substrates, such as ACLY. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes like lipid metabolism and tumor suppression (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of KLHL25, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms can lead to structural and functional diversity, but specific isoforms of KLHL25 are not mentioned in the context (Shi2019Kelchlike).

## Function
KLHL25 is a protein that functions as a substrate-specific adaptor in the CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. This complex targets ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation, which is significant in regulating lipid metabolism and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25). In healthy human cells, KLHL25 helps control ACLY protein levels, thereby influencing lipid synthesis and connecting glucose metabolism with lipid synthesis (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

The CUL3-KLHL25 complex is also involved in the differentiation of inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of ACLY. This process is essential for the metabolic shift from fatty acid synthesis to fatty acid oxidation, which is necessary for iTreg differentiation and immune homeostasis (Tian2021ACLY). KLHL25's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other cellular components to regulate protein turnover and maintain cellular function (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL25 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. In the context of inflammatory diseases, alterations in the CUL3-KLHL25-ACLY axis have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and allergic diarrhea. The absence of CUL3 impairs the differentiation of induced regulatory T cells (iTreg), which can exacerbate colitis in mouse models. However, ACLY depletion can mitigate the effects of CUL3 deficiency, highlighting the importance of this axis in regulating iTreg function and alleviating colitis (Tian2021ACLY).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high expression levels of KLHL25 are linked to reduced overall survival and progression-free survival in patients. KLHL25 is involved in the ubiquitination process, which plays a significant role in NSCLC progression. The regulation of KLHL25 by tumor suppressor miRNAs and transcription factors like SP1 suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker in NSCLC (Giannos2021Identification).

KLHL25 is also part of the CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets ACLY for degradation. This complex is crucial in regulating lipid metabolism and tumor suppression, particularly in lung cancer, where decreased CUL3 expression correlates with poor prognosis due to increased ACLY levels (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

## Interactions
KLHL25 is a protein that functions as a substrate adaptor in the CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in lipid synthesis. KLHL25 directly interacts with ACLY, facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the CUL3 complex. This interaction is crucial for regulating ACLY levels, which impacts lipid synthesis and tumor progression in lung cancer cells (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

The CUL3-KLHL25 complex negatively regulates ACLY protein levels, and knockdown of KLHL25 disrupts the interaction between CUL3 and ACLY, highlighting KLHL25's essential role in this regulatory process (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25). The interaction between KLHL25 and ACLY is mediated through specific domains within ACLY, particularly at the C terminus, which are important for ACLY's activity (Zhang2016Cullin3–KLHL25).

In addition to its role in cancer, the CUL3-KLHL25 complex is involved in the reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism during the differentiation of inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells. This process involves the ubiquitination and degradation of ACLY, which is necessary for iTreg differentiation (Tian2021ACLY).
