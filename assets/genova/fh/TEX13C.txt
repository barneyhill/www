# TEX13C

## Overview
TEX13C is a gene that encodes the protein TEX13 family member C, which is part of the TEX13 gene family. This family is generally associated with testis-specific functions, although TEX13C has been implicated in broader biological processes, particularly in the context of cancer. The TEX13C protein has been identified as a 'missing protein' in the study of metastatic cancer, notably in melanoma, where it is part of a network involving key cancer-related proteins such as the estrogen receptor ESR1, SMAD3, TGFB1, and ERK/MAPK kinases. These interactions suggest that TEX13C may play a role in cell signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer progression (Sanchez2019Novel). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific functions and interactions of TEX13C, both in cancer and potentially in reproductive biology.

## Interactions
TEX13C, a member of the TEX13 gene family, has been identified as one of the 'missing proteins' in the context of metastatic cancer progression, specifically in melanoma metastases. The protein was found to be part of a relational network centered on key cancer-related hubs, including the estrogen receptor ESR1, SMAD3, TGFB1, and ERK/MAPK kinases. This suggests that TEX13C may interact with these proteins, which are involved in cell-to-cell signaling and cancer progression (Sanchez2019Novel).

While the specific interactions of TEX13C with nucleic acids or other proteins have not been fully elucidated, its involvement in a network with known cancer-related proteins indicates potential roles in signaling pathways that could influence cancer progression. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the specific role and interactions of TEX13C in melanoma (Sanchez2019Novel). 

The broader TEX13 family, to which TEX13C belongs, is typically involved in testis-specific functions, suggesting that TEX13C might also participate in interactions related to reproductive processes, although specific interactions in this context have not been detailed in the available literature.
