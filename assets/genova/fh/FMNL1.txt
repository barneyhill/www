# FMNL1

## Overview
FMNL1 (formin-like 1) is a gene that encodes a member of the formin family of proteins, which are integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The FMNL1 protein is characterized by its formin homology domains, FH1 and FH2, which facilitate actin filament elongation and are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell motility, polarization, and mechanotransduction (Kühn2015The; Kühn2014Formins). FMNL1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and plays a significant role in immune cell function, particularly in T lymphocytes, where it is involved in centrosome polarity and cytotoxic activation (Kühn2014Formins). The protein interacts with Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42, which regulate its activity and localization to the plasma membrane, thereby influencing actin dynamics (Kühn2014Formins). FMNL1's involvement in cancer progression, particularly in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other malignancies, underscores its clinical significance, as alterations in its expression are linked to tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis (Chen2018FMNL1; Zhang2020FMNL1).

## Structure
FMNL1, a member of the formin family, is involved in actin polymerization and is characterized by the presence of formin homology (FH) domains, specifically the FH1 and FH2 domains. The FH2 domain forms an anti-parallel, torus-shaped dimer that associates with the barbed end of actin filaments, facilitating their elongation. The FH1 domain, rich in proline, interacts with profilin-actin to accelerate actin filament elongation (Kühn2015The). FMNL1 also contains a GTPase-binding domain (GBD) and a Diaphanous-autoregulatory domain (DAD), which regulate its activity through an intramolecular interaction that is relieved upon binding of an active Rho-GTPase, such as Cdc42 (MORIYA2012Protein; Kühn2015The).

The FMNL1 protein can dimerize through a coiled coil segment, forming a structure that spans more than 15 nm in diameter. This dimerization exposes membrane interaction motifs that may aid in actin filament elongation at the leading edge of lamellipodia and filopodia (Kühn2015The). The FMNL1-Cdc42 complex forms an umbrella-shaped structure with dimensions of 153 Å in width and 210 Å in height (Kühn2015The). FMNL1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as N-myristoylation, which is crucial for its membrane localization and function (MORIYA2012Protein).

## Function
FMNL1 (formin-like 1) is a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is essential for actin filament polymerization, severing, and bundling. FMNL1 is involved in mechanotransduction and cell polarization, contributing to cell motility and migration, which are vital for immune cell function and tissue development (Kühn2014Formins).

In hematopoietic cells, FMNL1 is expressed in tissues such as the thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes. It is particularly important in T lymphocytes, where it is essential for centrosome polarity and the activation of cytotoxic T cells. FMNL1 localizes at the tip of filopodial structures during antigen recognition and is recruited to the phagocytotic cup, playing a role in Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Kühn2014Formins).

FMNL1 interacts with Rho GTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1, which recruit it to the plasma membrane. This interaction suggests a role in actin dynamics and cellular processes regulated by these GTPases. The protein's dimeric FH2 domain associates with the barbed end of actin filaments, elongating them in the presence of profilin and preventing capping protein binding (Kühn2014Formins).

## Clinical Significance
FMNL1 (formin-like 1) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high FMNL1 expression is associated with aggressive disease progression and poor prognosis. It promotes cell migration, invadopodia formation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing tumor invasiveness and metastasis. This upregulation is partly due to gene amplification and decreased levels of miR-16, a microRNA that negatively regulates FMNL1 (Chen2018FMNL1).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FMNL1 is upregulated and linked to advanced tumor stages and poor clinical outcomes. It promotes metastasis through the induction of CXCR2, mediated by the loss of GATA3, a transcription factor that suppresses metastasis (Zhang2020FMNL1).

FMNL1 is also overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), particularly in the mesenchymal subtype, where it predicts poor prognosis. It facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis through interactions with proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements (Higa2019Forminlike).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FMNL1 is upregulated, especially in cases with bone metastasis. Its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and invasion by suppressing the TGF-β1/SMADs signaling pathway, which is crucial for EMT (Yang2019FMNL1).

## Interactions
FMNL1 (formin-like 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with Rho family GTPases, such as Cdc42, which are crucial for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics. The interaction with Cdc42 involves specific contacts through the Rho-GTPase insert helix, which is essential for FMNL1 activation by releasing its autoinhibition (Kühn2015The).

FMNL1 also interacts with AHNAK1, a scaffold protein involved in calcium signaling and membrane plasticity. This interaction occurs between the N-terminal region of FMNL1 and the C-terminal region of AHNAK1, influencing calcium-dependent processes (Han2013Proteomic).

In hematopoietic cells, FMNL1 is part of a complex network involving proteins like ARHGAP4 and ARHGAP17, which are involved in GTPase signaling pathways. These interactions suggest a role in cytoskeleton organization and cell-type specific functions (Han2013Proteomic).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, FMNL1 interacts with Profilin2 and HDAC1, promoting the cytoplasmic accumulation of HDAC1 and enhancing MTA1 expression. This interaction is crucial for the aggressive behavior of these cancer cells (Chen2018FMNL1).
