# SUCLG1

## Overview
The SUCLG1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the enzyme succinate-CoA ligase, which is integral to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This enzyme is classified as a ligase, specifically involved in the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, a critical step in cellular energy production. The protein encoded by SUCLG1 forms a heterodimer with either SUCLA2 or SUCLG2, resulting in enzymes that are specific for ATP or GTP, respectively, and is essential for substrate-level phosphorylation within the mitochondria (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA; Rouzier2010The). Beyond its role in the TCA cycle, SUCLG1 is implicated in various metabolic pathways, including amino acid and fatty acid catabolism, and is crucial for mitochondrial DNA maintenance (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA). Mutations in SUCLG1 are linked to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, highlighting its significance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA; Molaei2020SUCLG1).

## Structure
The SUCLG1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the succinate-CoA ligase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the Krebs cycle. The primary structure of SUCLG1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. Notably, the CoA-ligase domain is a significant feature, with mutations in this region potentially affecting the protein's function (Rouzier2010The).

The secondary structure of SUCLG1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is critical for its interaction with other molecules. The protein's structure was modeled using the pig GTP-specific succinyl CoA synthetase as a template, highlighting the importance of residues 41 to 346 in its function (Rouzier2010The).

In terms of quaternary structure, SUCLG1 forms a heterodimer with either SUCLA2 or SUCLG2, resulting in ATP-specific or GTP-specific enzymes, respectively (Rouzier2010The). The protein's structure and function can be affected by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms, as confirmed in both patient and control fibroblasts (Rouzier2010The). These structural features are crucial for the enzyme's role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.

## Function
The SUCLG1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of succinate-CoA ligase (SUCL), a crucial enzyme in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, a key step in the TCA cycle that is coupled with the substrate-level phosphorylation of GDP or ADP to GTP or ATP, respectively (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA; Rouzier2010The). SUCLG1 is essential for the catalytic activity of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), facilitating energy production within the mitochondria (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA).

In healthy human cells, SUCLG1 is involved in various metabolic processes beyond the TCA cycle, including amino acid and fatty acid catabolism, ketone breakdown, and heme synthesis (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA). The enzyme's activity is also linked to lysine succinylation, a protein modification with metabolic and epigenetic implications, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, which is crucial for cellular function and integrity (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA). SUCLG1's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as skeletal muscle and the brain (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUCLG1 gene are associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by defects in oxidative metabolism. These mutations often result in severe clinical phenotypes, including metabolic encephalopathy, severe hypotonia, dystonia, sensorineural hearing impairment, delayed psychomotor development, and growth deficits. Patients with SUCLG1 mutations typically present with early-onset symptoms, often within the first months of life, and have a significantly reduced life expectancy, with many not surviving beyond infancy (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA; Molaei2020SUCLG1).

SUCLG1-related conditions are also marked by metabolic abnormalities such as lactic acidosis and elevated methylmalonic acid levels. Brain MRI findings often reveal hyperintensity lesions in the caudate nuclei and putamen, contributing to motor control issues (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA; DevauxBricout2014Aspect). The mutations can lead to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, characterized by reduced mtDNA mass and combined respiratory chain deficits (Rouzier2010The; Molaei2020SUCLG1).

The severity of the phenotype linked to SUCLG1 mutations may correlate with the residual amount of SUCLG1 protein, affecting the clinical presentation and progression of the disease (Rouzier2010The). Research indicates that SUCLG1 mutations can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to conditions like mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA).

## Interactions
The SUCLG1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the succinate-CoA ligase enzyme, which is involved in the citric acid cycle. SUCLG1 forms a heterodimeric complex with either SUCLA2 or SUCLG2, facilitating the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Molaei2020SUCLG1; Rouzier2010The).

In yeast, the human orthologs SUCLA2 and SUCLG1 are associated with the mitofilin protein Fcj1, suggesting a similar interaction in humans between IMMT (the human orthologue of yeast Fcj1) and the SUCLA2/SUCLG1 complex. This interaction may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders (Jin2015Yeast).

SUCLG1 also interacts with nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), which is essential for deoxyribonucleotide salvage. A lack of interaction with SUCL can lead to decreased NDPK activity, contributing to mitochondrial DNA depletion (Rouzier2010The).

In the context of renal cell carcinoma, SUCLG1 has been identified as a hub gene with decreased expression in cancerous tissues. Its overexpression in cell lines reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Chen2020Identifying). However, specific protein interactions involving SUCLG1 in this context are not detailed (Chen2020Identifying).
