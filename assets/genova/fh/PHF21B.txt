# PHF21B

## Overview
PHF21B is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 21B, a member of the epigenetic regulator family involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein functions as an epigenetic reader, recognizing specific histone modifications to influence gene expression. It plays a dual role in transcriptional activation and repression, with a particular affinity for histone H3 trimethylated lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a marker of active transcription (Chin2022The). PHF21B is crucial in neural development, particularly during the neurogenic phase of cortical development, where it regulates the transition of neural stem cells from proliferation to differentiation (Basu2020Phf21b). The protein's interactions with transcription factors and other epigenetic regulators underscore its importance in synaptic plasticity, social memory, and neuronal differentiation (Chin2022The). Clinically, PHF21B has been implicated in various conditions, including cancer, major depressive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Bertonha2014PHF21B; Wong2016The).

## Function
The PHF21B gene encodes a PHD finger protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. This protein functions as an epigenetic reader, interacting with specific histone modifications to modulate transcriptional activity. PHF21B is involved in both transcriptional activation and repression, with a preference for binding to histone H3 trimethylated lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a marker associated with active transcription (Chin2022The). It also interacts with the transcription factor CREB, facilitating the transcriptional activation of synaptic genes, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission (Chin2022The).

In the context of neural development, PHF21B is highly expressed during the neurogenic phase of cortical development, where it regulates the transition of neural stem cells from proliferation to differentiation. It achieves this by targeting regulatory regions of cell cycle-promoting genes, recruiting lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 and histone deacetylase HDAC2 to remove active chromatin marks, thereby repressing these genes and promoting neuronal differentiation (Basu2020Phf21b). This function is critical for proper brain development and is linked to the regulation of social memory and synaptic plasticity (Chin2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The PHF21B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), PHF21B is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene. Its overexpression reduces migratory and clonogenic abilities in cell lines, indicating a potential role in cancer suppression. Loss of the PHF21B gene has been observed in some HNSCC cases, suggesting a predisposition to cancer (Bertonha2014PHF21B).

In prostate cancer, PHF21B expression is significantly upregulated, correlating with disease progression and poor prognosis. High levels of PHF21B are associated with advanced tumor stages and reduced recurrence-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2017PHF21B).

PHF21B is also linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). Variants in the gene are associated with MDD, and alterations in its expression may affect stress response mechanisms. The gene's expression is significantly decreased in stress-resilient animal models, indicating a role in stress resilience (Wong2016The).

Mutations in the PHF21B locus have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including Phelan-McDermid syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in mental health conditions (Basu2020Phf21b).

## Interactions
PHF21B is known to interact with various proteins and histone modifications, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation. It interacts with histone markers such as H3K9ac, H3K9me2, and H3K36me3, which are associated with transcriptional activation and repression. PHF21B's interaction with these markers suggests its dual role in modulating transcriptional activity, depending on the specific histone modification it binds to (Chin2022The).

PHF21B also interacts with the transcription factor CREB and its phosphorylated form, p-CREB, which are involved in transcriptional activation. This interaction is crucial for synaptic plasticity and social memory, as evidenced by studies in mice (Chin2022The). In the context of neural stem cell differentiation, PHF21B forms complexes with epigenetic regulators such as histone deacetylase Hdac2 and lysine-specific demethylase Lsd1. These interactions facilitate the repression of cell cycle genes, promoting neuronal differentiation (Basu2020Phf21b).

Mass spectrometry analysis has identified numerous putative interactors of PHF21B, highlighting its involvement in complex protein-protein interaction networks essential for neural development (Basu2020Phf21b). These interactions underscore PHF21B's role as a critical mediator in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.
