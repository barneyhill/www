# FAM120B

## Overview
FAM120B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 120 member B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by FAM120B functions as a coactivator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor critical for regulating gene expression related to glucose and lipid metabolism (krysler2020applications). Additionally, FAM120B acts as a 5' exonuclease, contributing to the cellular response to inter-strand DNA cross-links through a Fanconi anemia-independent pathway (krysler2020applications). Beyond its nuclear roles, FAM120B is implicated in mitochondrial gene activation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function (krysler2020applications). The gene's expression and interactions have clinical significance, particularly in cancer and mitochondrial function, making it a subject of ongoing research (Song2022circFAM120B; Lamba2020DNA).

## Function
FAM120B, also known as CCPG/SAN1/PGCC1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes. It is localized in the nucleus and functions as a novel coactivator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (krysler2020applications). FAM120B also acts as a 5' exonuclease, playing a crucial role in the cellular response to inter-strand DNA cross-links (ICLs), which can impede replication and transcription. While ICLs are typically repaired by the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, FAM120B collaborates with the helicase Senataxin in an FA-independent pathway to confer resistance to these DNA lesions (krysler2020applications).

In addition to its nuclear functions, FAM120B is implicated in mitochondrial gene activation. Studies using FAM120B knockout (KO) clones in HEK293T cells have shown that the induction of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) levels by a specific peptide is abolished in the absence of FAM120B, indicating its role in facilitating mitochondrial gene expression (krysler2020applications). The detailed molecular interactions and functions of FAM120B in healthy human cells remain an area of active research.

## Clinical Significance
FAM120B has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), circFAM120B, a circular RNA derived from the FAM120B gene, is frequently downregulated. This downregulation is associated with larger tumor size and poorer prognosis in patients. CircFAM120B functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with the miR-661/PPM1L axis and the PKR/p38 MAPK/EMT pathway, inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Song2022circFAM120B).

In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FAM120B is among the genes that exhibit significant hypomethylation in patients with the t(8;21) cytogenetic subtype. This hypomethylation may be relevant to the disease's pathogenesis, although specific clinical implications of FAM120B mutations or expression changes in AML are not detailed (Lamba2020DNA).

Research also suggests that FAM120B may play a role in mitochondrial function, as studies using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing have shown that FAM120B knockout in HEK293T cells affects the induction of mitochondrial gene activation by a synthetic peptide (krysler2020applications).
