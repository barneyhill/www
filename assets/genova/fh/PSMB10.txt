# PSMB10

## Overview
PSMB10 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 10, a critical component of the immunoproteasome, which is a specialized form of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The immunoproteasome plays a vital role in the immune system by processing proteins for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, thus facilitating immune surveillance and response. The PSMB10 subunit, also known as MECL-1, is particularly responsive to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which enhances its expression and function in generating peptides for antigen presentation. This subunit is involved in regulating apoptosis and protecting against inflammatory stress, with its activity being modulated by cytokines. PSMB10 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular protein homeostasis and immune responses (Ferrington2012Immunoproteasomes; Lundh2017The; Ghannam2014Upregulation).

## Function
The PSMB10 gene encodes a subunit of the immunoproteasome, which is a specialized form of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. In healthy human cells, the immunoproteasome plays a crucial role in processing proteins for presentation by MHC class I molecules, thereby contributing to immune surveillance and the regulation of immune responses (Ferrington2012Immunoproteasomes; Ghannam2014Upregulation). The PSMB10 subunit, also known as MECL-1, is responsive to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which upregulates its expression and enhances the immunoproteasome's ability to generate peptides with hydrophobic C termini for antigen presentation (Ferrington2012Immunoproteasomes).

The immunoproteasome, including the PSMB10 subunit, is generally expressed at lower levels under basal conditions but can be upregulated by factors such as IFN-γ or environmental stressors. In immune cells, it is constitutively expressed at high levels (Ferrington2012Immunoproteasomes). The PSMB10 subunit is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and protection against inflammatory stress, as its activity is induced by cytokines, which also increase the proteasome's catalytic activities (Lundh2017The). This subunit is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular protein homeostasis and immune responses (Ferrington2012Immunoproteasomes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PSMB10 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. PSMB10 mutations are associated with proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS), a group of disorders characterized by systemic inflammation. Specific mutations, such as the homozygous c.41T>C (p.Phe14Ser) and frameshift mutation p.Cys83Leufs*123, have been identified in patients with PRAAS, leading to symptoms like recurrent skin lesions, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly (Sarrabay2020PSMB10; Papendorf2023Identification). These mutations can impair proteasome function, contributing to the disease phenotype (Papendorf2023Identification).

Altered expression of PSMB10 is also linked to various cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), higher PSMB10 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and poorer prognosis (Jiang2022Comprehensive). Conversely, in breast cancer, elevated PSMB10 expression is associated with improved survival outcomes, suggesting a protective role (Rouette2016Expression). In primary myelofibrosis, PSMB10 is upregulated in patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation, potentially contributing to disease pathology through enhanced antigen presentation and immune response (Di2020Immunoproteasome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PSMB10 in both inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.

## Interactions
PSMB10, a component of the immunoproteasome, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in antigen processing and immune response. It interacts with the non-structural protein NS3 of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and GST pulldown assays, and confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. PSMB10 and NS3 colocalize in the cytoplasm, and PSMB10 is suggested to degrade NS3 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, inhibiting CSFV replication (Deng2019Host).

PSMB10 is also part of the immunoproteasome complex, which includes other catalytic subunits like PSMB9. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PSMB10 shows differential behavior, suggesting a dysfunctional immunoproteasome, potentially due to an anomalous immune or inflammatory response (Arisi2015Time).

In proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes, PSMB10 variants such as p.Gly167Asp and p.Cys83Leufs*123 impair the incorporation of the mutant proteasome component into the 20S and/or 26S proteasome complexes, affecting proteasome assembly and function (Papendorf2023Identification). These interactions highlight PSMB10's role in both viral inhibition and immune system regulation.
