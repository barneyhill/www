# CLPB

## Overview
The CLPB gene encodes a mitochondrial protein known as ClpB family mitochondrial disaggregase, which is a member of the Hsp100/Clp ATPase family. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis by disaggregating and unfolding misfolded proteins within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. As a mitochondrial disaggregase, it is essential for cellular homeostasis and proper mitochondrial function, operating as a hexamer with ATPase activity (Wu2023Comprehensive; Cupo2024Decoding). The protein's structure is characterized by two ATP-binding AAA modules and a unique middle domain, which are vital for its chaperone activity and oligomerization (Kedzierska2003Structure). CLPB's interactions with various mitochondrial proteins, such as HAX1 and OPA1, further underscore its importance in mitochondrial function and cellular health (Wu2023Comprehensive). Mutations in the CLPB gene are linked to severe mitochondrial metabolic disorders, highlighting its critical role in preventing protein aggregation and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Cupo2024Decoding).

## Structure
The CLPB protein, also known as ClpB family mitochondrial disaggregase, is a member of the Hsp100/Clp ATPase family. It is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of CLPB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form two ATP-binding AAA modules, known as AAA1 and AAA2, and a unique middle domain (MD) (Kedzierska2003Structure). The secondary structure is rich in α-helices, particularly within the MD, which is crucial for the protein's chaperone activity and oligomerization (Kedzierska2003Structure).

The tertiary structure of CLPB involves the folding of these domains into a functional 3D shape, with the MD forming a stable α-helical coiled-coil architecture (Kedzierska2003Structure). The quaternary structure of CLPB is dynamic, with the protein forming oligomeric rings that can exhibit 6-fold or 7-fold symmetry, a common feature among AAA+ ATPases (Uchihashi2018Dynamic). These oligomeric forms are essential for its function in protein disaggregation, with ATP binding and hydrolysis driving structural changes necessary for its activity (Uchihashi2018Dynamic).

CLPB does not interact with the ClpP protease, distinguishing it from other family members like ClpA (Kim2000Heptameric). The protein's structure is also influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and stability. Splice variants of CLPB can lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its functional properties.

## Function
The CLPB gene encodes a protein that functions as a mitochondrial protein disaggregase, crucial for maintaining protein solubility within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) in human cells (Cupo2024Decoding). This protein, also known as Skd3, is part of the AAA+ ATPase family and operates as a hexamer, facilitating ATPase and disaggregase activities (Cupo2024Decoding). CLPB is involved in the disaggregation and unfolding of misfolded proteins, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis (Kanabus2015Bi‐allelic; Wu2023Comprehensive).

The protein's activity is regulated by the rhomboid protease PARL, which enhances its disaggregase function through cleavage, potentially in response to cellular stress (Cupo2024Decoding). CLPB interacts with various mitochondrial proteins, including HAX1, OPA1, and AGK, which are crucial for mitochondrial function (Wu2023Comprehensive). The ankyrin repeat domain (ANK) of CLPB is essential for its disaggregase activity and higher-order assembly, playing a direct role in substrate binding (Wu2023Comprehensive).

Mutations in the CLPB gene can lead to severe mitochondrial metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular health (Cupo2024Decoding). The protein's role in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis is critical for preventing protein aggregation and ensuring proper mitochondrial function (Cupo2024Decoding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLPB gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily characterized by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3MGA), cataracts, congenital neutropenia, and neurological disorders. These mutations can lead to a syndrome that includes intellectual disability, progressive brain atrophy, movement disorders, and early death (Wortmann2015CLPB). The phenotypic spectrum varies significantly, with some individuals experiencing mild symptoms such as cataracts and neutropenia, while others suffer from severe neurological impairments and hematological issues, including leukemia (Wortmann2015CLPB; Pronicka2017A).

The CLPB gene encodes a mitochondrial disaggregase involved in protein homeostasis. Mutations in this gene can disrupt its function, leading to the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates, which are thought to contribute to the development of cataracts and nephrocalcinosis (Kanabus2015Bi‐allelic). The gene's role in mitochondrial function is further highlighted by its association with mitochondrial disorders, where mutations can result in decreased respiratory chain enzyme activities, particularly in complexes I and III (Saunders2015CLPB). The clinical manifestations of CLPB mutations underscore its critical role in maintaining cellular and mitochondrial protein homeostasis.

## Interactions
The human gene CLPB, also known as Skd3, encodes a mitochondrial protein disaggregase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function. CLPB interacts with HAX1, an anti-apoptotic protein, where the ANK domain of CLPB is essential for binding. Specific residues, Y272 in CLPB and L130 in HAX1, facilitate this interaction, which is vital for maintaining HAX1 solubility and preventing its aggregation (Wu2023Comprehensive; Cupo2024Decoding). CLPB also interacts with proteins involved in apoptosis, such as PARL, OPA1, HTRA2, and SMAC/DIABLO, maintaining their solubility and function (Cupo2024Decoding).

CLPB forms ATP-dependent complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, potentially including homo-oligomers or hetero-complexes with other mitochondrial proteins like the prohibitin complex and MAVS (Thevarajan2020Human). The ANK domain of CLPB is crucial for substrate interaction, suggesting its role in chaperone activity and substrate selection (Cupo2024Decoding; Wu2023Comprehensive). CLPB's interactions are ATP-dependent, with ATP binding inducing structural changes that facilitate these interactions (Thevarajan2020Human). These interactions are essential for CLPB's role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, contributing to processes like mitochondrial cristae maintenance and antiviral innate immunity (Thevarajan2020Human).
