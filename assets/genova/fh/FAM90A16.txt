# FAM90A16

## Overview
FAM90A16 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A16. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although the specific functional role of FAM90A16 within this family remains to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by FAM90A16 is not currently categorized under any specific functional class such as kinases or receptors, indicating that its precise biological activities and interactions are still under investigation. Research into the gene and its protein product is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential involvement in various cellular pathways and its implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
