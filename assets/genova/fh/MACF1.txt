# MACF1

## Overview
The MACF1 gene encodes the microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1, a large cytoskeletal linker protein that plays a crucial role in cellular architecture and function. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal linker due to its ability to connect microtubules and actin filaments, facilitating various cellular processes such as cell migration, synaptic stabilization, and vesicular trafficking. MACF1 is involved in the regulation of the neuromuscular junction, cilium elongation, and the maintenance of the intestinal barrier, among other functions. The gene is located on human chromosome 1p32 and undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct domain structures and tissue-specific expression patterns. Mutations in MACF1 are associated with several clinical conditions, including spectraplakinopathy type I, neurodevelopmental disorders, and various cancers, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Hu2021MACF1; Cusseddu2021Strength; Kang2020Mutations).

## Structure
The MACF1 protein, encoded by the MACF1 gene on human chromosome 1p32, is a large cytoskeletal linker protein with a complex structure comprising multiple domains. The primary structure includes an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) with two calponin homology (CH) domains, CH1 and CH2, which are crucial for binding F-actin. However, not all isoforms contain both CH domains; for instance, MACF1a3 only has CH2, while MACF1-4 lacks CH domains entirely (Gong2001MACF1; Hu2016Isoforms).

The central region of MACF1 features a plakin domain and numerous spectrin repeats, forming a flexible, rod-like structure that links the actin and microtubule-binding domains. The spectrin repeats are characterized by α-helical structures, contributing to the protein's flexibility and ability to act as a spacer between functional domains (Cusseddu2021Strength; Gong2001MACF1).

The C-terminal domain includes two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs and a GAS2-related domain, which binds and stabilizes microtubules. The presence of a Ser-x-Ile-Pro (SxIP) motif allows binding to microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins like EB1 (Cusseddu2021Strength; Hu2016Isoforms).

MACF1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, such as MACF1a1, MACF1a2, MACF1a3, MACF1b, MACF1c, and MACF1-4, each with distinct domain structures and tissue-specific expression patterns (Gong2001MACF1; Hu2016Isoforms). The protein's ability to bind various partners, such as Rapsyn and Axin, is mediated through these structural features (Cusseddu2021Strength).

## Function
MACF1, or Microtubule Actin Crosslinking Factor 1, is a critical protein involved in various cellular processes by linking microtubules and actin filaments. It plays a significant role in stabilizing the neuromuscular junction by promoting the stabilization of acetylcholine receptors at the actin-rich postsynaptic membrane, which is essential for efficient synaptic transmission and muscle function (Oury2019MACF1). In ciliated cells, MACF1 connects microtubules with the basal body of the cilia, facilitating cilium elongation (Cusseddu2021Strength).

In the intestinal epithelium, MACF1 maintains the intestinal barrier by linking microtubules to ZO-1 positive tight junctions, influencing their dynamics (Cusseddu2021Strength). It is also involved in vesicular trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, crucial for axonal growth in neurons (Cusseddu2021Strength). MACF1 regulates cell migration by linking growing microtubule tips to focal adhesions and recruiting the Elmo/DOCK complex to activate RAC1, promoting actin polymerization necessary for membrane protrusion (Cusseddu2021Strength).

In osteoblasts, MACF1 regulates differentiation by sequestering transcriptional repressors in the cytoplasm, thereby promoting the expression of osteogenic genes (Hu2021MACF1). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MACF1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions. In humans, mutations in MACF1 have been linked to spectraplakinopathy type I, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by hypotonia, joint contracture, and developmental delay (Kang2020Mutations). Missense variants in the GAR domain of MACF1 are associated with severe phenotypes, including defects in neuronal migration and axon guidance, leading to brain malformations such as mild lissencephaly and poorly formed hippocampi (Dobyns2018MACF1).

MACF1 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Alterations in MACF1 expression can affect neuronal migration and synaptic function, contributing to these conditions (Salem2023Role; Moffat2017The). In Parkinson's disease, reduced MACF1 levels are linked to cytoskeletal dysregulation, increasing the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to neurodegeneration (Moffat2017The).

In neuromuscular disorders, MACF1 mutations can lead to congenital myasthenia, characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. These mutations affect synaptic differentiation and motor performance, highlighting MACF1's role in maintaining neuromuscular synapses (Oury2019MACF1). Additionally, aberrant MACF1 expression is associated with various cancers, including breast, colon, and lung cancer (Kang2020Mutations).

## Interactions
MACF1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In the Wnt signaling pathway, MACF1 associates with a complex containing Axin, β-catenin, GSK3β, and APC. It binds to a specific region of Axin, distinct from the binding sites for other proteins, suggesting that MACF1 does not interfere with their binding to Axin (Chen2006The). MACF1 is involved in the translocation of the Axin complex to the cell membrane upon Wnt stimulation, where it binds to LRP6, facilitating the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (Chen2006The).

In neuromuscular synapses, MACF1 coisolates with acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in a Rapsyn-dependent manner and recruits a microtubule network, including EB1 and MAP1b, as well as the actin-binding protein Vinculin, to the postsynaptic membrane. This recruitment is crucial for maintaining synaptic AChR density and promoting synapse growth (Oury2019MACF1).

MACF1 also interacts with other proteins through its spectrin repeats, including Talpid3 and MKKs in ciliated cells, and GolginA4 in vesicular trafficking, highlighting its role in stabilizing cellular structures and facilitating vesicular transport (Cusseddu2021Strength).
