# PRRG1

## Overview
The PRRG1 gene encodes the protein proline rich and Gla domain 1, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a proline-rich region and a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, which are indicative of its role in cellular signaling and interaction. The Gla domain is typically associated with proteins that require calcium binding for their function, suggesting that PRRG1 may play a role in calcium-mediated cellular processes. The precise biological functions of PRRG1 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
