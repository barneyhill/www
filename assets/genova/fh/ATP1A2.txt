# ATP1A2

## Overview
The ATP1A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane enzyme critical for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and cell volume regulation. The ATP1A2 protein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in astrocytes, where it is essential for regulating intracellular ion concentrations and signaling. As part of a heteromeric enzyme complex, the alpha-2 subunit is responsible for the catalytic activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, working in concert with beta and gamma subunits. Mutations in ATP1A2 are linked to several neurological disorders, including familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 and various forms of epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2021Functional; Bassi2004A; Vanmolkot2006Two).

## Structure
The ATP1A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a critical enzyme for maintaining cellular ion gradients. The protein's primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Sweadner2019Genotypestructurephenotype).

The tertiary structure of ATP1A2 involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure includes key domains such as the transmembrane domain, which spans the cell membrane, and the cytoplasmic ATP-binding domain, crucial for ATP hydrolysis (Sweadner2019Genotypestructurephenotype).

In terms of quaternary structure, ATP1A2 assembles with beta and gamma subunits to form a functional enzyme complex. This assembly is vital for its role in ion transport across the cell membrane (Sweadner2019Genotypestructurephenotype).

Common post-translational modifications of ATP1A2 include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity, and glycosylation, which may affect its stability and localization. The gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, potentially leading to proteins with different functional properties (Sweadner2019Genotypestructurephenotype).

## Function
The ATP1A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This enzyme is essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and regulation of cell volume (Fusco2003Haploinsufficiency; Bassi2004A). The Na+/K+ ATPase functions by actively transporting sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, consuming ATP in the process. This activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and providing the necessary conditions for secondary active transport (Li2021Functional).

In healthy human cells, the ATP1A2 protein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in astrocytes of the adult brain, where it plays a significant role in regulating intracellular ion concentrations and signaling (Li2021Functional). The alpha-2 subunit is part of a heteromeric enzyme complex that includes beta and gamma subunits, with the alpha subunit being responsible for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Bassi2004A). The proper functioning of this enzyme is critical for maintaining the electrochemical gradients necessary for cellular processes, such as electrical excitability in neurons and muscle cells (Li2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP1A2 gene, which encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, are associated with several neurological disorders. Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2) is a primary condition linked to ATP1A2 mutations, characterized by severe migraine attacks with aura and reversible motor weakness (Fusco2003Haploinsufficiency; Vanmolkot2006Two). Approximately 20% of FHM cases are attributed to ATP1A2 mutations, with specific mutations such as R593W and V628M identified as causative (Vanmolkot2006Two).

Beyond FHM2, ATP1A2 mutations are implicated in benign familial infantile convulsions, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, and various forms of epilepsy, including epileptic encephalopathy (Deprez2007Epilepsy; Vetro2021ATP1A2). These mutations can lead to a range of symptoms, including seizures, prolonged coma, and cerebellar signs like ataxia and nystagmus (Deprez2007Epilepsy; Vanmolkot2006Two).

The mutations often result in a loss of Na+/K+ pump function, leading to disrupted ion homeostasis and increased neuronal excitability, which contribute to the clinical manifestations of these disorders (Fusco2003Haploinsufficiency; Vetro2021ATP1A2). The phenotypic spectrum of ATP1A2 mutations is broad, with varying degrees of severity and symptom overlap among different conditions (Li2021Functional).

## Interactions
ATP1A2, a subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase enzyme, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining ion gradients across the plasma membrane. It interacts with the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit, which is essential for proper folding, assembly, and targeting of the enzyme complex (Friedrich2016ATP1A2). ATP1A2 also forms complexes with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX1, particularly in the context of Ca2+ signaling in the brain, suggesting a role in forming signaling complexes that include ryanodine receptors and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (Friedrich2016ATP1A2).

In the brain, ATP1A2 interacts with the cellular prion protein (PrP C), which may influence the electrochemical gradient controlled by Na+,K+-ATPases and affect signaling pathways. This interaction is well-validated, although the exact binding interface remains unclear (Williams2021The). PrP C expression has been shown to promote NKA activity, and its deficiency affects NKA activity, indicating a complex relationship that may involve both direct and indirect effects (Williams2021The).

These interactions highlight the role of ATP1A2 in various cellular processes, including ion homeostasis and signal transduction, which are critical for normal neuronal function and may be implicated in disease states such as migraine and prion diseases.
