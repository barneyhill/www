# HPCAL1

## Overview
HPCAL1, or hippocalcin-like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family, which plays a pivotal role in calcium ion binding and signal transduction within neurons. The protein, also referred to as HPCAL1, is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium binding, and a calcium-myristoyl switch that enables membrane association. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating critical cellular processes such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. HPCAL1's function as a calcium sensor allows it to modulate various calcium-dependent pathways, influencing the phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival (Burgoyne2007Neuronal; Zhang2019HPCAL1). Its involvement in pathways like Wnt/β-catenin underscores its significance in maintaining neuronal health and its potential implications in various cancers (Zhang2019HPCAL1).

## Structure
HPCAL1, also known as hippocalcin-like 1, is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of proteins. It features EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures (BURGOYNE2000The; rostamirad2010identification). The protein undergoes a calcium-myristoyl switch, a conformational change upon calcium binding that involves the protrusion of the myristoylated N-terminus, facilitating membrane association (Viviano2016Electrophoretic; BURGOYNE2000The). This myristoylation is a common post-translational modification in NCS proteins, enhancing their interaction with cellular membranes (Burgoyne2007Neuronal).

HPCAL1 is closely related to other proteins in the NCS family, such as VILIP-3, hippocalcin, and neurocalcin δ, sharing high sequence similarity (rostamirad2010identification). The protein is expressed in various neuronal cells, including retinal photoreceptors, where it plays a role in calcium modulation (Lilue2019Mouse; rostamirad2010identification). The exact quaternary structure of HPCAL1 is not detailed in the available context, but its interactions with other proteins, such as ANKRD33, suggest a role in complex cellular pathways (rostamirad2010identification).

## Function
HPCAL1, also known as hippocalcin like 1, is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family, which plays a crucial role in calcium ion binding and signal transduction in neurons. This protein is primarily active in the brain, where it is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (rostamirad2010identification). HPCAL1 functions as a calcium ion sensor, modulating the activity of calcium-dependent pathways. It influences the phosphorylation of proteins such as GSK3β and ERK, which are involved in cell proliferation pathways (Zhang2019HPCAL1).

In healthy human cells, HPCAL1 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it enhances β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation, crucial for cell proliferation (Zhang2019HPCAL1). The protein's activity is dependent on calcium ion concentration, and it acts as a downstream effector of calcium, modulating the expression of genes like c-Myc and CCND1, which are essential for cell cycle progression (Zhang2019HPCAL1). HPCAL1's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining neuronal function and survival, contributing to the overall health and functionality of the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HPCAL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), loss of HPCAL1 expression is associated with increased lipid biosynthesis and mTOR signaling, leading to enhanced tumorigenesis and poor clinical outcomes. HPCAL1 negatively regulates mTOR signaling, and its deficiency results in increased mTOR activation, which correlates with worse survival in HCC patients (Chen2022HippocalcinLike). In glioblastoma (GBM), HPCAL1 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This upregulation is linked to increased calcium ion concentration, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Zhang2019HPCAL1).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with bone metastasis, HPCAL1 expression is low in primary tumors but high in metastatic lesions, indicating a potential role in cancer progression through mitochondrial dysfunction (Wang2015Eight). Additionally, neonatal exposure to endocrine disruptors like estradiol and bisphenol A can alter HPCAL1 expression in the prostate gland, potentially increasing the risk of prostate carcinogenesis (Tang2012Neonatal). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HPCAL1 in cancer and suggest that its expression levels and interactions could serve as potential therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
HPCAL1, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the retina, HPCAL1 interacts with ANKRD33, a novel retinal protein, suggesting a role in calcium-dependent pathways specific to cone photoreceptors (rostamirad2010identification). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells (rostamirad2010identification).

In the context of liver cancer, HPCAL1 interacts with RUVBL1/2, proteins involved in mTOR signaling and lipid metabolism. This interaction occurs in a calcium-independent manner and negatively regulates mTOR signaling, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and tumor progression (Chen2022HippocalcinLike). The interaction with RUVBL1/2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and GST pulldown analysis (Chen2022HippocalcinLike).

HPCAL1 also plays a role in glioblastoma proliferation by interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It enhances the Wnt pathway by promoting β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation, which increases the expression of genes like c-Myc and CCND1 (Zhang2019HPCAL1). This interaction is crucial for glioblastoma cell proliferation and highlights HPCAL1's role in modulating key signaling pathways.
