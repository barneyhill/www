# COL4A4

## Overview
The COL4A4 gene encodes the collagen type IV alpha 4 chain, a crucial component of the type IV collagen family, which is integral to the structure and function of basement membranes in various tissues. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, forming part of the heterotrimeric complexes with other type IV collagen chains, such as alpha 3 and alpha 5, to create a network essential for the integrity of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney. The alpha 4 chain's role extends to facilitating cell adhesion, differentiation, and tissue development, thereby maintaining tissue architecture and function. Mutations in COL4A4 are linked to hereditary nephropathies, including Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy, underscoring its clinical significance in renal pathology (AbreuVelez2012Collagen; Voskarides2008COL4A3COL4A4Mutations; Leinonen1994Complete).

## Structure
The COL4A4 gene encodes the alpha 4 chain of type IV collagen, a key component of basement membranes. The primary structure of the COL4A4 protein includes a 1,690-amino acid polypeptide, consisting of a 38-residue signal peptide, a 1,421-residue collagenous domain, and a 231-residue noncollagenous (NC1) domain (Boye1998Determination; Leinonen1994Complete). The collagenous domain is characterized by Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, which are interrupted at 26 locations by noncollagenous sequences, providing flexibility (Leinonen1994Complete).

The secondary structure involves the formation of a triple helix, typical of collagen proteins, with the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats playing a crucial role in this configuration (Kamagata1992Isolation). The tertiary structure is defined by the folding of these helices, while the quaternary structure involves the assembly of the alpha 4 chain into heterotrimers with other type IV collagen chains, such as alpha 3 and alpha 5, forming a network essential for the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (Sand2016Type; Boye1998Determination).

Post-translational modifications include the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, which are common in collagen proteins and contribute to the stability of the triple helix (Sand2016Type). The NC1 domain is highly conserved and plays a critical role in the heterotrimerization and hexamer formation necessary for collagen IV network polymerization (Korstanje2014A).

## Function
The COL4A4 gene encodes the alpha 4 chain of type IV collagen, a critical component of basement membranes in various tissues. Type IV collagen is essential for the structural integrity and function of basement membranes, which support and separate cells in tissues such as the kidney, inner ear, and eye (AbreuVelez2012Collagen). The alpha 4 chain, along with other alpha chains, forms heterotrimers that create a complex network crucial for maintaining the structural framework of basement membranes and facilitating cell attachment (AbreuVelez2012Collagen; Mariyama1992The).

In healthy human cells, the alpha 4 chain of type IV collagen is involved in cell adhesion, differentiation, and tissue development, playing a vital role in maintaining tissue architecture and function (Kamagata1992Isolation). The NC1 domain of the alpha 4 chain is important for the specificity of protomer assembly and interaction, which are essential for the formation of the collagen superstructure (Mariyama1992The). This chain is particularly significant in the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney, where it contributes to the filtration function and structural integrity, and its absence is associated with Alport syndrome (Leinonen1994Complete).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL4A4 gene are associated with several hereditary nephropathies, most notably Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes, and can be inherited in autosomal recessive (ARAS) or autosomal dominant (ADAS) forms due to mutations in COL4A4. These mutations can lead to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from isolated hematuria to more severe symptoms such as chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Longo2002COL4A3COL4A4; Marcocci2009Autosomal). 

In ADAS, mutations in COL4A4 can cause a range of phenotypes, including microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure, with some patients also experiencing sensorineural hearing loss (Pescucci2004Autosomaldominant; Marcocci2009Autosomal). TBMN, often associated with heterozygous mutations in COL4A4, is characterized by persistent hematuria and thinning of the glomerular basement membrane, though it generally has a better renal prognosis compared to Alport syndrome (Imafuku2020How). The clinical variability and reduced penetrance of these conditions highlight the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and management (Pescucci2004Autosomaldominant).

## Interactions
The COL4A4 gene encodes the alpha 4 chain of type IV collagen, which is a crucial component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney. This protein interacts with the alpha 3 (COL4A3) and alpha 5 (COL4A5) chains to form a heterotrimeric structure, essential for the stability and function of the GBM. These interactions are critical for the proper assembly of the collagen network, which is necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the basement membrane (Voskarides2008COL4A3COL4A4Mutations).

Mutations in COL4A4 can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired formation of the α3α4α5(IV) trimers. This disruption is associated with conditions such as Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN), where the assembly of the collagen network is compromised, affecting the incorporation of other molecules like laminin into the GBM (Voskarides2008COL4A3COL4A4Mutations). In mouse models, mutations in Col4a4 result in abnormal collagen trimers that are secreted into the GBM at reduced levels, leading to characteristic lesions of Alport syndrome (Korstanje2014A). These findings highlight the importance of COL4A4 interactions in maintaining the functional integrity of basement membranes.
