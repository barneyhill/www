# CNTNAP3C

## Overview
CNTNAP3C is a gene that encodes the protein contactin-associated protein family member 3C, which is part of the neurexin superfamily. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the formation and maintenance of the nodes of Ranvier, which are critical for the rapid propagation of action potentials along myelinated axons. The CNTNAP3C gene is expressed in the nervous system and plays a role in neural development and synaptic function. Mutations or dysregulation of CNTNAP3C have been implicated in various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neural function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
