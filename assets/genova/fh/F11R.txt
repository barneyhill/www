# F11R

## Overview
The F11R gene encodes the Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly within epithelial and endothelial cells, by contributing to the integrity of tight junctions. JAM-A is characterized by its single transmembrane segment and extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate both homophilic and heterophilic interactions essential for cellular adhesion and signaling (CzubakProwizor2021The; Bonilha2020Targeting). The protein's cytoplasmic tail contains a PDZ-binding motif, linking it to various scaffold proteins and influencing intracellular signaling pathways (CzubakProwizor2021The). JAM-A is involved in numerous physiological processes, including the regulation of paracellular permeability, cell polarity, and migration, and plays a significant role in immune responses and inflammation (Hartmann2020Physiological; Laukoetter2007JAMA). Its dysregulation is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Fang2021Association; Azari2011Transcription).

## Structure
The F11R gene encodes the Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein structure includes a single transmembrane segment, a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and an extracellular N-terminal region with two immunoglobulin-like domains: a distal V-type Ig-like domain (D1) and a membrane-proximal C2-type Ig-like domain (D2) (CzubakProwizor2021The). The D1 domain is involved in homophilic binding, allowing JAM-A monomers to form dimers through cis interactions, which can then engage in trans interactions with other JAM-A dimers to facilitate cell-cell adhesion (Bonilha2020Targeting). The D2 domain is important for heterophilic interactions and contains an N-glycan that stabilizes homodimers (CzubakProwizor2021The).

The cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A contains a PDZ-binding motif, which links it to scaffold proteins like CD9, facilitating interactions with integrins such as β3 integrin (Bonilha2020Targeting). This tail also includes phosphorylation sites that participate in tight junction assembly, intracellular signaling, and cell polarity regulation (CzubakProwizor2021The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Azari2011Transcription).

## Function
The F11R gene encodes the Junctional Adhesion Molecule A (JAM-A), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and the integrity of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. JAM-A is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of paracellular permeability, cell polarity, and cell migration (Hartmann2020Physiological; Laukoetter2007JAMA). It interacts with multi-domain scaffolding proteins such as ZO-1, ZO-2, and Par3, which are essential for tight junction formation and function (Hartmann2020Physiological).

JAM-A is active at the apical region of intercellular junctions, where it participates in adhesive interactions crucial for processes like platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion (MartìnPadura1998Junctional; CzubakProwizor2021The). It also plays a role in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes, contributing to immune homeostasis and inflammation regulation (CzubakProwizor2021The). In the intestine, JAM-A is vital for maintaining the mucosal barrier, with its deficiency linked to increased intestinal permeability and inflammation (Hartmann2020Physiological).

JAM-A's function is regulated by its PDZ domain-binding motif, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, influencing intracellular signaling and cell polarity (CzubakProwizor2021The; Ebnet2017Junctional). These interactions are crucial for the assembly of signaling complexes at cell-cell contact sites, impacting cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Ebnet2017Junctional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the F11R gene, also known as Junctional Adhesion Molecule A (JAM-A), have been implicated in various diseases. In primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, F11R polymorphisms and reduced mRNA expression are associated with disease susceptibility and severity. The -436A/G polymorphism in the F11R gene promoter is linked to decreased susceptibility to SS, particularly in individuals negative for HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3, suggesting a protective role of the G allele (Fang2021Association).

In cancer, F11R/JAM-A expression is dysregulated across multiple types. Overexpression is observed in cervical adenocarcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and testicular cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target. Conversely, underexpression in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma is associated with increased cancer cell aggressiveness and poor prognosis (CzubakProwizor2021The).

In cardiovascular diseases, F11R plays a critical role in atherogenesis. Its expression is upregulated in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines, facilitating platelet adhesion and contributing to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Silencing F11R expression reduces platelet adhesion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in atherosclerosis (Azari2011Transcription).

## Interactions
The F11R protein, also known as Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. F11R participates in homophilic interactions, where it binds to other F11R molecules on adjacent cells, facilitating platelet adhesion to inflamed endothelial cells, a key step in atherogenesis (Babinska2014Development; Azari2011Transcription). It also engages in heterophilic interactions with proteins such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), afadin (AFDN), calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), and tight junction protein-1 (TJP1), which are involved in processes like tumor cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis (Antonio2020Halting; Bonilha2020Targeting).

F11R interacts with β1-integrin, influencing cell motility and migration, and is involved in signaling pathways such as Rap1 GTPase activation via AF-6 and PDZ-GEF2 proteins (CzubakProwizor2021The). These interactions are significant in cancer progression, where F11R expression levels can affect tumor recurrence and cell migration. The protein's cytoplasmic domains contain motifs that allow binding to scaffold proteins, facilitating interactions with integrins and influencing immune cell migration (Bonilha2020Targeting). These interactions highlight F11R's role in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases and cancer.
