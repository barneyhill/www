# MPI

## Overview
The MPI gene encodes the enzyme mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI), a zinc metalloenzyme that plays a critical role in the glycosylation pathway by catalyzing the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. This enzyme is essential for the synthesis of GDP-mannose, a precursor for lipid-linked oligosaccharides necessary for N-glycosylation of proteins, which affects protein stability, activity, and cellular localization (Sharma2014Mannose; Girard2020Long). The MPI protein is characterized by a cupin domain and a Rossmann fold, functioning as a monomer in the cytoplasm (Xiao2006Computational). Deficiencies in MPI activity can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (Sharma2014Mannose; Chu2012A).

## Structure
The human mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) protein is involved in the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. The primary structure of MPI consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MPI gene. The secondary structure of MPI includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a cupin domain characterized by a deep pocket (Xiao2006Computational). The tertiary structure of MPI is compact and globular, featuring a Rossmann fold, which is common in proteins that bind nucleotides (Xiao2006Computational). The protein functions as a monomer, indicating that it does not have a quaternary structure (Xiao2006Computational).

The MPI protein is a zinc metalloenzyme, with a zinc-binding site involving residues Gln 110, His 112, Glu 137, and His 276, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Xiao2006Computational). The enzyme's active site is located within a hydrophobic environment formed by residues such as Tyr 278 and Met 287, which are important for substrate binding and catalysis (Xiao2006Computational). Post-translational modifications of MPI may include phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The MPI gene encodes the enzyme mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI), which is crucial for the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate, a key step in the glycosylation pathway (Sharma2014Mannose; Girard2020Long). This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for the synthesis of GDP-mannose, a substrate necessary for the production of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) (Chu2012A). These LLOs are critical for the N-glycosylation of proteins, a process that influences protein stability, activity, and cellular localization (Sharma2014Mannose; Chu2012A).

In healthy human cells, MPI activity ensures the proper glycosylation of proteins, which is vital for normal cellular functions and organismal development (Girard2020Long). The enzyme's role in glycosylation is crucial for the modification of secretory proteins on asparagine residues, affecting their function and localization within the cell (Chu2012A). Deficiencies in MPI can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), characterized by multi-systemic diseases due to protein hypoglycosylation (Chu2012A). The majority of mannose used in glycosylation is derived from glucose through the action of MPI, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (Sharma2014Mannose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPI gene, which encodes the enzyme mannose phosphate isomerase, lead to a congenital disorder of glycosylation known as MPI-CDG or CDG-Ib. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the MPI enzyme, crucial for the N-glycosylation pathway, resulting in symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, hepatomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, and hypoglycemia (Girard2020Long; Lu2023Mannose). Patients with MPI-CDG often experience gastrointestinal and hepatic involvement, but typically do not exhibit intellectual disabilities or neurological impairments (Chu2012A; Lu2023Mannose).

The disorder is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the MPI gene, leading to impaired conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate, which is essential for proper protein glycosylation (Chu2012A; Girard2020Long). Common mutations include missense mutations and splice mutations, which result in reduced MPI activity and hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins (Schollen2000Genomic; Helander2014Asymptomatic).

MPI-CDG is treatable with oral mannose supplementation, which bypasses the metabolic block and improves glycosylation, alleviating most symptoms (Chu2012A; Mühlhausen2020Mannose). However, some complications, such as liver disease, may persist despite treatment (Girard2020Long). Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes (Lu2023Mannose).
