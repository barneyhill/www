# GPR89B

## Overview
GPR89B is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 89B, a transmembrane protein predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus. This receptor functions as a voltage-dependent anion channel, playing a critical role in maintaining the pH balance necessary for proper protein trafficking and processing within the Golgi (Dwivedi2019Genome; Wiktor2021Identification). Beyond its cellular homeostatic functions, GPR89B is implicated in neurodevelopment, particularly in the expansion of progenitor cell populations in the telencephalon, a region associated with higher cognitive functions (Soto2024Gene). The protein's interactions with nucleotide sugar transporters and chemokine receptors further suggest its involvement in glycosylation processes and potential roles in cancer biology (Gritsina2023Chemokine; Wiktor2021Identification).

## Function
GPR89B, or G protein-coupled receptor 89B, is a transmembrane protein primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a voltage-dependent anion channel. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the pH balance within the Golgi, which is essential for proper protein trafficking and processing (Dwivedi2019Genome; Wiktor2021Identification). The regulation of intracellular pH by GPR89B is vital for the Golgi's function in glycosylation, a process necessary for the modification and maturation of proteins (Wiktor2021Identification).

In addition to its role in cellular homeostasis, GPR89B is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. It is expressed in the telencephalon, a brain region associated with higher cognitive functions, and influences cell proliferation. Humanized GPR89B expression in model organisms has been shown to increase the likelihood of cells being progenitors, suggesting its involvement in expanding progenitor cell populations, which may contribute to the expansion of the human neocortex (Soto2024Gene). This gene's function in maintaining Golgi apparatus integrity and its potential role in brain development highlight its importance in both cellular and organismal contexts.

## Interactions
GPR89B, a Golgi-associated protein, has been identified to interact with several nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) from the SLC35A subfamily. Notably, it shows a strong interaction with SLC35A2GA and SLC35A4, as evidenced by a significant increase in luminescent signal in a split luciferase-based assay. In contrast, its interaction with SLC35A2ER or SLC35A3 is weaker, indicated by a smaller increase in luminescence (Wiktor2021Identification). GPR89B also co-immunoprecipitates with SLC35A2, suggesting a functional relationship that may be crucial for maintaining pH and ion homeostasis in the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for glycosylation processes (Wiktor2021Identification).

Additionally, GPR89B is mentioned as a Golgi-associated protein interacting with the chemokine receptor CXCR7, which is involved in promoting neuroendocrine prostate cancer growth through the activation of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). This interaction suggests a role for GPR89B in cell cycle progression and possibly in cancer biology (Gritsina2023Chemokine). These interactions highlight the potential involvement of GPR89B in various cellular processes, including glycosylation pathways and cancer progression.
