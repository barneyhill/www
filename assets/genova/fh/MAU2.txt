# MAU2

## Overview
The MAU2 gene encodes the MAU2 sister chromatid cohesion factor, a protein integral to the cohesin loading complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) array, which facilitates its interaction with NIPBL, another key component of the cohesin loader complex. The MAU2 protein plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation, thereby maintaining genomic stability. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is involved in various chromatin-associated processes. Mutations in the MAU2 gene have been linked to Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), underscoring its clinical significance in developmental disorders (Parenti2020MAU2; Seitan2006Metazoan).

## Structure
The MAU2 protein is a component of the kollerin complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and cohesin loading. Structurally, MAU2 contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) array that is essential for its interaction with NIPBL, another component of the complex. This TPR array envelops the N-terminus of NIPBL, facilitating the formation of a stable heterodimer necessary for the function of the kollerin complex (Parenti2018MAU2).

A specific in-frame deletion in MAU2, p.(Gln310_Ala316del), affects a helix within the TPR array, impairing its interaction with NIPBL. This deletion leads to a reduction in heterodimerization activity, as demonstrated by quantitative mammalian two-hybrid interaction assays (Parenti2018MAU2). The structural integrity of MAU2 is crucial for its interaction with NIPBL, which is important for sister chromatid cohesion (Parenti2018MAU2).

The MAU2 protein is also involved in the cohesin loading complex, which is essential for chromosome segregation and genome stability. The TPR repeats form a barrel-like superhelix, which is a prominent structural feature necessary for its function (Minina2017The).

## Function
The MAU2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in sister chromatid cohesion, a process essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. In healthy human cells, MAU2 forms a complex with NIPBL, known as the cohesin loader complex, which is crucial for loading cohesin onto chromatin. This process is vital for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion, ensuring proper chromosome segregation, and facilitating DNA repair and transcriptional regulation (Parenti2020MAU2; Seitan2006Metazoan).

MAU2 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins such as Delangin, suggesting its involvement in chromatin-associated processes (Seitan2006Metazoan). The interaction between MAU2 and NIPBL is necessary for the stability of both proteins, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to developmental disorders such as Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) (Parenti2020MAU2).

The MAU2 protein is also involved in the regulation of cell and axon migration, indicating its broader role in developmental processes beyond chromosome segregation (Seitan2006Metazoan). This highlights the importance of MAU2 in both cellular and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAU2 gene have been implicated in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a developmental disorder characterized by growth retardation, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. A specific in-frame deletion mutation in MAU2, resulting in the loss of seven amino acids (p.(Gln310_Ala316del)), has been identified in a patient with CdLS. This mutation impairs the interaction between MAU2 and NIPBL, another protein involved in the cohesin loading complex, leading to reduced stability and function of the complex. The impaired interaction is hypothesized to cause NIPBL instability and haploinsufficiency, contributing to the CdLS phenotype (Parenti2020MAU2).

The MAU2 gene is highly constrained against loss-of-function variations, as indicated by its high pLI and Z scores, supporting the pathogenicity of identified mutations (Parenti2018MAU2). The clinical features of patients with MAU2 mutations resemble those with NIPBL mutations, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism. The study of MAU2 mutations highlights their clinical significance in contributing to the pathogenesis of CdLS through their impact on the cohesin loading complex and subsequent cellular processes (Parenti2020MAU2).

## Interactions
MAU2, also known as the MAU2 sister chromatid cohesion factor, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for chromosomal cohesion and gene regulation. MAU2 forms a complex with NIPBL, which is crucial for loading cohesin onto chromatin, a process vital for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), where mutations in NIPBL can disrupt its binding with MAU2, leading to the syndrome's characteristic features (Braunholz2011Isolated).

In C. elegans, MAU-2 interacts with the transcription factor EOR-1 and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, suggesting a role in regulating chromatin states and gene expression during neuronal maturation. This interaction is proposed to alter chromatin structure at EOR-1 binding sites, facilitating gene expression programs necessary for neuronal development (Shinkai2018Regulation).

In Arabidopsis, the homolog of MAU2, AtSCC4, interacts with AtSCC2, forming a cohesin loading complex essential for chromosome segregation and genome stability. This interaction is crucial for cohesin loading onto chromatin, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of MAU2's function across species (Minina2017The).
