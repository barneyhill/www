# CDX4

## Overview
CDX4 is a gene that encodes the caudal type homeobox 4 protein, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and hematopoiesis. The CDX4 protein is categorized as a homeobox transcription factor, which plays a pivotal role in the formation of the posterior body axis and the development of hematopoietic cells. It is essential for the expression of Hoxa9, a gene critical for normal hematopoiesis, and interacts with the transcriptional coregulator menin to facilitate histone modifications necessary for gene expression (Yan2006Cdx4). Beyond its role in hematopoiesis, CDX4 is also involved in embryonic axial patterning and placental development, contributing to the ontogenesis of the placental labyrinth in murine models (van2006TheCdx4mutation). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in understanding developmental processes and the pathogenesis of certain leukemias, where its aberrant expression is associated with poor prognosis (Bei2014Regulation).

## Function
CDX4 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the posterior body axis and hematopoiesis. In hematopoietic cells, CDX4 is essential for the expression of Hoxa9, a gene crucial for normal hematopoiesis. CDX4, in cooperation with the transcriptional coregulator menin, binds to specific regulatory regions at the Hoxa9 locus, facilitating histone modifications necessary for gene expression (Yan2006Cdx4). 

CDX4 directly interacts with Hoxa9 regulatory elements, and its binding is enhanced by menin, which helps stabilize CDX4 on chromatin (Yan2006Cdx4). This interaction is crucial for the proper expression of multiple Hox genes, particularly during specific stages of hematopoiesis (Yan2006Cdx4). CDX4's role is not limited to hematopoiesis; it is also involved in embryonic axial patterning and placental development, as demonstrated in studies on mice, where it contributes to the ontogenesis of the placental labyrinth (van2006TheCdx4mutation). These functions highlight CDX4's importance in developmental processes and its potential implications in understanding gene regulation in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDX4 gene have been implicated in various forms of leukemia. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CDX4 transcription is aberrantly sustained due to mutations that activate Shp2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase. This aberrant transcription is associated with poor prognosis in AML, particularly in cases with MLL1 translocations or Flt3 mutations (Bei2014Regulation). Increased CDX4 expression is also correlated with the progression from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to AML, but not with progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (Bei2014Regulation).

In acute erythroid leukemia (AEL), CDX4 is expressed at significantly higher levels compared to other AML subtypes. Constitutive expression of CDX4 in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells leads to the development of AEL, characterized by increased erythroid cell formation and a block in erythroid differentiation (Thoene2019The). The gene's expression profile in leukemic mice resembles that of immature erythroid stages, suggesting that CDX4 plays a role in promoting oncogenic pathways and suppressing erythroid differentiation (Thoene2019The). The murine model of AEL induced by CDX4 provides insights into the genomic complexity of the disease, highlighting its potential role in early stages of AEL development (Thoene2019The).

## Interactions
CDX4 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It is known to bind specifically to the regulatory elements of the Hoxa9 gene, playing a crucial role in its expression in hematopoietic cells. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of menin, a transcriptional coregulator, which enhances CDX4's ability to access chromatin targets at the Hoxa9 locus. Menin is necessary for CDX4's chromatin binding, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Yan2006Cdx4).

CDX4 also interacts with HoxA9 and HoxA10 proteins, which modulate its transcriptional activity. HoxA9 represses CDX4 transcription by binding to the proximal cis element of the CDX4 promoter, while HoxA10 activates transcription by interacting with the distal cis element. These interactions are influenced by the phosphorylation state of the Hox proteins, which can be modulated by factors such as Shp2 and Jak2 (Bei2014Regulation).

In the context of leukemogenesis, CDX4 transcription is regulated by the Mll-Ell oncogene, which increases HoxA10-dependent CDX4 expression in myeloid progenitor cells. This regulation is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of sustained CDX4 expression in leukemias (Bei2014Regulation).
