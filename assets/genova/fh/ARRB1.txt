# ARRB1

## Overview
ARRB1 is a gene that encodes the protein arrestin beta 1, a member of the arrestin family of proteins, which are pivotal in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein that functions primarily as a scaffold, facilitating the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs, thereby modulating signal transduction pathways (Tomita2019βArrestin; Krieger2019Arrestinβ1). Beyond its canonical role in GPCR signaling, arrestin beta 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including circadian rhythm regulation, autophagy, and cellular stress responses (Tomita2019βArrestin; Liu2017Arrestins). The protein's ability to interact with multiple signaling molecules underscores its versatility and importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Alterations in ARRB1 expression or function have been linked to several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and major depressive disorder (Chappell2022The; Shu2020ARRB1Promoted; Zhang2020ARRB1).

## Structure
ARRB1 (arrestin beta 1) is a protein characterized by a two-domain structure consisting of N-terminal and C-terminal domains. These domains are primarily composed of anti-parallel β-strands linked by small loop regions, forming a cup-like shape (Wess2023β−Arrestins:; Shukla2020Structure). The protein's basal conformation is stabilized by intramolecular interactions known as the 'polar core' and the 'three-element interaction,' which involve charged and hydrophobic side chains from both domains and the C-terminus (Wess2023β−Arrestins:; Shukla2020Structure).

ARRB1 can exist in various states, including free monomers and oligomers, and can bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in different modes, leading to conformational changes that affect its interaction with other proteins (Wess2023β−Arrestins:). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its function in GPCR signaling (Wess2023β−Arrestins:). Structural studies have highlighted the importance of the C-domain in determining the conformational differences between ARRB1 and its isoform βarr2, which influence their functional roles in cellular signaling (Ghosh2019Conformational). Splice variant isoforms of ARRB1 may exist, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
ARRB1 (arrestin beta 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. It acts as a negative regulator by binding to agonist-occupied receptors, which uncouples the receptor from its cognate G proteins, leading to receptor internalization and attenuation of signaling (Tomita2019βArrestin). Beyond its role in GPCR signaling, ARRB1 functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules. It is involved in the crosstalk between thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors (TSHR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors (IGF1R), stabilizing their association and enabling receptor crosstalk, which is crucial for cellular signaling pathways (Krieger2019Arrestinβ1).

ARRB1 is also implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms, particularly in peripheral tissues. It is expressed in a circadian manner in the ciliary epithelium and saliva, reflecting the peripheral clock's rhythm and suggesting its potential as a circadian biomarker (Tomita2019βArrestin). In neuronal cells, ARRB1 is essential for activating autophagy, a process vital for cellular homeostasis and protection against amyloid beta-induced toxicity, highlighting its neuroprotective role (Liu2017Arrestins). ARRB1's diverse functions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ARRB1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), ARRB1 expression is reduced in both patient liver samples and mouse models. This reduction accelerates the development of steatohepatitis, leading to increased lipogenic gene expression and decreased β-oxidative gene expression, which exacerbates liver conditions such as steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation (Zhang2020ARRB1). 

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), ARRB1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is generally decreased in T-ALL cells, and its overexpression inhibits tumor progression by promoting NOTCH1 degradation. The oncomiR miR-223 targets ARRB1, leading to its downregulation, which contributes to the malignancy of T-ALL (Shu2020ARRB1Promoted).

In major depressive disorder (MDD), ARRB1 polymorphisms are associated with treatment response to antidepressants. Lower levels of ARRB1 mRNA and β-arrestin 1 protein have been observed in depression models and patients, with levels normalizing after treatment, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for antidepressant response (Chappell2022The; Chang2014Association).

## Interactions
ARRB1 (arrestin beta 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. In the context of liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, ARRB1 interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). ARRB1 binds to ASK1 in hepatocytes, inhibiting its activation by antagonizing TRAF6-mediated lysine 6-linked polyubiquitination. This interaction prevents the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as JNK1/2, p38, and NF-κB, which are involved in cell death and inflammation (Xu2020ARRB1).

ARRB1 also interacts with the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and the E3 ligase mahogunin ring finger 1 (MGRN1). MGRN1 acts as an E3-Ub ligase for ARRB1 in the presence of MC1R, facilitating its ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ARRB1 stability and function (Abrisqueta2018Human).

In lung cancer, ARRB1 enhances chemosensitivity by modulating the DNA damage response pathway. It interacts with proteins involved in this pathway, such as phosphorylated ATR, ATM, Chk1, Chk2, BRCA1, and NF-κB p65, influencing cellular responses to DNA damage (Shen2016ARRB1).
