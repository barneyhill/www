# ZNF721

## Overview
ZNF721 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 721, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 721 is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization and gene expression modulation. The gene's significance is underscored by its high mutation frequency in certain cancer types, such as Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma and Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, where it is thought to contribute to transcriptional dysregulation and cancer progression (Munro2018Two). The mutations often occur in critical positions within the zinc finger domains, affecting the protein's DNA-binding capabilities and potentially altering its regulatory functions (Munro2018Two).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF721 is implicated in several cancer types due to its high mutation frequency, particularly in Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) and Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas (COAD/READ). In UCEC, ZNF721 exhibits 17 mutations across 14 individuals, while in COAD/READ, it shows 11 mutations in 8 individuals (Munro2018Two). These mutations are concentrated in specific positions within the zinc finger domains, notably positions 9 and 11, which are critical for the structural integrity and function of these domains (Munro2018Two). The mutations at these positions can alter DNA-binding preferences, potentially leading to transcriptional dysregulation, which is a hallmark of cancer progression (Munro2018Two).

The study suggests that ZNF721, along with other zinc finger genes, is preferentially targeted in these cancers, indicating a significant role in cancer-related pathways. The mutations in ZNF721 are associated with transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization, processes that are often disrupted in cancer cells (Munro2018Two). While the specific diseases or conditions beyond these cancer types are not detailed, the high mutation rate and expression levels comparable to other cancer-relevant genes underscore its clinical significance in oncology (Munro2018Two).
