# MACIR

## Overview
The MACIR gene, also known as C5orf30, encodes the macrophage immunometabolism regulator protein, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of macrophage cell phenotype and immunometabolism. This protein is characterized as a disordered protein, lacking significant secondary structure, and is conserved across vertebrate species. Despite its disordered nature, MACIR contains a proline/tyrosine-nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) motif that facilitates its interaction with the nuclear transport receptor TNPO1, suggesting a role in nuclear transport processes. MACIR is involved in modulating immune responses, promoting anti-inflammatory functions, and facilitating wound healing and inflammation resolution. It is highly expressed in the synovium, particularly by fibroblasts and macrophages, where it acts as a negative regulator of tissue damage and inflammation. The protein's interactions with various signaling proteins, including 14-3-3 adapter protein isoforms, underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in autoimmune diseases and certain cancers (McGauran2020Resolving; McGauran2019The).

## Structure
The MACIR protein, encoded by the human gene MACIR, is a 206 amino acid protein that is predicted to be disordered, lacking significant α-helical or β-sheet content, which complicates traditional structure-function analysis (McGauran2020Resolving; McGauran2019The). Despite its disordered nature, MACIR contains a specific proline/tyrosine-nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) motif located at amino acid positions 98-117, which is crucial for its interaction with the nuclear transport receptor TNPO1 (McGauran2020Resolving; McGauran2019The). This interaction is significant for the protein's subcellular localization and function.

MACIR is involved in regulating macrophage cell phenotype and immunometabolism, with its activity modulated by transcriptional and post-translational modifications (McGauran2019The). Phosphorylation sites on MACIR have been confirmed through phosphopeptide mass spectrometry, and these sites are predicted to be within 14-3-3 binding motifs, indicating potential regulatory roles in cellular signaling pathways (McGauran2020Resolving). The protein is exclusively found in vertebrates and is highly conserved among vertebrate species, although it does not show homology to other known vertebrate proteins (McGauran2020Resolving).

## Function
The MACIR gene, also known as C5orf30, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating macrophage immunometabolism, which is essential for maintaining immune balance and tissue homeostasis. In healthy human cells, MACIR is involved in modulating macrophage cell phenotype, promoting anti-inflammatory functions, and facilitating wound healing and inflammation resolution (McGauran2019The). The protein achieves these roles through transcriptional and post-translational modifications, as well as protein turnover, which are vital for its regulatory functions (McGauran2019The).

MACIR is highly expressed in the synovium, particularly by fibroblasts and macrophages, where it acts as a negative regulator of tissue damage and inflammation (McGauran2020Resolving). The protein is a 206 amino acid disordered protein, lacking significant secondary structure, and is conserved across vertebrates (McGauran2020Resolving). Its interaction with the nuclear transport receptor TNPO1 via a PY-NLS motif suggests a role in nuclear transport processes, which may be significant in macrophage signaling (McGauran2019The). These interactions and localizations are crucial for its function in cellular processes, particularly in the context of macrophage biology and immunometabolism (McGauran2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The MACIR gene, previously known as C5orf30, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Alterations in MACIR expression are linked to the severity of RA, as it acts as a negative regulator of tissue damage and inflammation. In RA patients, MACIR is highly expressed in the synovium, primarily by fibroblasts and macrophages. Reduced expression of MACIR is an early event in RA pathogenesis and is negatively correlated with disease activity and TNF expression, contributing to increased joint inflammation and tissue damage (McGauran2020Resolving; McGauran2019The).

MACIR's role in regulating macrophage phenotype is crucial, with higher expression observed in M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages. Inhibition of MACIR expression impairs macrophage functions related to wound healing and inflammation resolution, highlighting its importance in immune response regulation (McGauran2020Resolving; McGauran2019The).

Additionally, MACIR is considered an unfavorable prognostic marker in liver and endometrial cancer. A CCNH: MACIR fusion gene has been identified in various cancers, suggesting its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (McGauran2019The). Understanding MACIR's interactions, particularly with the nuclear transport receptor TNPO1, may offer therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases like RA (McGauran2019The).

## Interactions
The MACIR protein, known as the macrophage immunometabolism regulator, engages in several significant protein interactions that are crucial for its function in immune response regulation. One of the primary interactions is with the nuclear transport receptor TNPO1, which binds to MACIR via a PY-NLS motif. This interaction is essential for the nuclear import of MACIR, influencing its subcellular localization and function in macrophage biology and inflammation regulation (McGauran2019The).

MACIR also interacts with trafficking proteins UNC119 homolog A and B, which are involved in the localization of myristoylated proteins and the regulation of T-cell and macrophage signaling activities. These interactions were validated through immunoprecipitation and are significant for understanding MACIR's role in immune signaling pathways (McGauran2020Resolving).

Additionally, MACIR has been shown to interact with 14-3-3 adapter protein isoforms, which are known to regulate signaling pathways through phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motifs. These interactions suggest a role for MACIR in modulating signaling pathways that are critical for immune response and inflammation (McGauran2020Resolving). The study of these interactions is vital for developing therapeutic interventions for autoimmune diseases and understanding MACIR's function as an unfavorable prognostic marker in certain cancers (McGauran2019The).
