# PCYT1B

## Overview
PCYT1B is a gene that encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase β (CCTβ), which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major component of cell membranes. This enzyme is categorized as a cytidylyltransferase and is involved in the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, a key step in the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis (Cornell2015CTP:phosphocholine). The PCYT1B gene produces multiple isoforms of CCTβ through alternative splicing, each with distinct functions in various tissues. Notably, the CCTβ2 isoform is essential for neuronal development, particularly in axonal phosphatidylcholine synthesis and branching (Strakova2011Involvement; Karim2003Gene). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affects its function and interaction with other cellular components (Cornell2015CTP:phosphocholine).

## Structure
The PCYT1B gene encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase β (CCTβ), which is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The enzyme has several isoforms, including CCTβ2 and CCTβ3, which are generated through alternative splicing and have distinct roles in different tissues (Marcucci2008Characterization; Karim2003Gene). The CCTβ2 isoform is particularly important in neuronal development, where it is involved in axonal phosphatidylcholine synthesis and branching (Strakova2011Involvement).

The primary structure of CCTβ includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, such as the catalytic domain, which is highly conserved across species (Cornell2015CTP:phosphocholine). The enzyme's secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure, if present, would involve the assembly of multiple subunits, but specific information is not available.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the activity of CCTβ, particularly in its regulatory tail domain, which includes a disordered region rich in phosphorylation sites (Cornell2015CTP:phosphocholine).
