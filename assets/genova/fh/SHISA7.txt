# SHISA7

## Overview
SHISA7 is a gene that encodes the protein shisa family member 7, which is a type-I transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission in the brain. The protein is characterized by a signal peptide, an extracellular domain with a conserved cysteine-rich motif, a single transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain with a PDZ-ligand motif. As an auxiliary subunit, shisa family member 7 interacts with both AMPA and GABA_A receptors, playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. It is particularly significant in the regulation of tonic inhibition through its interaction with a5-GABA_A receptors, which is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Additionally, the protein is implicated in cognitive functions such as learning and memory, as well as in the regulation of sleep/wake cycles (Wu2021Activity; Schmitz2017The; Han2019Shisa7).

## Structure
The SHISA7 protein is a type-I transmembrane protein characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains a signal peptide (SP) of 22 amino acids, an extracellular domain with a conserved cysteine-rich motif, a single transmembrane region (TM), and an intracellular domain with a type II PDZ-ligand motif (EVTV) (Schmitz2017The). The protein also includes an alternative-splice region, Exon4, which is similar to Shisa9, while Shisa6 has this as Exon3 (Schmitz2017The). The predicted molecular weight of the two mature Shisa7 protein variants is approximately 56 and 54 kDa (Schmitz2017The).

Shisa7 shares major structural characteristics with other members of the Shisa protein family, such as an N-terminal cysteine-rich region and a C-terminal PDZ type II binding motif (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). The protein is glycosylated in the hippocampus, which increases its observed molecular weight (Schmitz2017The). Shisa7 also contains a GRID domain, which is important for interaction with GABA A receptors, suggesting a role in neurological development (Liu2023Characteristics). These structural features contribute to its function as an auxiliary subunit interacting with AMPA and GABA A receptors, influencing synaptic transmission and receptor modulation (Schmitz2017The; Han2019Shisa7).

## Function
The SHISA7 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in modulating synaptic transmission in the brain. It functions as an auxiliary subunit for GABA A receptors, particularly influencing the actions of a5-GABA A receptors, which are crucial for tonic inhibition in neurons. This form of inhibition is essential for controlling neuronal excitability and maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain (Wu2021Activity). SHISA7 is involved in the exocytosis of a5-GABA A receptors, facilitating their surface expression and thereby enhancing tonic inhibition (Wu2021Activity).

SHISA7 is also associated with AMPA receptors, where it influences synaptic plasticity and memory processes. It is involved in the regulation of long-term potentiation (LTP), a process critical for learning and memory, by affecting AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic expression (Schmitz2017The). In the hippocampus, SHISA7 is crucial for maintaining synaptic strength and plasticity, which are essential for cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Schmitz2017The). The protein's activity is linked to the modulation of neuronal excitability and is implicated in the regulation of sleep/wake cycles (Wu2021Activity).

## Interactions
SHISA7, a member of the shisa family of proteins, is known for its interactions with various receptor subunits, playing a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. It interacts with GABA_A receptor subunits, including α1, α2, and γ2, but not with β2 and β3 subunits. This interaction is facilitated by a specific 22-amino acid domain in the N-terminal region of SHISA7, termed the GABA_A receptor interacting domain (GRID) (Han2019Shisa7). SHISA7 also forms complexes with AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits, such as GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3, and interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 through a type II PDZ-ligand motif (Schmitz2017The).

In the hippocampus, SHISA7 is part of native AMPAR complexes and is enriched in the postsynaptic density, where it co-purifies with synaptic proteins like PSD-95, GluA2, and GluN2A (Schmitz2017The). It also interacts with a5-GABA_A receptors, promoting their trafficking to the cell surface and enhancing tonic inhibitory currents (Wu2021Activity). These interactions highlight SHISA7's role in modulating receptor properties and synaptic function, influencing both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain.
