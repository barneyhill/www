# PDK1

## Overview
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, a member of the kinase family of proteins. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is crucial for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a key substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. PDK1 achieves this regulation through phosphorylation of the E1 component of PDC, thereby modulating the flow of carbon into the TCA cycle and maintaining glucose homeostasis (Roche2001Distinct; Stacpoole2017Therapeutic). The protein is characterized by a bilobal kinase fold and features a phosphate pocket and a hydrophobic PIF-pocket essential for substrate interaction and activation (Biondi2002High). PDK1 is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix and is responsive to metabolic conditions, such as increased levels of acetyl-CoA and NADH, which are indicative of fatty acid oxidation (Stacpoole2017Therapeutic). The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in both cancer research and metabolic disorders due to their roles in cellular metabolism and signaling pathways (Gagliardi2018PDK1:; Bayascas2008Mutation).

## Structure
The human PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) protein is characterized by a high-resolution crystal structure that reveals significant insights into its molecular architecture. The primary structure of PDK1 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, with specific residues such as Lys76, Arg131, Thr148, and Gln150 playing crucial roles in its function (Biondi2002High). The secondary structure of PDK1 features a classic bilobal kinase fold, similar to that of protein kinase A (PKA), with a root mean square deviation of 1.0 Å on Cα atoms (Biondi2002High). 

The tertiary structure of PDK1 includes a phosphate pocket and a hydrophobic PIF-pocket, which are essential for substrate interaction and enzyme activation (Biondi2002High). The PIF-pocket is formed by key residues such as Lys115, Ile118, Ile119, Val124, Val127, and Leu155, and is crucial for binding to the hydrophobic motif of substrates (Biondi2002High). 

PDK1 may also form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, although this is not explicitly detailed in the context provided. Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is critical for its regulatory functions (Biondi2002High). The protein may have different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Roche2001Distinct).

## Function
PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) is a key regulatory enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by controlling the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. PDK1 phosphorylates the E1 component of PDC, leading to its inactivation and thus regulating the flow of carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Roche2001Distinct; Stacpoole2017Therapeutic). This phosphorylation is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, particularly in tissues that rely heavily on glucose oxidation, such as the central nervous system (Roche2001Distinct).

PDK1 is capable of phosphorylating all three serine residues on the E1 component, with a preference for the third site, which is unique to PDK1 (KOLOBOVA2001Regulation; Patel2001Regulation). The enzyme is less sensitive to inhibition by ADP compared to other PDK isoforms and is modestly stimulated by NADH and acetyl-CoA (Roche2001Distinct). PDK1 activity is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix, where it responds to changes in metabolic conditions, such as increased levels of acetyl-CoA and NADH during fatty acid oxidation (Stacpoole2017Therapeutic). This regulation is crucial for adapting to metabolic demands, such as during fasting or high-fat availability, ensuring efficient energy production and metabolic flexibility (Patel2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDK1 gene have significant clinical implications. In cancer, PDK1 is often overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. This overexpression is linked to increased tumor growth and invasiveness, particularly in breast cancer, where it is often found alongside mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, such as ERBB2 amplification, PTEN loss, or PIK3CA mutation (Gagliardi2018PDK1:). PDK1's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, where it acts as a critical component. Targeting PDK1 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, especially in cancers with PI3K pathway alterations (Gagliardi2018PDK1:).

In metabolic disorders, mutations in the PDK1 gene, such as the K465E mutation, lead to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. This mutation affects the activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), resulting in reduced phosphorylation and activation of PKB in insulin-sensitive tissues, contributing to metabolic disorders like hyperinsulinemia (Bayascas2008Mutation). The mutation also impacts insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, leading to significant physiological changes, including reduced body size and organ size (Bayascas2008Mutation).
