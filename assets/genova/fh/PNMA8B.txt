# PNMA8B

## Overview
PNMA8B is a gene that encodes the protein PNMA family member 8B, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in cellular processes related to the immune response and have been implicated in various neurological conditions. The PNMA8B protein is characterized by its role in intracellular signaling pathways and may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival. Although the specific functions of PNMA8B are not fully elucidated, it is believed to interact with other proteins within the PNMA family, contributing to its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
