# USH2A

## Overview
The USH2A gene encodes usherin, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the sensory systems of the retina and inner ear. Usherin is integral to the structural and functional integrity of photoreceptor cells and cochlear hair cells, contributing to processes such as cell adhesion and matrix interactions. The protein's complex structure, which includes laminin G-like, fibronectin type III, and other domains, facilitates its involvement in critical cellular functions, including synaptic adhesion and mechano-electrical transduction (Yu2020Structural; Reiners2006Molecular). Mutations in the USH2A gene are linked to Usher syndrome type II and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, conditions characterized by progressive vision and hearing loss (Toms2020Clinical; van2004Identification). The gene's large size and alternative splicing result in multiple usherin isoforms, contributing to the phenotypic diversity observed in affected individuals (Baux2007Molecular).

## Structure
The USH2A gene encodes the protein usherin, which is associated with inherited retinal degeneration and hearing loss. Usherin is a large protein with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. These domains include laminin G-like (LGL), laminin N-terminal (LN), laminin EGF-like (LE), laminin G (LG), fibronectin type III (FN3), and a transmembrane domain (Yu2020Structural). The LGL, LN, LG, and FN3 domains adopt a beta-sandwich conformation, while the LE repeats are stabilized by disulfide bonds, forming a rod-shaped structure (Yu2020Structural).

The transmembrane domain of usherin is characterized by a long alpha-helix (Yu2020Structural). Usherin's FN3 domains can interact with each other and with LN and LE domains, allowing for both linear and bent conformations, and potentially forming antiparallel homodimers (Yu2020Structural). The intracellular region and the F16-F17 linker contain multiple loops among beta-strands and alpha-helices (Yu2020Structural).

Usherin undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may affect its function and localization. The USH2A gene produces different isoforms of usherin through alternative splicing, which can influence the protein's structure and function (Baux2007Molecular).

## Function
The USH2A gene encodes the protein usherin, which plays a critical role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of sensory cells in the retina and inner ear. Usherin is involved in cell adhesion and matrix interactions, contributing to the stability and function of photoreceptor cells and cochlear hair cells. In the retina, USH2A is expressed in photoreceptor cells, particularly in the connecting cilium and synaptic terminals, where it is part of the molecular composition of ribbon synapses, essential for synaptic adhesion and ionic homeostasis (Reiners2006Molecular). In the inner ear, USH2A is localized in the stereocilia and synaptic regions of cochlear hair cells, playing a role in mechano-electrical transduction necessary for hearing (Reiners2006Molecular).

USH2A forms a ternary protein complex with SANS (USH1G) and whirlin (USH2D), which is crucial for intracellular transport and synaptic function in photoreceptor cells. This complex is involved in the transport of cargo from the periciliary region to the outer segment of photoreceptor cells, facilitating the maintenance of inter-stereocilia links in hair cells (Sorusch2017Characterization). The protein's domain structure, including laminin G-like domains and fibronectin type III repeats, suggests its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling processes (Reiners2006Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USH2A gene are primarily associated with Usher syndrome type II and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP). Usher syndrome type II is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa, making it the most common cause of inherited deaf-blindness (Toms2020Clinical; van2004Identification). Mutations in USH2A account for a significant proportion of Usher syndrome cases, with estimates ranging from 29% to 85% depending on the study (Toms2020Clinical; Lenassi2015A). 

USH2A mutations also contribute to non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa, a condition that affects the retina's ability to respond to light, leading to progressive vision impairment without hearing loss (McGee2010Novel; Huang2023Novel). Specific mutations, such as c.2299delG, are associated with Usher syndrome, while others like c.2276G>T are linked to non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (Lenassi2015A; SanjurjoSoriano2020Genome). The gene's large size and complex splicing patterns contribute to the diversity of phenotypes observed in patients with USH2A mutations (McGee2010Novel; van2004Identification).

## Interactions
USH2A, also known as usherin, is a protein that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of a protein complex essential for sensory cell function in the retina and cochlea. It interacts with several other proteins, including whirlin (WHRN) and very large G-protein coupled receptor 1 (VLGR1), forming part of the periciliary membrane complex (PMC) in photoreceptor cells. This complex is crucial for the transport of opsins through the connecting cilium, and its disruption due to mutations in USH2A can lead to retinal degeneration (Tebbe2023The).

USH2A also interacts with SANS (USH1G) and whirlin, forming a ternary complex that is vital for the organization of the periciliary membrane complex of Usher syndrome proteins. The central domain of SANS is essential for binding to the C-terminal part of the intracellular tail of USH2A, while the PBM of USH2A is not necessary for this interaction. This interaction is important for maintaining the structural integrity of the USH protein network in sensory cells (Sorusch2017Characterization).

In the retina, USH2A co-localizes with whirlin and VLGR1 in specific subcellular regions, including the outer plexiform layer and connecting cilia, indicating a direct association between these proteins in photoreceptor cells (van2006The).
