# CCND1

## Overview
The CCND1 gene encodes the cyclin D1 protein, a regulatory subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which are crucial for cell cycle progression through the G1 phase. Cyclin D1 is a member of the cyclin protein family, characterized by its role in regulating the cell cycle and its involvement in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription regulation. The protein's activity is tightly controlled through post-translational modifications and interactions with other cellular proteins, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of CCND1 expression or cyclin D1 activity is implicated in several cancers, where it contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Solomon2003Cyclin; Tchakarska2019The).

## Structure
The CCND1 gene encodes the cyclin D1 protein, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Cyclin D1's primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids, with the canonical isoform, cyclin D1a, being 295 amino acids long, while the alternative splice variant, cyclin D1b, is 274 amino acids long (Wiestner2007Point; Tchakarska2019The). The secondary structure of cyclin D1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure.

Cyclin D1 contains a cyclin box domain essential for binding to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4/6) and the CIP1/KIP1 family, facilitating its role in cell cycle progression (Tchakarska2019The). The protein also features an LxCxE motif for binding to the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) (Tchakarska2019The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by GSK3β, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2, regulate cyclin D1's activity and stability, particularly influencing its nuclear export and degradation (Solomon2003Cyclin; Tchakarska2019The).

The cyclin D1b isoform lacks the C-terminal PEST domain and threonine 286, which are present in cyclin D1a and are involved in protein destabilization and turnover (Solomon2003Cyclin). Cyclin D1b is constitutively localized in the nucleus and exhibits distinct oncogenic properties compared to cyclin D1a, despite its reduced ability to phosphorylate RB1 (Solomon2003Cyclin).

## Function
Cyclin D1, encoded by the CCND1 gene, is a pivotal regulator of the cell cycle in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by forming complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which are essential for the progression through the G1 phase and the transition to the S phase, initiating DNA replication (Tchakarska2019The). Cyclin D1 acts as a mitogenic sensor, integrating extracellular signals to regulate cell cycle progression. It is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response, chromosome duplication, and stability (Tchakarska2019The).

In the nucleus, cyclin D1 associates with CDK4/6 and other partners like transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes to regulate the cell cycle. It phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), facilitating the release of E2F transcription factors that activate genes necessary for DNA synthesis (Tchakarska2019The). Cyclin D1 also plays a role in transcription regulation by interacting with nuclear receptors and chromatin modifiers, influencing pathways critical for development and differentiation (Tchakarska2019The).

Cyclin D1's activity is linked to its levels, and its degradation is necessary for the progression of the S phase. It is exported to the cytoplasm for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process dependent on phosphorylation by kinases such as GSK3β (Tchakarska2019The). Cyclin D1 also regulates cell metabolism by inhibiting oxidative glycolysis and mitochondrial activity, maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic homeostasis (Tchakarska2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCND1 gene, which encodes cyclin D1, are implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, CCND1 amplification and overexpression are linked to poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapies, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive tumors (Montalto2020Cyclin; Jeffreys2022Prognostic). Cyclin D1 overexpression is also associated with chemoresistance and poor outcomes in ovarian cancer (Montalto2020Cyclin).

In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the t(11;14) translocation leads to cyclin D1 overexpression, contributing to high proliferation rates and shorter survival. This is often due to truncated cyclin D1 mRNAs resulting from genomic deletions or point mutations, which increase mRNA stability (Wiestner2007Point).

Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in non-small cell lung carcinoma, where it interacts with KRAS and PTEN pathways, affecting tumorigenesis (Montalto2020Cyclin). In melanomas, CCND1 upregulation is linked to oncogenic pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt, contributing to malignant transformation (GonzálezRuiz2021Prognostic).

The G870A mutation in CCND1, producing the CCND1b isoform, is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast and thyroid cancer (Wang2023Aberrant).

## Interactions
Cyclin D1 (CCND1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and cancer progression. Cyclin D1 forms holoenzymes with cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) to regulate cell cycle progression (Jirawatnotai2014The). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, cyclin D1 interacts with the chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 5 (CCT5), promoting cell migration and invasion through the PI3K/AKT-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway (Meng2021CCT5).

Cyclin D1 also interacts with DNA repair proteins, including RAD51, a recombinase involved in homologous recombination. This interaction is crucial for recruiting RAD51 to DNA damage sites, facilitating DNA repair processes (Jirawatnotai2011A). In breast cancer cells, cyclin D1 interacts with various proteins, including the novel zinc finger protein ZFP106 and the cell cycle inhibitor p18INK4C (CDKN2C) (Jirawatnotai2014The).

In the context of cell invasion and metastasis, cyclin D1, in complex with CDK4, phosphorylates paxillin, a focal adhesion component, promoting Rac1 activation and cell invasion (Fusté2016Cytoplasmic). Cyclin D1 also interacts with transcription factors such as NF-Y, STAT, and CREB2, influencing gene expression during development (Bienvenu2010Transcriptional). These interactions highlight cyclin D1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a target in cancer therapy.
