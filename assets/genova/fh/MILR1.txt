# MILR1

## Overview
The MILR1 gene encodes the mast cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 1, commonly referred to as Allergin-1, which is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed on mast cells and myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Allergin-1 functions as an inhibitory receptor, playing a pivotal role in modulating immune responses, particularly in allergic reactions. It contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are essential for inhibiting signaling pathways mediated by the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI). This inhibition is crucial for suppressing IgE-mediated mast cell activation and degranulation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Miki2020Allergin1; Nagai2013Expression). The MILR1 gene's involvement in immune regulation extends to its role in suppressing Th2 responses and controlling allergic airway inflammation, highlighting its significance in both innate and adaptive immunity (Miki2020Allergin1).

## Structure


## Function
The MILR1 gene encodes the Allergin-1 protein, which plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of allergic reactions. Allergin-1 is primarily expressed on mast cells and myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor. It contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic portion, which recruit phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2. These phosphatases inhibit signaling pathways mediated by the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI), thereby suppressing IgE-mediated mast cell activation and degranulation (Miki2020Allergin1; Nagai2013Expression).

In dendritic cells, Allergin-1 suppresses Th2 responses by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway, which is responsible for the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Jagged 1 (Jag1) (Miki2020Allergin1). This suppression is crucial for controlling allergic airway inflammation, as demonstrated in studies where the absence of Allergin-1 led to increased airway hyperresponsiveness and elevated Th2 responses (Miki2020Allergin1). The MILR1 gene, through Allergin-1, thus plays a significant role in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating the activity of mast cells and dendritic cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MILR1 gene, also known as mast cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 1, have been associated with various immune-related conditions. In the context of atopy, a genetic predisposition to allergic diseases, polymorphisms in the MILR1 promoter, such as rs6504230, have been linked to increased expression of the gene. This increased expression is associated with a protective effect against atopy, suggesting that MILR1 may influence susceptibility to allergic reactions by modulating IgE-mediated responses (Nanatsue2014Influence).

In Alzheimer's disease, MILR1 is part of a significant gene triplet with H2-Ob and Csf1r, which may play a role in the disease's pathology. The expression levels of MILR1, along with Csf1r, are positively correlated, indicating that they may be involved in immune response regulation in the central nervous system (Khayer2017Threeway).

In breast cancer, MILR1 is associated with a detrimental prognosis in overall survival. Although no targeted drugs for MILR1 have been identified, its role in the immune microenvironment of tumors suggests potential therapeutic implications (LópezCade2022Genomic).

## Interactions
The MILR1 gene encodes the Allergin-1 protein, which is involved in several key interactions that regulate immune responses. Allergin-1 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic region, which facilitate its interaction with Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases, specifically SHP-1 and SHP-2. These interactions are crucial for inhibiting signaling pathways mediated by the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) in mast cells, thereby suppressing IgE and mast cell-dependent systemic and cutaneous anaphylaxis (Miki2020Allergin1; Lin2019Selective).

In dendritic cells, Allergin-1 suppresses Th2 responses by inhibiting Syk activation through the recruitment of SHP-1. This interaction downregulates the TLR4-MyD88-Erk signaling pathway, which is involved in allergic airway inflammation (Miki2020Allergin1). The absence of Allergin-1 leads to increased activation of Syk and MAPK signaling molecules, indicating its regulatory role in modulating immune responses (Miki2020Allergin1).

Allergin-1 also plays a role in suppressing the COX2-PGE2 axis in house dust mite-stimulated dendritic cells by inhibiting the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway, which is responsible for PGE2 production. This suppression is achieved through the recruitment of SHP-1, which inhibits Syk activation (Miki2020Allergin1).
