# BSG

## Overview
Basigin (BSG) is a gene that encodes the basigin protein, also known as CD147, which is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains and is highly glycosylated, which is essential for its structural stability and function (Belton2008Basigin2; Muramatsu2015Basigin). Basigin plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including nutrient transport, immune response modulation, and tissue remodeling. It is notably involved in the induction of matrix metalloproteinases and the regulation of monocarboxylate transporters, which are vital for cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Zhu2017The; Muramatsu2015Basigin). Additionally, basigin is implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential biomarker for disease prognosis (Qi2019Arf6driven; Yang2021FOXO3induced).

## Structure
Basigin (BSG), also known as CD147, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein typically consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region, which are crucial for its function and interactions. The N-terminal domain is classified as a C2 set immunoglobulin domain, while the C-terminal domain is categorized as an I set domain, connected by a flexible linker (Yu2008Crystal).

The BSG protein is highly glycosylated, with glycosylation occurring at asparagine residues, which is essential for its structural stability and function (Belton2008Basigin2; Muramatsu2015Basigin). Glycosylation sites are strategically positioned to allow the protein to stand upright on the cell surface, facilitating ligand binding (Yu2008Crystal).

BSG exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including basigin-1 and basigin-2. Basigin-1 contains an additional immunoglobulin-like sequence, while basigin-2 is the prototypical form with two Ig domains (Belton2008Basigin2; Muramatsu2015Basigin). The protein can form homo-oligomers, primarily through its N-terminal Ig-like domain, which is necessary for oligomerization (Belton2008Basigin2; Yoshida2000Homo‐oligomer). This oligomerization is crucial for its role in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways.

## Function
Basigin (BSG), also known as CD147, is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transport of nutrients and the migration of inflammatory leukocytes, as well as the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are crucial for tissue remodeling and repair (Zhu2017The; Muramatsu2015Basigin). BSG is essential for the cell surface translocation and activity of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which facilitate the transport of short-chain fatty acids like lactate and pyruvate across the plasma membrane, particularly in metabolically active cells such as tumor cells and activated lymphocytes (Muramatsu2015Basigin).

In the retina, BSG is involved in energy metabolism by mediating the uptake of lactate by photoreceptor cells, which is crucial for visual function (Muramatsu2015Basigin). It also interacts with rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) and GLUT1, enhancing glucose uptake and promoting the survival of cone photoreceptors (Muramatsu2015Basigin). BSG's interactions with integrins, CD98, and other molecules suggest its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Muramatsu2015Basigin). Additionally, BSG is implicated in immune response modulation by suppressing T-cell activation and is involved in T-cell development (Muramatsu2015Basigin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BSG gene, which encodes the basigin protein (CD147), are significantly associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CD147 is overexpressed in multiple tumors, including liver cancer, where it plays a crucial role in promoting malignant phenotypes. This overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, such as shorter overall survival and increased metastasis in HCC patients (Qi2019Arf6driven). The Arf6-driven endocytic recycling of CD147 is essential for maintaining cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, which are key processes in cancer progression (Qi2019Arf6driven).

In addition to its role in cancer, CD147 is involved in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis. The long non-coding RNA LOC554202, regulated by the transcription factor FOXO3, influences BSG expression by sponging miR-485-5p, thereby promoting HCC cell proliferation and metastasis (Yang2021FOXO3induced). High BSG expression is also associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis in HCC, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Yang2021FOXO3induced).

## Interactions
Basigin (BSG), also known as CD147, is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein that participates in various protein interactions. It serves as a receptor for the Plasmodium falciparum ligand PfRH5, which is crucial for erythrocyte invasion, a key step in malaria pathogenesis. This interaction is species-specific, with PfRH5 binding strongly to human BSG but not to gorilla BSG, highlighting its role in host tropism (Wanaguru2013RH5–Basigin; Crosnier2011Basigin).

BSG also interacts with integrins, which are important for cell attachment and spreading. This interaction is necessary for cytoskeletal rearrangements and cellular architecture modulation, as demonstrated in studies involving Drosophila models and insect cells (Curtin2005Basigin). Additionally, BSG interacts with cyclophilin A (CypA), which mediates isomerization of specific proline residues, potentially affecting BSG's structural conformation and function (Schlegel2009Solution).

BSG is involved in the cell surface translocation and activity of monocarboxylate transporters and associates with proteins such as GLUT1, CD44, and CD98. These interactions are crucial for processes like nutrient transport and immune response (Muramatsu2015Basigin).
