# ARV1

## Overview
The ARV1 gene encodes the ARV1 homolog, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in lipid homeostasis and cellular cholesterol transport. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the trafficking of sterols and the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are essential for anchoring proteins to cell membranes (Tong2010Decreased; Davids2020Homozygous). The ARV1 protein is characterized by a conserved ARV1 homology domain (AHD) that is crucial for its function in lipid metabolism and preventing free sterol toxicity (Davids2020Homozygous). Mutations in the ARV1 gene have been linked to severe neurological disorders, such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-38 (DEE38), highlighting its clinical significance (Palmer2016Neuronal; Esmaeilzadeh2021Whole).

## Structure
The ARV1 protein is a putative lipid transporter involved in various cellular processes, including sterol trafficking, sphingolipid metabolism, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis. It is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is predicted to have six transmembrane regions, although empirical studies suggest it may contain only three (Villasmil2011Determination; Villasmil2024Structurefunction). The ARV1 protein includes a conserved ARV1 homology domain (AHD), which is essential for its function and contains a putative zinc-binding motif characterized by two CXXC motifs separated by 20 residues (Villasmil2024Structurefunction).

The AHD is located within the N-terminus of the ARV1 protein and is crucial for its role in lipid homeostasis and preventing free sterol toxicity (Davids2020Homozygous). The AHD is cytosolic, while the C-terminus of the protein is ER luminal, with a large ER luminal loop that may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Villasmil2024Structurefunction). The ARV1 protein does not contain typical ER localization signals, such as the KKXX motif or the HDEL sequence (Villasmil2024Structurefunction).

## Function
The ARV1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in cholesterol transport and lipid homeostasis in human cells. ARV1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it facilitates the transport of cholesterol from the ER to other cellular compartments, such as the plasma membrane. This transport is essential for maintaining cholesterol balance within the cell, preventing cholesterol accumulation in the ER, and ensuring proper lipid homeostasis (Tong2010Decreased).

In addition to its role in cholesterol transport, ARV1 is involved in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for the proper localization and anchoring of GPI-anchored proteins to cell membranes. This process is essential for the synthesis of GPI anchors, which are necessary for the proper functioning of various proteins (Davids2020Homozygous).

ARV1 also plays a significant role in cell division by recruiting proteins such as IQGAP1 and myosin to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. This recruitment is crucial for the formation and function of the actomyosin ring, which is essential for the successful completion of cell division (Sundvold2016Arv1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARV1 gene are associated with a range of severe neurological conditions, primarily developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-38 (DEE38). This disorder is characterized by early-onset seizures, developmental delay, profound intellectual disability, ataxia, dystonia, and peripheral hypertonia. DEE38 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with affected individuals often exhibiting intractable seizures and severe neurodevelopmental impairments (Palmer2016Neuronal; Esmaeilzadeh2021Whole).

Specific mutations in ARV1, such as the c.294 + 1G > A splice variant and the p.Gly189Arg missense variant, have been shown to disrupt normal splicing and protein function, leading to a truncated, non-functional ARV1 protein. These mutations result in severe intellectual disability, movement disorders, and visual impairments, often culminating in early mortality (Davids2020Homozygous; Palmer2016Neuronal).

ARV1 mutations are also linked to deficiencies in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor synthesis, which is crucial for the proper functioning of certain cell surface proteins. This deficiency contributes to the observed clinical phenotypes, including severe developmental delays, seizures, and metabolic dysfunctions (Davids2020Homozygous). Additionally, some patients with ARV1 mutations have been reported to develop dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting a broader phenotypic spectrum (Karabinos2022Dilated).

## Interactions
The ARV1 protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of sterol synthesis and cell division. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ARV1 physically interacts with the ERG11 protein, a relationship essential for sterol synthesis. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate that ScErg11-MYC can be co-immunoprecipitated with ScArv1-HA. Mutant forms of ScArv1, such as ScArv1 C3A and ScArv1 Y37A, still interact with ScErg11, while ScArv1 C27A does not, suggesting the importance of specific residues for this interaction (Villasmil2020An).

In Candida albicans, ARV1 also interacts with ERG11, stabilizing the protein and maintaining azole susceptibility. The interaction is crucial for the proper folding and function of ERG11 within the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in ARV1 that disrupt this interaction lead to azole hypersusceptibility and reduced ERG11 levels, likely due to accelerated proteasomal degradation (Villasmil2020An).

ARV1 also plays a role in cell division by recruiting proteins to the cleavage furrow. It interacts with IQGAP1 and myosin, facilitating the formation of the actomyosin ring necessary for cytokinesis. This recruitment is independent of cholesterol levels, indicating a specific role in cell division (Sundvold2016Arv1).
