# IGBP1C

## Overview
IGBP1C is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the IGBP1 family, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by IGBP1C is involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, a critical phosphatase in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. As a regulatory protein, IGBP1C interacts with key signaling molecules, including the catalytic subunit of PP2A, PI3K, and AKT, to modulate their phosphorylation states and influence downstream signaling pathways. This modulation is essential for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of AKT, leading to the activation of the JNK pathway and subsequent apoptosis (Nadel2022GqPCRstimulated). Additionally, IGBP1C's ability to sequester phosphatase activity from targets like 4EBP and p70S6K underscores its role in promoting translation initiation and affecting cell growth dynamics (Grech2008Igbp1). The protein's structural flexibility, particularly in its C-terminal region, enhances its capacity to interact with various proteins, thereby expanding its regulatory influence within the cell (Smetana2006Low).

## Interactions
IGBP1C, a member of the IGBP1 family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that regulate key signaling pathways. It interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac), forming a dimer that can bind to either PI3K or AKT, influencing their phosphorylation states. This interaction is crucial for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of AKT, which leads to JNK activation and apoptosis (Nadel2022GqPCRstimulated). In resting cells, IGBP1C is bound to PI3K (p85 subunit) and PP2Ac, but not to AKT. Upon stimulation, the interaction with PI3K diminishes, while the interaction with AKT increases, indicating that IGBP1C recruits the PP2A complex to AKT, inactivating it (Nadel2022GqPCRstimulated).

IGBP1C also modulates PP2A phosphatase activity, affecting the phosphorylation of targets such as 4EBP and p70S6K. This modulation is part of a mechanism that sequesters phosphatase activity away from these targets, promoting translation initiation and influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Grech2008Igbp1). The protein's structural flexibility, particularly in its C-terminal region, allows it to interact with various proteins, enhancing its regulatory role in cellular functions (Smetana2006Low).
