# CKAP2

## Overview
CKAP2, or cytoskeleton-associated protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and mitotic spindle formation. The CKAP2 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a critical role in stabilizing microtubules and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It is primarily associated with microtubules and centrosomes during interphase and localizes to mitotic spindles and spindle poles during mitosis (Hong2008Transient). The expression of CKAP2 is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its levels peaking during the late G1 and G2/M phases, which underscores its importance in cell proliferation (Jeon2006A). CKAP2 is also a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex, and its timely degradation is essential for the completion of cytokinesis and maintenance of genomic stability (Hong2008Transient). Aberrations in CKAP2 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2018CKAP2; Zhang2017CKAP2).

## Function
CKAP2, also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 2, plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle formation. It is primarily associated with microtubules and centrosomes during interphase and localizes to mitotic spindles and spindle poles during mitosis (Hong2008Transient). CKAP2 is involved in stabilizing microtubules, which is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of mitotic spindles, thereby ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Zhang2017CKAP2). The protein's expression is cell cycle-dependent, with levels increasing between the late G1 and G2/M phases, indicating its role in cell proliferation (Jeon2006A).

CKAP2 is also a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and is degraded during mitotic exit, which is essential for the completion of cytokinesis and maintenance of spindle bipolarity (Hong2008Transient). Its phosphorylation at specific sites during mitosis suggests that CKAP2's functions are regulated by timely phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Zhang2017CKAP2). In healthy human cells, CKAP2 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and normal cell proliferation, as its depletion can lead to chromosome missegregation and increased chromosomal instability (Zhang2017CKAP2).

## Clinical Significance
CKAP2 (cytoskeleton-associated protein 2) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In high-grade glioma (HGG), CKAP2 expression is significantly elevated and associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). It acts as an independent prognostic biomarker, with high expression levels correlating with malignant factors such as high Ki67 expression and phosphatase and tensin homolog mutations (Wang2018CKAP2).

In ovarian cancer, CKAP2 is overexpressed and promotes tumorigenesis through the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-ERK2 signaling pathway. This overexpression enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting CKAP2's role as an oncogene in ovarian cancer progression (Zhang2017CKAP2).

CKAP2 is also overexpressed in osteosarcoma, where it contributes to tumor growth by affecting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of CKAP2 in osteosarcoma cells results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2018Silencing).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high CKAP2 expression is linked to early recurrence post-surgery, serving as a predictive marker for recurrence risk (Hayashi2014Cytoskeletonassociated). These findings highlight CKAP2's significant role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CKAP2, also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 2, participates in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle formation. CKAP2 is a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and its co-activator Cdh1, which mediates its degradation. This interaction is facilitated by the KEN box motif within CKAP2, which is essential for its recognition and ubiquitylation by the APC-Cdh1 complex (Hong2007Functional). Coimmunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between CKAP2 and Cdh1, highlighting the regulatory role of CKAP2 in spindle function and cytokinesis (Hong2007Functional).

CKAP2 also interacts with microtubules, stabilizing them by recruiting soluble tubulin to microtubule seeds, which promotes microtubule nucleation and growth. This interaction involves both end-tracking and lattice binding, although CKAP2 does not engage in depolymerization activities typical of other microtubule-associated proteins (McAlear2021The). CKAP2's association with microtubules is crucial for maintaining spindle pole integrity and chromosomal stability during mitosis (Case2013CKAP2). Despite these interactions, CKAP2 does not directly overlap with centrosomes or kinetochores, suggesting its role is mediated through other spindle elements or complexes (Case2013CKAP2).
