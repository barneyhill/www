# ZNF687

## Overview
ZNF687 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 687, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression related to bone metabolism, particularly influencing the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which are essential for bone remodeling and maintenance (Divisato2016ZNF687; Russo2022The). ZNF687 is expressed in various tissues, with significant upregulation during osteoclastogenesis, indicating its role in osteoclast differentiation (Divisato2016ZNF687). Beyond its role in bone biology, ZNF687 is implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with key signaling pathways and transcriptional complexes, contributing to tumorigenic processes and cancer stem cell maintenance (Zhang2017Overexpression). Mutations in ZNF687 have been linked to Paget's disease of bone and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Divisato2016ZNF687; Zhang2017Overexpression).

## Function
ZNF687 is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus where it binds to DNA and influences gene expression. It plays a significant role in bone metabolism, particularly in the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which are crucial for bone remodeling and maintenance. During osteoclastogenesis, ZNF687 expression is upregulated, supporting the osteoclastogenic process by modulating the expression of genes essential for osteoclast differentiation, such as TRAP, MMP-9, and CTSK (Russo2022The). ZNF687 is also expressed in differentiated osteoblasts, indicating its involvement in osteoblast differentiation (Divisato2016ZNF687).

The gene is expressed in various adult human tissues, including bone, and its expression increases significantly during osteoclast formation, suggesting a role in osteoclastogenesis (Divisato2016ZNF687). ZNF687 is part of a transcriptional regulator complex known as Z3, which includes ZMYND8 and ZNF592, and is involved in regulating genes crucial for osteoclast differentiation (Divisato2016ZNF687). The protein's nuclear localization signal is crucial for its nuclear import, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor (Huybrechts2023Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF687 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably Paget's disease of bone (PDB) and certain cancers. In PDB, specific mutations such as c.2810C>G and P937R in ZNF687 are associated with severe forms of the disease, characterized by increased osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling abnormalities. These mutations lead to a gain-of-function effect, enhancing the nuclear import of the ZNF687 protein and altering its nuclear-cytoplasmic balance, which contributes to the pathogenesis of PDB and its complications, including giant cell tumors (Divisato2016ZNF687; Russo2022The).

In cancer, ZNF687 is notably upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumorigenic capabilities. It enhances the expression of pluripotency-associated factors such as BMI1, OCT4, and NANOG, promoting stem cell-like traits, chemoresistance, and recurrence in HCC cells (Zhang2017Overexpression). The gene's dysregulation has also been observed in acute myeloid leukemia, indicating its broader oncogenic role (Zhang2017Overexpression).

## Interactions
ZNF687 is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It directly targets and activates the promoters of BMI1, NANOG, and OCT4, which are associated with stem cell-like traits in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Zhang2017Overexpression). ZNF687 interacts with the MBD3/NuRD complex, facilitating pluripotency induction and forming a transcriptional coregulator complex with ZMYND8 and ZNF592, indicating a role in chromatin remodeling (Zhang2017Overexpression). It also participates in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to the upregulation of transcription factors such as SOX2, c-MYC, and ABCG2, which are important for cancer stem cell maintenance (Zhang2017Overexpression).

In the context of DNA damage repair, ZNF687 interacts with ZMYND8, ZNF532, ZNF592, and PARP1 to promote the homologous recombination pathway, highlighting its role in genome stability (Kamaliyan2024Zinc). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZNF687 forms a fusion transcript with RUNX1, suggesting interactions with unique RNA and protein complexes that contribute to tumorigenic properties (Nguyen2006Identification). These interactions underscore ZNF687's involvement in transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, and cancer progression.
