# UTP15

## Overview
UTP15 is a gene that encodes the UTP15 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is a part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA and the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit. UTP15 is characterized by its β-propeller structure, which includes WD40 domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for the assembly and stabilization of protein complexes (Barandun2017The; Srivastava2014Analysis). In humans, UTP15 interacts with proteins such as CIRH1A and WDR43, forming a module within the nucleolar structure that is vital for ribosome assembly and function (Sato2013Interaction). The gene's role in ribosome biogenesis is conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental importance in cellular growth and function (Gallagher2018Proteins). Additionally, UTP15 has clinical significance, as alterations in its expression have been associated with glioma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Bhushan2021Scouting).

## Structure
The UTP15 protein is a component of the small subunit processome, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. Its molecular structure includes a β-propeller, which is a common fold associated with WD40 domains. These domains are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the assembly and stabilization of protein complexes (Barandun2017The; Srivastava2014Analysis). 

In humans, UTP15 is part of a complex with CIRH1A and WDR43, forming a module within the nucleolar structure. These proteins localize to the fibrillar center region in nucleoli and bind directly with each other, indicating a quaternary structure involving multiple protein interactions (Sato2013Interaction). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in the function of UTP15. For instance, phosphorylation of CIRH1A at Thr 131 suppresses its binding with UTP15, highlighting the regulatory role of phosphorylation in protein interactions (Sato2013Interaction). 

In zebrafish, mutations in the utp15 gene result in splice variants that lead to structural changes in the protein, affecting its function in vascular patterning and apoptosis (Mouillesseaux2011Mutation).

## Function
UTP15 is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a critical ribonucleoprotein complex involved in ribosome biogenesis. In healthy human cells, UTP15 plays a significant role in the processing and maturation of the 18S rRNA, which is essential for the formation of the small ribosomal subunit. This process occurs in the nucleolus, where UTP15 is active and contributes to the assembly and function of ribosomes, facilitating protein synthesis and cellular growth (Sato2013Interaction; Barandun2017The).

UTP15 is part of the t-UTP sub-complex, which is involved in the early stages of SSU processome assembly. This complex is essential for the transcription and processing of pre-rRNA, linking these processes to ensure efficient ribosome assembly (Gallagher2018Proteins; Phipps2010The). UTP15 interacts with other proteins such as CIRH1A and WDR43, forming a complex that is localized in the nucleolar fibrillar center (FC) region. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleolus and supporting ribosome biogenesis (Sato2013Interaction).

The role of UTP15 in ribosome biogenesis is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental importance in cellular function and growth (Gallagher2018Proteins).

## Clinical Significance
The UTP15 gene is implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its role in ribosome biogenesis. Alterations in UTP15 expression have been associated with glioma, a type of brain tumor. In hypoxic glioma cells, UTP15 is part of a five-gene signature that is downregulated, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapy in glioma (Bhushan2021Scouting). Although specific mutations in UTP15 have not been directly linked to clinical conditions, its involvement in the ribosome biogenesis pathway suggests that disruptions could contribute to diseases characterized by impaired protein synthesis.

UTP15 is also part of the t-UTP/UTPA subcomplex, which is essential for pre-rRNA processing. Depletion of UTP15 affects U3-dependent cleavage, indicating its critical role in rRNA processing (Prieto2007Recruitment). While the clinical significance of UTP15 mutations is not explicitly detailed, its interactions with other ribosome biogenesis proteins, such as Utp5/WDR43, are crucial. Disruptions in these interactions have been linked to craniofacial defects, as seen in zebrafish models, suggesting potential implications for human craniofacial development (Sondalle2016The).

## Interactions
UTP15 is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome and is involved in various protein interactions essential for ribosome biogenesis. It forms part of the tUTP subcomplex, interacting with proteins such as Utp4, Utp5, Utp8, and Utp9 to form a stable pentameric complex. Within this complex, Utp15 forms a dimer with Utp5, which further interacts with Utp4 to create a trimeric building block. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the tUTP pentamer (Pöll2014In).

In the context of the SSU processome, UTP15 plays a role in the coordination of the 5' ETS, utilizing its N-terminal extension and a long linker between its C-terminal domain and WD40 domain to stabilize helices II and III. It provides a binding platform for Noc4, facilitating the lateral extension of the UtpA complex, and interacts with Utp18 to interlock the UtpA and UtpB complexes (Barandun2017The).

In human cells, UTP15, along with CIRH1A and WDR43, is localized to the fibrillar center region in nucleoli and binds directly with these proteins in vitro. This interaction is integral to nucleolar structure and supports the dynamic scaffold model for inter-chromatin region structures (Sato2013Interaction).
