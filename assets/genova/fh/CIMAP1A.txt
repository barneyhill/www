# CIMAP1A

## Overview
CIMAP1A is a gene that encodes the ciliary microtubule associated protein 1A, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are essential for various cellular processes, including motility, sensory perception, and signaling pathways. The protein encoded by CIMAP1A is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cilia. This protein is critical for maintaining the proper architecture and function of cilia, and disruptions in its expression or function can lead to a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction (Qiu2020aarFDC).
