Desmogleins are calcium-binding transmembrane glycoprotein components of desmosomes, cell-cell junctions between epithelial, myocardial, and other cell types. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature glycoprotein. This gene is present in a gene cluster with other desmoglein gene family members on chromosome 18. The encoded protein has been identified as the autoantigen of the autoimmune blistering disease pemphigus vulgaris.
