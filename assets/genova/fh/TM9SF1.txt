# TM9SF1

## Overview
TM9SF1 is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the protein transmembrane 9 superfamily member 1, which is characterized by its nine transmembrane domains. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and autophagy. The N-terminal region of the protein interacts with Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), influencing its subcellular distribution and potentially affecting DNA repair processes. TM9SF1 is implicated in cellular homeostasis and immune responses, with its expression linked to several clinical conditions, such as cancer and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Cao2024TM9SF1; Zhou2024Distribution). Further research is necessary to fully understand the regulatory mechanisms and molecular activities of TM9SF1 in human health and disease.

## Structure
The TM9SF1 protein, encoded by the TM9SF1 gene located on chromosome 14, is characterized by a complex structure that includes nine transmembrane domains. These domains are situated within the C-terminal region, spanning amino acids 237-606, contributing to its hydrophobic nature and suggesting a role in membrane-related functions (Zhou2024Distribution). The N-terminal region, encompassing amino acids 1-236, is responsible for interacting with FEN1, a protein crucial for DNA repair (Zhou2024Distribution).

TM9SF1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm with a distinct perinuclear distribution and is also found in autophagosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum, with a smaller presence in the Golgi apparatus (Zhou2024Distribution). The protein's cellular localization and interaction with FEN1 suggest its involvement in autophagy and material transport (Zhou2024Distribution). Although the study does not provide specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, the presence of multiple transmembrane domains indicates a significant role in membrane trafficking and cellular processes (Zhou2024Distribution). The study does not mention any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
TM9SF1 is a protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and autophagy. It interacts with Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a protein crucial for DNA repair, through its N-terminal region. This interaction influences the subcellular distribution of FEN1, potentially affecting its function in DNA repair processes (Zhou2024Distribution). TM9SF1's overexpression can lead to the sequestration of FEN1 in the cytoplasm, hindering its nuclear entry and compromising DNA repair capacity, which may result in increased DNA damage (Zhou2024Distribution).

TM9SF1 is also implicated in autophagy and material transport, with its presence noted in various cellular compartments, including the ER, mitochondria, lysosomes, autophagosomes, and Golgi apparatus (Zhou2024Distribution). Although its full function is not completely understood, TM9SF1 is suggested to play roles in cellular homeostasis and immune responses, potentially contributing to the onset and progression of clinical diseases (Zhou2024Distribution). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and molecular activities of TM9SF1 in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TM9SF1 gene have been linked to several diseases. Overexpression of TM9SF1 is associated with various conditions, including cancer, lung injury, and ruptured intracranial aneurysms. In cancer, TM9SF1 affects the cellular distribution of FEN1, a nuclease involved in DNA repair, by retaining it in the cytoplasm and reducing its nuclear presence. This mislocalization can lead to DNA damage, as indicated by increased expression of Î³-H2AX, p-CHK2, P53, and P21, potentially contributing to tumor progression (Zhou2024Distribution).

In the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), TM9SF1 has been identified as a biomarker for predicting disease severity and mortality. Higher expression levels of TM9SF1 correlate with increased severity and mortality risk in ARDS patients. The gene's expression is significantly elevated in severe ARDS cases compared to non-severe cases and healthy controls, suggesting its role in the inflammatory response and immune regulation associated with ARDS pathogenesis (Cao2024TM9SF1).

TM9SF1's involvement in autophagy and its interaction with FEN1 suggest that it may influence disease progression by affecting cellular processes such as DNA repair and material transport (Zhou2024Distribution).

## Interactions
TM9SF1 interacts with Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a crucial protein involved in DNA repair. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal region of TM9SF1, comprising amino acids 1-236, which can translocate into the nucleus. The C-terminal segment, consisting of amino acids 237-606, is responsible for TM9SF1's cellular localization. Overexpression of TM9SF1 sequesters FEN1 in the cytoplasm, hindering its nuclear entry and compromising DNA repair, which leads to increased DNA damage and cell growth inhibition. However, knockdown or knockout of TM9SF1 does not affect FEN1 distribution or DNA damage, suggesting compensatory mechanisms may exist (Zhou2024Distribution).

The interaction between TM9SF1 and FEN1 was validated through bioinformatics analysis, Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assays, and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. These studies confirmed that the N-terminal region of TM9SF1 interacts with FEN1, while the C-terminal region does not (Zhou2024Distribution). TM9SF1's role in cellular processes extends to its involvement in autophagy, as it localizes in lysosomes and autophagosomes, potentially linking DNA damage to autophagy activation (Zhou2024Distribution).
