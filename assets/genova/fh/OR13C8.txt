# OR13C8

## Overview
The OR13C8 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 8, which is part of the extensive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This family is known for its role in signal transduction across cell membranes. The OR13C8 protein is specifically involved in the detection of odor molecules, functioning as a monomeric unit without forming quaternary structures (Cheng2017The). Characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, OR13C8 shares common features with other GPCRs, such as an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus, which are essential for its role in olfactory signal transduction (Cheng2017The). Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, are known to affect the stability, localization, and function of this receptor, highlighting its complexity and importance in the olfactory system (Cheng2017The).

## Structure
The OR13C8 protein is an olfactory receptor that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure typically includes an extracellular N-terminus, seven transmembrane helices, and an intracellular C-terminus, which are common features of GPCRs (Cheng2017The). The primary structure of OR13C8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its three-dimensional conformation. 

In terms of secondary structure, the seven transmembrane helices are a hallmark of GPCRs, forming a bundle that traverses the cell membrane. These helices are connected by loops that can vary in length and composition. The tertiary structure of OR13C8 involves the folding of these helices into a specific three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its function in odor detection.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in olfactory receptors, including OR13C8. These modifications can influence receptor stability, localization, and function (Cheng2017The). Olfactory receptors, including OR13C8, generally do not form quaternary structures, as they function as monomeric units in the detection of odor molecules (Cheng2017The).
