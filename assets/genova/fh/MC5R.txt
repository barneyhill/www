# MC5R

## Overview
The MC5R gene encodes the melanocortin 5 receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including metabolism, exocrine function, and immune response. The melanocortin 5 receptor is primarily expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle, exocrine glands, and immune cells, where it plays a role in glucose uptake, sebum production, and inflammatory regulation. The receptor's interaction with specific ligands and accessory proteins influences its signaling pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Variants in the MC5R gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as major depressive disorder and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its significance in human health (Amin2022Implication; Ji2022Melanocortin5; Xu2020Melanocortin).

## Structure
The melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains (TMDs), which are typical of the GPCR family. The primary structure of MC5R consists of 325 amino acids, encoded by an intronless gene located on chromosome 18p11.21 in humans (Ji2022Melanocortin5; Xu2020Melanocortin). The secondary structure includes seven α-helical transmembrane segments, which are highly conserved across species (Xu2020Melanocortin). 

The tertiary structure of MC5R involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a ligand-binding pocket. This pocket includes an ionic pocket formed by Asp115 and Asp119 in TM3, and an aromatic binding pocket constituted by Phe195 in TM5 and Phe254 in TM6 (Xu2020Melanocortin). The receptor's extracellular loops, particularly ECL2 and ECL3, contribute to the formation of the binding site and are involved in ligand recognition (Feng2023Structural).

MC5R does not have a well-defined quaternary structure, as it typically functions as a monomer. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs, although specific modifications for MC5R are not detailed in the available literature (Yang2017Molecular).

## Function
The melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and exocrine function. In skeletal muscles, MC5R plays a crucial role in glucose uptake and energy expenditure. Activation of MC5R by α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) enhances glucose uptake in muscles, contributing to whole-body glucose clearance through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway (Enriori2016αMelanocyte).

MC5R is also significantly expressed in exocrine glands, such as sebaceous glands, where it regulates sebum production and sebocyte differentiation. This receptor is involved in the production of sebum-specific lipids, which are essential for skin and hair health, and its expression is associated with the differentiation of sebocytes (Zhang2006Melanocortin5).

In addition to its role in metabolism and exocrine function, MC5R is implicated in immune and inflammatory responses. It is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal glands, liver, and immune cells, where it influences processes such as lipolysis and inflammatory response regulation (Xu2020Melanocortin).

## Clinical Significance
The MC5R gene, encoding the melanocortin 5 receptor, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in various physiological processes. Variants in the MC5R gene have been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Finnish populations. Specifically, the MC5R rs2236700 SNP is significantly linked to MDD under the dominant complete penetrance model (Amin2022Implication). Although this SNP was not associated with bipolar disorder, the T2D-risk G allele of rs2236700 has been found to increase susceptibility to schizophrenia when combined with variants in other genes, such as tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2 (MCHR2) (Amin2022Implication).

MC5R is also involved in exocrine gland function, and its deficiency can lead to conditions such as alacrimia, characterized by dry eyes, due to its expression in the lacrimal gland (Xu2020Melanocortin). In knockout mouse models, MC5R deficiency results in impaired sebaceous gland function, leading to reduced hair lipid content and defects in water repulsion and thermoregulation, suggesting potential implications for similar conditions in humans (Xu2020Melanocortin). The receptor's role in stress response and inflammation further underscores its clinical significance (Xu2020Melanocortin).

## Interactions
The melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing its signaling and function. MC5R can form complexes with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which may be a common feature among GPCRs, suggesting potential interactions that could modulate its signaling pathways (Rodrigues2009Melanocortin). 

MC5R interacts with melanocortin receptor accessory proteins (MRAPs), including MRAP1 and MRAP2. These proteins are involved in the trafficking and pharmacology of MC5R, affecting its movement to the plasma membrane and its dimerization. MRAPs are expressed in various tissues, such as the brain and skin, and their interaction with MC5R is crucial for its function (Ji2022Melanocortin5). 

The receptor also interacts with specific ligands, such as α-MSH and PG-901, which bind to MC5R and influence its activation. These interactions involve specific residues in the transmembrane domain and extracellular loops of MC5R, with mutations in these residues significantly affecting ligand potency and receptor activation (Feng2023Structural). These interactions are essential for understanding the receptor's role in various physiological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
