# GOT2

## Overview
The GOT2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is integral to the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which is essential for transferring reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria, thereby maintaining the NADH/NAD+ balance crucial for various metabolic pathways (van2019Biallelic). Structurally, the GOT2 protein functions as a homodimer and exhibits a high degree of conservation across species, underscoring its fundamental biological role (van2019Biallelic). Beyond its metabolic functions, GOT2 is involved in significant protein-protein interactions, influencing cancer biology and other diseases. Alterations in GOT2 expression and function have been linked to metabolic disorders and various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Song2023Combining; Li2022GOT2).

## Structure
The GOT2 protein, encoded by the human GOT2 gene, functions as a homodimer, meaning it consists of two identical subunits (van2019Biallelic). The structure of the human GOT2 protein has been resolved at a 3.0 Å resolution, revealing its high degree of structural conservation with the mouse GOT2 protein, with a sequence identity of 95% and an average atomic distance of less than 1 Å (van2019Biallelic). This structural conservation suggests a similar functional role across species.

GOT2 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, which indicates the presence of a PLP cofactor-binding domain essential for its catalytic activity (van2019Biallelic). The protein's structure includes hydrogen bonds and charge interactions that are crucial for its stability and function (van2019Biallelic). 

Post-translational modifications of GOT2 include acetylation at specific lysine residues (K159, K185, and K404), which enhances its interaction with mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) and plays a role in cellular metabolism and tumor growth (Yang2015SIRT). The acetylation of these sites is conserved across several species, highlighting their regulatory importance (Yang2015SIRT).

## Function
The GOT2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2, which plays a crucial role in the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). This shuttle is essential for transferring reducing equivalents, specifically NADH, from the cytosol into the mitochondria, where they can be re-oxidized. This process is vital for maintaining the NADH/NAD+ balance within cells, which is necessary for various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and serine biosynthesis (van2019Biallelic).

GOT2 catalyzes the reversible conversion of oxaloacetate and glutamate into aspartate and α-ketoglutarate, facilitating the proper functioning of the MAS. This activity supports cellular energy metabolism by ensuring the availability of NAD+ for glycolysis and other cellular processes (van2019Biallelic). In healthy human cells, GOT2 is also involved in the production of aspartate within mitochondria, which is critical for cellular metabolism due to the low uptake of aspartate from the blood (van2019Biallelic).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the redox state and supporting serine biosynthesis, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disturbances, such as hyperlactatemia and hyperammonemia (van2019Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GOT2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Bi-allelic mutations in GOT2 are associated with a treatable malate-aspartate shuttle-related encephalopathy. This condition is characterized by early-onset metabolic encephalopathy with epilepsy, progressive microcephaly, and biochemical abnormalities such as elevated blood lactate and mild hyperammonemia. These mutations disrupt the malate-aspartate shuttle, affecting cellular redox balance and serine biosynthesis, which can lead to encephalopathy and other metabolic disturbances (van2019Biallelic).

In cancer, alterations in GOT2 expression have been observed. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low GOT2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment efficacy (Li2022GOT2). In B-cell lymphomas, aberrant GOT2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is regulated by STAT3 and NF-κB pathways (Feist2018Cooperative). In cutaneous melanoma, high GOT2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and low immune infiltration, indicating its role in tumor growth and immune suppression (Song2023Combining).

## Interactions
GOT2, or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant in cancer biology. It interacts with MDH2 (malate dehydrogenase 2), a relationship enhanced by the acetylation of GOT2 at specific lysine residues (K159, K185, and K404). This acetylation, promoted by nicotinamide (NAM), facilitates the association between GOT2 and MDH2 without affecting GOT2's enzymatic activity (Yang2015SIRT).

GOT2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein TP53 and several metabolic enzymes, including GAPDH, NQO1, COX17, and TX. These interactions may influence cancer progression, as mutant P53 can prevent the nuclear translocation of GAPDH, enhancing glycolysis in cancer cells, while NQO1 stabilizes P53, and TX enhances P53's DNA binding (Siwo2024Pancancer).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), GOT2 interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARδ, influencing tumor progression through metabolic and immune-modulatory mechanisms. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activity of PPARδ, which is reduced in GOT2-null PDAC cells. GOT2's role in fatty acid binding and trafficking is also significant, as it binds directly to fatty acid ligands that regulate PPARδ (SanfordCrane2020A).
