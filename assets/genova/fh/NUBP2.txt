# NUBP2

## Overview
NUBP2 is a gene that encodes the NUBP iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor 2, a cytosolic protein involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters, which are vital cofactors for numerous cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a P-loop NTPase and plays a significant role in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and maintenance, impacting cellular energy metabolism, DNA repair, and oxidative stress regulation (DiStasio2020Nubp2; Abdulla2023Serum). NUBP2 is also implicated in centrosome duplication, ribosome biogenesis, and microtubule dynamics, interacting with proteins such as KATNAL2 and forming a heterocomplex with NUBP1 (Ververis2015A; Okuno2009Comparison). These interactions underscore its multifaceted roles in cellular regulation and development, with potential implications in clinical contexts such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and craniofacial development (DiStasio2020Nubp2; Abdulla2023Serum).

## Function
NUBP2, also known as NUBP iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor 2, is a cytosolic protein involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential cofactors for various cellular processes. These clusters play a critical role in cellular energy metabolism, DNA repair, and the regulation of oxidative stress, impacting overall cellular health and function (Abdulla2023Serum). NUBP2 is a highly conserved P-loop NTPase that acts as a scaffold for transferring the iron-sulfur cofactor to non-mitochondrial apoproteins, contributing to mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and maintenance (DiStasio2020Nubp2).

In addition to its role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly, NUBP2 is involved in regulating centrosome duplication and ribosome biogenesis, as demonstrated in studies using yeast and mouse models (Okuno2009Comparison). The protein is also implicated in microtubule dynamics and cell cycle processes through its interaction with katanin-like 2 proteins (KATNAL2), which are involved in microtubule-based processes in mammalian cells (Ververis2015A). NUBP2's intracellular localization and interactions suggest it plays a cooperative role with NUBP1, forming a hetero complex that is crucial for its physiological functions (Okuno2009Comparison).

## Clinical Significance
NUBP2 has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Studies have shown that NUBP2 expression is elevated in OSCC patients, with 72% of cases showing positive staining through immunohistochemical analysis. This increased expression correlates with better disease-free survival, suggesting its potential utility in early diagnosis or screening of OSCC (Abdulla2023Serum). However, NUBP2 expression does not significantly correlate with clinical factors such as age, gender, tumor site, size, or lymph node metastasis (Abdulla2023Serum).

In mice, mutations in the Nubp2 gene, such as the 'dorothy' mutation, result in craniofacial defects due to increased apoptosis in cranial neural crest cells (CNCC). This mutation leads to developmental abnormalities like midfacial clefting and limb defects, highlighting the gene's role in craniofacial development (DiStasio2020Nubp2). Despite these findings in animal models, no clinical disorders have been directly associated with NUBP2 variants in humans (DiStasio2020Nubp2). The potential for NUBP2 to influence apoptosis through interactions with transcriptional regulators suggests a complex role that may extend beyond its known functions in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway (DiStasio2020Nubp2).

## Interactions
NUBP2, also known as Nucleotide Binding Protein 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. NUBP2 forms a heterocomplex with its homologous partner NUBP1, which is essential for centrosome duplication and ribosome biogenesis (Okuno2009Comparison). This interaction suggests a cooperative function in vivo, as both proteins are highly conserved and share a nucleotide-binding motif near the N-terminus.

NUBP2 also interacts with KATNAL2, a novel family of katanin-like 2 protein isoforms. These interactions have been confirmed through in vivo pull-down assays and in vitro experiments, indicating that NUBP2 is co-selected with KATNAL2 isoforms, suggesting a role in microtubule-based processes (Ververis2015A). The interaction between NUBP2 and KATNAL2 is significant for regulating microtubule dynamics and ciliogenesis, processes critical for cell division and function (Ververis2015A).

Additionally, NUBP2 is implicated in pathways involving RNA binding and mRNA processing, as it interacts with proteins like TDP-43, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases (Romano2013Targeting). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of NUBP2 in cellular regulation and development.
