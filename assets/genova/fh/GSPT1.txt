# GSPT1

## Overview
GSPT1, or G1 to S phase transition 1, is a gene that encodes a protein known as eRF3a, which plays a pivotal role in translation termination and cell cycle regulation. The GSPT1 protein is categorized as a GTPase and is integral to the translation termination complex, where it interacts with other proteins to ensure the accurate cessation of protein synthesis and the maintenance of mRNA stability (Sellar2022Degradation; Ozawa1992Mapping). This protein is crucial for the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, a key process in cell proliferation and growth (Ozawa1992Mapping). GSPT1's interactions with various proteins, including eRF1 and poly(A)-binding protein, underscore its importance in cellular processes such as mRNA surveillance and the regulation of apoptosis pathways (MaltaVacas2009Differential; Hoshino1999The). The gene's involvement in cancer, particularly through mutations and polymorphisms, highlights its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Brito2009eRF3aGSPT1; MaltaVacas2009Differential).

## Function
The GSPT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in translation termination and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, GSPT1 is involved in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, a process essential for cell proliferation and growth (Ozawa1992Mapping). The protein functions as a GTPase and is part of the translation termination complex, interacting with ETF1 to recognize termination codons at the A site of the ribosome (Sellar2022Degradation). This interaction is crucial for proper translation termination and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), processes that ensure the fidelity of protein synthesis and mRNA surveillance (Sellar2022Degradation).

GSPT1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it coordinates the interaction between the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and the termination complex, facilitating the binding of PABP to the poly(A) tail during translation termination (Sellar2022Degradation). The protein's GTPase activity is essential for its function in these molecular processes, and its degradation can lead to impaired translation termination and activation of stress response pathways (Sellar2022Degradation). These activities highlight GSPT1's role in maintaining normal cellular function and growth.

## Clinical Significance
The GSPT1 gene, also known as eRF3a, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in translation termination and cell cycle progression. Mutations and polymorphisms in GSPT1, particularly the GGC 12 allele, have been associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including colorectal, breast, and gastric cancers. The GGC 12 allele is linked to a 12-fold increased risk for colorectal cancer and is found exclusively in cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a cancer biomarker (Brito2009eRF3aGSPT1; MaltaVacas2009Differential). In breast cancer, the presence of the 12-GGC allele is associated with a significantly increased risk, with an odds ratio of 11.32 (Brito2009eRF3aGSPT1). 

In gastric cancer, the 12-Gly allele is associated with a 20-fold increased risk, highlighting its potential role in cancer susceptibility (Brito2005Polyglycine). GSPT1 overexpression is observed in various tumors, including gastric and breast cancers, and is linked to the presence of the GGC 12 allele (MaltaVacas2009Differential). The gene's interaction with miRNA-144 in colorectal cancer suggests that miRNA-144 may suppress cancer cell proliferation and migration by targeting GSPT1 (Xiao2015miRNA144). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GSPT1 in cancer diagnosis and therapy.

## Interactions
GSPT1, also known as eRF3a, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in translation termination, mRNA stability, and cell cycle regulation. GSPT1 interacts with eRF1 to form a complex that facilitates the release of nascent polypeptide chains from the ribosome during translation termination (MaltaVacas2009Differential). This interaction is mediated through the conserved C-terminal region of GSPT1, which is essential for its function in translation termination (MaltaVacas2009Differential).

GSPT1 also interacts with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), where it binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain of PABP. This interaction is thought to regulate mRNA stability by inhibiting the multimerization of PABP on poly(A) RNA, potentially influencing translation initiation and mRNA degradation (Hoshino1999The).

In the context of cell signaling, GSPT1 interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), enhancing ASK1-mediated MAPK pathway activity. This interaction involves the C-terminal domain of GSPT1 and is independent of the phosphorylation status of ASK1. GSPT1 competes with 14-3-3 proteins for binding to ASK1, thereby promoting ASK1 autophosphorylation and kinase activity, which is linked to apoptosis (Lee2007G1).
