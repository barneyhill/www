# ACVR2A

## Overview
The ACVR2A gene encodes the activin A receptor type 2A, a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. This receptor plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes by forming heteromeric complexes with type I receptors, such as ALK2, ALK3, ALK4, and ALK6, to mediate signaling pathways that influence cellular responses to activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) stimuli (Szilágyi2022Competition). ACVR2A is involved in regulating bone mass, reproductive processes, and is implicated in several diseases, including pre-eclampsia and certain cancers (Glotov2018Targeted; Goh2017Activin; Yang2024ACVR2A). The receptor's interactions and signaling pathways are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and are subject to competitive regulation, which can vary across different physiological conditions (Szilágyi2022Competition).

## Function
The ACVR2A gene encodes a receptor that is part of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which includes activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This receptor is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by forming heteromeric complexes with type I receptors such as ALK2, ALK3, ALK4, and ALK6. These complexes regulate signaling pathways that influence cellular responses to activin and BMP stimuli, particularly through the Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 pathways (Szilágyi2022Competition).

In osteoblasts, ACVR2A functions as a negative regulator of bone mass. It limits bone formation by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation and activity, as evidenced by increased bone mass and mechanical properties in mice lacking ACVR2A in osteoblasts (Goh2017Activin). ACVR2A's role in bone homeostasis is further supported by its involvement in signaling pathways that regulate the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity (Olsen2015Activin).

ACVR2A is also involved in reproductive processes, particularly in the regulation of trophoblast invasion and placental formation during pregnancy. It is predominantly expressed in the endometrium and placenta, highlighting its importance in pregnancy-related mechanisms (Yang2024ACVR2A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ACVR2A gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably pre-eclampsia and certain cancers. In pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria, the ACVR2A gene has been associated with increased risk. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variants within the ACVR2A gene that are linked to pre-eclampsia, such as rs145399059, rs17692648, and an insertion at position 148642724, which are considered potential risk markers in certain populations (Glotov2018Targeted; Roten2008Association).

In cancer, ACVR2A mutations are frequently observed in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, particularly in gastric and colon cancers. These mutations often result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the ACVR2A protein, leading to a loss of function. In gastric cancer, such mutations are associated with increased tumor mutation burden and decreased lymph node metastasis (Microsatellite; Zhao2020&lt; p&gt). In colon cancer, ACVR2A mutations are prevalent in MSI-H tumors, contributing to the loss of protein expression and potentially playing a role in tumor pathogenesis (Jung2004Loss). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACVR2A in both pre-eclampsia and cancer.

## Interactions
ACVR2A interacts with various type I receptors, including ALK4, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6, to mediate signaling pathways within the TGF-beta superfamily. These interactions are crucial for directing signaling to distinct Smad pathways. ACVR2A forms stable heteromeric complexes with these receptors, which are essential for signaling to Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 pathways. ALK4, when paired with ACVR2A, signals to the Smad2/3 pathway, while ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6 direct signaling to the Smad1/5/8 pathway (Szilágyi2022Competition).

The interactions between ACVR2A and these type I receptors are competitive, with ALK4 and BMP type I receptors (ALK2, ALK3, ALK6) competing for binding to ACVR2A. This competition regulates the balance of signaling between activin-mediated Smad2/3 and BMP-mediated Smad1/5/8 pathways. The relative expression levels of these receptors can influence this competition, which varies across different cell types and physiological conditions (Szilágyi2022Competition).

ACVR2A also forms heteromeric complexes with ALK2 variants, showing stronger interactions with ALK2-WT compared to the ALK2-R206H mutant. The presence of ligands like activin A (ActA) enhances these interactions, promoting the formation of stable complexes (Szilágyi2024The).
