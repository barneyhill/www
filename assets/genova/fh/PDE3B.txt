# PDE3B

## Overview
Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphodiesterase 3B, which is a member of the phosphodiesterase family of proteins. This enzyme is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which are pivotal secondary messengers in various cellular signaling pathways. PDE3B is categorized as a phosphodiesterase and plays a significant role in metabolic regulation, particularly in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and pancreatic β-cells. It is integral to processes such as insulin signaling, lipolysis, and energy homeostasis. The enzyme's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and its interaction with other proteins, which are essential for its function in insulin-mediated pathways (Choi2006Alterations; Ahmad2007Insulininduced). Dysregulation of PDE3B has been implicated in metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, underscoring its importance in maintaining metabolic balance (Azevedo2013Clinical).

## Structure
The human phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes distinct primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary features. The primary structure of PDE3B consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with specific residues playing crucial roles in its function. The secondary structure is composed of 16 alpha-helices that form three subdomains, with the amino-terminal domain containing seven helices and a 44-residue insertion typical of the PDE3 subfamily (Scapin2004Crystal).

The tertiary structure of PDE3B is compactly folded, with a metal binding site located in a deep pocket at the interface of the three subdomains. This site coordinates magnesium ions essential for catalytic activity (Scapin2004Crystal). The quaternary structure of PDE3B is dimeric, with a small dimer interface formed around a hydrophobic core, which is consistent with the dimeric nature of mammalian phosphodiesterases (Scapin2004Crystal).

PDE3B undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its activation and interaction with other proteins in insulin signaling pathways (Ahmad2007Insulininduced). The N-terminal region of PDE3B contains phosphorylation sites necessary for its recruitment into macromolecular complexes (Ahmad2007Insulininduced).

## Function
Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, which are crucial secondary messengers in cellular signaling. In adipocytes, PDE3B is associated with caveolae, specialized plasma membrane domains that are important for organizing insulin signaling. It is involved in the regulation of insulin-induced glucose uptake, GLUT-4 translocation, and lipogenesis, as well as the inhibition of lipolysis (Nilsson2006Plasma). PDE3B is activated by insulin, IGF-1, and leptin through PI3K-dependent pathways, and it plays a significant role in energy metabolism by modulating intracellular cAMP levels (Choi2006Alterations).

In pancreatic β-cells, PDE3B regulates insulin secretion by modulating cAMP levels, which are essential for glucose-stimulated insulin release. Overexpression of PDE3B reduces cAMP levels and insulin secretion, highlighting its role in controlling insulin exocytosis (Härndahl2002Important). In hepatocytes, PDE3B is involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, influencing processes such as gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis (Berger2009Phosphodiesterase). Overall, PDE3B is crucial for maintaining normal metabolic functions in various tissues, impacting processes like lipolysis, insulin signaling, and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PDE3B gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. In particular, PDE3B plays a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis, and its dysregulation can contribute to conditions such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Studies on PDE3B knockout mice have shown that the absence of PDE3B leads to increased liver triglyceride content, altered insulin secretion, and signs of insulin resistance, highlighting its importance in glucose and lipid metabolism (Choi2006Alterations; Azevedo2013Clinical).

PDE3B is involved in the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, and its absence impairs insulin's ability to suppress lipolysis, which can lead to increased lipolysis and contribute to insulin resistance (Choi2006Alterations; DiPilato2015The). This impairment is evident in PDE3B knockout models, where insulin fails to inhibit catecholamine-activated lipolysis, suggesting that PDE3B is crucial for the antilipolytic effects of insulin (Choi2006Alterations).

Despite its significant role in metabolic processes, polymorphisms in the PDE3B gene have not been correlated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility in some populations, indicating that other factors may also play a role in the development of this condition (Azevedo2013Clinical).

## Interactions
Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. In the context of insulin signaling, PDE3B interacts with protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT. This interaction is enhanced upon insulin stimulation, where phosphorylated PKB (pPKB) interacts with PDE3B via its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The regulatory domain (RD) of PDE3B is important for this interaction, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing that more pPKB than PKB co-immunoprecipitates with PDE3B (Ahmad2007Insulininduced).

PDE3B is also part of high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) formed in response to insulin, which include proteins such as IRS-1, PI3K p85, HSP-90, 14-3-3, and PP2A. These complexes are involved in the regulation of PDE3B activity and are influenced by its phosphorylation state (Ahmad2009Differential; Ahmad2007Insulininduced).

In adipocytes, PDE3B interacts with caveolin-1 (CAV-1), which acts as a scaffolding molecule necessary for the stabilization and activation of PDE3B in response to insulin and β3-adrenergic receptor agonists. CAV-1 knockdown affects the formation and maintenance of macromolecular signaling complexes involving PDE3B (Ahmad2009Differential).
