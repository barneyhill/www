# RNF103

## Overview
RNF103 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 103, an E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by its RING finger domain. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating protein ubiquitination levels. As an ER-resident ligase, ring finger protein 103 is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of misfolded proteins, although its specific substrates and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Preston2017The). The protein contains multiple transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in exporting ERAD substrates to the cytosol (Kaneko2016Genomewide). RNF103 interacts with various proteins, including ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and components of the ERAD machinery, highlighting its role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses (Nakamura2011The). Alterations in the expression or function of RNF103 have been implicated in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Function
RNF103, also known as ring finger protein 103, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and protein-protein interactions. RNF103 is an ER-resident ligase that regulates protein ubiquitination levels, although its specific role in substrate degradation is not fully understood (Preston2017The). It interacts with proteins such as p97 and DERLIN-1 and is known to undergo autoubiquitination, suggesting a regulatory function in the ubiquitination process (Preston2017The).

RNF103 is also identified as one of the E3 ligases with multiple transmembrane domains, which are essential for exporting ERAD substrates to the cytosol (Kaneko2016Genomewide). These transmembrane domains are crucial for its function in ERAD, although specific physiological or pathological roles in healthy human cells have not been detailed (Kaneko2016Genomewide). The protein is implicated in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses, primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, its precise functions in these cellular processes remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF103 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The RNF103 protein plays a crucial role in ubiquitination, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by tagging proteins for degradation. Disruptions in this process can lead to the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, contributing to cellular stress and disease pathogenesis.

In cancer, aberrant expression of RNF103 may affect the regulation of proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, potentially leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development. The precise mechanisms by which RNF103 contributes to oncogenesis are still under investigation, but its role in protein degradation suggests it may influence the stability of oncogenes or tumor suppressors.

In neurodegenerative disorders, alterations in RNF103 expression or function can exacerbate the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, a hallmark of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The gene's involvement in cellular stress responses indicates that it may also play a role in the neuronal response to oxidative stress and other damaging stimuli, which are critical factors in the progression of neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
RNF103, a RING finger protein, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s). It interacts with Ubc13 and UbcH7, two E2 enzymes, through its RING-finger domain. The interaction with Ubc13 is stabilized by favorable contacts and electrostatic interactions, such as the contact between W651 in RNF103 and M64 in Ubc13. Similarly, the interaction with UbcH7 is facilitated by the positioning of F63 in UbcH7 fitting into a pocket on RNF103 (Scheper2008Analysis). 

Mutations at specific residues, such as substituting hydrophobic residues V649 and M650 with polar ones, can alter these interactions. This mutation leads to a loss of interaction with UbcH7 while maintaining interaction with Ubc13, indicating the importance of hydrophobic residues in interaction stability and selectivity (Scheper2008Analysis). 

RNF103 also interacts with Derlin-1 and VCP, components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to protein degradation (Nakamura2011The). Additionally, RNF103 has been identified as a specific interactor of Ube2E2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (Ambivero2014Mulan).
