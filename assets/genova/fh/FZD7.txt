# FZD7

## Overview
FZD7 is a gene that encodes the frizzled class receptor 7, a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The FZD7 protein is particularly significant in maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells and is involved in hematopoietic homeostasis and cartilage homeostasis. It interacts with Wnt ligands at the cell membrane to initiate intracellular signaling cascades. Alterations in FZD7 expression have been linked to several cancers, where it contributes to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis by modulating pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled; Asad2014FZD7; Fernandez2014The).

## Structure
The FZD7 protein is a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. Its extracellular region contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) composed of approximately 120 amino acids and 10 conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, creating a compact globular structure primarily made of α-helical secondary structures with a hydrophobic groove (Nile2019Fatty). This CRD is crucial for binding fatty acids and Wnt proteins, with a U-shaped lipid-binding cavity that accommodates fatty acids like C24 (Nile2019Fatty).

The tertiary structure of FZD7 includes a hydrophilic internal cavity important for receptor stability and dynamics, with a conserved cholesterol-binding site that plays a role in structural stabilization and signaling (Schulte2024Structural). The quaternary structure of FZD7 involves the formation of an artificial antiparallel dimer with C2 symmetry, stabilized by lipidic aliphatic chains and cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) (Schulte2024Structural).

Post-translational modifications of FZD7 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's structural plasticity allows for flexibility in the lipid-binding cavity, which may regulate fatty acid binding and selectivity (Nile2019Fatty).

## Function
FZD7 (frizzled class receptor 7) is a receptor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotent state of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It is highly expressed in undifferentiated hESCs and is essential for their self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency. FZD7 transduces Wnt signals to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is necessary for sustaining the expression of pluripotency-associated genes such as OCT4 and NANOG (Fernandez2014The).

In addition to its role in stem cells, FZD7 is expressed in normal adult hematopoietic cells, including bone marrow and peripheral B and T cells, suggesting its involvement in hematopoietic homeostasis (Sercan2010Expression). FZD7 is also implicated in the regulation of chondrocyte phenotype through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, where it influences cartilage homeostasis and potentially osteoarthritis development by modulating β-catenin stabilization (Yang2020MicroRNA1).

FZD7 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with Wnt ligands to initiate intracellular signaling cascades, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FZD7 gene have been implicated in various cancers, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In ovarian cancer, particularly the Stem-A subtype, FZD7 is overexpressed and associated with increased cell proliferation and migration through the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Knockdown of FZD7 in these cancer cells results in reduced proliferation and changes in cell morphology, indicating a shift towards more epithelial characteristics (Asad2014FZD7).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), FZD7 is significantly overexpressed in certain clusters, correlating with higher malignant activity and increased Ki-67 indexes, which are markers of cell proliferation. This suggests that FZD7 may play a role in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting malignancy in these tumors (Fujiya2020Aberrant).

FZD7 is also implicated in colorectal cancer, where its expression is regulated by the tumor microenvironment and β-catenin/TCF4 signaling. This regulation affects tumor growth and cell migration, potentially facilitating metastasis (Vincan2009Variable). In breast cancer, FZD7 expression is positively regulated by sirtuin deacetylases, and its knockdown leads to reduced cell migration and growth, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Simmons2014Frizzled).

## Interactions
FZD7, a member of the frizzled family of receptors, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in Wnt signaling pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, FZD7 interacts specifically with the Wnt3 protein, facilitating the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which show that Wnt3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with full-length FZD7, indicating a specific binding through the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD7 (Kim2008Functional).

In the context of colorectal cancer, FZD7 is involved in a complex with RSPO2, LGR5, and ZNRF3. RSPO2 promotes the degradation of FZD7 through ZNRF3-mediated ubiquitination, which affects noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for regulating FZD7 levels and modulating cancer cell migration and metastasis (Dong2017RSPO2).

In prostate cancer, FZD7 interacts with GIPC2 via its PDZ domain. This interaction is significant for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to cancer metastasis. The binding of GIPC2 to FZD7 suggests a mechanism by which GIPC2 overexpression can enhance Wnt signaling in prostate cancer (Wang2022GIPC2).
