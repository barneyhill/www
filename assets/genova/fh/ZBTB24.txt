# ZBTB24

## Overview
ZBTB24 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 24 protein, which functions as a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including DNA methylation, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage response. The protein is characterized by its BTB domain, AT-hook, and multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and other proteins (Ren2019Structural; Aktar2019Identification). As a transcription factor, ZBTB24 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by recruiting DNA methyltransferases to specific genomic loci and regulating the expression of genes such as CDCA7, which is involved in cell cycle regulation (Thompson2018ZBTB24; Grillo2023ZBTB24). Mutations in the ZBTB24 gene are linked to Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome, highlighting its importance in immune function and development (de2011Mutations).

## Structure
The ZBTB24 protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function as a transcription factor. It contains a BTB domain, an AT-hook, and eight C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) motifs. The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and dimerization, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with corepressor complexes (Aktar2019Identification; Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins). The AT-hook motif facilitates interactions with AT-rich DNA, contributing to the protein's DNA-binding capabilities (Ren2019Structural).

The zinc finger domain of ZBTB24, particularly the ZF5-8 motifs, is crucial for sequence-specific DNA binding. These motifs interact with DNA in the major groove, with ZF7-8 engaging in base-specific interactions (Ren2019Structural). The 6th and 7th ZF motifs are particularly important for the transcriptional activation of the CDCA7 gene (Aktar2019Identification). Mutations in these ZF motifs can disrupt DNA binding and are associated with ICF syndrome, highlighting their functional significance (Ren2019Structural).

The protein's structure is further supported by crystallographic studies, which have elucidated the interactions of the ZF domains with DNA, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context (Ren2019Structural).

## Function
ZBTB24 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining DNA methylation and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in the recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B to centromeric satellite DNA, which is essential for establishing and maintaining correct DNA methylation patterns. This function is critical for centromere integrity and genomic stability (Grillo2023ZBTB24). ZBTB24 predominantly occupies transcription start sites and proximal promoters, acting mainly as a transcriptional activator, and targets specific genes such as CDCA7, RIOK2, and CNPY4, promoting their expression (Grillo2023ZBTB24).

ZBTB24 also plays a role in transcriptional repression at centromeres, maintaining these regions in a silent state, which is essential for chromosomal stability (Grillo2023ZBTB24). It is enriched at active promoters and enhancers, particularly those with high CpG content, and is involved in regulating the expression of genes associated with active transcription (Thompson2018ZBTB24). The gene's function is not limited to immune cells, as it is expressed across a wide range of human tissues, indicating a broader role in cellular homeostasis (Thompson2018ZBTB24).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZBTB24 gene are associated with Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome, specifically type 2 (ICF2). This rare genetic disorder is characterized by primary immunodeficiency, facial anomalies, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. Patients with ICF2 often experience recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections due to hypogammaglobulinemia, despite normal B cell counts (de2011Mutations; Grillo2023ZBTB24). 

ZBTB24 mutations lead to DNA hypomethylation at pericentromeric satellite DNA, resulting in chromosomal instability. This hypomethylation is linked to developmental defects and immune system abnormalities observed in ICF2 patients (Grillo2023ZBTB24). The gene's dysfunction affects the expression of CDCA7, a gene involved in cell cycle regulation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of ICF2 (Wu2016Converging). 

In T cells, ZBTB24 deficiency promotes TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which can be mitigated by blocking TRAIL/TRAIL-R interactions. This suggests that ZBTB24 regulates T-cell apoptosis through the CDCA7/TRAIL-R axis, providing a molecular basis for the T-cell defects observed in ICF2 patients (Qin2019ZBTB24). The clinical significance of ZBTB24 mutations is underscored by their impact on immune function and genomic stability (Thompson2018ZBTB24).

## Interactions
ZBTB24 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and DNA methylation. It interacts with CDCA7, a protein crucial for regulating apoptosis in human T cells. ZBTB24 upregulates CDCA7 expression, which inhibits TRAIL/TRAIL-R-induced apoptosis, highlighting its role in T cell survival (Qin2019ZBTB24).

ZBTB24 also interacts with DNMT3B, a DNA methyltransferase, to regulate DNA methylation. Although ZBTB24 and DNMT3B do not co-bind the same DNA features, they show an association at the gene level, suggesting that ZBTB24 may help recruit DNMT3B to gene bodies (Thompson2018ZBTB24). This interaction is crucial for maintaining DNA methylation at specific loci, with ZBTB24 acting as a transcriptional regulator that coordinates with DNMT3B (Thompson2018ZBTB24).

In the context of DNA damage response, ZBTB24 interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair processes. ZBTB24 binds to PAR chains synthesized by PARP1, facilitating its recruitment to DNA damage sites. This interaction is mediated by the zinc-finger domain of ZBTB24, which is essential for its role in the DNA damage response (Helfricht2020Loss). These interactions underscore ZBTB24's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation, DNA methylation, and DNA repair.
