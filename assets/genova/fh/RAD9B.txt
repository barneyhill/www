# RAD9B

## Overview
RAD9B is a gene that encodes the protein RAD9 checkpoint clamp component B, which is a crucial part of the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) system. This protein functions as a checkpoint regulator, playing a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by recognizing DNA damage and facilitating repair processes. RAD9B is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to DNA repair pathways and the activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), thereby preventing double-strand breaks and ensuring proper cell cycle regulation (Cao2020Loss). Beyond its role in DNA repair, RAD9B is significant in early neural development, influencing neural stem cell differentiation and interacting with pathways related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix, which are essential for neural tube closure (Cao2020Loss). Mutations in RAD9B have been linked to neural tube defects, underscoring its clinical importance in developmental biology and disease (Cao2020Loss).

## Function
The RAD9B gene encodes a protein that is a component of the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex, which plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) system. This complex is essential for maintaining genome integrity by recognizing DNA damage and facilitating repair processes, thereby preventing mutations that could lead to conditions such as cancer (Cao2020Loss). In healthy human cells, RAD9B is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA repair pathways and helps establish a DNA damage checkpoint by activating Chk1, which prevents double-strand breaks (Cao2020Loss).

RAD9B is particularly important in early neural development, where it influences the differentiation of neural stem cell populations. The loss of RAD9B impairs the expression of OCT4, a marker of pluripotency, and leads to abnormal activation of PAX6, affecting neuroectodermal cell fate determination. This dysregulation results in fewer mature neurons and impaired neural differentiation, as evidenced by decreased expression of neural progenitor markers like Nestin and pan-neuronal markers like Tuj1 (Cao2020Loss). RAD9B also plays a role in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interaction pathways, which are crucial for proper organoid formation and neural development (Cao2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAD9B gene have been implicated in the development of neural tube defects (NTDs), particularly spina bifida. Research has shown a significant enrichment of rare deleterious RAD9B variants in individuals with spina bifida compared to unaffected controls. These mutations include frameshift and specific point mutations that disrupt RAD9B's nuclear localization, protein stability, and its ability to activate JNK signaling, all of which are crucial for cell proliferation and neural development (Cao2020Loss). Knockdown experiments in human embryonic stem cells have demonstrated that RAD9B deficiency impairs early neural differentiation and organoid formation, suggesting its critical role in neural tube closure (Cao2020Loss).

The study by Cao et al. is the first to identify a DNA damage response (DDR) gene as a risk factor for NTDs in humans, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying folic acid-resistant NTDs (Cao2020Loss). The findings suggest that RAD9B mutations may contribute to the etiology of spina bifida by disrupting early neural development processes, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in understanding and potentially predicting the risk of such defects (Cao2020Loss).

## Interactions
RAD9B is a component of the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity by participating in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. This complex is involved in activating checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and establishing a DNA damage checkpoint, which is essential for cell cycle regulation and DNA repair (Cao2020Loss). RAD9B interacts with other proteins in the 9-1-1 complex, including RAD1 and HUS1, to form a clamp structure that is recruited to sites of DNA damage. This recruitment facilitates the activation of ATR, a key protein in the DDR pathway, which in turn activates Chk1 (Cao2020Loss).

In addition to its role in the 9-1-1 complex, RAD9B is involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix pathways, which are critical for neural tube closure during early neural development (Cao2020Loss). The protein's interactions extend to influencing the expression of transcription factors such as OCT4 and PAX6, which are important for maintaining pluripotency and determining neuroectodermal cell fate, respectively (Cao2020Loss). These interactions highlight RAD9B's multifaceted role in cellular processes beyond DNA repair.
