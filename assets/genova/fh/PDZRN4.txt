# PDZRN4

## Overview
PDZRN4 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ domain containing ring finger 4, which is a member of the Ligand of Numb Protein-X (LNX) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of PDZ domains and a RING finger domain, which are integral to its function in mediating protein-protein interactions and potential ubiquitin ligase activity. PDZRN4 is primarily involved in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maintenance, where it plays a crucial role in protein trafficking and post-translational modifications. The protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus and interacts with MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for NMJ formation, suggesting its involvement in vesicular transport and protein localization. Additionally, PDZRN4 is implicated in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, where its expression levels are altered, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role. The gene's expression in macrophages and its potential involvement in immune cell function further highlight its diverse biological significance (Hu2015PDZRN4; RosasGarcía2022Distinct; Ham2024Single-nuclei).

## Structure
PDZRN4, also known as PDZ domain containing ring finger 4, is a protein characterized by the presence of PDZ domains and a RING finger domain. The PDZ domains are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various biological processes. PDZRN4 contains one RING domain and two PDZ domains, which are likely derived from its paralogs LNX1 or LNX2 (Hu2015PDZRN4). The PDZ domains in PDZRN4 are involved in interactions with other proteins, such as MuSK, a key protein in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation (Ham2024Single-nuclei).

The protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus, where it may play a role in vesicle transport and protein localization at the NMJ (Ham2024Single-nuclei). PDZRN4 is also associated with post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may influence its function and interactions. The presence of a RING finger domain suggests potential ubiquitin ligase activity, although specific details about this function in PDZRN4 are not provided in the context.

Alternative splicing of the PDZRN4 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context. The protein is relatively conserved across different species, indicating its importance in basic biological activities (Hu2015PDZRN4).

## Function
PDZRN4, also known as PDZ domain containing ring finger 4, plays a significant role in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maintenance. It is involved in protein trafficking and post-translational modification processes, crucial for NMJ integrity. PDZRN4 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and interacts with MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for NMJ formation. This interaction suggests that PDZRN4 acts as a tether between the Golgi and MuSK, potentially prolonging MuSK's residence time at the Golgi for post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation (Ham2024Single-nuclei).

PDZRN4 is associated with vesicle-like structures and colocalizes with microtubules, indicating its involvement in vesicular transport. Overexpression of PDZRN4 can lead to mislocalization of acetylcholine receptors and MuSK, while knockout results in NMJ fragmentation, highlighting its role in maintaining NMJ protein localization (Ham2024Single-nuclei).

In addition to its role in NMJ maintenance, PDZRN4 is expressed in macrophages under baseline conditions, suggesting a potential role in immune cell function, although specific details in healthy human cells remain unclear (RosasGarcía2022Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
PDZRN4, also known as PDZ domain containing ring finger 4, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PDZRN4 is significantly down-regulated, with studies showing that its ectopic expression inhibits the proliferation of HCC cells, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Hu2015PDZRN4). Similarly, in breast cancer, low PDZRN4 expression correlates with malignant progression and poor survival rates, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor (Hong2020The).

In rectal adenocarcinoma, PDZRN4 expression is reduced, possibly due to increased methylation and targeting by miRNAs such as mir-182, which may contribute to tumor development (Hua2017Abnormal). PDZRN4 mutations are also associated with tumor development in brain metastasis of colorectal cancer (Hong2020The).

In contrast, PDZRN4 expression is elevated in papillary thyroid carcinoma following childhood radiation exposure, possibly as a feedback response to suppress tumor development (Hong2020The). Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PDZRN4 has been linked to increased susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, suggesting its potential role as a novel biallelic marker for the disease (Hong2020The).

## Interactions
PDZRN4, also known as LNX4, is a member of the Ligand of Numb Protein-X (LNX) family, which includes proteins characterized by the presence of RING and PDZ domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing PDZRN4 to potentially engage in various cellular processes. Although specific interactions of PDZRN4 are not detailed extensively, it is suggested that PDZRN4 may interact with members of the frizzled family of proteins, which are involved in Wnt signaling pathways. This interaction is predicted based on sequence-based analysis, indicating that PDZRN4 could play a role in modulating Wnt signaling through its interactions with frizzled proteins such as FZD1, FZD2, FZD4, FZD7, and FZD10 (Hui2013Predicting).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PDZRN4 is down-regulated, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor. While specific protein interactions in HCC are not detailed, the down-regulation of PDZRN4 in cancerous tissues implies that its interactions may be crucial in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining normal cellular functions (Hu2015PDZRN4).
