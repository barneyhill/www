# SSU72L6

## Overview
SSU72L6 is a gene that encodes the protein SSU72 like 6, which is part of the phosphatase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and RNA processing. The SSU72 like 6 protein shares structural similarities with other phosphatases, which are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from molecules, a critical function in cellular signaling and metabolism. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation and possibly in oncogenic processes (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific functions and interactions of SSU72L6 in human biology.
