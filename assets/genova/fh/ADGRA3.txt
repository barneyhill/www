# ADGRA3

## Overview
ADGRA3, also known as GPR125, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A3, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain and a large extracellular N-terminus, which facilitates cell adhesion and signaling. ADGRA3 is involved in various cellular processes, including Wnt signaling, cell polarity, and adipose tissue thermogenesis. It plays a significant role in the biogenesis of beige adipocytes and is implicated in the PKA-CREB signaling pathway, which is crucial for thermogenesis. The receptor undergoes constitutive endocytosis in a β-arrestin-independent, clathrin-dependent manner, which is essential for regulating its surface expression and function. ADGRA3's expression and interactions have been linked to several clinical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia, female reproductive health issues, and kidney diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent; El‑Masry2020RNA; Zhao2024Constitutively; CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

## Structure
ADGRA3, also known as GPR125, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) and a large extracellular N-terminus with adhesion properties. The receptor undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage at the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS), resulting in an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) that remain noncovalently linked. This structural feature is crucial for the receptor's function, as the NTF's position relative to the CTF allows the Stachel sequence to act as a tethered agonist (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent; Knapp2019Affinity).

The extracellular region of ADGRA3 often contains domains like the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is common among aGPCRs. The receptor is involved in Wnt signaling and cell polarity, and its structural features are important for its biological functions, including its role in cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor or have oncogenic effects depending on the cancer type (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent).

Post-translational modifications of ADGRA3 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are typical for proteins in this family, although specific modifications for ADGRA3 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's structure and function are influenced by its ability to undergo constitutive endocytosis in a β-arrestin-independent but clathrin-dependent manner (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent).

## Function
ADGRA3, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A3, is involved in several critical molecular processes in human cells. It is predominantly expressed in adipocytes, with higher expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) compared to white adipose tissue (WAT). ADGRA3 plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis and the biogenesis of beige adipocytes. Knockdown of ADGRA3 in pre-adipocytes results in decreased expression of thermogenesis and lipolysis-related genes, reduced UCP1 expression, fewer mitochondria, increased lipid droplets, and decreased glucose uptake. Conversely, overexpression of ADGRA3 enhances UCP1 expression, increases mitochondria, reduces lipid droplets, and boosts glucose uptake and oxygen consumption (Zhao2024Constitutively).

ADGRA3 is also implicated in the activation of the PKA-CREB signaling pathway, which is crucial for adipocyte thermogenesis and the biogenesis of beige adipocytes. This receptor couples with the Gs protein, leading to cAMP production and activation of this pathway (Zhao2024Constitutively). In human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, ADGRA3 knockdown reduces UCP1 expression and mitochondrial number, while its overexpression enhances these features, indicating its role in promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis (Zhao2024Constitutively).

ADGRA3 is expressed on the cell surface and undergoes constitutive endocytosis in a β-arrestin-independent, clathrin-dependent manner. This process is important for controlling receptor surface expression and accessibility for ligands, contributing to its biological functions (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent).

## Clinical Significance
ADGRA3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ADGRA3 is significantly upregulated, with a log 2 fold change of 5.25, suggesting its potential role in the disease's progression and as a target for further research (El‑Masry2020RNA). 

In female reproductive health, ADGRA3 deficiency in mice leads to a high incidence of imperforate vagina, a condition where the vaginal opening fails to develop, resulting in infertility. This condition is linked to altered estrogen signaling and a reduction in progesterone receptor expression, indicating ADGRA3's critical role in vaginal tissue remodeling and canalization (Kvam2024High).

ADGRA3 is also associated with kidney diseases. It is upregulated in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), suggesting its involvement in these conditions. The gene's expression is notably higher in chRCC, indicating a potential role in the development and progression of renal cell carcinoma (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

## Interactions
ADGRA3, also known as GPR125, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and cellular processes. It undergoes constitutive endocytosis in a clathrin-dependent manner, independent of β-arrestins, which are typically involved in receptor internalization. This suggests that ADGRA3 may interact with clathrin or other proteins involved in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent).

ADGRA3 has been shown to interact with β-arrestin-2, although this interaction is limited and not as strong as with other proteins like US28. The recruitment of β-arrestin-2 is not significant enough to facilitate its internalization, indicating that ADGRA3's endocytosis is largely arrestin-independent (Spiess2019Arrestin‐independent).

In terms of intracellular interactions, ADGRA3 has been associated with various intracellular membrane networks, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. These associations suggest potential roles in intracellular signaling or trafficking, although specific protein partners in these interactions are not detailed (Knapp2019Affinity).

ADGRA3 also interacts with scaffold proteins, such as those containing PDZ domains, which may play a role in synaptic localization and function (Knapp2019Affinity).
