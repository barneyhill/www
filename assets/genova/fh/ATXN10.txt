# ATXN10

## Overview
The ATXN10 gene encodes the protein ataxin 10, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and Golgi membrane dynamics. Ataxin 10 is a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with key mitotic kinases, such as Aurora B and Polo-like kinase 1, to facilitate its role in cell division. It is also implicated in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, as well as in embryonic heart development and epithelial cell maintenance in adult organs. Mutations in the ATXN10 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The gene's involvement in other conditions, such as parkinsonism, highlights its clinical significance and the complexity of its genetic interactions (BentleyFord2021ATXN10; Tian2015Aurora; Schüle2017Parkinson’s).

## Function
Ataxin-10, encoded by the ATXN10 gene, plays a significant role in several cellular processes, particularly in cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division. It interacts with key mitotic kinases such as Aurora B and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which phosphorylate Ataxin-10 to facilitate its function in cytokinesis. This phosphorylation is crucial for the proper localization of Ataxin-10 to the midbody, a structure that forms during cytokinesis, and is essential for successful cell division (Tian2015Aurora).

In addition to its role in cytokinesis, Ataxin-10 is involved in Golgi membrane dynamics. It is associated with the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle for protein and lipid modification and transport. Ataxin-10 co-localizes with Golgi markers and is membrane-bound, indicating its specific association with Golgi membranes. Its depletion leads to Golgi dispersal, suggesting a role in maintaining Golgi structure and function during cell division (Tian2017Ataxin10).

Ataxin-10 is also implicated in embryonic heart development and the maintenance of epithelial cell phenotypes in adult organs such as the kidney and pancreas. Its loss results in severe developmental and physiological abnormalities, highlighting its essential role in maintaining normal cellular functions (BentleyFord2021ATXN10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATXN10 gene are primarily associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and seizures. This condition is caused by an expansion of ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene. In affected individuals, the number of repeats ranges from 800 to 4500, compared to 10 to 29 in the normal population (Teive2011Spinocerebellar; Matsuura2000Large). The disease exhibits phenotypic variability, with some families experiencing seizures, while others do not. This variability is not solely explained by the size of the repeat expansions, suggesting other genetic or environmental factors may influence the clinical presentation (Teive2011Spinocerebellar).

In addition to SCA10, alterations in ATXN10 have been linked to other conditions. A study identified a family with ATXN10 expansions where some members exhibited typical SCA10 symptoms, while others presented with early-onset parkinsonism or remained asymptomatic despite carrying large repeat expansions. The presence or absence of repeat interruptions may influence these clinical outcomes, with interruptions potentially contributing to epilepsy and their absence to parkinsonism (Schüle2017Parkinson’s).

## Interactions
Ataxin 10 (ATXN10) is known to interact with several proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with the G-protein β2 subunit (Gb2), which has been shown to induce neuritogenesis by activating the Ras-MAP kinase-Elk-1 signaling cascade in PC12 cells. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies in mammalian cells (Waragai2006Ataxin).

ATXN10 also interacts with Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates ATXN10 at serine 12 (S12). This phosphorylation promotes its interaction with Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a crucial step for cytokinesis. The interaction between ATXN10 and Plk1 is essential for proper cell division, as demonstrated by the inability of a non-phosphorylatable S12A mutant to rescue cytokinesis defects (Tian2015Aurora).

Additionally, ATXN10 has been implicated in interactions with proteins involved in Golgi membrane dynamics and ciliary function, although its exact role in these processes remains less clear (Tian2017Ataxin10).
