# REEP5

## Overview
REEP5, or Receptor Expression Enhancing Protein 5, is a gene that encodes a membrane protein known as receptor accessory protein 5. This protein is primarily localized to the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) in cardiac myocytes, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of the SR/ER network. As a member of the ER morphogen family, REEP5 is involved in shaping the ER membrane, which is essential for various cellular processes, including protein and lipid synthesis, as well as calcium cycling, all of which are vital for proper cardiac function (Angelotti2022Exploring; Lee2020REEP5). The protein features a reticulon homology domain (RHD) that facilitates the formation of high membrane curvature, crucial for the differentiated SR network in cardiac cells (Angelotti2022Exploring). REEP5's interactions with other proteins, such as reticulon and atlastin family members, underscore its importance in maintaining ER integrity and function, with implications for cardiac health and disease (Lee2020REEP5).

## Structure
REEP5 is a conserved membrane protein primarily localized to the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) in cardiac myocytes. It features a reticulon homology domain (RHD) that forms dual hairpin structures, which are crucial for inducing and stabilizing high membrane curvature in ER tubules (Angelotti2022Exploring; Lee2020REEP5). The protein's topology includes four hydrophobic, hairpin transmembrane domains connected by a hydrophilic segment, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytosol (Lee2020REEP5). 

The C-terminal domain of REEP5 is essential for maintaining ER membrane structure, as its truncation leads to ER luminal vacuolization (Lee2020REEP5). REEP5 can form dimers, potentially through disulfide bridges, and its dimerization is important for its functionality in marking the ER network (Lee2020REEP5). It may form homodimers or heterodimers with other proteins or isoforms (Lee2020REEP5). 

REEP5 lacks a microtubule-binding domain, distinguishing it from other REEP family members like REEP1-4, and it does not interact with microtubules (Angelotti2022Exploring). The protein is involved in intracellular trafficking and processing of cargo proteins, classifying it as an ER morphogen (Angelotti2022Exploring).

## Function
REEP5 is a membrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) in cardiac muscle cells. It is involved in shaping the ER membrane, which is essential for various cellular processes such as protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and calcium cycling, all of which are vital for proper cardiac function (Lee2020REEP5; Lee2020Towards). REEP5 localizes to the SR/ER network, particularly in areas responsible for protein synthesis and calcium cycling, which are critical for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes (Lee2020Towards).

In cardiac myocytes, REEP5 is highly expressed and co-localizes with known SR markers, indicating its role in regulating SR function (Lee2020REEP5). It interacts with other SR/ER-shaping proteins, such as reticulon and atlastin family members, to maintain the differentiated SR network in cardiac cells (Lee2020REEP5). The protein's C-terminal domain is particularly important for stabilizing SR/ER morphology, and its absence leads to structural impairments such as SR vacuolization and disrupted SR membranes (Lee2020REEP5).

REEP5 is also implicated in regulating cardiac cell stress responses, with its depletion linked to increased reactive oxygen species, disrupted calcium cycles, and elevated ER stress markers (Lee2020Towards). These functions highlight REEP5's essential role in maintaining SR/ER organization and function in cardiac cells, which is crucial for normal cardiac function and development (Lee2020REEP5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the REEP5 gene have been linked to various cardiac conditions. REEP5 is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) in cardiac myocytes. Depletion of REEP5 in mice leads to significant cardiac dysfunction, including myocardial dilatation, reduced cardiac ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output. These changes are accompanied by elevated expression of ER stress markers and proteins associated with ER stress-induced apoptosis (Lee2020REEP5). In zebrafish, REEP5 depletion results in cardiac abnormalities, such as arrhythmogenic beating rhythms and atrioventricular conduction defects, which are associated with poor survival rates (Lee2020REEP5).

Altered REEP5 expression is observed in various cardiac diseases. In mouse models, REEP5 levels decrease in severe dilated cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction, while in humans, ischemic cardiomyopathy shows similar downregulation. Conversely, inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy in humans is associated with upregulated REEP5 expression (Lee2020REEP5). These findings suggest that REEP5 plays a significant role in the progression of heart disease, potentially through its involvement in maintaining SR/ER integrity and function. Disruptions in REEP5 interactions with other SR/ER proteins, such as RTN4 and ATL3, further contribute to cardiac dysfunction (Lee2020REEP5).

## Interactions
REEP5 is known to participate in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) integrity. It interacts with proteins such as reticulon (RTN) and atlastin (ATL) family members, including RTN4 (Nogo-A/B), RTN3, and ATL2, which are involved in ER shaping. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that REEP5 physically associates with Nogo isoforms and other proteins like ATL3 and CKAP4, a sheet-ER stabilizing protein (Lee2020REEP5).

In the context of myocardial infarction, REEP5 interacts with CLEC5A, a protein that promotes cardiac dysfunction. CLEC5A binds to REEP5 and accelerates its degradation, thereby modulating REEP5's protective effects against ER stress-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. This interaction is significant as it suggests a regulatory mechanism where CLEC5A downregulates REEP5 levels, impacting myocardial function (Wang2024REEP5).

Additionally, REEP5 has been shown to interact with CXCR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor, enhancing IL-8-stimulated responses in lung cancer cells. This interaction is specific to CXCR1 and does not occur with CXCR2, highlighting REEP5's role in receptor-specific signaling pathways (Park2016The).
