# CYB561D2

## Overview
CYB561D2 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome b561 family member D2, which belongs to the cytochrome b561 family of transmembrane electron transfer proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in redox reactions within secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ascorbate to various substrates, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining intracellular redox balance (Zhou2016miRNA216; Asard2013Cytochromesb561:). The CYB561D2 protein is implicated in cellular responses to environmental stressors and is regulated by microRNAs, which modulate its expression under stress conditions (Zhou2016miRNA216; Huang2014MicroRNA‐155). Additionally, CYB561D2 has been associated with tumor suppression, particularly in lung cancer, and is involved in interactions that influence tumor biology, such as its interaction with the STAT3 signaling pathway in gliomas (Zhou2016miRNA216; Tao2021CYB561D2). These characteristics underscore the gene's significance in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Function
The CYB561D2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cytochrome b561 family, which are transmembrane electron transfer proteins involved in various physiological processes. CYB561D2 is primarily active in the secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, where it participates in redox reactions by transferring electrons from ascorbate to monodehydroascorbate radicals or other substrates (Zhou2016miRNA216; Asard2013Cytochromesb561:). This protein is involved in the regeneration of ascorbate, a potent antioxidant, and plays a role in maintaining intracellular redox balance (Tao2021CYB561D2).

CYB561D2 is also implicated in the cellular response to environmental stressors and chemical exposure. It is regulated by microRNAs such as miR-155, miR-216b, and miR-499, which can modulate its expression in response to stressors like fipronil exposure (Zhou2016miRNA216; Huang2014MicroRNA‐155). The protein's expression is associated with tumor suppression, as it has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and proliferation in lung cancer cells (Zhou2016miRNA216). These functions highlight CYB561D2's role in both normal cellular processes and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
The CYB561D2 gene is clinically significant due to its association with gliomas, a type of brain tumor. Studies have shown that CYB561D2 expression is up-regulated in glioma tissues compared to normal tissues, with higher expression levels correlating with more aggressive tumor grades and shorter patient survival times (Tao2021CYB561D2). This up-regulation is induced by reactive oxygen species, specifically hydrogen peroxide, which activates the STAT3 signaling pathway. This activation leads to the expression of immunosuppressive genes such as PD-L1, CCL2, and TDO2, contributing to tumor aggression and immunosuppression (Tao2021CYB561D2).

Knock-down experiments of CYB561D2 in glioma cell lines have demonstrated reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, while promoting apoptosis, indicating its role in aggressive tumor behavior (Tao2021CYB561D2). In an intracranial glioma model, over-expression of CYB561D2 was associated with reduced survival, an effect that could be mitigated by inhibiting STAT3, suggesting that CYB561D2's effects are mediated through this pathway (Tao2021CYB561D2). These findings highlight CYB561D2 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in gliomas.

## Interactions
CYB561D2, a member of the cytochrome b561 family, is involved in various interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In gliomas, CYB561D2 interacts with the transcription factor STAT3, a key player in cancer pathogenesis. Knockdown of CYB561D2 in glioma cell lines results in reduced levels of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), suggesting a functional interaction that is crucial for the aggressive behavior of glioma cells. This interaction is significant as it regulates gene expression related to tumor aggression and immunosuppression, such as PD-L1, CCL2, and TDO2 (Tao2021CYB561D2).

In zebrafish, CYB561D2 is targeted by microRNA-155 (miR-155), which binds to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of cyb561d2 mRNA, leading to decreased expression of CYB561D2 at both mRNA and protein levels. This interaction was confirmed through luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analyses, demonstrating that miR-155 directly regulates CYB561D2 expression (Huang2014MicroRNA‐155). These interactions highlight the regulatory mechanisms involving CYB561D2 in response to environmental stress and its role in tumor biology.
