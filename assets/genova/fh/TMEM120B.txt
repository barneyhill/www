# TMEM120B

## Overview
TMEM120B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 120B, which is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and a coiled-coil domain, classifying it as a transmembrane protein (Hu2024TMEM120B). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways such as TAZ and mTOR, which are crucial for cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness, particularly in the context of cancer (Hu2024TMEM120B). TMEM120B interacts with myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), playing a significant role in maintaining breast cancer cell stemness and chemotherapy resistance (Hu2024TMEM120B). Additionally, TMEM120B is implicated in other conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and neurological disorders, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Labonne2016An; Huang2018Construction).

## Structure
TMEM120B is a transmembrane protein composed of six transmembrane domains and a coil-coil domain (Hu2024TMEM120B). The protein shares a homo-dimeric assembly with TMEM120A, with nearly identical structures and a root-mean-square distance (r.m.s.d.) of 0.82 Å over 293 Cα atoms (Ke2021CryoEM). The transmembrane domain (TMD) of each protomer contains six transmembrane helices, which enclose a large solvent-accessible cytosol-facing cavity. The dimeric assembly is stabilized by extensive interactions in both the coiled coil domain (CCD) and TMD, with most residues in the dimer interface being highly conserved between TMEM120A and TMEM120B (Ke2021CryoEM).

The coil-coil domain in TMEM120B is essential for its binding to MYH9, which influences the TAZ and mTOR signaling pathways, affecting cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness (Hu2024TMEM120B). TMEM120B is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, contrary to its expected nuclear localization (Hu2024TMEM120B). The protein's interaction with MYH9 is crucial for its oncogenic role, and the coil-coil domain in both proteins is essential for their interaction (Hu2024TMEM120B).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM120B has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In breast cancer, TMEM120B is highly expressed and is associated with advanced cancer stages, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Its overexpression enhances breast cancer cell stemness and resistance to chemotherapy through the β1-integrin/FAK-TAZ-mTOR signaling axis by binding to MYH9, which stabilizes MYH9 and prevents its degradation (Hu2024TMEM120B). This interaction contributes to the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells, as well as resistance to chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel and doxorubicin (Hu2024TMEM120B).

In osteosarcoma, TMEM120B has been identified with a nonsynonymous mutation (c.G274A/p.D92N) in tumor tissue, suggesting a potential role in the disease. This mutation is associated with decreased mRNA expression in tumor tissues compared to controls, although its exact function remains unclear (Reimann2014Whole).

TMEM120B is also involved in neurological phenotypes. It shows widespread expression in the human brain, particularly in the cerebellum, and its transcript levels are reduced in patients with a 12q24.31 microdeletion, which is linked to intellectual disabilities and other neurological disorders (Labonne2016An).

## Interactions
TMEM120B interacts with myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) through its coil-coil domain, which is crucial for maintaining breast cancer cell stemness and chemotherapy resistance. This interaction stabilizes MYH9 by preventing its degradation via a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism involving CUL9, an E3-ubiquitin ligase. The stabilization of MYH9 by TMEM120B enhances the assembly of focal adhesions and facilitates the translocation of TAZ, a transcriptional co-activator, thereby activating the β1-integrin/FAK-TAZ-mTOR signaling axis. This signaling pathway is significant for promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness, as well as increasing resistance to chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel and doxorubicin (Hu2024TMEM120B).

In the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), TMEM120B is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving PWRN2 and miR-92b-3p. PWRN2, a long non-coding RNA, interacts with miR-92b-3p, which in turn targets TMEM120B. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where miR-92b-3p suppresses TMEM120B expression by binding to its 3' UTR, indicating a potential role in the regulation of TMEM120B expression in PCOS cumulus cells (Huang2018Construction).
