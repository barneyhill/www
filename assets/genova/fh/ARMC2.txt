# ARMC2

## Overview
The ARMC2 gene encodes the armadillo repeat containing 2 protein, which is a conserved protein characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in pulmonary function and spermatogenesis. In the respiratory system, ARMC2 is implicated in the regulation of inflammation and autoimmune processes, potentially influencing conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Huang2021ARMC). In the reproductive system, ARMC2 is essential for the proper formation and function of sperm flagella, with mutations in the gene leading to multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF) and male infertility (Wang2022Patient). Additionally, ARMC2 is involved in the intraflagellar transport of radial spokes, a function primarily studied in model organisms like Chlamydomonas (Lechtreck2022Chlamydomonas). The protein's interactions with various partners, including transcription factors and proteins involved in apoptosis and inflammation, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular physiology (Huang2021ARMC).

## Structure
The ARMC2 protein, encoded by the Cre12.g559300 gene, is a conserved armadillo-repeat protein with a molecular weight of approximately 107 kD. Its structure includes both intrinsically disordered and structured regions. The N-terminal region, comprising about 400 residues, is largely intrinsically disordered and contains ten phosphorylation sites identified through phosphoproteomics. The C-terminal region, consisting of approximately 600 residues, is predominantly α-helical and includes three armadillo repeats, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Lechtreck2021ChlamydomonasARMC2PF27).

Mass spectrometry analysis of ARMC2 confirmed the presence of these structural features, with the protein migrating at around 160 kD in Western blots, consistent with its predicted size. The experimental peptides covered 42% of the predicted protein, spanning all but one of the 17 predicted exons (Lechtreck2021ChlamydomonasARMC2PF27).

ARMC2 is highly conserved in primates, with a 99% identity between gorillas and humans, suggesting a significant evolutionary role, particularly in pulmonary function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Huang2021ARMC). The protein's armadillo repeats form a superhelical structure, facilitating interactions with various partners (Gul2016Metazoan).

## Function
The ARMC2 gene encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of pulmonary function and spermatogenesis. In the lungs, ARMC2 is associated with pulmonary function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may regulate inflammation and autoimmune processes within lung tissue, interacting with proteins like PYCARD to modulate inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining healthy pulmonary function (Huang2021ARMC).

In the reproductive system, ARMC2 plays a significant role in spermatogenesis. It is specifically expressed in the testis and is involved in the formation and function of sperm flagella. Mutations in ARMC2 can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF), affecting sperm motility and leading to male infertility. The protein interacts with several other proteins, such as CEP78, PGAM5, RHOA, FXR1, and SKIV2L2, which are crucial for normal sperm function (Wang2022Patient).

ARMC2 is also implicated in the intraflagellar transport of radial spokes in flagella, a process essential for the proper assembly and function of these structures, although this role is primarily studied in model organisms like Chlamydomonas (Lechtreck2022Chlamydomonas).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARMC2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. ARMC2 is associated with pulmonary function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A genome-wide association study identified a connection between ARMC2 and COPD, suggesting that ARMC2 may play a role in inhibiting COPD progression through the NRF1/ARMC2/PYCARD/caspase&NF-κB pathway (Huang2021ARMC).

In the context of reproductive health, ARMC2 mutations are implicated in Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Flagella (MMAF), a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility due to aberrant flagellar phenotypes. ARMC2 is involved in protein degradation and sperm localization, contributing to MMAF (Graziani2024Genetic). Studies in mice have shown that homozygous knockout of Armc2 results in specific alterations in sperm nuclear morphology, affecting sperm head shape and flagellum biogenesis (Martinez2021Oligogenic).

Additionally, ARMC2 variants are associated with severe asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition affecting sperm morphology and motility (Rehman2022The). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both respiratory and reproductive health.

## Interactions
The ARMC2 protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor NRF1, which binds to the ARMC2 promoter to activate its expression, suggesting a regulatory role in pulmonary function and potentially inhibiting COPD progression (Huang2021ARMC). ARMC2 also binds with PYCARD, a protein crucial in apoptosis and inflammation, through pyrin and CARD domains. This interaction may interfere with PYCARD's activating effects, indicating a possible inhibitory role in inflammatory pathways (Huang2021ARMC).

In the context of Chlamydomonas, ARMC2 functions as a cargo adapter for intraflagellar transport (IFT) of radial spokes, interacting specifically with the spoke protein RSP3. This interaction is essential for the transport of radial spokes into flagella, as ARMC2 and RSP3 co-migrate on anterograde IFT trains (Lechtreck2022Chlamydomonas). In mammals, ARMC2 is associated with male infertility and reduced lung function, with mutations leading to sperm malformations (Lechtreck2022Chlamydomonas). Additionally, ARMC2 interacts with proteins such as CEP78, PGAM5, RHOA, FXR1, and SKIV2L2, which may be involved in spermatogenesis (Wang2022Patient).
