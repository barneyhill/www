# DTWD1

## Overview
DTWD1 (DTW domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in human cells. The protein, also named DTW domain containing 1, is primarily responsible for the introduction of the 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U) modification at position 20 in specific tRNAs, such as those for cysteine and tyrosine. This modification is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and functional efficiency of tRNAs during protein synthesis (Takakura2019Biogenesis). DTWD1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, indicating that the acp3U modification occurs there (Takakura2019Biogenesis). The protein is part of the TDD domain superfamily, characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, and is implicated in RNA processing and protein degradation pathways (Burroughs2014Analysis; Baek2024Unveiling). The physiological significance of DTWD1 is highlighted by its role in supporting normal cell growth, as evidenced by growth retardation in cells lacking both DTWD1 and its homolog DTWD2 (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

## Structure


## Function
DTWD1 (DTW domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the modification of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in human cells. The protein is primarily responsible for introducing the 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine (acp 3 U) modification at position 20 in tRNAs, specifically in tRNAs for cysteine (Cys) and tyrosine (Tyr) (Takakura2019Biogenesis). This modification is crucial for the biogenesis of aminocarboxypropyluridine in tRNA, which plays a role in stabilizing the tRNA structure and ensuring accurate and efficient translation (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

DTWD1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, suggesting that the acp 3 U20 formation occurs there (Takakura2019Biogenesis). Despite its role in tRNA modification, the loss of acp 3 U modification does not affect the steady-state level of tRNAs, indicating that it does not impact tRNA stability (Takakura2019Biogenesis). The DTWD1 protein is also associated with RNA processing, potentially contributing to the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Burroughs2014Analysis). The physiological importance of DTWD1 is underscored by the growth retardation observed in cells lacking both DTWD1 and its homolog DTWD2, highlighting its role in supporting normal cell growth (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

## Interactions
DTWD1 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of the TDD domain superfamily, which is characterized by RNA-binding capabilities, suggesting that DTWD1 may interact with RNA through zinc-chelating domains like the Zn-knuckle (Burroughs2014Analysis). This interaction is further supported by its role in the biogenesis of aminocarboxypropyluridine (acp3U) in tRNA, where DTWD1 is responsible for introducing acp3U at position 20 in tRNAs, indicating a direct interaction with tRNA molecules (Takakura2019Biogenesis).

DTWD1 also forms a compound-dependent ternary complex with CRBN when molecular glues such as pomalidomide and FPFT-2216 are used. This interaction leads to the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of DTWD1 by the CRL4 complex, highlighting its role in targeted protein degradation pathways (Baek2024Unveiling). The structural analysis suggests that DTWD1 has a G-loop that facilitates binding to IMiD-CRBN, although the initial clash score was high, indicating a complex interaction mechanism (Baek2024Unveiling). These interactions underscore DTWD1's involvement in both RNA processing and protein degradation pathways.
