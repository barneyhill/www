# MACROH2A1

## Overview
The MACROH2A1 gene encodes the macroH2A.1 histone, a variant of the canonical histone H2A, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin architecture and gene regulation. This histone variant is characterized by its unique tripartite structure, comprising an N-terminal histone-fold domain, an unstructured linker region, and a large C-terminal macrodomain. The macroH2A.1 protein exists in two isoforms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, which differ in their ability to bind NAD+ derived metabolites, influencing their functional roles in cellular processes. MacroH2A.1 is involved in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and cellular differentiation, and it interacts with various proteins to modulate these processes. The gene's expression and the functional roles of its protein product have significant implications in health and disease, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Sun2019Histone; Giallongo2021Phosphorylation; HurtadoBagès2018The).

## Structure
The MACROH2A1 gene encodes a histone variant known as macroH2A1, which is characterized by a unique tripartite structure. This structure includes an N-terminal histone-fold domain (HFD), an unstructured linker region, and a large C-terminal macrodomain (Sun2019Histone; HurtadoBagès2018The). The histone-fold domain is similar to that of canonical H2A, allowing macroH2A1 to integrate into chromatin (Rack2016Macrodomains:). The macrodomain is significantly larger than the histone-fold domain and is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and gene regulation (Ruiz2018MacroH2A1; Sun2019Histone).

MacroH2A1 exists in two splice variant isoforms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, which differ in a 30-amino-acid region within the macrodomain (Giallongo2021Phosphorylation; HurtadoBagès2018The). The macroH2A1.1 isoform can bind NAD+ derived metabolites such as ADP-ribose, while macroH2A1.2 lacks this capability (Giallongo2021Phosphorylation; HurtadoBagès2018The). The macrodomain of macroH2A1.1 has a narrower binding pocket compared to macroH2A1.2, influencing ligand recognition and binding affinities (Giallongo2021Phosphorylation).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, occur within the linker region and can influence the protein's interactions and functions (Giallongo2021Phosphorylation). These structural features and modifications contribute to the distinct functional roles of the macroH2A1 isoforms in chromatin regulation and cellular processes.

## Function
The MACROH2A1 gene encodes a histone variant involved in chromatin modification and gene regulation. This variant, particularly its isoforms macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation by replacing canonical histones, thereby imparting specific properties to chromatin. MacroH2A1 is associated with repressed chromatin and is often found in regions marked by H3K27 trimethylation, a hallmark of facultative heterochromatin (Gamble2009The). Despite its association with transcriptional repression, macroH2A1 can also positively regulate the expression of certain genes, particularly those responsive to external stimuli (Gamble2009The).

MacroH2A1.1 interacts with the PARP1 enzyme, a cellular stress sensor, influencing cellular NAD+ pools and supporting mitochondrial function. This interaction is crucial for maintaining optimal NAD+ levels, which are essential for various metabolic processes, including glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration (HurtadoBagès2018The). MacroH2A1.1 is also involved in the regulation of stress response genes and plays a role in cellular differentiation and development (HurtadoBagès2018The).

In terms of organismal outcomes, macroH2A1 isoforms have distinct roles in lipid metabolism. MacroH2A1.1 is associated with lipid accumulation, while macroH2A1.2 inhibits adipogenesis and promotes leanness, suggesting a protective role against obesity (Pazienza2016Histone).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MACROH2A1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In uveal melanoma (UM), increased expression of macroH2A1 is associated with greater tumor aggressiveness. The gene regulates mitochondrial metabolism, and its loss reduces UM cell proliferation and aggressiveness by inhibiting mitochondrial function. This suggests that macroH2A1 acts as an oncoprotein in UM (Giallongo2020Loss). In contrast, in cutaneous melanoma, macroH2A1 functions as a tumor suppressor, highlighting its diverse roles in different cancer types (Giallongo2020Loss).

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), macroH2A1.1, a splice variant of MACROH2A1, is crucial for normal ribosomal protein gene expression. Its deficiency leads to hematopoietic defects, including anemia and neutropenia, by affecting ribosomal biogenesis and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. This deficiency is often observed in MDS patients with a 5q deletion or the U2AF1 S34F mutation (Bereshchenko2019Deficiency).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high macroH2A1.1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for tumor metastasis (Lavigne2014Increased).

## Interactions
The MACROH2A1 protein, a variant of histone H2A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence chromatin structure and gene regulation. It interacts with the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) through its MATH domain, forming a complex with CULLIN3, which results in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This complex facilitates the ubiquitination of MACROH2A1, indicating its role in protein degradation pathways (HernándezMuñoz2005Stable).

MACROH2A1 also interacts with the mitotic kinase VRK1 during interphase, suppressing VRK1's activity and reducing phosphorylation of histone H3 at specific sites. This interaction is mediated by the macrodomain of MACROH2A1, which competes with histone H3 for VRK1 binding (Kim2012Macro).

The isoform macroH2A1.1 interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair, such as PARP1 and XRCC1, enhancing the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This interaction is crucial for DNA damage response and repair, as demonstrated by increased DNA damage in macroH2A1.1 knockout models (Giallongo2022Histone).

Additionally, MACROH2A1 interacts with the transcriptional coactivator PELP1, influencing gene expression regulation. This interaction is significant in chromatin-associated processes, affecting transcription and chromatin structure maintenance (Hussey2014The).
