# CX3CL1

## Overview
CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, is a gene that encodes the C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1, a unique transmembrane chemokine involved in both cell adhesion and signaling. The protein exists in two forms: a membrane-bound form that facilitates cell-to-cell adhesion and a soluble form that acts as a chemotactic agent. CX3CL1 is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes a chemokine domain, a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail, each contributing to its diverse biological functions (Ostuni2014CX3CL1). The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis plays a significant role in immune surveillance, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and inflammatory conditions (Subbarayan2022CX3CL1CX3CR1; Liu2016Role; Corcione2012CX3CL1fractalkine).

## Structure
The CX3CL1 protein, also known as fractalkine, is a multi-domain transmembrane chemokine involved in cell adhesion and signaling. It consists of a chemokine domain (CD), a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a cytosolic tail (Ostuni2014CX3CL1). The chemokine domain, comprising 76 residues, is a globular structure maintained by two disulfide bridges, facilitating high-affinity binding to the CX3CR1 receptor (Ostuni2014CX3CL1).

The mucin stalk, which is 241 residues long, is highly glycosylated, allowing the chemokine domain to extend beyond the cell membrane and interact effectively with its receptor (Ostuni2014CX3CL1). Glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification that enhances the adhesive properties of CX3CL1 by maintaining the mucin stalk in an extended form (Ostuni2014CX3CL1).

The transmembrane domain is essential for the oligomerization of CX3CL1, forming linear assemblies of monomers that enhance cell-to-cell adhesion (Ostuni2020CX3CL1). This oligomerization is driven by hydrophobic interactions within the TM domain, involving specific residues such as Leu, Ala, and Gly (Ostuni2020CX3CL1). The cytosolic tail interacts with the cytoskeleton, contributing to the protein's adhesive robustness (Ostuni2014CX3CL1). CX3CL1 can exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter being generated through cleavage by metalloproteinases (Garton2001Tumor).

## Function
CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, is a unique chemokine that exists in both a membrane-bound form and a soluble form, each mediating distinct biological activities. In healthy human cells, CX3CL1 plays a crucial role in mediating chemotaxis and adhesion. The soluble form acts as a conventional chemokine, attracting monocytes, NK cells, T cells, and B cells, while the membrane-bound form serves as an adhesion protein, promoting firm adhesion of leukocytes under static and flow conditions without activating integrins (Corcione2012CX3CL1fractalkine).

CX3CL1 is expressed on various cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells, lymphocytes, neurons, microglial cells, and osteoblasts. Its receptor, CX3CR1, is expressed on human NK cells, monocytes, Th1 CD4+ cells, CD8+ T cells, mast cells, and B cells (Corcione2012CX3CL1fractalkine). The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is involved in several physiological processes, including neuron/microglia cross-talk, contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis in the brain under conditions of inflammation or injury (Corcione2012CX3CL1fractalkine).

In the immune system, CX3CL1 functions as an adhesive and chemoattractant molecule, playing a role in normal cellular processes such as immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis (Liu2016Role). It is involved in the recruitment of circulating CD4+ T cells in the airways following allergen contact and plays a role in leukocyte accumulation and smooth muscle cell migration in atherosclerotic lesions (Corcione2012CX3CL1fractalkine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CX3CL1 gene, also known as fractalkine, have been implicated in various diseases. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, changes in CX3CL1 expression and signaling are associated with disease progression. In Alzheimer's disease, decreased levels of CX3CL1 are observed in cortical tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, contributing to neuroinflammation and pathology. The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway has a dual role, as knockout models show reduced amyloid pathology but exacerbated tau pathology (Subbarayan2022CX3CL1CX3CR1). In Parkinson's disease, CX3CL1 is suggested to be neuroprotective, reducing neuron loss, while its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia plays a protective role against neurotoxicity and inflammation (Subbarayan2022CX3CL1CX3CR1).

In cancer, the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis influences tumor growth, metastasis, and cell migration. It promotes angiogenesis and metastasis in various cancers, including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, and is linked to poor prognosis in gastric cancer. However, in colorectal carcinoma, higher expression is associated with better survival (RivasFuentes2021Regulation).

In inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial lung disease, CX3CL1 is involved in the migration of inflammatory cells, contributing to disease progression. Treatment with anti-CX3CL1 antibodies has shown potential in reducing inflammation in these conditions (Mizutani2021Treatment).

## Interactions
CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, is a chemokine that interacts with its receptor CX3CR1, which is expressed on various leukocytes, including monocytes, T cells, and NK cells. This interaction is crucial for the adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium, particularly during inflammation (Green2006The). CX3CL1 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the membrane-bound form facilitating leukocyte adhesion without requiring transmembrane signaling or calcium fluxes (Green2006The). The soluble form of CX3CL1 acts as a chemotactic agent, promoting the migration of CX3CR1-expressing cells (Hundhausen2003The).

The interaction between CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 is modulated by other chemokines, such as MCP-1, which enhances the surface expression of CX3CR1 on monocytes, thereby increasing their adhesion to CX3CL1 (Green2006The). CX3CL1 also interacts with Plasmodium falciparum proteins CBP1 and CBP2, which are expressed on infected red blood cells. These proteins bind specifically to CX3CL1, suggesting a role in the cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes (Hermand2016Plasmodium). Additionally, CX3CL1 may interact with integrin receptors, although initial tests with integrin inhibitors did not confirm this pathway, indicating the possibility of an unidentified receptor for CX3CL1 (Finneran2022Concentration).
