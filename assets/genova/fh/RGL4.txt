# RGL4

## Overview
RGL4 (ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) within the Ras superfamily. The protein, also referred to as RGL4, plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ral GTPases, thereby activating them. This activation is crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. RGL4 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to extracellular signals. Its expression is notably altered in pathological conditions such as sepsis, brain arteriovenous malformations, and hematological malignancies, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory responses and disease progression (Foroushani2017Largescale; Zhang2024Integration; Weinsheimer2011Gene). Despite its significant role in these processes, the specific mechanisms and interactions of RGL4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
RGL4 (ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ral GTPases, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This activity is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. RGL4 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to extracellular signals. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular function and organismal health. In the context of sepsis, RGL4 is upregulated, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory response and immune system activation, which may exacerbate the systemic inflammatory state observed in sepsis (Zhang2024Integration). The gene's expression is significantly correlated with the infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, which are crucial in the early response to sepsis (Zhang2024Integration). This suggests that RGL4 may enhance the recruitment or activation of these cells, contributing to the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of sepsis. However, specific information about the function of RGL4 in healthy human cells is not detailed in the provided context.

## Clinical Significance
RGL4 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and potential role in disease progression. In brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) patients, RGL4 is identified as a novel candidate gene, with its expression being downregulated in unruptured BAVM patients compared to controls, and upregulated in ruptured BAVM cases. This suggests that RGL4 may play a role in the temporal changes associated with BAVM disease progression (Weinsheimer2011Gene).

In the context of multiple myeloma (MM), RGL4 is among the differentially expressed genes in younger patients, indicating its involvement in age-related transcriptomic changes. This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis and highlights the importance of understanding its expression for developing age-specific treatment strategies (Keskin2022Comparison).

RGL4 is also included in a minimal gene set used for classifying acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), indicating its relevance in these hematological conditions. Its expression is part of a decision tree model that aids in distinguishing between AML and MDS, underscoring its potential clinical significance in these diseases (Foroushani2017Largescale).

## Interactions
RGL4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is involved in interactions with small GTPases, particularly RalA and RalB, which are part of the Ras superfamily. Although RGL4 lacks a well-defined Ras-association (RA) or pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, it contains a CDC25 homology domain, which is characteristic of RalGEFs and is crucial for its catalytic activity (Gentry2014Ral). RGL4 exhibits promiscuous GEF activity towards both Ras and Ral GTPases, suggesting its involvement in various signaling pathways (Shirakawa2015Ral).

The protein's interactions are primarily inferred from its functional role as a GEF, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ral GTPases, thereby activating them (Bum‐Erdene2022Covalent; Saraç2010GOPred:). Prediction tools have suggested that RGL4 is involved in small GTPase binding, which implies potential interactions with these proteins (Saraç2010GOPred:). However, specific details about physical interactions or multiprotein complexes involving RGL4 are not extensively documented in the available literature. The role of RGL4 in oncogenic processes, particularly in lymphoma, has been suggested, but the exact mechanisms and interaction partners remain unclear (Shirakawa2015Ral).
