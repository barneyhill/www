# CCDC63

## Overview
CCDC63 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 63 protein, which is integral to the structural organization and function of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as part of the outer dynein arm-docking complex (ODA-DC), playing a crucial role in the motility of cilia and flagella by facilitating the periodic arrangement of outer dynein arms on microtubules (Young2015CRISPRCas9Mediated). CCDC63 is particularly significant in male reproductive physiology, where it is essential for the proper development and elongation of sperm flagella, thereby influencing sperm motility and fertility (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). The gene is predominantly expressed in the testes, with expression commencing at three weeks postnatal, underscoring its specific involvement in the later stages of spermatogenesis (Young2015CRISPRCas9Mediated). Additionally, CCDC63 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential role in the genetic complexity of gout and its association with microtubule-based movement in congenital anomaly conditions (Ritter2023Genetic; Chang2022Polygenic).

## Function
CCDC63 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural organization of cells, particularly in the formation and function of sperm flagella. In healthy human cells, CCDC63 is primarily active in the cilia, where it contributes to ciliary function and structure, which is crucial for cell signaling and movement. The protein is part of the outer dynein arm-docking complex (ODA-DC), which is involved in the periodic arrangement of outer dynein arms on microtubules, essential for the motility of cilia and flagella (Young2015CRISPRCas9Mediated).

In the context of male reproductive physiology, CCDC63 plays a critical role in spermiogenesis, the process of sperm development. It is essential for the proper elongation of the sperm flagella, which is necessary for sperm motility and fertility. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of CCDC63 results in shortened flagella and infertility, highlighting its importance in the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella (Young2015CRISPRCas9Mediated; Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

CCDC63 is expressed primarily in the testes, with its expression beginning at three weeks postnatal, indicating its specific role in the later stages of spermatogenesis (Young2015CRISPRCas9Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC63 gene has been implicated in the genetic complexity of gout, a form of arthritis characterized by severe pain and swelling in the joints. A genome-wide association study identified CCDC63 as one of the genes with significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with male gout, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Chang2022Polygenic). 

In the context of VACTERL association, a condition involving multiple congenital anomalies, CCDC63 is associated with microtubule-based movement. This association highlights its potential involvement in ciliary function, although the study does not specifically link CCDC63 to VACTERL or other diseases (Ritter2023Genetic).

While CCDC63 is mentioned in discussions of genetic redundancy in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder affecting ciliary function, it is not directly associated with PCD. Instead, it is suggested that CCDC63 might compensate for the function of CCDC114 in sperm, potentially explaining the lack of infertility in some PCD cases with CCDC114 mutations (Legendre2021Motile). The exact role of CCDC63 in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated.
