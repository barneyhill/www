# DEFA1

## Overview
The DEFA1 gene encodes the protein human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP-1), a member of the alpha-defensin family, which is characterized by its small, cysteine-rich, antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a pivotal role in the innate immune system by providing a primary defense mechanism against microbial pathogens through the disruption of microbial membranes (Chen2010Increased; Brogden2005Antimicrobial). The DEFA1 gene is expressed predominantly in neutrophils, where the encoded protein is stored in azurophil granules and released upon activation during immune responses (Chen2010Increased). The protein's structure, featuring a triple-stranded β-sheet stabilized by disulfide bonds, is crucial for its antimicrobial function (Winter2012Human). Variations in the DEFA1 gene, such as copy number alterations, have been linked to susceptibility to various diseases, including severe sepsis and IgA nephropathy, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Chen2010Increased; Ai2016Low).

## Structure
The DEFA1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the α-defensin family, known for its antimicrobial properties. The primary structure of DEFA1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a peptide with six cysteine residues. These cysteines are linked by three intramolecular disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the protein's stability and function (Brogden2005Antimicrobial). The secondary structure of DEFA1 is characterized by a triple-stranded β-sheet, a common feature among α-defensins, which contributes to its ability to disrupt microbial membranes (Winter2012Human; Brogden2005Antimicrobial).

The tertiary structure of DEFA1 involves the folding of the peptide into a stable three-dimensional shape, primarily stabilized by the disulfide bonds. This structure is essential for its antimicrobial activity, allowing it to interact effectively with microbial membranes (Brogden2005Antimicrobial). While specific details on the quaternary structure of DEFA1 are not provided, defensins can form dimers or multimers, which may enhance their functional capabilities (Brogden2005Antimicrobial).

Post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic processing, are common in defensins, although specific modifications for DEFA1 are not detailed in the provided context. These modifications can influence the protein's activity and stability.

## Function
The DEFA1 gene encodes human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP-1), a member of the alpha-defensins family, which are small, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced by neutrophils. These peptides are crucial components of the innate immune system, providing a first line of defense against microbial invasion by disrupting microbial membranes (Chen2010Increased). HNP-1, along with HNP-2 and HNP-3, is stored in the azurophil granules of neutrophils and released into circulation upon neutrophil activation in response to infections (Chen2010Increased).

In healthy human cells, DEFA1 plays a significant role in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. It enhances phagocytosis by macrophages, promotes neutrophil recruitment, and regulates complement activation, thereby contributing to the host's defense mechanisms (Chen2010Increased). HNP-1 also acts as an immune modulator by attracting native T cells, immature dendritic cells, and monocytes, and inducing the release of chemokines and cytokines, which are essential for orchestrating an effective immune response (Ai2016Low).

The expression of DEFA1 is dose-dependent, with higher gene copy numbers correlating with increased intracellular levels of HNP-1, which in turn influences the effectiveness of the immune response (Chen2010Increased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DEFA1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of severe sepsis, an increased genomic copy number of DEFA1, along with DEFA3, has been associated with a higher susceptibility to the condition in the Chinese Han population. Individuals with more than eight copies of DEFA1/DEFA3 were found to have a significantly higher risk of developing severe sepsis, with an odds ratio of 2.77. This increased copy number correlates with lower plasma levels of human neutrophil peptides 1-3 and certain cytokines, suggesting a potential immunomodulatory role that may influence the immune response in severe sepsis (Chen2010Increased).

The DEFA1 gene is also implicated in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), where low copy numbers of DEFA1A3, which includes DEFA1, are associated with an increased risk for IgAN and poor long-term renal survival. This association was confirmed in both Southern Chinese Han and Caucasian cohorts, highlighting the gene's role in mediating glomerular injury in IgAN (Ai2016Low). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DEFA1 in influencing susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases.
