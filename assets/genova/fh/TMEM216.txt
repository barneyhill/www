# TMEM216

## Overview
TMEM216 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 216, a tetraspan transmembrane protein integral to the process of ciliogenesis. This protein is characterized by its four hydrophobic transmembrane domains and is a component of the transition zone tectonic complex, which is crucial for the formation and function of cilia. TMEM216 plays a significant role in centrosome docking and ciliary membrane protein localization, processes essential for proper cellular signaling and movement. Mutations in the TMEM216 gene are linked to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome-related disorders and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, which are marked by developmental abnormalities due to defective ciliary function (Valente2010Mutations; Liu2020TMEM216). The protein's interactions with other components of the ciliary transition zone underscore its importance in maintaining ciliary integrity and function (Szymanska2015Unraveling).

## Structure
The TMEM216 protein is a tetraspan transmembrane protein characterized by four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which are predicted to form two extracellular loops and one intracellular loop (Valente2010Mutations; Liu2020TMEM216). The longest splice isoform of TMEM216 encodes a protein of 148 amino acids, although alternative splicing can result in shorter isoforms (Valente2010Mutations). The protein is part of the transition zone tectonic complex, which includes other proteins such as TCTN1, TCTN2, and TMEM67, and is involved in cilia formation and the regulation of ciliary membrane protein localization (Liu2020TMEM216).

Mutations in TMEM216, such as the p.R73 change, often lead to unstable protein products, resulting in reduced protein levels in patient cells compared to wild-type (Valente2010Mutations). These mutations can disrupt the protein's role in ciliogenesis and centrosome docking, which are crucial for ciliary function and structure (Valente2010Mutations). The protein's localization to the base of the primary cilium suggests its involvement in ciliary signaling and trafficking (Valente2010Mutations). The specific molecular structure details, such as prominent folds or post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMEM216 is a tetraspan transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is essential for proper cellular signaling and movement. In healthy human cells, TMEM216 is involved in the docking of centrosomes at the apical cell surface, a crucial step in ciliogenesis (Valente2010Mutations). It interacts with Meckelin and is implicated in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which is vital for actin-dependent polarized cell behavior. This pathway involves the small GTPase RhoA, which is hyperactivated in the absence of TMEM216, leading to mislocalization of RhoA and γ-tubulin, further affecting ciliogenesis (Valente2010Mutations).

TMEM216 is also part of the transition zone tectonic complex, which regulates the localization of ciliary membrane proteins and is essential for the normal genesis of outer segment disc structures in photoreceptors (Liu2020TMEM216). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, limb bud, kidney, and cartilage during human development, and localizes to the base of the primary cilium or adjacent basal body in ciliated cells (Valente2010Mutations). Its proper function is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of cilia, and its disruption can lead to severe developmental disorders (Valente2010Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM216 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome-related disorders (JSRD) and Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). These conditions are characterized by developmental abnormalities due to defective ciliary function. In JSRD, common phenotypes include neurological symptoms such as hypotonia, ataxia, and psychomotor delay, along with nephronophthisis and polydactyly, although retinal dystrophy and congenital hepatic fibrosis are typically absent (Valente2010Mutations). MKS is a more severe condition, often resulting in early lethality, and is marked by occipital encephalocele, cystic dysplastic kidneys, hepatic bile duct proliferation, and polydactyly (Valente2010Mutations; Liu2020TMEM216).

A specific mutation, p.R73L, is identified as a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, with a carrier frequency of about 1:100 (Valente2010Mutations). TMEM216 mutations disrupt ciliogenesis, leading to impaired centrosome docking and defective ciliary signaling, which are critical for the proper functioning of cilia (Valente2010Mutations; Arts2012Current). These disruptions contribute to the pathogenesis of the associated syndromes, highlighting the clinical significance of TMEM216 in human health (Valente2010Mutations).

## Interactions
TMEM216 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and is involved in several protein interactions essential for ciliary function. TMEM216 interacts with Meckelin, forming a complex that is vital for proper centrosome docking and ciliogenesis. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrate the complex formation between TMEM216 and Meckelin (Valente2010Mutations). TMEM216 is also part of the 'MKS-JBTS module' at the ciliary transition zone, interacting with other proteins such as TMEM138, TMEM237, TMEM231, TMEM17, TMEM107, TCTN1, TCTN2, TCTN3, and TMEM67. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ciliary gate and regulating the function of membrane-targeting proteins (Szymanska2015Unraveling).

TMEM216 is involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, interacting with RhoA and Dishevelled (Dvl), which are key mediators of this pathway. The loss of TMEM216 results in hyperactivation of RhoA signaling, indicating its role in actin remodeling and centrosome docking (Valente2010Mutations). Additionally, TMEM216 interacts with TMEM107, TMEM231, TMEM237, and MKS1, forming part of the MKS module proteins that are crucial for organizing the ciliary transition zone (Lambacher2015TMEM107).
