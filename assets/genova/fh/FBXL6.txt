# FBXL6

## Overview
FBXL6 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 6, a member of the F-box protein family involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This protein functions as a substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The activity of FBXL6 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination, impacting cell development and differentiation (Shi2020FBXL6; Lin2024Prognostic). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions are significant in various cellular pathways, and its dysregulation has been linked to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zhang2023Elevated; Lin2023Prognostic).

## Function
FBXL6 is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is crucial for protein regulation in cells. It functions as a substrate recognition subunit within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein levels, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction (Shi2020FBXL6; Lin2024Prognostic).

In healthy human cells, FBXL6 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular pathways. It plays a critical role in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination, which is important for cell development and differentiation (Lin2023Prognostic). The protein's activity is linked to several cellular processes, including cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and immune response (Lin2024Prognostic).

FBXL6's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal outcomes. By regulating the turnover of specific proteins, FBXL6 ensures proper cellular function and response to environmental changes, contributing to overall cellular health and stability (Lin2024Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
FBXL6 has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FBXL6 is highly overexpressed in over 90% of cases compared to healthy bone marrow, and its high mRNA expression levels are associated with adverse prognosis. Knocking out FBXL6 in AML cell lines, especially those with FLT3-ITD mutations, results in decreased proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sperk2024FBXL6).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBXL6 is overexpressed in a significant portion of tumor tissues and is linked to advanced disease stages, vascular thrombosis, and metastasis. It acts as a superoncogene, promoting liver tumorigenesis and lung metastasis through various pathways, including the ERK/mTOR/Prelid2/ROS axis. FBXL6 enhances the polyubiquitination and activation of KRAS and its mutant form KRAS G12D, driving oncogenic signaling pathways. High FBXL6 expression correlates with poor overall survival in HCC patients, highlighting its role as an independent risk factor for aggressive disease and metastasis (Zhang2023Elevated; Xiong2023Elevated).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of FBXL6 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
FBXL6 is involved in several protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes. It forms a classical SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ligase complex with known interacting proteins Cullin1 and SKP1. This complex is crucial for its function as a ubiquitin ligase (Shi2020FBXL6). FBXL6 also interacts with HSP90AA1, a heat shock protein, through its leucine-rich repeat sequences at the C-terminus. This interaction is specific, as FBXL6 was the only F-box protein among those tested that bound to HSP90AA1 (Shi2020FBXL6). The interaction with HSP90AA1 leads to its stabilization through K63-dependent ubiquitination, which is atypical for F-box proteins that usually promote proteasomal degradation (Shi2020FBXL6).

FBXL6 also interacts with transketolase (TKT), a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. It ubiquitinates TKT at Lys16 and Lys319, leading to its activation and promoting hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis (Zhang2023Elevated). FBXL6's interaction with KRAS and its mutant KRAS G12D involves K63-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 128, which activates KRAS and contributes to tumorigenesis (Xiong2023Elevated). These interactions highlight FBXL6's role in modulating protein stability and activity, influencing cancer progression.
