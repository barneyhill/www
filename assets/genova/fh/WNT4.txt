# WNT4

## Overview
WNT4 is a gene that encodes the Wnt family member 4 protein, a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The WNT4 protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by its cysteine-rich structure and involvement in both canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways. It plays a pivotal role in cell differentiation and development, particularly in female sexual development and organogenesis. The protein's structure includes a unique thumb-index fold stabilized by disulfide bridges, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation, which are crucial for its function and interaction with frizzled receptors (Azam2015Structural; Azam2014Role). Mutations in the WNT4 gene are linked to several developmental disorders, including Serkal syndrome and Müllerian duct abnormalities, underscoring its significance in reproductive health and development (Philibert2008Identification; Mandel2008SERKAL).

## Structure
The WNT4 protein, a member of the Wnt family, is composed of 351 amino acids, with the first 22 serving as a signal peptide and the remaining 329 forming the mature peptide (Azam2014Role). The protein's structure is characterized by a unique thumb-index fold, with the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) resembling a thumb and index finger, respectively, separated by a hydrophobic palm domain (Azam2015Structural; Azam2014Role). This fold is stabilized by disulfide bridges formed by cysteine residues, which are crucial for maintaining structural integrity (Azam2015Structural; Azam2014Role).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation are essential for WNT4's function. Palmitoylation, particularly at Ser190, enhances the protein's hydrophobicity and is necessary for its interaction with frizzled receptors and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (Azam2015Structural). The protein's hydrophobic nature is further emphasized by the presence of palmitoleic acid, which contributes to its activity and stability (Azam2015Structural). The structural complexity of WNT4 has made it challenging to identify direct inhibitors, prompting the use of computational techniques for potential drug discovery (Azam2015Structural).

## Function
The WNT4 gene encodes a cysteine-rich secretory glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell differentiation and development. WNT4 is involved in both β-catenin-dependent (canonical) and β-catenin-independent (non-canonical) signaling pathways. In the canonical pathway, WNT4 binding leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. In the non-canonical pathway, WNT4 influences cytoskeletal reorganization and calcium mobilization (Zhang2021Roles).

WNT4 is essential for female sexual development, particularly in the formation of the Müllerian duct, which is necessary for the development of female reproductive structures. It suppresses the development of Leydig cells in the ovary, preventing ectopic testosterone biosynthesis (Vainio1999Female). WNT4 also plays a role in maintaining oocyte development and preventing the differentiation of supporting cells into Sertoli cells, which is crucial for female sex determination (Vainio1999Female).

In addition to its role in reproductive development, WNT4 is involved in the differentiation of various cell types, including osteogenic differentiation, which is crucial for bone formation and maintenance (Zhang2021Roles). It also contributes to the maturation and function of pancreatic β-cells, enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Zhang2021Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WNT4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting sexual development and organogenesis. One notable condition is Serkal syndrome, an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation in WNT4. This syndrome is characterized by female to male sex reversal, renal, adrenal, and lung dysgenesis, and other developmental defects. The specific mutation c.C341T leads to decreased mRNA stability and expression levels, resulting in severe developmental anomalies (Mandel2008SERKAL).

WNT4 mutations are also linked to Müllerian duct abnormalities and primary amenorrhea. A heterozygous mutation, L12P, has been identified in patients with these conditions, leading to hyperandrogenism and uterine hypoplasia. This mutation affects the WNT signaling pathway by impairing the palmitoylation of the WNT4 protein, reducing β-catenin levels, and increasing androgen biosynthesis (Philibert2008Identification).

In addition, WNT4 deficiency can result in premature ovarian failure (POF) and is implicated in Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, characterized by primary amenorrhea and congenital absence of the uterus and upper vagina. These conditions highlight the critical role of WNT4 in female reproductive development and function (BiasonLauber2004AWNT4Mutation; Prunskaite‐Hyyrylainen2013Wnt4).

## Interactions
WNT4 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its signaling pathways. It interacts with Frizzled (FZD) receptors and co-receptors like LRP5/6 to regulate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (Zhang2021Roles). WNT4 can bind to the FZD2 receptor and G protein subunits, recruiting Dishevelled (DVL) protein to promote phospholipase C (PLC) activity, leading to calcium release and activation of calcium-dependent kinases (Zhang2021Roles). 

In the context of neural tube closure, WNT4 forms a complex with ephrinB2, Ror2, Dishevelled 2 (Dsh2), and Shroom3, known as the WERDS complex. This complex is crucial for apical constriction, a process necessary for neural tube closure. The interaction between ephrinB2 and Dsh2 enhances the formation of the WERDS complex, which activates Rho-associated kinase to induce apical constriction (Yoon2022Wnt4). 

WNT4 also interacts with EHD1, which can suppress WNT4/β-catenin signaling, affecting processes like decidualization (Zhang2021Roles). These interactions highlight WNT4's role in modulating various cellular processes through both stable and transient protein interactions.
