# ZNF134

## Overview
ZNF134 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 134, a member of the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its 11 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional regulator by binding to DNA. Unlike many zinc finger proteins, ZNF134 lacks the Kruppel associated box (KRAB) domain, suggesting its function as a transcriptional activator rather than a repressor. Zinc finger protein 134 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of viral RNA, particularly enhancing the activity of the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (LTR). The gene is located on chromosome 19, a region frequently associated with retroviral integration, indicating a potential role in viral genome integration. While its specific physiological functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, ZNF134 is implicated in processes such as DNA replication, apoptosis, and inflammation, and is notably upregulated in certain infections, including HIV and mycobacterial infections (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).

## Structure
ZNF134 is a human zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of 11 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are typical of the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc-finger transcriptional regulator family (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). These zinc finger domains facilitate the protein's ability to bind DNA, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Unlike many other zinc finger proteins, ZNF134 lacks the Kruppel associated box (KRAB) domain, which is commonly associated with transcriptional repression, indicating that ZNF134 functions as an activator rather than a repressor (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).

The precise molecular structure of ZNF134 in terms of its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures is not fully detailed in the available literature. However, its classification as a zinc finger protein suggests a modular structure, with each zinc finger motif contributing to its DNA-binding capability. The protein's role as a transcriptional regulator is further supported by its localization to the nucleus, where it enhances the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). The evolutionary conservation of ZNF134 is indicated by its sequence homology to other zinc finger genes, such as ZNF-132 and C2H2-25 (Becker1997Molecular).

## Function
ZNF134, a member of the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family, is primarily active in the nucleus of cells, where it functions as a transcriptional regulator. This protein is involved in the transcriptional regulation of viral RNA, particularly in the context of HIV-1 pathogenesis, by acting as a positive regulator of the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) activity (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). ZNF134 enhances LTR-driven transcription and viral production, with its overexpression leading to increased viral transcripts and production (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).

While the specific physiological function of ZNF134 in healthy human cells remains undefined, it is suggested that it may participate in crucial cellular processes such as DNA replication, apoptosis, and inflammation, which are essential for cell survival (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). The protein's genomic location on chromosome 19, a frequent site for retroviral integration, hints at a potential role in viral genome integration (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). Despite its role in viral transcription, the absence of the KRAB domain, typically associated with transcriptional repression, suggests that ZNF134 may not function as a repressor in healthy cells (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). Further studies are needed to elucidate its role in normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF134, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in the regulation of HIV-1 and mycobacterial infections. Alterations in the expression of ZNF134 have been associated with increased HIV-1 propagation. The protein acts as a positive regulator of HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) activity, enhancing viral transcription and production. Overexpression of ZNF134 leads to increased viral transcripts and titers, while siRNA-mediated knockdown results in decreased viral activity, highlighting its role as a critical activator of HIV-1 replication (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).

ZNF134 expression is notably upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during HIV, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and HIV-TB co-infections, with the most significant increase observed in mycobacterial infections. This suggests that mycobacterial infections may facilitate HIV-1 propagation by increasing ZNF134 levels, potentially serving as a biological marker for co-infections (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). Elevated ZNF134 levels have also been observed in neural cell lines post-HIV-1 infection, indicating a possible role in HIV-associated neuronal disorders (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). These findings suggest that ZNF134 could be a target for therapeutic interventions in managing HIV and TB co-infections (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).

## Interactions
ZNF134, a human zinc finger protein, is known to interact with the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (LTR), playing a significant role in the regulation of viral transcription and propagation. This interaction was identified through pull-down assays using biotinylated HIV-1 LTR immobilized onto Streptavidin agarose beads, which successfully captured the hZNF-134-GFP fusion protein, confirming its binding to the LTR (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). The interaction between ZNF134 and the HIV-1 LTR enhances LTR-driven transcription, as evidenced by increased luciferase activity in the presence of ZNF134 and the viral protein Tat (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).

Over-expression of ZNF134 in HEK293T cells leads to a significant increase in viral transcript levels and viral production, indicating its role as a positive regulator of HIV-1 LTR activity (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZNF134 results in decreased viral transcripts and p24 levels, further supporting its function as an activator of LTR-mediated transcription (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial). These findings suggest that ZNF134 may play a crucial role in the integration of the viral genome, potentially due to its genomic location near retroviral integration hotspots (Benjamin2014Mycobacterial).
