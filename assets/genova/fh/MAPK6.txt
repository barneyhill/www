# MAPK6

## Overview
MAPK6, also known as ERK3, is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, an atypical member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Unlike conventional MAPKs, the protein encoded by MAPK6 features a unique Ser-Glu-Gly (SEG) motif in its activation loop, distinguishing it from the typical Thr-X-Tyr (TXY) motif. This atypical kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. MAPK6 interacts with several proteins, such as MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) and AKT, forming complexes that influence neuronal development and oncogenic pathways, respectively. Its role in cancer biology is significant, with alterations in MAPK6 expression linked to tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers, including lung and breast cancer (Bogucka2020ERK3MAPK6; Cai2020Oncogenic; Cargnello2011Activation).

## Structure
MAPK6, also known as ERK3, is an atypical member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. The primary structure of MAPK6 includes a unique Ser-Glu-Gly (SEG) motif in its activation loop, distinguishing it from the canonical Thr-X-Tyr (TXY) motif found in conventional MAPKs (Cai2020Oncogenic). The protein consists of an N-terminal kinase domain, a C34 conserved region, and a long C-terminal tail, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins such as AKT (Cai2020Oncogenic).

The secondary structure of MAPK6 includes typical kinase features, with an N-terminal lobe containing β-strands and a C-terminal lobe primarily composed of helices (Schröder2020Crystal). The tertiary structure of MAPK6 is characterized by its distinct ATP binding pocket, which differs significantly from classical MAPKs like ERK2, affecting its inhibitor binding properties (Schröder2020Crystal).

MAPK6 can form a dimer in crystal structures but behaves as a monomer in solution, indicating a potential quaternary structure under certain conditions (Schröder2020Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating its activity, with autophosphorylation on Ser 189 being a notable feature (Coulombe2007Atypical).

## Function
MAPK6, also known as ERK3, is an atypical member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, involved in various cellular processes. Unlike classical MAPKs, ERK3 lacks the typical Thr-X-Tyr motif in its activation loop and instead has a Ser-Glu-Gly motif, with a single phospho-acceptor site at serine 189, which is constitutively phosphorylated (Bogucka2020ERK3MAPK6; Cargnello2011Activation). ERK3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with the highest levels found in the brain, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract (Bogucka2020ERK3MAPK6).

In healthy human cells, MAPK6 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. It plays a critical role in the modulation of migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Hu2018miR‑98). ERK3 is also implicated in the regulation of the epithelial secretome, particularly in the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is essential for leukocyte chemotaxis and immune responses (Bogucka2020ERK3MAPK6). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors such as c-Jun, influencing AP-1 activity and cytokine production (Bogucka2020ERK3MAPK6). These activities highlight its importance in maintaining normal cellular and immune functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of MAPK6, also known as ERK3, have been implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), ERK3 is highly upregulated and associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. It is notably upregulated in squamous cell lung carcinomas, which are less responsive to EGFR kinase inhibitors, suggesting ERK3 as a potential therapeutic target for this subtype (Long2012ERK3). 

Mutations such as L290P and L290V within the kinase domain of ERK3 enhance its cytoplasmic localization and promote cancer cell migration and invasion, although they do not significantly affect cell proliferation (Elkhadragy2024Role; Alsaran2017L290PV). These mutations increase ERK3's interaction with the nuclear export factor CRM1, contributing to its enhanced cytoplasmic presence and invasiveness (Alsaran2017L290PV).

In breast cancer, MAPK6 expression is upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis. The circDNAJC11/TAF15/MAPK6 signaling pathway plays a significant role in breast cancer progression by stabilizing MAPK6 mRNA, thereby promoting cell proliferation and metastasis (Wang2023CircDNAJC11). Additionally, miR-653-5p targets MAPK6, suppressing breast cancer cell growth and migration, indicating MAPK6's role in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2021miR‑653‑5p).

## Interactions
MAPK6, also known as ERK3, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions of MAPK6 is with MAPK-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), also known as PRAK. This interaction forms a signaling complex that regulates various cellular processes, including neuronal function and morphology. The ERK3/MK5 complex is involved in spine formation and dendrite morphology, with MK5-deficient mice showing impaired spine formation, highlighting the importance of this interaction in neuronal development (Brand2012The; Seternes2004Activation).

MAPK6 also interacts with Sept7, a protein involved in spine morphogenesis and dendrite development. The interaction between MAPK6 and Sept7 is facilitated by the C-terminal parts of both proteins, and they can form a ternary complex with MK5, suggesting a potential signaling module that influences neuronal structure and function (Brand2012The).

In cancer biology, MAPK6 interacts with AKT, a protein kinase involved in cell survival and growth. MAPK6 can activate AKT by phosphorylating it at specific sites, contributing to its oncogenic activities. This interaction is distinct from that of MAPK4 with AKT, as MAPK6 uses unique sequences within its C34 region and C-terminal tail for binding (Cai2020Oncogenic).

MAPK6 is also part of a large protein complex with E6AP, HERC2, and NEURL4, although the functional consequences of this interaction are not fully understood (MartínezNoël2012Identification). Additionally, HSP90 proteins are crucial for stabilizing MAPK6, indicating their role in MAPK-mediated signaling (Bandyopadhyay2010A).
