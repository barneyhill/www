# HAGHL

## Overview
The HAGHL gene encodes the hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like protein, which is involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis. This protein is part of the glyoxalase system, which plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by converting toxic compounds into less harmful substances. Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like proteins are categorized as hydrolases, enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical bonds. The activity of this protein is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage. Dysregulation of the HAGHL gene or its protein product may have implications in various metabolic disorders and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
