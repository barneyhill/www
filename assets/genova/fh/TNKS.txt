# TNKS

## Overview
The TNKS gene encodes the protein tankyrase, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including telomere maintenance, mitosis, and Wnt signaling. Tankyrase is characterized by its structural domains, such as the ankyrin repeat domain and the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, respectively (DaRosa2016Structural; Mariotti2016Tankyrase). The protein's catalytic PARP domain is responsible for ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification that regulates cellular functions (Pillay2022Structural). Tankyrase plays a critical role in telomere dynamics by interacting with the telomeric protein TRF1, and it is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the stability of Axin, a key component in the β-catenin destruction complex (Kulak2015Disruption; Hsiao2008Tankyrase). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Hsiao2008Tankyrase).

## Structure
Tankyrase (TNKS) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The protein includes an ankyrin repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is crucial for oligomerization. The SAM domain forms a helical structure that mediates head-to-tail oligomerization, essential for the protein's function in Wnt-β-catenin signaling and other pathways (DaRosa2016Structural; Mariotti2016Tankyrase).

The SAM domain of TNKS can form both homo- and hetero-oligomers, with interactions characterized by charge-charge and hydrophobic contacts (DaRosa2016Structural). The polymerization of the SAM domain is necessary for the full catalytic activity of TNKS, as it facilitates the formation of supramolecular assemblies that enhance catalytic PARP activity (Pillay2022Structural).

The catalytic PARP domain of TNKS is involved in ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification that regulates various cellular functions. The PARP domains engage in head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions, which are crucial for the allosteric activation of tankyrase (Pillay2022Structural). These interactions are highly conserved and play a significant role in the protein's catalytic activity (Pillay2022Structural).

## Function
Tankyrase (TNKS) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance, mitosis, and Wnt signaling in human cells. At the molecular level, TNKS interacts with the telomeric protein TRF1, facilitating telomere elongation by telomerase. This interaction involves the ADP-ribosylation of TRF1, which reduces its binding to telomeric DNA, allowing telomerase access to elongate telomeres (Smith2000Tankyrase; Hsiao2008Tankyrase). TNKS is also involved in resolving sister telomere cohesion during mitosis, a process essential for proper chromosome segregation (Hsiao2008Tankyrase).

In addition to its role in telomere dynamics, TNKS is active in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it regulates the stability of Axin, a key component in the destruction complex of β-catenin. This regulation is critical for maintaining the cellular response to Wnt ligands (Kulak2015Disruption). TNKS is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is particularly active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, impacting cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Smith1998Tankyrase; Lehtiö2008Zinc). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, highlighting its importance in healthy human cells (Hsiao2008Tankyrase).

## Interactions
Tankyrase (TNKS) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with AXIN1, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, through its ankyrin-repeat clusters (ARCs). This interaction is crucial for the degradation of AXIN1, as TNKS-dependent degradation of AXIN1 is facilitated by a bivalent binding mode involving two discrete segments of AXIN1 interacting with TNKS (Morrone2012Crystal). 

TNKS also interacts with RNF146, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates the turnover of AXIN proteins. RNF146 binds to multiple ARCs of TNKS, introducing a new type of tankyrase-binding motif (TBM) that includes an extra amino acid, potentially increasing the number of predicted TBMs in the proteome (DaRosa2018Structural). 

Additionally, TNKS is involved in interactions with proteins containing tankyrase-binding motifs (TBMs), which are recognized by its ARCs. These interactions are mediated by specific binding hotspots within the ARCs, such as the 'arginine cradle' and 'aromatic glycine sandwich' (Pollock2019Fragmentbased). These interactions are essential for TNKS's role in cellular signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling and telomere maintenance (Pollock2019Fragmentbased).
