# CDKN2AIPNL

## Overview
CDKN2AIPNL is a human gene that encodes the protein CDKN2A interacting protein N-terminal like, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and cellular senescence. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with the CDKN2A gene. This interaction is pivotal for tumor suppression, as CDKN2A encodes proteins that inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby controlling cell proliferation and preventing oncogenesis. The CDKN2AIPNL protein's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity, highlighting its significance in preventing cancerous growths and contributing to the stability and longevity of cells (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
CDKN2AIPNL, or CDKN2A interacting protein N-terminal like, plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular senescence. It interacts with the CDKN2A gene, which encodes proteins that inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby contributing to tumor suppression. This interaction is significant in maintaining the proper function of the cell cycle, as it helps control the transition between different phases, ensuring that cells do not proliferate uncontrollably.

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation. By modulating the expression of specific genes, CDKN2AIPNL can affect cellular stress responses, which are vital for the cell's ability to cope with various stressors and maintain homeostasis. This regulatory function is essential for preventing the accumulation of cellular damage that could lead to oncogenesis.

In healthy human cells, the activities of CDKN2AIPNL are integral to maintaining cellular integrity and preventing the onset of cancerous growths. Its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with tumor suppressor pathways underscores its importance in cell biology and organismal health. Through these molecular processes, CDKN2AIPNL contributes to the overall stability and longevity of cells, playing a part in the broader context of cellular and organismal health.
