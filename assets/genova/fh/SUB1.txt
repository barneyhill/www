# SUB1

## Overview
The SUB1 gene encodes the SUB1 regulator of transcription, a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. As a transcriptional coactivator, SUB1 interacts with various components of the transcription machinery, including the RNA polymerase II complex and transcription factors such as TFIIB. These interactions are crucial for modulating mRNA synthesis and processing, highlighting SUB1's role in transcription initiation and termination. The protein's ability to influence transcriptional regulation and mRNA processing underscores its importance in cellular function and its potential implications in disease states, such as cancer, where its expression is often dysregulated (He2003Functional; Garavís2016Sub1; Knaus1996Yeast).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SUB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In prostate cancer, SUB1 is overexpressed, which contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. This overexpression is often due to the downregulation of microRNA-101 (miR-101), a tumor suppressor that normally regulates SUB1. The loss of miR-101 leads to increased SUB1 expression, which activates oncogenes such as PLK1, C-MYC, and BUB1B, driving cancer progression. Targeting these pathways, particularly PLK1, has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy (Chakravarthi2016MicroRNA101).

In yeast, the disruption of SUB1 leads to a redistribution of mutations induced by APOBEC enzymes, suggesting a protective role of SUB1 against DNA mutations. This model has implications for understanding cancer evolution, as similar mechanisms may occur in human cells, contributing to tumor development and drug resistance (Lada2015Disruption).

In hepatoblastoma, a common liver tumor in children, SUB1 acts as a transcription co-activator that, along with ARID1B, regulates the long non-coding RNA HOXA-AS2. This regulation promotes malignant behaviors, indicating that SUB1 may play a role in the progression of this disease (Liu2021ARID1BSUB1‐activated).

## Interactions
The human gene SUB1, also known as the SUB1 regulator of transcription, encodes a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. SUB1 is known to interact with components of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex, particularly the Rpb4/7 heterodimer. It directly targets the Rpb7 subunit, which is part of this heterodimer, facilitating its association with RNAPII even in the absence of Rpb4 (Garavís2016Sub1). This interaction is crucial for modulating mRNA synthesis and maintaining proper RNAPII phosphorylation levels (Garavís2016Sub1).

SUB1 also interacts with transcription factors such as TFIIB, where it acts as a suppressor of certain TFIIB mutations. This interaction is significant for transcriptional activation, as SUB1 can inhibit the formation of TBP-TFIIB-promoter complexes, suggesting a competitive binding mechanism (Knaus1996Yeast). Additionally, SUB1 interacts with the Pta1 protein, a component of the mRNA 3' end processing machinery, indicating its role in transcription initiation and termination (He2003Functional). These interactions highlight SUB1's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and mRNA processing.
