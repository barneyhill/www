# RBMXL2

## Overview
RBMXL2 is a gene that encodes the RBMX-like 2 protein, a member of the RNA-binding protein family characterized by the presence of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). These motifs are integral to the protein's function in RNA binding and splicing, allowing it to interact with specific RNA sequences and regulate splicing events. The RBMX-like 2 protein is particularly significant in germ cells, where it plays a crucial role in splicing regulation during meiosis. It shares functional similarities with its paralog RBMX, especially in its ability to bind RNA motifs and regulate alternative splicing. The protein's interactions with splicing regulators, such as Tra2β and SR proteins, are essential for maintaining accurate splicing patterns and preventing cryptic splicing events. RBMXL2's ability to replace RBMX activity in somatic cells underscores its importance in ensuring proper exon inclusion, particularly during male meiosis when the X chromosome is silenced (Siachisumo2023An; Ehrmann2019An).

## Structure
RBMXL2 encodes a protein involved in RNA binding and splicing, characterized by the presence of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules. These motifs are crucial for the protein's function in recognizing and binding to specific RNA sequences, which is essential for its role in RNA processing. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with other molecules.

RBMXL2 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may lead to variations in its structure and function. These isoforms can differ in the number and arrangement of RRMs, potentially altering their RNA binding capabilities and the protein's overall role in cellular processes. The existence of these isoforms highlights the complexity and adaptability of RBMXL2 in regulating RNA splicing events.

The specific details of the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RBMXL2 are not provided in the available context. However, the presence of RRMs suggests a conserved structural framework typical of RNA-binding proteins, which often includes beta-sheet and alpha-helix arrangements that form a stable platform for RNA interaction.

## Function


## Interactions
RBMXL2 is a germ cell-specific RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in splicing regulation, particularly during meiosis. It interacts with RNA motifs containing the dinucleotide AA, similar to its paralog RBMX, due to shared sequence identity. This binding is enriched within alternative exon sequences and regions near regulated splice sites, suggesting direct regulation of splicing events (Ehrmann2019An).

RBMXL2 also interacts with splicing regulators such as Tra2β and SR proteins. These interactions are important for maintaining proper splicing patterns by preventing cryptic splicing events. RBMXL2 can buffer the activity of these splicing regulators, thereby suppressing cryptic splice site selection (Ehrmann2019An). The protein's ability to repress cryptic exon splicing is demonstrated by its effect on the Kdm4d cryptic exon, where RBMXL2 significantly reduces its inclusion in splicing assays (Ehrmann2019An).

RBMXL2 can replace the activity of RBMX in somatic cells, particularly in repressing cryptic splice sites within ultra-long exons. This function is crucial during male meiosis when the X chromosome is silenced, and RBMX is inactive (Siachisumo2023An). The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient for its splicing control function, highlighting its role in ensuring proper exon inclusion (Siachisumo2023An).
