# NFILZ

## Overview
NFILZ is a gene that encodes the NFIL3-like basic leucine zipper protein, which is categorized as a transcription factor. This protein is part of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, characterized by a leucine zipper motif that facilitates dimerization, a critical feature for its function in DNA binding and transcription regulation. The NFIL3-like basic leucine zipper protein plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, as evidenced by its inclusion in databases such as AnimalTFDB 4.0, which catalog transcription factors across various species (Shen2022AnimalTFDB). The protein's activity can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its regulatory functions. While the gene's broader biological roles and potential clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated, its classification as a transcription factor underscores its importance in cellular processes.

## Structure
NFILZ, also known as NFIL3-like basic leucine zipper, is a protein that shares structural features with other basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. These proteins typically have a primary structure characterized by a leucine zipper motif, which facilitates dimerization. The secondary structure often includes alpha-helices, which are common in bZIP proteins. The tertiary and quaternary structures involve the formation of dimers or higher-order oligomers, which are essential for their function as transcription factors. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of NFILZ, influencing its role in transcription regulation (Shen2022AnimalTFDB).

NFILZ has been identified as a DNA-binding transcription factor with activity confirmed through various bioinformatics tools and databases, such as AnimalTFDB 4.0, which includes annotations for transcription factors across multiple species (Shen2022AnimalTFDB). The protein's involvement in transcription regulation is supported by its classification as a transcription factor in comprehensive databases, highlighting its potential role in gene expression and regulation (Shen2022AnimalTFDB). However, specific details about its splice variant isoforms or additional structural domains are not provided in the available context.
