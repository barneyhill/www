# G3BP2

## Overview
G3BP2, or Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes the G3BP stress granule assembly factor 2, a multifunctional protein involved in cellular stress responses and mRNA metabolism. This protein is a key component of stress granules, which are cytoplasmic aggregates that form in response to environmental stress and play a crucial role in regulating mRNA stability and translation. G3BP2 is characterized by several functional domains, including an N-terminal nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and an arginine-glycine-rich (RGG) domain, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins (Kang2021Research; Zheng2021G3BP2). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA decay, stress granule dynamics, and viral replication, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Kang2021Research; Zheng2021G3BP2).

## Structure
G3BP2, a member of the G3BP protein family, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, which is involved in dimerization and cellular localization (Kang2021Research; Götte2019Separate). The protein also features an RNA recognition motif (RRM), essential for RNA binding, and an arginine-glycine-rich (RGG) domain, which plays a role in protein-protein interactions and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Kang2021Research; Zheng2021G3BP2).

G3BP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and methylation. Phosphorylation affects its oligomerization and mRNA decay, while methylation inhibits stress granule formation (Kang2021Research). G3BP2 exists in different isoforms, with G3BP2b being a spliced variant of G3BP2a, lacking 33 amino acids in its central region (Kang2021Research).

The protein's structure facilitates its involvement in stress granule assembly and interaction with viral proteins, impacting processes like mRNA stability and translation (Kang2021Research; Götte2019Separate). These structural features make G3BP2 a significant factor in cellular stress responses and viral replication.

## Function
G3BP2, a member of the G3BP protein family, is involved in several critical cellular processes. It functions as a site-specific ribonucleic acid endonuclease and plays a significant role in the formation and activity of stress granules (SGs), which are aggregates of translationally stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes that form in response to environmental stresses (Kang2021Research). These stress granules are crucial for cellular stress responses, as they help regulate mRNA translation and attenuation, thereby affecting gene expression (Kang2021Research).

G3BP2 is highly expressed in the small intestine and brain, indicating its importance in these tissues (Kang2021Research). The protein contains several distinct motifs, including the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) domain, which is associated with nuclear transport and cellular localization, and the RNA recognition motif (RRM), essential for RNA binding (Kang2021Research). The RGG domain of G3BP2 is crucial for recruiting the host translation machinery and mediating protein-protein interactions (Kang2021Research).

In healthy cells, G3BP2 is involved in regulating mRNA levels, affecting the stability and translation efficiency of specific mRNAs, and participating in various signaling pathways, including the NF-kB, ERK, p53, and Ras pathways (Kang2021Research).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the G3BP2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). G3BP2 is upregulated in ESCC, correlating with poor patient outcomes, lymph node metastasis, and deeper tumor invasion. This upregulation is associated with unfavorable prognosis due to its role in enhancing tumor cell migration and invasion (Zheng2021G3BP2). The interaction between G3BP2 and the long non-coding RNA LINC01554 is crucial for stabilizing G3BP2 protein levels, which in turn stabilizes HDGF mRNA, promoting metastasis in ESCC (Zheng2021G3BP2).

In addition to ESCC, G3BP2 is highly expressed in other squamous cell carcinomas, such as lung and head and neck cancers, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zheng2021G3BP2). The use of G3BP2 inhibitors, like compound C108, has shown promise in reducing tumor cell migration and invasion, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting G3BP2 in cancer treatment (Zheng2021G3BP2).

G3BP2 is also involved in radioresistance in oral cancer, where its expression is regulated by the FOXD1 gene. FOXD1 upregulation leads to increased G3BP2 expression, contributing to radioresistance by inhibiting p53 activity, which is crucial for DNA damage response (Lin2020FOXD1).

## Interactions
G3BP2 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in stress granule (SG) assembly and cellular stress responses. It interacts with Caprin1 and USP10, forming complexes that mediate SG condensation. The binding of USP10 to G3BP2 inhibits SG formation by altering the physical state of G3BP2, making it SG-incompetent (Kedersha2016G3BP–Caprin1–USP10). G3BP2 also associates with 40S ribosomal subunits, a connection that is partly resistant to RNase, suggesting a potential RNA-independent interaction (Kedersha2016G3BP–Caprin1–USP10).

In the context of viral infections, G3BP2 interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which disrupts its interactions with other SG-related proteins such as USP10 and PKR. This interaction enhances the phase separation of G3BP2, forming larger and more stable liquid droplets in the presence of RNA (Luo2021SARSCoV2). G3BP2 also physically interacts with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, facilitating the assembly of viral replication complexes and enhancing virion production (Murigneux2024Proteomic).

These interactions highlight G3BP2's role in both cellular stress responses and viral replication processes, underscoring its importance in regulating SG dynamics and translation regulation.
