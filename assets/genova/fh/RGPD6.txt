# RGPD6

## Overview
RGPD6 is a gene that encodes the protein RANBP2-like and GRIP domain containing 6, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the nuclear import of proteins bearing nuclear localization signals (NLS). The protein is characterized by its RANBP2-like and GRIP domains, which suggest a role in intracellular transport and possibly in the regulation of gene expression. RGPD6 has been associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as certain cancers, indicating its potential significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Annear2022NonMendelian; Zhang2017miR3635p). The gene's involvement in these conditions is thought to be influenced by its enrichment with CGG short tandem repeats, which may contribute to genetic variability and disease susceptibility (Annear2022NonMendelian).

## Clinical Significance
The RGPD6 gene has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Deletions of RGPD6 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and severe intellectual disability, although the precise biological function and role of RGPD6 in these conditions remain largely unknown (Annear2022NonMendelian). The gene is enriched with CGG short tandem repeats (STRs), which are more common in neurodegenerative diseases than previously thought, suggesting that these repeats could contribute to the missing heritability in such diagnoses (Annear2022NonMendelian).

RGPD6 is also involved in the import of NLS-bearing proteins into the nucleus, and its CGG STRs show high variability, which may play a role in genetic expression and cognition (Annear2022NonMendelian). In the context of cancer, RGPD6 has been identified as a target of hsa-miR-363-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with low expression of this miRNA associated with better overall survival, suggesting a potential prognostic role (Zhang2017miR3635p). Additionally, RGPD6 has been linked to specific radiomic features in pancreatic cancer, indicating its possible involvement in tumor texture patterns (Zheng2024radioGWAS). However, the clinical significance of RGPD6 mutations in these contexts is still under investigation.
