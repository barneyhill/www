# RNF217

## Overview
RNF217 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 217, a member of the RING finger family of proteins, which are characterized by their involvement in the ubiquitination process. This protein, also known as Opposite of STL (OSTL), is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase due to its RING-IBR-RING domain structure, which facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation. The RNF217 protein is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the testis and skeletal muscle, and is implicated in cellular processes such as apoptosis regulation and iron metabolism. It interacts with proteins like HAX1, influencing apoptosis, and ECM26, indicating a role in protein degradation pathways. Clinically, RNF217 is associated with hematologic malignancies, including leukemia and multiple myeloma, where its expression and interactions may contribute to disease progression and serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Fontanari2014Identification; Zhou2020Comprehensive; Ganz2021New).

## Structure
The RNF217 protein, also known as Opposite of STL (OSTL), is a member of the RING finger family of proteins and is characterized by its RING-IBR-RING domain structure. It consists of 284 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa (Fontanari2014Identification). The protein includes three distinct domains: a variant N-terminal RING finger (RING1), an in-between-RING finger domain (IBR), and a consensus RING finger (RING2) at the C-terminal end (Fontanari2014Identification). The RING1 domain of RNF217 is notable for having a lysine residue instead of a histidine at the H4 position, and the spacing between cysteines 7 and 8 is four amino acids, differing from the typical consensus sequence (Fontanari2014Identification).

RNF217 is subject to extensive alternative splicing, resulting in at least seven putative protein-encoding splice variants (Fontanari2014Identification). The protein is highly conserved in vertebrates and is involved in protein ubiquitination, a process significant in human leukemia (Fontanari2014Identification). The interaction of RNF217 with the anti-apoptotic protein HAX1, mediated by the RING1 domain, suggests a role in apoptosis regulation (Fontanari2014Identification). The protein's structure and interactions highlight its potential involvement in leukemogenesis through the deregulation of ubiquitination processes (Fontanari2014Identification).

## Function
RNF217, also known as ring finger protein 217, is a member of the RING finger family of proteins, which are primarily involved in the process of ubiquitination. This process tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Nakamura2011The; Jeong2023Targeting). RNF217 contains a RING-IBR-RING domain structure, which is characteristic of the RBR family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. These domains facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to a substrate protein, a critical step in the ubiquitination pathway (Jeong2023Targeting).

In healthy human cells, RNF217 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the testis and skeletal muscle (Fontanari2014Identification). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays roles in cellular signaling and apoptosis regulation. RNF217 interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein HAX1, suggesting a role in apoptosis homeostasis by potentially influencing mitochondrial membrane potential and preventing apoptosis (Fontanari2014Identification). This interaction is mediated by the RING1 domain of RNF217, highlighting its involvement in protein-protein interactions necessary for its function (Fontanari2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF217 gene, also known as OSTL, have been implicated in various forms of leukemia. The gene is located adjacent to a translocation breakpoint involving ETV6 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), suggesting that its deregulation may contribute to leukemogenesis (Fontanari2014Identification). RNF217 is highly expressed in certain human leukemias, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its expression levels are higher compared to lymphoblastic leukemias (Fontanari2014Identification). The interaction of RNF217 with the anti-apoptotic protein HAX1 suggests a role in apoptosis regulation, where its deregulation could lead to imbalanced apoptosis signaling, promoting leukemia development (Fontanari2014Identification).

In multiple myeloma (MM), circ-RNF217, a circular RNA derived from the RNF217 gene, is upregulated and associated with poor treatment response and survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhou2020Comprehensive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RNF217 in hematologic malignancies and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
RNF217, a RING-IBR-RING protein, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1), an anti-apoptotic protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and preventing apoptosis. This interaction is mediated by the RING1 domain of RNF217 and has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-transfection experiments. The interaction suggests a potential role for RNF217 in apoptosis regulation, possibly influencing leukemia progression by affecting HAX1 stability and function (Fontanari2014Identification).

RNF217 is also involved in the ubiquitination process, interacting with the 26 S proteasome-binding protein ECM26, which may indicate a role in protein degradation pathways (Fontanari2014Identification). Additionally, RNF217 has been identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contributes to the degradation of ferroportin, a cellular iron exporter, in response to the hormone hepcidin. This interaction is crucial for regulating systemic iron homeostasis, as RNF217 facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ferroportin (Ganz2021New). These interactions highlight RNF217's involvement in both apoptosis regulation and iron metabolism.
