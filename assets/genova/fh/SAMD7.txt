# SAMD7

## Overview
SAMD7 (sterile alpha motif domain containing 7) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly within the retina. The protein, also named SAMD7, is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is integral to its role in mediating protein-protein interactions necessary for cellular processes such as signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. SAMD7 is predominantly expressed in the photoreceptor nuclei of the retina, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor, modulating the expression of genes regulated by the cone-rod homeobox (CRX) transcription factor. This regulatory activity is crucial for photoreceptor development and function, and disruptions in SAMD7 expression have been linked to retinal diseases, including autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) (Van2016Autosomal).

## Function
SAMD7 (sterile alpha motif domain containing 7) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the retina. The SAMD7 protein is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes such as signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, SAMD7 is predominantly expressed in the photoreceptor nuclei of the retina, where it plays a significant role in regulating photoreceptor function (Van2016Autosomal).

SAMD7 acts as a transcriptional repressor, fine-tuning the expression of genes regulated by the cone-rod homeobox (CRX) transcription factor, which is essential for photoreceptor development and function (Van2016Autosomal). The gene contains cis-regulatory binding regions (CBRs) that are crucial for its transcriptional activity. Variants in these regions can disrupt CRX-binding motifs, affecting SAMD7 expression and potentially altering the expression of other retinal degeneration (RD) genes (Van2016Autosomal). This regulatory role underscores the importance of SAMD7 in maintaining normal retinal function and highlights its potential involvement in retinal diseases when its expression is disrupted (Van2016Autosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SAMD7 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), particularly in a Turkish consanguineous family. This family exhibited a rare homozygous missense mutation in the RHO gene (E150K) alongside non-coding variants in the cis-regulatory regions of SAMD7, which are believed to affect its expression (Van2016Autosomal). These non-coding variants are located in CRX-binding regions, specifically in the promoter regions termed CBR1 and CBR2, and have been shown to decrease SAMD7 reporter activity, suggesting a cis-regulatory effect on SAMD7 expression (Van2016Autosomal).

The presence of these variants may contribute to the unusual retinal phenotype observed in the affected family members, characterized by distinct pigmentary changes and other classic RP symptoms (Van2016Autosomal). Functional assays demonstrated that the combined cis-regulatory activity of CBR1 and CBR2 is impaired in patient constructs, which could have implications for SAMD7 transcription regulation and potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of arRP (Van2016Autosomal). These findings suggest that SAMD7 could be a candidate gene for retinal diseases, with its expression potentially influenced by non-coding regulatory elements (Van2016Autosomal).
