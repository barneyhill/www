# ADAMTS10

## Overview
ADAMTS10 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 10, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is a secreted metalloprotease involved in the formation and maintenance of microfibrils, primarily through its interaction with fibrillin-1, a key component of the extracellular matrix (Kutz2011ADAMTS10). ADAMTS10 plays a crucial role in microfibril biogenesis and the structural organization of tissues, contributing to cell-matrix interactions and the formation of focal adhesions (Cain2016ADAMTS10). Mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene are linked to Weill-Marchesani syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by short stature, joint stiffness, and ocular abnormalities (Dagoneau2004ADAMTS10). The protein's interactions with other extracellular matrix components, such as lysyl oxidase and the tumor suppressor protein RECK, further underscore its significance in maintaining tissue integrity and stability (Matsuzaki2018The; Aviram2019Interactions).

## Structure
ADAMTS10 is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, thrombospondin type 1 motifs, and a cysteine-rich domain (Takeda2016ADAM). The signal peptide is crucial for the protein's entry into the secretory pathway, and mutations in this region can disrupt protein localization, as seen with the leucine to glutamine substitution at position 14 (Steinkellner2014Identification).

The metalloproteinase domain of ADAMTS10 is part of the metzincin superfamily, featuring a conserved HEXXHXXGXXH sequence that coordinates a catalytic zinc ion (Takeda2016ADAM). This domain is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are common in M12B proteinases (Takeda2016ADAM). The disintegrin-like domain in ADAMTS proteins, including ADAMTS10, adopts an ADAM_CR domain fold rather than a classic disintegrin-like structure (Takeda2016ADAM).

ADAMTS10 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which are essential for its stability and secretion. Mutations affecting these modifications can lead to protein instability and impaired secretion (Steinkellner2014Identification). The protein is secreted as a zymogen and is resistant to furin cleavage, which is atypical for ADAMTS proteins (Mularczyk2018ADAMTS10mediated).

## Function
ADAMTS10 is a secreted metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of microfibrils, particularly through its interaction with fibrillin-1, a major component of tissue microfibrils. This interaction is significant for the structural integrity of tissues, as ADAMTS10 binds to fibrillin-1 with high specificity and affinity, promoting its deposition in the extracellular matrix (Kutz2011ADAMTS10). ADAMTS10 is involved in microfibril biogenesis, enhancing the assembly of fibrillin-1 microfibrils without significantly affecting fibrillin-1 production levels, suggesting its role is more in assembly than in synthesis (Kutz2011ADAMTS10).

In cell biology, ADAMTS10 supports the formation of focal adhesions, which are essential for microfibril deposition and cell-matrix interactions. It maintains cell-cell and heparan sulfate-rich cell-matrix interfaces, crucial for the formation of ordered microfibril arrays (Cain2016ADAMTS10). ADAMTS10 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, lung, and pancreas, and is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to the structural organization of microfibrils in tissues (Karoulias2020The; Somerville2004Discovery).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene are associated with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), a rare connective tissue disorder. WMS is characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and ocular abnormalities such as microspherophakia and ectopia of the lenses. Specific mutations in ADAMTS10, including nonsense and splice-site mutations, lead to truncated proteins that disrupt normal extracellular matrix function, contributing to the clinical manifestations of WMS (Dagoneau2004ADAMTS10). 

A novel mutation in the pro-domain of ADAMTS10, c.232T>C, p. Tyr78His, has been linked to severe cardiac abnormalities in WMS patients, including stenosis in various heart areas. This mutation is considered deleterious and is associated with unique cardiac presentations, although not all WMS patients exhibit these anomalies (Levitas2023A). 

In a canine model, a Gly661Arg substitution in ADAMTS10 has been implicated in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This mutation affects the stability and function of the extracellular matrix in the trabecular meshwork, leading to increased intraocular pressure and contributing to the pathogenesis of POAG (Kuchtey2011Mapping). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ADAMTS10 mutations in connective tissue disorders and their potential impact on ocular and cardiovascular health.

## Interactions
ADAMTS10 interacts with fibrillin-1, a major component of tissue microfibrils, promoting its deposition in the extracellular matrix. This interaction is significant in the context of Weill-Marchesani syndrome, where mutations in ADAMTS10 and FBN1 (the gene encoding fibrillin-1) result in similar phenotypes. ADAMTS10 binds to two distinct regions of fibrillin-1, one in the N-terminal half and another in the C-terminal half, with high specificity and affinity (Kutz2011ADAMTS10).

ADAMTS10 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein RECK, which stabilizes ADAMTS10 by protecting it from fragmentation. This interaction suggests a novel connection between these two clinically significant proteins, influencing each other's stability and activity (Matsuzaki2018The).

Additionally, ADAMTS10 forms complexes with lysyl oxidase (LOX), indicating a potential crosstalk between these extracellular matrix families. This interaction was demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation assays and proximity ligation assays, showing that LOX and ADAMTS10 may interact both extracellularly and intracellularly (Aviram2019Interactions).
