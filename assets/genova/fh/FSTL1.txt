# FSTL1

## Overview
FSTL1, or follistatin-like 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the SPARC family of proteins. The protein, also referred to as FSTL1, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as a follistatin-like domain, a Kazal-like domain, and EF-hand calcium-binding domains, among others (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike). Functionally, FSTL1 is involved in a variety of biological processes, including cardiovascular development, lung tissue development, and immune response regulation. It plays a crucial role in heart muscle regeneration and modulates signaling pathways such as BMP, SHH, WNT, and FGF (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). The protein's interactions with receptors like DIP2A, TLR4, and BMP receptors underscore its involvement in diverse signaling pathways, influencing processes such as angiogenesis and inflammation (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike). Clinically, FSTL1 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, where its expression levels can serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets (Chan2008Tumor; Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike).

## Structure
Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is a secreted glycoprotein that is part of the SPARC family of proteins. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: a secretion signal, a follistatin-like domain, a Kazal-like domain, two EF-hand calcium-binding domains, and a von Willebrand factor type C domain (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike). The primary structure of FSTL1 consists of 308 amino acids in humans, with a high degree of similarity (94.4%) to the mouse FSTL1 sequence (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike).

FSTL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its biological activity. In humans, one glycosylated form has been identified, utilizing two of the three potential N-glycosylation sites (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike). The glycosylation state affects its function, influencing processes such as proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects in cardiomyocytes (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike).

The quaternary structure of FSTL1 is suggested by its ability to form homodimers, although specific details on secondary and tertiary structures are not provided in the available context. The presence of glycosylated isoforms indicates the existence of post-translational modifications, but specific splice variant isoforms are not detailed (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

## Function
Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cardiovascular development and function, particularly in the growth of cardiac myofibrils and the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, which are crucial for heart muscle regeneration (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). FSTL1 is expressed in multiple cell types within the heart, including vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes, and is involved in the response to cardiac injury (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike).

FSTL1 is also involved in lung tissue development, where it regulates signaling pathways such as BMP, SHH, WNT, and FGF, which are important for lung smooth muscle development (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). In the context of inflammation, FSTL1 acts as both an anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory factor, depending on the context, and is involved in the regulation of immune responses (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

The protein is active in the extracellular matrix and influences processes like angiogenesis and immune response regulation. It interacts with several receptors, including DIP2A, TLR4, and BMP receptors, indicating its involvement in multiple signaling pathways (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike). FSTL1's function is influenced by its glycosylation state, affecting its biological activity, such as promoting proliferation in cardiomyocytes when glycosylated (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FSTL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In ovarian and endometrial cancers, FSTL1 is consistently downregulated, with a 4-fold decrease in endometrial cancer and a 9.5-fold decrease in ovarian cancer. This downregulation is associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for FSTL1 (Chan2008Tumor). In cervical cancer, FSTL1 expression is also reduced, correlating with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its overexpression inhibits these processes and promotes apoptosis (Liu2023Analysis).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FSTL1 is downregulated, and its knockdown leads to increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor (Ni2017FSTL1). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, FSTL1 is overexpressed and associated with larger tumor size and poorer survival outcomes, suggesting a role in promoting cancer progression (Yang2017FSTL1).

In cardiovascular diseases, elevated levels of FSTL1 are observed in conditions such as heart failure and acute coronary syndrome, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike). These findings highlight the complex role of FSTL1 in disease, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context.

## Interactions
Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is known to interact with several receptors and proteins, primarily within the TGF-β superfamily. It interacts with the type I transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFBR1) and bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMP-receptors), acting as an antagonist to BMP signaling by interacting with the BMPRII receptor and the BMP4 factor (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). FSTL1 also binds to the disco-interacting protein 2 (DIP2A) receptor, which is involved in preventing the degradation of tissue proteins by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and mediating various signaling pathways (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Mattiotti2018Follistatinlike).

FSTL1 interacts with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein (CD14), activating inflammatory responses through the TLR4/CD14 pathway (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). It is also involved in the activation of signaling pathways such as MAPK, JAK/STAT3, and NF-kB, which are crucial for its role in inflammation and immune response (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). The protein's interactions with these receptors and pathways highlight its complex role in modulating cellular processes and its potential impact on various diseases.
