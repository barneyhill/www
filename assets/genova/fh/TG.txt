# TG

## Overview
The TG gene encodes thyroglobulin, a large glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones, specifically thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroglobulin is synthesized in the thyroid gland and secreted into the follicular lumen, where it serves as a precursor and matrix for hormone production. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple domains and extensive glycosylation, which are essential for its function. The CholinEsterase-Like (ChEL) domain within thyroglobulin acts as an intramolecular chaperone, facilitating proper folding and secretion. Mutations in the TG gene can lead to thyroid dysfunctions such as congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid dyshormonogenesis, highlighting its clinical significance (Citterio2019The; Holzer2016Thyroglobulin; Rivolta2006Molecular).

## Structure
The human thyroglobulin (TG) protein is a large, homodimeric glycoprotein essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. Its primary structure consists of a long polypeptide chain with approximately 2750 amino acid residues, including numerous tyrosine residues critical for hormone production (Holzer2016Thyroglobulin). The secondary structure of TG includes multiple repeating domains, such as Tg type 1, Tg type 2, and Tg type 3 domains, each with specific sequence motifs and structural features (Kim2021The). 

The tertiary structure of TG involves complex folding, with the presence of a CholinEsterase-Like (ChEL) domain at the C-terminal end, which is involved in the conformational maturation and export of TG (Holzer2016Thyroglobulin). The quaternary structure forms a 660 kDa homodimer, stabilized by extensive interchain contacts and numerous disulfide bridges, contributing to its structural stability (Holzer2016Thyroglobulin; Adaixo2021Cryo-EM).

TG is heavily glycosylated, with multiple N-linked glycosylation sites that are crucial for its biological function (Kim2021The). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including iodination of specific tyrosine residues, which are essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (Adaixo2021Cryo-EM).

## Function
The thyroglobulin (TG) gene encodes a large glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), in healthy human cells. TG is synthesized and secreted by thyroid cells into the follicular lumen of the thyroid gland, where it serves as a matrix for thyroid hormone synthesis and storage of iodine (van2001Up; Rivolta2006Molecular). The protein undergoes iodination of tyrosine residues, leading to the formation of monoiodotyrosines and di-iodotyrosines, which are then coupled to form T4 and T3 (Lamas1989Consensus; van2001Up).

The TG protein is active in the thyroid follicular lumen, where it undergoes complex post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and iodination, essential for its maturation and function (Rivolta2006Molecular; Lee2008The). The cholinesterase-like (ChEL) domain within TG functions as an intramolecular chaperone, facilitating the proper folding and secretion of TG from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis (Lee2008The). Proper functioning of the TG gene is essential for maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis, and mutations can lead to thyroid dysfunction (Citterio2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the thyroglobulin (TG) gene are associated with several thyroid-related disorders, primarily congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid dyshormonogenesis. These conditions often manifest as goiter and can range from euthyroid states to severe hypothyroidism. The TG gene mutations can lead to structural defects in the protein, resulting in its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis (Rivolta2006Molecular; Siffo2018Molecular). 

Congenital hypothyroidism due to TG mutations is a significant cause of intellectual disability if untreated, with an incidence of about 1 in 3,000 newborns. These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, requiring individuals to be homozygous or compound heterozygous (FernándezCancio2024Clinical). 

Specific mutations, such as p.R2317Q, p.A2343P, and p.W2346R, are predicted to be pathogenic, causing retention of TG in the endoplasmic reticulum and leading to ER storage disease (ERSD) (Siffo2018Molecular). Additionally, TG gene mutations have been linked to thyroid cancers, including papillary and follicular carcinoma, with some mutations affecting the ACHE-homology domain and leading to structural instability of the TG protein (VonoToniolo2005Naturally; Rivolta2006Molecular).

## Interactions
Thyroglobulin (TG) interacts with various proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate its proper folding and maturation. TG forms intermolecular disulfide-linked adducts with ER oxidoreductases such as ERp72, CaBP1/P5, ERp57, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). These interactions are crucial for the oxidative maturation of TG, allowing it to acquire its native conformation (Di2014Transient; Di2015Thyroglobulin).

TG also engages with ER chaperones like BiP, GRP94, calreticulin (CRT), and calnexin (CNX). These chaperones assist in the folding process by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions and facilitating the recruitment of oxidoreductases to specific sites on TG (Di2014Transient; Delom1999Involvement). The interaction with CRT and CNX is carbohydrate-dependent and is essential for the maturation of TG's intrachain disulfide bonds (Di2015Thyroglobulin).

In the context of mutations associated with thyroid dyshormonogenesis, TG shows altered interactions with components of the ER lectin chaperone network, such as calreticulin and PDIA3, which may lead to unique protein quality control defects (Wright2021Thyroglobulin). These interactions highlight the complex network of proteins involved in TG's folding and maturation process.
