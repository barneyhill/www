# OLFML2B

## Overview
OLFML2B is a gene that encodes the protein olfactomedin like 2B, which is a member of the olfactomedin family. This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of an olfactomedin-like domain, typically involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and interactions within the extracellular matrix (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). The OLFML2B protein is secreted and plays a significant role in modulating cell-cell communication, particularly in ocular tissues such as the retina, cornea, and lens, suggesting its involvement in maintaining eye physiology and neural processes (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike; Li2019Olfactomedin). Additionally, OLFML2B is implicated in various interactions within the tumor microenvironment, influencing immune pathways and cancer progression (Hu2022PanCancer). Its expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in several cancers, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2021OLFML2B).

## Structure
OLFML2B encodes a protein that is part of the olfactomedin family, characterized by an olfactomedin-like domain located at the C-terminal region. The protein consists of 753 amino acids in humans and includes a signal sequence at the N-terminal, which is typical for proteins that are secreted or located in the extracellular matrix (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). The primary structure of OLFML2B features two tandem CXCXCX9C motifs, a putative coiled-coil region, and a serine/threonine-rich region, which may contribute to its structural stability and function (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). 

The protein also contains two or three potential N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that can influence protein folding, stability, and interactions (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). OLFML2B is known to bind to proteoglycans, suggesting a role in cell-cell interaction and signaling (GarzaRodríguez2019Olfactomedinlike). No evidence of alternative splicing was found for OLFML2B in the tissues examined, which contrasts with previous findings in other species (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures have not been detailed in the available literature.

## Function
OLFML2B (olfactomedin like 2B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the extracellular space. The protein is part of the olfactomedin family, which is known for roles in cell adhesion, signaling, and extracellular matrix interactions. OLFML2B is implicated in modulating cell-cell communication and may influence tissue development and maintenance (Li2019Olfactomedin).

In healthy human cells, OLFML2B is expressed in ocular tissues, including the retina, cornea, and lens, suggesting a role in eye physiology. The protein's presence in these tissues indicates its potential involvement in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the eye, similar to other olfactomedin proteins associated with eye health (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike). The expression of OLFML2B in the retina, particularly in ganglion cells and other retinal layers, supports its role in neural and visual processes (PérezIbave2016Olfactomedinlike).

While the specific molecular activities of OLFML2B in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its high expression in the brain and ocular tissues suggests significant roles in neurodevelopment and visual function (Li2019Olfactomedin). Further research is needed to clarify its precise functions and mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The OLFML2B gene has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and bladder cancer. In LUAD and LUSC, OLFML2B is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced cancer stages. Its expression is linked to smoking history, TP53 mutations, and impaired immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, while promoting regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages, suggesting a role in immune escape and tumor progression (Wang2021OLFML2B).

In bladder cancer, high OLFML2B expression is associated with worse prognosis, increased cancer stage and grade, and enhanced tumor cell migration and proliferation. It is also linked to macrophage infiltration, indicating its involvement in the tumor microenvironment and potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2021OLFML2B).

Pan-cancer analyses reveal that OLFML2B expression is associated with immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability across various cancers. It is involved in immune-related pathways and may influence drug sensitivity, highlighting its role in cancer prognosis and treatment efficacy (Hu2022PanCancer).

## Interactions
OLFML2B is involved in various interactions within the tumor microenvironment and immune pathways. It is coexpressed with several immune-associated genes, including chemokines, chemokine receptors, immune activation genes, and immunosuppressive genes. Notably, OLFML2B is coexpressed with TNFSF4, TNFSF8, STING1, IL6, IL2RA, CXCR4, CXCL12, CD276, and CD27, as well as immunosuppressive genes like TIGIT, TGFB1, IL10, CTLA4, CSF1R, CD274, and BTLA (Hu2022PanCancer). 

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis has identified 50 OLFML2B-binding proteins, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Hu2022PanCancer). In bladder cancer, OLFML2B is highly coexpressed with tumor-associated macrophage markers such as CD14, CD163, CSF1R, ITGAM, and MRC1, indicating a potential role in immune modulation (Lin2021OLFML2B). 

OLFML2B also binds selectively to chondroitin sulphate-E and heparin, which are involved in regulating growth factor interactions (Lin2021OLFML2B). These interactions highlight OLFML2B's involvement in the crosstalk between cancer cells and the immune system, potentially influencing cancer progression and immune response.
