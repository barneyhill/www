# GAPT

## Overview
The GAPT gene encodes the GRB2 binding adaptor protein, transmembrane, which is a transmembrane adaptor protein primarily expressed in B cells and myeloid cells. This protein is characterized by its short extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with multiple tyrosine residues, crucial for its interaction with signaling molecules (Draber2012Transmembrane; Liu2008Identification). Unlike other proteins in the LAT family, GAPT does not undergo phosphorylation upon B cell receptor (BCR) ligation but maintains a constitutive association with the adaptor protein Grb2 through a proline-rich region, indicating a unique interaction mechanism involving SH3 domains (Liu2008Identification). GAPT's role in B cell signaling and proliferation, particularly under conditions of persistent low-grade BCR ligation, highlights its potential significance in immune cell function and its implications in hematological disorders (Liu2008Identification).

## Structure
The GAPT protein is a transmembrane adaptor protein encoded by the human GAPT gene. It features a short extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail containing multiple tyrosine residues, four of which are within Grb2-binding motifs (Draber2012Transmembrane; Liu2008Identification). The primary structure of GAPT includes seven tyrosine residues in its cytosolic region, which are crucial for its interaction with signaling molecules (Draber2012Transmembrane). 

GAPT shares structural similarities with LAT family proteins, which are known for their roles in immune cell signaling (Liu2008Identification). Despite these similarities, GAPT is distinct in that it does not undergo phosphorylation upon B cell receptor (BCR) ligation, yet it constitutively associates with Grb2 through a proline-rich region, suggesting an interaction mechanism involving SH3 domains rather than the typical phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction (Liu2008Identification). 

The protein is primarily localized to the plasma membrane but is excluded from lipid rafts, even though it contains two membrane-proximal cysteines that could potentially be palmitoylated (Liu2008Identification). The molecular weight of GAPT is approximately 17.8 kDa, and it shares 58% homology with its mouse counterpart (Liu2008Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the GAPT gene (GRB2 binding adaptor protein, transmembrane) have been implicated in various hematological disorders. Dysregulation of GAPT can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and immune responses, which are critical factors in the development of conditions such as leukemia and autoimmune diseases. Changes in GAPT expression or its interactions may disrupt normal intracellular signaling pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases. The precise mechanisms by which GAPT alterations lead to these conditions are still under investigation, but its role in immune cell function suggests that it may be a significant factor in the dysregulation observed in these disorders. Understanding the clinical significance of GAPT mutations and expression changes is essential for developing targeted therapies for related hematological and immune conditions.

## Interactions
GAPT (GRB2 binding adaptor protein, transmembrane) is known for its constitutive interaction with the adaptor protein Grb2 in B cells. This interaction is unique because it does not depend on the typical phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction. Instead, the association is mediated through a proline-rich region in GAPT, as demonstrated by the disruption of the GAPT-Grb2 interaction when three conserved prolines are mutated to alanines. This suggests that the SH3 domains of Grb2 are involved in the interaction (Liu2008Identification).

Despite containing multiple Grb2-binding motifs with tyrosine residues, GAPT does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, which is a common mechanism for protein interactions in signal transduction pathways (Liu2008Identification). GAPT is primarily expressed in B cells and myeloid cells, and its role in B cell signaling and proliferation has been studied using GAPT-deficient mice. These studies indicate that GAPT is not essential for BCR-induced Ras/MAPK activation but may regulate B cell proliferation and activation, particularly under conditions of persistent low-grade BCR ligation (Liu2008Identification).
