# TXLNG

## Overview
TXLNG is a gene that encodes the protein γ-taxilin, which is a crucial component in cellular processes such as intracellular vesicle trafficking and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. As a member of the taxilin family, γ-taxilin is characterized by its involvement in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its interaction with syntaxin-4 to facilitate membrane fusion events. This protein plays a significant role in exocytosis and endocytosis, as well as in the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in ER stress pathways (Hotokezaka2015GSK3βdependent). Additionally, γ-taxilin is active in the centrosome, contributing to microtubule organization and spindle orientation during cell division, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ma2021αγTaxilin). The diverse interactions and functions of γ-taxilin underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and its potential implications in various disease processes.

## Function
The TXLNG gene encodes the protein γ-taxilin, which plays a significant role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in healthy human cells. γ-Taxilin is involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical cellular stress response related to the ER. It interacts with syntaxin-4, a member of the syntaxin family, to facilitate membrane fusion events, thereby contributing to the regulation of exocytosis and endocytosis (Hotokezaka2015GSK3βdependent).

In the context of ER stress, γ-taxilin is involved in the phosphorylation of PERK, which subsequently phosphorylates eIF2α. This process reduces the formation of translation initiation complexes, decreasing the levels of unfolded proteins in the ER (Hotokezaka2015GSK3βdependent). γ-Taxilin also interacts with ATF4 to inhibit ATF4-mediated transcription, affecting the transcriptional activation of the ATF4 target gene CHOP (Hotokezaka2015GSK3βdependent).

Additionally, γ-taxilin is active in the centrosome, where it plays a role in microtubule organization and spindle orientation during cell division. It is crucial for the assembly of centriolar subdistal appendages, which serve as microtubule anchoring sites (Ma2021αγTaxilin). This protein is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TXLNG, or taxilin gamma, is involved in various protein interactions that play a role in intracellular transport processes. It is associated with microtubule-based binding and vesicle-mediated trafficking, suggesting its involvement in cellular transport mechanisms (Galligan2014Proteomic). TXLNG has been identified as a potential binding partner for the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, indicating a role in protein degradation pathways (Ravalin2019Specificity). 

In the context of pulmonary hypertension, TXLNG is correlated with ferroptosis-related genes, although its precise role in this process requires further investigation (Hu2023Identification). The gene is also part of a regulatory network involving transcription factors such as PRDM1, FOXO3, and FOXP1, which target TXLNG and other biomarkers in pulmonary hypertension (Hu2023Identification).

In cardiac biology, TXLNG is part of the taxilin family, which includes proteins like Txlnb and Txlna. These proteins share a conserved internal coiled-coil domain and intrinsically disordered protein regions, allowing them to engage with diverse proteins and potentially influence the ubiquitin-proteasome system (McLendon2024A). TXLNG's interactions in these contexts highlight its multifaceted roles in cellular dynamics and disease processes.
