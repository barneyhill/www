# RFX3

## Overview
RFX3 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor Regulatory Factor X3, which is a member of the RFX family characterized by a conserved winged-helix DNA-binding domain. This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in processes related to ciliogenesis and pancreatic endocrine cell development. RFX3 functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor, forming homo- or heterodimers with other RFX family members to regulate the expression of cilia-associated genes and other critical developmental genes. It is involved in various biological processes, including the differentiation of multiciliated cells and the maturation of pancreatic islets. Mutations in the RFX3 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and ciliopathies, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Harris2020Disruption; Memon2024RFX3; Didon2013RFX3).

## Structure
RFX3 is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved winged-helix type DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for recognizing the X-box DNA motif (Zhang2024Rfx3; SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). This domain is part of its primary structure, which also includes an activation domain (AD), domain B, domain C, and a dimerization domain (DIM), typical of Group 1 RFX family members (Zhang2024Rfx3; SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). 

The tertiary structure of RFX3 allows it to function as a transcriptional activator or repressor, forming homo- or heterodimers through its dimerization domain (Zhang2024Rfx3). This quaternary structure is significant for its role in gene regulation, as it can form complexes with other proteins, such as RFX1, to regulate transgene expression (Julien2018RFX1).

RFX3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Additionally, RFX3 has splice variant isoforms that exhibit variations at the N-terminal, potentially affecting nuclear localization signals and subcellular localization (Zhang2024Rfx3). These isoforms contribute to its functional diversity in different tissues and developmental stages.

## Function
RFX3 (Regulatory Factor X3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression related to ciliogenesis in human cells. It functions as a transcriptional co-activator with FOXJ1, enhancing the expression of cilia-associated genes such as DNAI1, DNALI1, SPAG6, TEKT1, and TEKT2. RFX3 amplifies the effects of FOXJ1, promoting the expression of these genes, although it is not sufficient alone to drive the differentiation of basal cells into multiciliated cells (Didon2013RFX3).

RFX3 is also crucial for the development and maturation of human pancreatic islets derived from pluripotent stem cells. It is highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine lineages during differentiation stages, playing a key role in regulating the development of endocrine islet cells. Loss of RFX3 leads to reduced expression of critical endocrine genes and increased cell apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining pancreatic endocrine cell function and identity (Memon2024RFX3).

In the context of motile ciliogenesis, RFX3, along with RFX2, is essential for the differentiation of multiciliated cells, particularly in ependymal cells, where it regulates a core set of ciliogenic genes (Lemeille2020Interplay).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RFX3 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Harris2020Disruption). These mutations often result in loss-of-function variants, such as frameshift, splice donor, missense, and deletion variants, which are primarily de novo, though some inherited cases have been observed (Harris2020Disruption). Clinical manifestations in affected individuals include neurodevelopmental delays, behavioral issues like excitability and aggression, sensory hypersensitivity, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and seizures. Some individuals also exhibit dysmorphic features and head size abnormalities (Harris2020Disruption).

RFX3 is also implicated in ciliopathies, as it plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis. In mice, RFX3 deficiency leads to severe developmental defects and conditions such as hydrocephalus due to impaired differentiation of ciliated cells in the choroid plexus and subcommissural organ (Laurençon2007Identification; Lemeille2020Interplay). The gene's role in ciliary function is essential, and its disruption can lead to significant developmental and physiological abnormalities (Lemeille2020Interplay).

## Interactions
RFX3 is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms both homodimers and heterodimers with other RFX family members, such as RFX1 and RFX2, which are crucial for its function in processes like ciliogenesis and gene expression regulation (Zhang2024Rfx3; Lemeille2020Interplay). In the context of adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction, RFX3 interacts with the D sequence of the AAV inverted terminal repeat, forming heterodimers with RFX1. This interaction influences the efficiency of AAV-mediated transgene expression (Julien2018RFX1).

RFX3 also interacts with other transcription factors, such as Six1 and Forkhead-box proteins like Foxp1, to regulate gene expression in auditory hair cells. These interactions can lead to either activation or repression of target genes, depending on the specific combination of transcription factors and the sequence context of the cis-regulatory elements (Zhang2024Rfx3). The cooperation between RFX3 and these factors is essential for processes such as outer hair cell differentiation and maintenance, as well as hair bundle formation (Zhang2024Rfx3).
