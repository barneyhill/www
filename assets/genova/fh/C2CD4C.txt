# C2CD4C

## Overview
C2CD4C is a gene that encodes the protein C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 4C, which is characterized by the presence of a C2 domain. This domain is known for its role in calcium-dependent membrane targeting, a function that is conserved across various species, underscoring its importance in cellular processes (Omori2016Changes). The C2CD4C protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is distinct from other members of the C2cd4 family, which are typically nuclear (Omori2016Changes). In the context of pancreatic development, C2CD4C is expressed in endocrine progenitor cells and later in insulin- and pancreatic polypeptide-expressing cells, suggesting a role in the differentiation and function of pancreatic endocrine cells (Omori2016Changes). However, studies in knockout mice indicate that C2CD4C is not essential for normal pancreatic development and function (Omori2016Changes).

## Function
The C2CD4C gene encodes a protein that contains a C2 domain, which is typically involved in calcium-dependent membrane targeting. This domain is highly conserved across species, indicating a fundamental role in cellular processes (Omori2016Changes). In the context of pancreatic development, C2CD4C is expressed in pancreatic endocrine progenitors during early embryonic stages and later becomes confined to insulin- and pancreatic polypeptide-expressing cells as development progresses (Omori2016Changes). In adult mice, C2CD4C is specifically localized to beta cells in the pancreas, suggesting its involvement in the function of these cells (Omori2016Changes).

Despite its specific expression pattern, studies have shown that C2CD4C knockout mice exhibit normal pancreatic development and function, indicating that C2CD4C is not essential for these processes (Omori2016Changes). The protein is localized to the cytoplasm, unlike other members of the C2cd4 family, which are nuclear (Omori2016Changes). While the specific molecular activities of C2CD4C in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression in endocrine progenitor cells and overlap with markers such as Nkx6.1 and Ngn3 suggest a role in the differentiation and function of pancreatic endocrine cells (Omori2016Changes).
