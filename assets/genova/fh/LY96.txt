# LY96

## Overview
LY96 is a gene that encodes the protein lymphocyte antigen 96, also known as myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2), which is a secreted glycoprotein integral to the immune response. MD-2 is categorized as a lipid-binding protein and is part of the ML superfamily. It plays a pivotal role in the recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria by forming a complex with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the cell surface. This interaction is crucial for initiating TLR4-mediated signaling pathways that lead to the activation of innate immune responses and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The protein's structure, which includes a strong cationic and hydrophobic binding site, is essential for its function in LPS recognition and immune signaling (JERALA2007Structural; Dou2013Signatures). LY96 is predominantly active in immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, where it facilitates the formation of the MD2/TLR4 complex, underscoring its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to pathogenic threats (Chen2020Macrophagederived).

## Structure
The LY96 gene encodes the protein MD-2, which is crucial for the immune response by forming a complex with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to recognize lipopolysaccharides (LPS). MD-2 is a glycoprotein consisting of 143 amino acids and is part of the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins (JERALA2007Structural). The protein contains seven cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds, essential for its activity (JERALA2007Structural). 

MD-2 has a strong cationic and a hydrophobic binding site, which are important for its function in LPS recognition (JERALA2007Structural). The protein's structure includes a segment similar to amphipathic cationic endotoxin-neutralizing peptides, which binds LPS (JERALA2007Structural). MD-2 undergoes N-linked glycosylation, although this modification is not necessary for LPS binding or signaling (JERALA2007Structural; Dou2013Signatures).

MD-2 forms covalent oligomers, but only the monomeric form is competent for signaling (JERALA2007Structural). The TLR4/MD-2 complex binds LPS with higher affinity than MD-2 alone, highlighting the importance of its quaternary structure in immune signaling (JERALA2007Structural). Sequence threading suggests structural similarity to the dust mite allergen protein Der p 2, although GM2-activating protein may be a better functional model (JERALA2007Structural).

## Function
LY96, also known as myeloid differentiation 2 (MD2), is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the immune response by associating with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the cell surface. This interaction is essential for the recognition and response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which triggers TLR4-mediated signaling pathways. This process leads to the activation of innate immune responses and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for the body's defense against microbial infections (Yi2020Soybean; Dou2013Signatures).

LY96 is primarily active in immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, where it facilitates the formation of the MD2/TLR4 complex. This complex is necessary for the downstream signaling that results in the expression of inflammatory cytokines, playing a significant role in inflammatory responses (Chen2020Macrophagederived). The protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation, which is crucial for its function in TLR4-mediated signal transduction (Dou2013Signatures). LY96's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to pathogenic threats.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LY96 gene, also known as Myeloid Differentiation Protein-2 (MD2), have been implicated in several types of cancer. In Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC), upregulation of LY96 is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stage, and high histological grade. The gene's increased expression is linked to inflammatory responses, potentially contributing to cancer progression through interactions with immune cells like macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (Upregulation; Xu2021LY96&nbsp).

In prostate cancer, LY96 is identified as a critical factor in cancer progression and metastasis. High expression levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and increased risk of metastasis. LY96 is involved in activating signaling pathways such as NF-κB, which promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and proteins associated with cancer cell invasiveness (Ferrari2023Myeloid).

In colon cancer, increased LY96 expression is observed in tumor tissues compared to non-neoplastic tissues, suggesting its role in cancer growth. Targeting LY96 has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to prevent cancer progression and metastasis (Rajamanickam2020Selective). These findings highlight LY96 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
LY96, also known as MD2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune response by forming a complex with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This interaction is essential for the recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, triggering downstream signaling pathways that lead to an immune response (Xu2021LY96&amp; Upregulation; nbsp). LY96 is necessary for the binding of bacterial LPS to TLR4, facilitating the formation of the MD2/TLR4 complex, which is critical for the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, including NF-kB and MAPK (Xu2021LY96&amp; Upregulation; nbsp; Wang2017Saturated).

In addition to its interaction with TLR4, LY96 is involved in the toll-like receptor signaling pathways and interacts with other proteins such as LY86, TLR2, TLR1, and CD180 (Xu2021LY96&amp; Upregulation; nbsp). The correlation between LY96 and TLR4 is notably high, indicating a strong interaction (Xu2021LY96&amp; Upregulation; nbsp). LY96 also interacts with kinases like LYN, LCK, and SYK, which are involved in oncogenic processes such as migration and proliferation (Xu2021LY96&amp; Upregulation; nbsp). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of LY96 in both immune response and cancer progression.
