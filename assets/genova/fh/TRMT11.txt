# TRMT11

## Overview
TRMT11 is a human gene that encodes the tRNA methyltransferase 11 homolog, a protein involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, specifically responsible for catalyzing the formation of N2-methylguanosine (m2G) at position 10 of certain tRNAs. This modification is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of tRNA, which is essential for accurate mRNA translation and overall protein synthesis. The TRMT11 protein functions in a complex with TRMT112, an allosteric activator that enhances its enzymatic activity and stability. The interaction between TRMT11 and TRMT112 is vital for the proper functioning of tRNA methylation, which in turn supports cellular proliferation and global translation efficiency (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine; Wang2020Structural).

## Structure
The TRMT11 protein is characterized by a modular structure that includes an N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain (NFLD) and a THUMP domain, which are crucial for RNA binding and substrate recognition (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine). The THUMP domain is involved in capturing the CCA terminus of tRNA, which is essential for the methylation process (Hori2023Transfer). The C-terminal region of TRMT11 contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain, adopting a typical Rossmann fold, which is common in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (Nishida2022Required; Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine).

TRMT11 forms a complex with the TRMT112 protein, which is crucial for its stability and catalytic activity. This interaction involves the binding of TRMT112 to the catalytic domain of TRMT11, enhancing its stability and preventing aggregation (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine). The quaternary structure of the TRMT11-TRMT112 complex is essential for its function, as TRMT11 alone does not exhibit methylation activity (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or methylation, which can affect its function and stability. Splice variant isoforms of TRMT11 may exist, potentially leading to different protein forms with distinct functions. However, specific details on these aspects are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TRMT11 is a tRNA methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules in human cells. It specifically catalyzes the formation of N2-methylguanosine (m2G) at position 10 of certain tRNAs, a modification that is essential for maintaining the structure and stability of tRNA, which in turn is vital for accurate and efficient mRNA translation (Wang2020Structural; Vasilieva2018The). This modification aids in the proper folding of tRNA and enhances its binding to the ribosomal A-site, facilitating the recognition by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (Wang2020Structural).

TRMT11 functions in a complex with TRMT112, an allosteric activator that is necessary for its enzymatic activity. TRMT112 enhances the binding of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to TRMT11, which is crucial for the methyltransferase activity of TRMT11 (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine; Bourgeois2016Activation). The interaction between TRMT11 and TRMT112 is essential for the stability and solubility of TRMT11, preventing its aggregation and ensuring its proper function in the cell (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine).

In human cells, the absence of TRMT11, along with other tRNA modification enzymes, can lead to impaired cellular proliferation, indicating its role in maintaining normal cell growth and global translation efficiency (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine).

## Interactions
TRMT11, a human gene encoding a tRNA methyltransferase, is involved in the formation of N2-methylguanosine (m2G) at position 10 of tRNA molecules. This modification is crucial for tRNA stability and function. TRMT11 interacts with TRMT112, a small protein that acts as an allosteric activator of various methyltransferases. In eukaryotes, TRMT11 is only active when complexed with TRMT112, which enhances its enzymatic activity and stability (Wang2020Structural; Graille2021Division).

The interaction between TRMT11 and TRMT112 is similar to that observed in yeast, where Trm11p and Trm112p form a complex necessary for the catalytic activity of m2G10 formation in tRNA. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of tRNA methylation, which is important for tRNA folding and stability (Purushothaman2005Trm11p; Wang2020Structural).

TRMT112 interacts with multiple methyltransferases in both yeast and humans, indicating its role as a common activator across different species. These interactions are essential for the stability and function of the methyltransferases, highlighting the importance of TRMT112 in cellular processes involving tRNA modification (Wang2020Structural; Graille2021Division).
