# PATE4

## Overview
PATE4 is a gene that encodes the protein prostate and testis expressed 4, which is primarily expressed in the prostate and testicular tissues. This protein is part of a family of proteins that are involved in reproductive processes, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. PATE4 is thought to play a role in the regulation of reproductive tissue development and function, potentially through interactions with other proteins or signaling pathways. The protein is categorized as a secreted protein, which suggests it may have extracellular roles, possibly in cell signaling or communication within the reproductive system. Understanding the precise mechanisms and pathways involving PATE4 could provide insights into its role in reproductive health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
