# KMT5B

## Overview
KMT5B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine methyltransferase 5B, a member of the SET domain family of proteins, which are known for their role in histone methylation. The KMT5B protein functions as a histone methyltransferase, specifically catalyzing the methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20), a modification crucial for chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Del2014Molecular; Kessler2021Loss). This enzyme is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and influencing processes such as DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle progression (Hyun2017Writing; Kohi2022Biological). Mutations in the KMT5B gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in normal cellular and neurological function (Eliyahu2022Refining; Faundes2018Histone).

## Structure
The KMT5B protein, also known as lysine methyltransferase 5B, is characterized by the presence of a SET domain, which is essential for its methyltransferase activity. This domain is involved in the methylation of lysine residues on histone proteins, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Del2014Molecular). The SET domain family, to which KMT5B belongs, is responsible for methylating specific lysine residues on histones, crucial for processes like epigenetic gene regulation and genome integrity (Del2014Molecular).

In terms of molecular structure, the KMT5B protein has been studied using three-dimensional computational models to predict the structural effects of specific missense variants. These models show that certain residues, such as H181 and N278, form hydrogen bonds with nearby residues, indicating their structural importance for the protein's stability and function (Eliyahu2022Refining). The missense variants identified in KMT5B are highly conserved and predicted to be damaging, with the p.Asn278Ile variant located in the SET domain, crucial for enzyme function (Eliyahu2022Refining).

KMT5B may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can affect its function and stability. The protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially altering its activity or localization. However, specific details on these modifications and isoforms are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
KMT5B, also known as lysine methyltransferase 5B, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in chromatin modification by catalyzing the methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20). This post-translational modification is essential for maintaining chromatin structure and function, impacting processes such as DNA repair, replication, and gene expression regulation (Kohi2022Biological; Kessler2021Loss). KMT5B is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to chromatin organization and genomic stability, influencing cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation (Hyun2017Writing).

In healthy human cells, KMT5B is involved in the di- and trimethylation of H4K20, which is critical for regulating the licensing and activation of early replication origins and maintaining replication timing (Kohi2022Biological). The enzyme's activity is vital for ensuring proper cell cycle progression, particularly during the S-phase, where it helps prevent defects in S-phase entry (Kohi2022Biological). Through its role in chromatin modification, KMT5B also influences gene expression by maintaining the appropriate methylation patterns necessary for genomic integrity and normal cellular function (Kessler2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KMT5B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants in KMT5B have been linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and seizures. These mutations often result in protein-truncating variants (PTVs) that lead to loss of function, suggesting a mechanism of haploinsufficiency. Some patients exhibit protein-altering missense variants, which may indicate alternate mechanisms like gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects, though this is not yet clear (Eliyahu2022Refining; Faundes2018Histone).

KMT5B is also implicated in glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. In glioblastoma cells, KMT5B shows altered DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation profiles, leading to its decreased expression. This downregulation is associated with increased tumorigenic potential, while overexpression of KMT5B has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting an anti-tumoral effect (López2021Epigenetic).

In addition to its role in cancer, KMT5B deficiency in the prefrontal cortex is linked to synaptic dysfunction and social deficits, relevant to ASD. This deficiency leads to reduced expression of glutamate receptor subunits and increased DNA damage, implicating KMT5B in synaptic and social deficits through transcriptional dysregulation (Wang2021Autism).

## Interactions
KMT5B, a histone methyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in chromatin modification and gene expression. It interacts with the RB1 protein, playing a role in inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. This interaction is crucial in the Rb1-Kmt5b-Caspase/Bcl2 axis, which regulates post-mitotic neuronal apoptosis, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Zhao2024Role). The interaction between KMT5B and RB1 is significant for the methylation of histone H4 at lysine-20 (H4K20), which inhibits gene transcription (Zhao2024Role).

KMT5B also participates in the formation of multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It is known to catalyze the histone modification H4K20me2, which is essential for DNA repair and gene transcription (Wang2021Autism). In the context of autism, KMT5B deficiency in the prefrontal cortex leads to synaptic dysfunction and social deficits, highlighting its role in maintaining synaptic function through interactions with nucleic acids (Wang2021Autism).

These interactions underscore KMT5B's role in various cellular processes, including neurodevelopment and synaptic function, through its influence on chromatin structure and gene expression.
