# IL1R1

## Overview
The IL1R1 gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor type 1, a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune and inflammatory responses. This receptor is part of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family and is primarily involved in binding IL-1 cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, to initiate signaling pathways that lead to inflammation. Structurally, IL1R1 features an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin-like domains crucial for ligand binding, and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain essential for signal transduction (Fields2019Structural; Boraschi2013The). The receptor's activity is tightly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammation, which can lead to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Boraschi2013The). IL1R1's interactions with both agonists and antagonists highlight its role in balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer (Lappano2020The; Boraschi2013The).

## Structure
The IL1R1 protein, also known as interleukin 1 receptor type 1, is a transmembrane receptor involved in immune and inflammatory responses. It consists of an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, labeled D1, D2, and D3, which are crucial for ligand binding (Fields2019Structural; Boraschi2013The). The D1 and D2 domains are tightly packed, forming a large groove that serves as one of the primary binding sites for interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokines, while the D3 domain is flexibly connected to D2 and forms a secondary binding site (Fields2019Structural; Boraschi2013The).

The receptor's structure resembles a grasping hand, with a flexible six-amino-acid linker connecting D1/D2 to D3, allowing for significant conformational flexibility (Fields2019Structural). This flexibility is particularly evident in the soluble form of IL1R1, which exhibits greater rotational motion and a wider range of hinge angles compared to the membrane-bound form (Luís2022Conformational).

The cytoplasmic portion of IL1R1 contains a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is homologous to other members of the TIR superfamily and is essential for signal transduction (Boraschi2013The). The receptor can undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function.

## Function
IL1R1 (interleukin 1 receptor type 1) is a crucial component of the immune system, primarily involved in mediating inflammatory responses. It is a membrane-bound receptor that binds interleukin-1 cytokines, specifically IL-1α and IL-1β, initiating a signaling cascade essential for immune and inflammatory responses (Boraschi2017The). Upon binding with its ligands, IL1R1 forms a complex with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which is necessary for signal transduction and the activation of downstream pathways such as NF-κB, leading to the expression of various inflammatory genes (Dinarello2009Immunological).

IL1R1 is expressed on various cell types, including T cells, fibroblasts, epithelial, and endothelial cells, and plays a role in maintaining tissue fitness and homeostasis. It is involved in interactions with the commensal microbiome, crucial for regulating metabolism, immunity, and organ functions, particularly in the intestinal mucosa (Boraschi2013The). The receptor's activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammation, which can lead to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Boraschi2013The). IL1R1's ability to bind both agonists and antagonists with high affinity suggests its involvement in maintaining a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, crucial for immune homeostasis (Boraschi2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL1R1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. The rs13019803 variant in the IL1R1 gene is associated with increased soluble ST2 (sST2) levels and a higher risk of aortic dissection (AD). The presence of the C allele of this variant is linked to elevated sST2 concentrations and an increased risk of type A aortic dissection, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of this cardiovascular condition (Jiang2021Association).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, IL1R1 has been identified as a potential risk gene for celiac disease (CeD). Variants such as Y202H and G398R in IL1R1 are predicted to be deleterious, affecting protein function and potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Mansour2022GenomeWide).

IL1R1 is also involved in inflammatory pathways, with its expression being modulated by miR-197-3p in conditions like Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). This modulation affects cytokine expression and inflammation, highlighting the gene's role in autoinflammatory diseases (AkkayaUlum2021Familial).

Overall, IL1R1's involvement in these conditions underscores its significance in immune response regulation and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
IL1R1, or interleukin 1 receptor type 1, is a key component in the IL-1 signaling pathway, primarily interacting with interleukin-1 (IL-1) ligands such as IL-1α and IL-1β. Upon binding these ligands, IL1R1 forms a complex with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), also known as IL-1R3, to initiate signaling pathways that lead to inflammatory responses (Yang2010Dynamic; Boraschi2017The). This receptor complex recruits the adaptor protein MyD88, which is essential for downstream signaling, leading to the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Yang2010Dynamic; Boraschi2017The).

IL1R1 also interacts with the receptor antagonist IL-1Ra, which competes with IL-1α and IL-1β for binding to IL1R1, thereby preventing the formation of the signaling complex and inhibiting the inflammatory response (Boraschi2017The). The interaction of IL1R1 with IL-1Ra is significant in regulating inflammation and is a target for therapeutic interventions, such as the use of IL-1 inhibitors like Anakinra (Boraschi2017The).

In the context of disease, IL1R1 interactions are implicated in various conditions, including schizophrenia and cancer. For instance, genetic variations in the IL-1 pathway, including SNPs in IL1R1, are associated with schizophrenia risk (Chasovskikh2024Computer). In cancer, IL1R1 signaling is involved in the up-regulation of metastatic genes under hypoxic conditions in breast cancer cells (Lappano2020The).
