# ITGA2B

## Overview
The ITGA2B gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 2b, a critical component of the integrin αIIbβ3 complex, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. This transmembrane protein is predominantly expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes, where it plays a vital role in hemostasis by mediating platelet aggregation. The αIIb subunit, in conjunction with the β3 subunit, facilitates the binding of fibrinogen and other adhesive ligands, which is essential for thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury. The integrin αIIbβ3 undergoes significant conformational changes upon activation, transitioning from a bent to a straightened form to expose ligand-binding sites, a process crucial for its function in blood clotting (Springer2008Structural; Nurden2015Expanding). Mutations in ITGA2B can lead to disorders such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia, characterized by impaired platelet aggregation due to dysfunctional integrin activity (Nurden2011Glanzmann).

## Structure
The ITGA2B gene encodes the αIIb subunit of the αIIbβ3 integrin, which is crucial for platelet aggregation. The αIIb protein is primarily expressed in the megakaryocyte lineage and undergoes several post-translational modifications, including O- and N-glycosylations, during its maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Nurden2015Expanding). The mature αIIb subunit has a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. Structurally, the major extracellular features of αIIb include the N-terminal β-propeller followed by the thigh, calf-1, and calf-2 domains (Nurden2015Expanding).

The β-propeller domain, encoded by exons 1 to 13, is a common site for missense mutations, which can affect the protein's function. These mutations often occur in highly conserved regions and can disrupt the structure by affecting FG-GAP motifs, which are important for the β-propeller's stability and interaction with the β3 subunit (Nurden2015Expanding). The β-propeller structure is characterized by its blades, which are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Nurden2015Expanding). The αIIbβ3 integrin can mediate bidirectional signaling and undergoes a conformational change from a bent to a straight structure upon platelet activation, which exposes binding sites for fibrinogen and other ligands (Nurden2015Expanding).

## Function
The ITGA2B gene encodes the integrin alpha 2b subunit, which pairs with the beta 3 subunit to form the integrin αIIbβ3 complex, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. This integrin is primarily expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes and plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation, a key process in blood clotting. In healthy human cells, αIIb is synthesized as a pro-peptide and forms a complex with β3 in a calcium-dependent manner. This complex undergoes glycosylation and post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Nurden2015Expanding).

The mature αIIbβ3 integrin mediates platelet aggregation by binding fibrinogen and other adhesive ligands, which is essential for thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury. It is also involved in clot retraction and endocytosis of platelet-bound fibrinogen to α-granules (Nurden2015Expanding). The integrin's activation involves a structural change from a bent to a straightened form, exposing binding sites for ligands (Zhu2008Structure). This conformational change is crucial for its function in hemostasis and thrombosis, facilitating stable platelet aggregation and the formation of platelet plugs to stop bleeding (Springer2008Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGA2B gene are primarily associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation due to abnormalities in the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. This condition results from various mutations, including frameshift, missense, and nonsense mutations, which can lead to impaired integrin function and platelet aggregation (Vannier2010Novel; Nurden2015Expanding). A specific example is the homozygous mutation c.175delG, which causes a frameshift and results in a truncated GPIIb protein, severely affecting platelet function (Vannier2010Novel).

The mutation spectrum in ITGA2B is diverse, with missense mutations often affecting the αIIb N-terminal β-propeller region, leading to structural changes that disrupt calcium binding and block αIIbβ3 biosynthesis (Nurden2015Expanding). These mutations can result in different GT phenotypes, including type I and type II, with varying severity of bleeding symptoms (Nurden2011Glanzmann).

Additionally, the ITGA2B R995W mutation is linked to congenital macrothrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by large platelets and reduced platelet count. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the αIIbβ3 receptor, affecting platelet production and function (Kunishima2011Heterozygous).

## Interactions
The ITGA2B gene encodes the integrin alpha IIb subunit, which forms a heterodimer with the integrin beta 3 subunit (ITGB3) to create the αIIbβ3 integrin complex, also known as the platelet glycoprotein complex GPIIb/IIIa. This complex is crucial for platelet aggregation and interacts with several proteins to mediate its function. 

The αIIbβ3 integrin complex interacts with fibrinogen, a key ligand that facilitates platelet aggregation by bridging between platelets. Mutations in ITGA2B can affect the ability of αIIbβ3 to bind fibrinogen, as seen in certain variants that fail to bind fibrinogen or PAC-1 upon activation (Nurden2011Glanzmann). 

The αIIbβ3 integrin also interacts with intracellular proteins such as talin and kindlin, which are involved in integrin activation and signaling pathways. These interactions are essential for the conformational changes that activate the integrin, allowing it to bind extracellular ligands effectively (Nurden2015Expanding).

Mutations in ITGA2B can lead to structural changes that impair these interactions, resulting in conditions like Glanzmann thrombasthenia, characterized by defective platelet aggregation due to impaired integrin function (Nurden2015Expanding).
