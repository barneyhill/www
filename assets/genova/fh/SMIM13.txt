# SMIM13

## Overview
SMIM13 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 13, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to the secretory pathway and membrane dynamics. While the precise biological functions of SMIM13 are still being elucidated, it has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in cancer biology. The expression of SMIM13 has been associated with improved outcomes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential protective role (Arend2022Metabolic). Conversely, its repression in colon cancer, influenced by TMED9, highlights its involvement in the regulatory mechanisms of protein secretion (Mishra2019The). Additionally, SMIM13 has been identified as a potential biomarker in diabetic kidney disease and cognitive dysfunction, indicating its broader relevance in human health (Peng2024Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The SMIM13 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), increased expression of SMIM13 is associated with improved progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance patient outcomes (Arend2022Metabolic). This indicates that SMIM13 may play a protective role in this type of cancer, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

In contrast, in the context of colon cancer, SMIM13 is part of a gene expression signature influenced by TMED9, a protein involved in the ER-Golgi network. TMED9 activity leads to the repression of SMIM13, among other genes, which are integral to the secretory network. This repression is linked to the regulatory mechanisms of protein secretion, which may have implications for understanding colon cancer metastasis (Mishra2019The).

Additionally, SMIM13 has been identified as a potential biomarker in the study of diabetic kidney disease and cognitive dysfunction, although specific details on its clinical significance in these conditions are not provided (Peng2024Identification). Overall, SMIM13's role in disease appears to be context-dependent, with varying implications across different types of cancer and other conditions.
