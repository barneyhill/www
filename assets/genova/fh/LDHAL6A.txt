# LDHAL6A

## Overview
LDHAL6A is a gene that encodes the protein lactate dehydrogenase A like 6A, which is a member of the lactate dehydrogenase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by facilitating the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, a key step in energy production, particularly under anaerobic conditions. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in glycolysis, contributing to the regulation of energy balance and metabolic flexibility within cells (Moolamalla2021Host). LDHAL6A's function extends to various cellular processes, including autophagy and immune response regulation, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to metabolic stress (Sun2024Autophagy). The gene's expression is implicated in several diseases, such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and various cancers, highlighting its potential role in disease progression and metabolic dysregulation (Liu2019Key; Zhang2023Characteristics).

## Function
LDHAL6A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the metabolic conversion of lactate to pyruvate, a critical step in cellular respiration. This protein is part of the lactate dehydrogenase family, which plays a significant role in energy production, particularly under anaerobic conditions. In healthy human cells, LDHAL6A is active in the cytoplasm, contributing to maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic flexibility (Moolamalla2021Host).

The protein encoded by LDHAL6A is involved in glycolysis, a process that breaks down glucose to produce energy. This function is crucial for cells that rely on glycolysis for energy production, especially when oxygen levels are low. The activity of LDHAL6A in glycolysis is linked to its role in lactate production, which is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune responses and cell signaling pathways (Sun2024Autophagy).

LDHAL6A's involvement in glycolysis and lactate production also suggests its potential role in cellular processes such as autophagy, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to metabolic stress (Sun2024Autophagy). The protein's activity in these pathways highlights its importance in cellular metabolism and energy regulation.

## Clinical Significance
LDHAL6A has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), LDHAL6A is one of the genes that is upregulated, suggesting a potential association with the condition, although specific mechanisms or impacts are not detailed (Liu2019Key). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LDHAL6A is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its involvement in cancer metabolism pathways and its potential role in tumor progression (Zhang2023Characteristics). The gene is also associated with altered lactate metabolism, which is a hallmark of cancer, contributing to the acidic tumor microenvironment that promotes immune evasion (Zhang2023Characteristics).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LDHAL6A is upregulated in normal tissues compared to tumor tissues, although it is not identified as an independent prognostic marker (Zhao2022Identifying). Additionally, in Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Region Instability, and Facial Anomalies Syndrome (ICF), LDHAL6A shows decreased DNA methylation and increased mRNA levels, suggesting a connection to germline function, although the primary focus is on the DNMT3B gene (CalleFabregat2020Understanding). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various metabolic and disease processes.
