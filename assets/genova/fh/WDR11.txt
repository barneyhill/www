# WDR11

## Overview
WDR11 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 11 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, including development and signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its multiple WD domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its function in cellular complexes. WDR11 is involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, ciliogenesis, and vesicle trafficking, playing a significant role in embryonic development and cellular differentiation (Kim2017WDR11‐mediated; Navarro2018The). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as EMX1 and components of vesicular transport complexes, underscore its importance in nervous system development and membrane trafficking (Kim2010WDR11; Navarro2018The). Mutations in the WDR11 gene are linked to clinical conditions like idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Kallmann syndrome, highlighting its critical role in reproductive and developmental health (Kim2010WDR11).

## Structure
The WDR11 protein is composed of 1,224 amino acids and features multiple WD domains, which are crucial for its function in mediating protein-protein interactions (Kim2010WDR11). These WD domains form beta-propeller structures, with the protein containing two seven-bladed beta-propellers followed by an alpha-solenoid, a structural motif common in several cellular complexes (Navarro2018The). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by these propeller formations, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and help organize multiprotein complexes (Kim2010WDR11).

WDR11 contains twelve WD domains, with nine confirmed through structural modeling based on homology to the C. elegans homolog of yeast actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1). The first beta-propeller is formed by WD domains 2-6, and the second by WD domains 7-10 (Kim2010WDR11). The protein is predicted to have a transmembrane region at the C-terminal end and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site at residue 1075, indicating potential post-translational modifications (Chernova2001A).

WDR11 is known to interact with the transcription factor EMX1, with interactions mediated through its N-terminus and central region (Kim2010WDR11). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but can colocalize with EMX1 in the nucleus under certain conditions (Kim2010WDR11).

## Function
The WDR11 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in the development and function of the central nervous system and reproductive system. In healthy human cells, WDR11 is involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for embryonic development and cell differentiation. It forms a complex with EMX1 and GLI3, facilitating the transcriptional regulation of target genes such as GNRH1, which is important for reproductive health (Kim2017WDR11‐mediated).

WDR11 is also implicated in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is vital for cellular signaling and motility. Disruption of WDR11 can lead to defects in cilia function, affecting processes like Hedgehog signaling and leading to developmental abnormalities (Kim2017WDR11‐mediated).

In addition to its role in signaling pathways, WDR11 is involved in vesicle tethering and transport processes. It facilitates the tethering of AP-1-derived vesicles, playing a key role in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining proper protein localization within cells (Navarro2018The). The protein's activity is observed in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences processes like cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control (Navarro2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR11 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS). These conditions are characterized by reproductive and developmental issues, with IHH involving a lack of sexual development due to insufficient gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and KS including anosmia or hyposmia (Kim2010WDR11). Mutations such as R395W, H690Q, F1150L, and A435T in WDR11 are located in the WD domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, and are predicted to disrupt normal protein function by altering these domains (Kim2010WDR11).

WDR11 is also implicated in ciliopathies related to KS, as it plays a role in ciliogenesis and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Defects in WDR11-mediated Hh signaling and ciliogenesis may underlie these conditions (Kim2017WDR11‐mediated). Additionally, biallelic loss-of-function variants in WDR11 have been linked to microcephaly and intellectual disability, as observed in affected individuals from multiple families (Haag2021Biallelic).

The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its critical role in developmental processes and its potential impact on a spectrum of developmental disorders, including congenital heart diseases and craniofacial dysmorphism (Kim2017WDR11‐mediated).

## Interactions
WDR11 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor EMX1, which is significant for nervous system development. This interaction involves the N terminus and central portion of WDR11, but not the C terminus, and is confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens, coimmunoprecipitation assays, and GST pull-down analysis (Kim2010WDR11). Mutations in WDR11, such as A435T and H690Q, can disrupt its binding to EMX1, potentially affecting normal protein function (Kim2010WDR11).

WDR11 also forms a stable complex with proteins FAM91A1 and C17orf75, which is involved in vesicular transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This complex is crucial for the tethering of AP-1-derived vesicles, indicating a role in membrane trafficking (Navarro2018The). Additionally, WDR11 interacts with specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) proteins, such as gB, VP16, VP5, and ICP0, suggesting a role in viral assembly and replication (Taylor2015Cellular). These interactions highlight WDR11's involvement in diverse cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, vesicle trafficking, and viral replication.
