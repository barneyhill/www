# OR5C1

## Overview
The OR5C1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily C member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, facilitating the sense of smell through a complex signal transduction pathway (Yin2020Functional). The OR5C1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is integral to the detection and discrimination of a wide array of odorants. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR5C1 and other olfactory receptors have been identified in various non-olfactory tissues, indicating potential additional roles in physiological processes outside of smell perception (Marzotto2014Extreme). The exploration of these roles is an ongoing area of scientific inquiry.

## Function
The OR5C1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants and initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). The olfactory transduction pathway involves the activation of G-proteins, which subsequently trigger a cascade of intracellular events, including the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the opening of ion channels, leading to neuronal depolarization and the transmission of olfactory signals to the brain (Yin2020Functional).

In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR5C1 have been found in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in other biological processes. For instance, OR5C1 has been implicated in sensory perception beyond smell, possibly involving the detection of molecular vibrations (Marzotto2014Extreme). However, the specific functions of OR5C1 in non-olfactory tissues and its broader physiological roles remain areas of active research.
