# TATDN1

## Overview
TATDN1 is a gene that encodes the protein TatD DNase domain containing 1, which is characterized by its TatD-like DNase domain. This protein is primarily involved in DNA repair and genomic stability, functioning as a nuclease with both apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and 3'-5' exonuclease activities. These enzymatic activities are crucial for repairing DNA damage and are facilitated by the presence of divalent metal ions, such as magnesium and manganese, which are essential for its catalytic function (Dorival2023Human). TATDN1 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and prokaryotes, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular processes. The protein's involvement in DNA repair and its interactions with other molecules, such as microRNAs and proteins, also implicate it in cancer progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2018LncRNA).

## Structure
The TATDN1 gene encodes a protein that features a TatD-like DNase domain, which is associated with DNA degradation. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in DNA metabolism. The primary structure of the TATDN1 protein includes a sequence that allows for the formation of secondary structural elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical in proteins with DNase activity. These secondary structures contribute to the protein's ability to interact with DNA substrates effectively.

The tertiary structure of TATDN1 involves the folding of these secondary elements into a three-dimensional conformation that is essential for its enzymatic function. This folding pattern is likely to facilitate the protein's interaction with other molecules and possibly its integration into larger protein complexes, suggesting a potential quaternary structure if it forms such complexes.

Post-translational modifications and splice variants may influence the function and structural conformation of TATDN1, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the available context. These modifications could play a role in regulating the protein's activity and stability, impacting its involvement in DNA metabolism.

## Function
TATDN1 is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. The protein exhibits apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease activity, which is essential for repairing abasic sites in DNA, a common form of DNA damage. This activity is specific to double-stranded DNA and is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Dorival2023Human). TATDN1 also shows 3'-5' exonuclease activity, primarily targeting single-stranded DNA, which contributes to its role in DNA repair processes (Dorival2023Human).

Structurally, TATDN1 employs a two-metal ion catalysis mechanism, where one metal ion activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack, and the other stabilizes the transition state (Dorival2023Human). The protein is localized to the nucleus, supporting its involvement in protecting against oxidative stress and maintaining genomic integrity (Dorival2023Human). TATDN1's evolutionary conservation across eukaryotes and prokaryotes underscores its fundamental role in cellular processes, particularly in DNA repair and genomic stability (Dorival2023Human).

## Clinical Significance
TATDN1 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TATDN1 is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant tissues and cells, contributing to drug resistance. It acts as a molecular sponge for miR-451, leading to the upregulation of TRIM66, which is associated with decreased sensitivity to cisplatin. Knockdown of TATDN1 enhances cisplatin sensitivity by reducing cell survival and proliferation while promoting apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance in NSCLC (Wang2018LncRNA).

In NSCLC with high metastatic potential, TATDN1 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion. Its knockdown results in increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of proteins like HER2, β-catenin, and Ezrin, which are linked to cancer progression. This indicates that TATDN1 may facilitate metastasis through pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT/MTOR (Zequn2016The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TATDN1 is also upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It accelerates cell proliferation and cycle progression by sponging miRNA-6089, which targets LIX1L, a gene involved in tumor growth (shen2019lncrna).

## Interactions
TATDN1 is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, playing a role in DNA repair and cancer progression. It exhibits apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and 3'-exonuclease activities, which are crucial for DNA repair processes. These activities are facilitated by the coordination of divalent metal cations, such as zinc ions, in its active site. The crystal structure of TATDN1 bound to dAMP in the presence of Zn2+ ions reveals that two zinc ions are essential for its enzymatic function, involving specific amino acid residues like Glu112, Asp222, His149, and His174 (Dorival2023Human).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TATDN1 interacts with microRNA-451 (miR-451) and TRIM66, forming a regulatory axis that contributes to cisplatin resistance. TATDN1 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-451, negatively regulating its expression. This interaction affects the expression of TRIM66, a gene whose expression is increased in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC. The TATDN1/miR-451/TRIM66 axis modulates drug resistance by influencing cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis (Wang2018LncRNA).

These interactions highlight TATDN1's role in both DNA repair and cancer cell behavior, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment.
