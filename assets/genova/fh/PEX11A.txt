# PEX11A

## Overview
PEX11A is a gene that encodes the protein peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 alpha, which is integral to the proliferation and maintenance of peroxisomes in human cells. This protein is categorized as a membrane elongation factor and is localized to the peroxisomal membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in peroxisome dynamics by facilitating membrane elongation and division. PEX11A interacts with the cytoskeleton and other PEX11 family members to regulate peroxisome proliferation, which is essential for lipid metabolism and detoxification processes (Koch2010PEX11). The protein's function is crucial for maintaining normal metabolic processes, and its deficiency is linked to metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia and obesity (Chen2018Pex11a).

## Function
PEX11A is a protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisome proliferation and maintenance in human cells. It functions as a membrane elongation factor, facilitating the elongation and division of peroxisomes, which are essential for lipid metabolism and detoxification processes (Koch2010PEX11). PEX11A is localized to the peroxisomal membrane, where it influences peroxisome dynamics by interacting with the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, to aid in peroxisome movement and proliferation (Koch2010PEX11). 

The protein is involved in the formation of juxtaposed elongated peroxisomes (JEPs), which are intermediates in peroxisome membrane proliferation (Koch2010PEX11). PEX11A's role in peroxisome proliferation is regulated through its interaction with other PEX11 family members, such as PEX11γ, which recruits PEX11A to form PEX11-rich patches on the peroxisomal membrane (Koch2010PEX11). 

In terms of organismal outcomes, PEX11A is important for maintaining normal lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. Its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidaemia and obesity, due to impaired fatty acid β-oxidation and decreased peroxisome abundance (Chen2018Pex11a).

## Clinical Significance
Pex11a deficiency is associated with several metabolic and renal disorders. In mice, the absence of Pex11a leads to a reduced number of functional peroxisomes, which are crucial for lipid metabolism. This deficiency results in dyslipidemia and obesity, characterized by increased adipose tissue mass, elevated serum cholesterol levels, and impaired fatty acid β-oxidation (Chen2018Pex11a). Pex11a -/- mice also exhibit metabolic disturbances such as increased fasting glucose levels, worse glucose tolerance, and lower insulin sensitivity when on a high-fat diet (Chen2018Pex11a).

In the context of renal health, Pex11a deficiency exacerbates renal interstitial lesions, particularly under conditions of fatty acid overload. This is due to increased lipid accumulation in proximal tubule cells, leading to oxidative stress and tubulointerstitial injury (Weng2014Pex11a). The deficiency is linked to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impaired antioxidant capacity, and higher levels of renal damage compared to wild-type mice (Weng2014Pex11a). These findings suggest that Pex11a plays a critical role in maintaining peroxisome function and protecting against metabolic and renal disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like chronic kidney disease and obesity-related metabolic disturbances (Chen2018Pex11a; Weng2014Pex11a).

## Interactions
PEX11A, a peroxisomal biogenesis factor, is involved in several interactions crucial for peroxisome proliferation and maintenance. In human cells, PEX11A is known to homo-oligomerize and interact with other PEX11 family members, such as PEX11B and PEX11G. These interactions are essential for recruiting the fission machinery necessary for peroxisome proliferation (Koch2011Membrane). PEX11A's interaction with PEX11G positions it as a central player in PEX11-induced peroxisome proliferation pathways, facilitating the formation of PEX11-rich patches on the peroxisomal membrane (Koch2010PEX11).

PEX11A also interacts with the fission machinery, including hFis1, a known mitochondrial fission factor. This interaction is dependent on membrane lipids, as demonstrated by experiments using digitonin. The C-terminus of PEX11B, a related protein, is required for interaction with hFis1, suggesting a similar mechanism may exist for PEX11A (Koch2011Membrane). These interactions highlight PEX11A's role in coordinating peroxisome dynamics and division, contributing to the regulation of peroxisomal membrane elongation and fission processes.
