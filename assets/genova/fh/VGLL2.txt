# VGLL2

## Overview
VGLL2, or vestigial like family member 2, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional coactivator protein involved in muscle development and differentiation. The VGLL2 protein, also known as Vestigial-like 2, functions primarily as a transcriptional cofactor, interacting with TEAD transcription factors and MEF2 family members to regulate muscle-specific gene expression. It plays a critical role in the specification of muscle fiber types, particularly in the development of slow-twitch muscle fibers. VGLL2 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including pediatric spindle and sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma, where it forms fusion proteins that contribute to tumorigenesis. Additionally, VGLL2 has been associated with developmental abnormalities such as orofacial clefts, highlighting its broader significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Honda2017Vestigiallike; Guo2024VGLL2; Alaggio2016A).

## Structure
The VGLL2 protein, also known as Vestigial-like 2, is a transcriptional cofactor involved in muscle development. It contains a TONDU (TDU) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with TEAD transcription factors (Guo2024VGLL2). This domain is retained in fusion proteins such as VGLL2-NCOA2, indicating its importance in maintaining functional activity (Guo2024VGLL2). The VGLL2 protein acts as a cofactor for TEF-1 (TEAD1) and MEF2 family members, playing a significant role in regulating muscle-specific gene transcription (Alaggio2016A).

In the context of pediatric spindle and sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma, VGLL2 is often involved in gene fusions, such as VGLL2-CITED2 and VGLL2-NCOA2, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of these tumors (Alaggio2016A). These fusions retain key functional domains, such as the vestigial motif in VGLL2, which are essential for their roles in muscle development and gene transcription (Alaggio2016A). The VGLL2-NCOA2 fusion protein, for instance, engages with the p300 epigenetic regulator to drive transcription and tumorigenesis, highlighting its role in oncogenic processes (Guo2024VGLL2). The molecular structure of VGLL2 beyond the TDU domain is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
VGLL2, also known as Vestigial-like 2, is a transcriptional coactivator involved in muscle-specific gene transcription. In healthy human cells, VGLL2 is expressed during embryogenesis in differentiating somites and branchial arches and is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle in adults (Alaggio2016A). It interacts with TEAD1 and MEF2 family members to enhance MyoD-mediated myogenic conversion, playing a crucial role in the muscle regulatory program (Alaggio2016A). VGLL2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during muscle differentiation, where it coactivates TEF-1 and MEF2-dependent muscle-specific promoters (Alaggio2016A).

VGLL2 is also involved in the distribution of muscle fiber types, particularly in the regulation of slow-twitch muscle fibers. It interacts with TEAD transcription factors to modulate the expression of genes like Myh7, which encodes slow type I myosin heavy chain, and is crucial for maintaining slow muscle fiber characteristics (Honda2017Vestigiallike). VGLL2's role in muscle fiber type specification is further supported by its involvement in the regulation of miRNAs, such as miR-208b, which target transcriptional repressors involved in muscle fiber type modulation (Honda2017Vestigiallike).

## Clinical Significance
VGLL2 (vestigial like family member 2) is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in muscle development and differentiation. Alterations in VGLL2 expression or function are associated with pediatric spindle and sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (SRMS), a type of muscle tumor found in very young children. In these cases, VGLL2 often forms fusion genes with CITED2 or NCOA2, leading to a block in skeletal muscle differentiation and maintaining a primitive tumor phenotype. These VGLL2-related fusions are linked to a favorable clinical course in infantile SRMS, with patients often showing no evidence of disease after long-term follow-up (Yamaguchi2020Multiple; SalgueroAranda2022Genetic; Alaggio2016A).

VGLL2 is also involved in the risk of orofacial clefts, particularly when interacting with environmental factors such as alcohol exposure. This suggests that VGLL2 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to orofacial clefts, a congenital condition affecting facial structure (Carlson2022Genome-wide). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both muscle-related tumors and developmental abnormalities.

## Interactions
VGLL2 interacts with TEAD transcription factors, forming complexes that regulate gene expression. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of an Ω-loop in VGLL2, which is crucial for its binding to TEAD4. The Ω-loop enhances VGLL2's interaction with TEAD4, although a longer linker region in VGLL2 can negatively impact this interaction (Mesrouze2020A). VGLL2 also interacts with other transcription factors such as MEF2c and NFATc1, which are involved in muscle fiber type specification and adaptation (Honda2019Transcriptional).

In the context of tumorigenesis, VGLL2 forms fusion proteins with NCOA2, which significantly induce TEAD-mediated transcriptional activation. These fusion proteins interact with the epigenetic regulator p300, driving transcriptional programs associated with tumorigenesis independently of the YAP/TAZ pathways (Guo2024VGLL2). The interaction with p300 is crucial for the transcriptional and oncogenic activities of these fusion proteins, highlighting a specific epigenetic regulation mechanism (Guo2024VGLL2). These interactions underscore VGLL2's role in both muscle development and pathological conditions.
