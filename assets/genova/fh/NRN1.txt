# NRN1

## Overview
Neuritin 1 (NRN1) is a gene that encodes the protein neuritin 1, a neurotrophic factor involved in various aspects of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Neuritin 1 is categorized as a neurotrophic factor due to its role in promoting neurite outgrowth, synaptic maturation, and stability, which are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks (Yao2018Functions; Cappelletti2007Neuritin). The NRN1 gene is expressed in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, each contributing to different cellular processes such as axonal growth and apoptosis prevention (Yao2018Functions). Neuritin 1 is predominantly active in the central nervous system, where it influences learning and memory by modulating synaptic connections (Yao2018Functions). The expression of NRN1 is regulated by neural activity and neurotrophins, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, and schizophrenia (Yao2018Functions; AlmodóvarPayá2022NRN1).

## Function
Neuritin 1 (NRN1) is a neurotrophic factor that plays a significant role in neuronal development and plasticity. It is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth, synaptic maturation, and stability, which are crucial for the development of neuronal structures and synaptic function (Yao2018Functions; Cappelletti2007Neuritin). Neuritin enhances synaptic efficiency by recruiting functional AMPA receptors to synapses and increasing dendritic spine density, particularly in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Yao2018Functions). 

NRN1 is expressed in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the membrane-bound form regulating dendritic and axonal growth, while the soluble form prevents apoptosis in cortical progenitors (Yao2018Functions). It activates several signaling pathways, including the MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways, which are important for synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Yao2018Functions). Neuritin also modulates gene expression through the Ca2+-CaN-NFATc4 pathway, leading to the upregulation of Kv4.2 and increased density of transient outward potassium currents (I_A) (Yao2018Functions).

Neuritin's expression is regulated by neural activity and neurotrophins, and it is predominantly active in the central nervous system, influencing processes like learning and memory by modulating synaptic connections and enhancing neural network formation (Yao2018Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NRN1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NRN1 expression is linked to cognitive function, with studies showing that neuritin can restore dendritic complexity and spine density, thereby improving cognitive impairments in AD models (Yao2018Functions). In depression models, decreased expression of neuritin in the hippocampus is associated with depressive behaviors, while its overexpression has antidepressant effects (Yao2018Functions).

In schizophrenia, NRN1 has been identified as a potential marker for early-onset schizophrenia (EO SZ). Genetic studies suggest that NRN1 influences brain activity, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for cognitive tasks involving working memory (AlmodóvarPayá2022NRN1). Variants in NRN1 are associated with changes in cortical surface area and volume, affecting symptom severity in schizophrenia (AlmodóvarPayá2024NRN1).

In esophageal cancer, NRN1 expression is often repressed due to promoter region methylation, which is associated with poor prognosis. NRN1 methylation serves as an independent prognostic factor for poor 5-year overall survival and is linked to tumor behavior, including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Du2021Methylation).

## Interactions
Neuritin 1 (NRN1) interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in neural development and plasticity. It acts as a ligand for the insulin receptor (IR), activating the IR pathway, which is crucial for up-regulating Kv4.2-mediated transient outward K+ current in rat cerebellar granule neurons. This interaction leads to increased Akt phosphorylation and activation of the mTOR pathway, essential for synaptic plasticity and memory (Yao2012Neuritin; Yao2018Functions).

NRN1 mRNA interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuD, which stabilizes and enhances its axonal localization. The 3'UTR of NRN1 mRNA has a higher affinity for HuD compared to other mRNAs like Gap43, indicating a competitive binding mechanism that influences mRNA localization in axons (Gomes2017Axonal).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, NRN1 interacts with synaptic proteins, contributing to cognitive resilience. It prevents Aβ42-induced dendritic spine degeneration and neuronal hyperexcitability, suggesting a protective role in maintaining synaptic integrity. NRN1's interaction with synaptic proteins is linked to its ability to modify the synaptic proteome, enhancing synaptic function and resilience (Hurst2022Integrated).
