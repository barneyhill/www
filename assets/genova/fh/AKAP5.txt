# AKAP5

## Overview
AKAP5, or A-kinase anchoring protein 5, is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein crucial for cellular signaling processes. The protein, also referred to as AKAP79, is primarily involved in anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to specific cellular locations, thereby facilitating the spatial and temporal coordination of signaling events. AKAP5 is characterized by its ability to interact with various signaling molecules, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and phosphodiesterases, which are essential for modulating cyclic AMP levels and PKA activity. This protein is predominantly localized to the cell membrane, where it plays a significant role in organizing signaling complexes that influence processes such as phosphorylation and calcium handling in cardiomyocytes and vascular myocytes (Koçer2012“Shaping”; Nichols2010Sympathetic). The gene's involvement in diverse physiological and pathological contexts, including cardiovascular function, psychiatric disorders, and cancer, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular signaling integrity and function (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations; Li2014Carvedilol).

## Structure
AKAP5, also known as AKAP79, is a scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to specific cellular locations. The protein is characterized by several distinct regions that contribute to its function and localization. The N-terminal region contains three positively charged domains (PCDs) that facilitate attachment to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane through electrostatic interactions with phospholipids (Koçer2012“Shaping”). Unlike some other AKAPs, AKAP5 is not N-myristoylated (Koçer2012“Shaping”).

The central region of AKAP5 interacts with the GPCR β2-adrenergic receptor, while the C-terminal region serves as a docking site for the RII subunit of PKA (Koçer2012“Shaping”). AKAP5 is largely 'natively unordered,' with over 80% of its sequence in this state, which contrasts with more ordered scaffolds like Dishevelled proteins (Gao2011AKAP5). Despite this unordered nature, AKAP5 has docking sites for various signaling partners, suggesting a unique mechanism of interaction (Gao2011AKAP5).

AKAP5 can form homo-oligomers, potentially organized as tetramers, with a molecular weight of approximately 220 kDa (Gao2011AKAP5). This oligomerization is significant for its role in cell signaling, as it may influence the protein's localization and function (Gao2011AKAP5). AKAP5 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Gao2011AKAP5).

## Function
AKAP5, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 5, is a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in cellular signaling by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to specific cellular locations. It is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including those mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the β2-adrenergic receptor. AKAP5 facilitates the spatial and temporal coordination of signaling events, impacting processes like phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (Koçer2012“Shaping”; CHEN2009Gproteincoupled).

AKAP5 is predominantly localized to the cell membrane, where it interacts with phospholipids through its N-terminal positively charged domains. This localization is crucial for its function in organizing signaling complexes that include adenylyl cyclase, PKA, and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), particularly PDE4D5, which modulate cyclic AMP levels and PKA activity (Koçer2012“Shaping”). In cardiomyocytes, AKAP5 is essential for the sympathetic regulation of calcium transients, as it organizes a signaling complex that includes L-type calcium channels and other proteins necessary for calcium handling (Nichols2010Sympathetic).

In vascular myocytes, AKAP5 organizes a nanocomplex involving P2Y11 receptors, AC5, PKA, and CaV1.2 channels, which is crucial for purinergic modulation of vascular L-type Ca2+ channels and vascular reactivity (Prada2020AKAP5). AKAP5's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular signaling integrity and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AKAP5 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the cardiovascular system, the deletion of AKAP5 in mice leads to cardiac insufficiency characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and reduced cardiac function. This is associated with increased activity of calcineurin and calmodulin kinase II, which carvedilol treatment can reverse (Li2014Carvedilol). 

In the context of psychiatric disorders, AKAP5 polymorphisms, such as the Pro100Leu variant, have been associated with emotional and behavioral regulation. Individuals with the leucine variant exhibit greater anger control and lower physical aggression, potentially influencing traits related to aggression and anger control (Richter2011A). AKAP5 is also implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, with variable copy numbers observed in these conditions (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, AKAP5 is involved in maintaining epithelial integrity and is implicated in cell migration and metastasis. Its deletion has been observed in metastatic lesions, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Kjällquist2018Exome). 

AKAP5's involvement in synaptic function also links it to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where disruptions in its signaling pathways may contribute to synaptic dysfunction (Wild2018Potential).

## Interactions
AKAP5, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 5, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for cellular signaling. It docks several signaling molecules, including protein kinase A (PKA), phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), facilitating the propagation of signaling cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Koçer2012“Shaping”). AKAP5 interacts specifically with PDE4D5, a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, to regulate the phosphorylation dynamics by PKA. This interaction is significant in reversing PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation by degrading cyclic AMP, thus shaping the cellular signaling environment (Koçer2012“Shaping”).

AKAP5 also forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with AKAP12, influencing each other's functions in cellular signaling pathways. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, where AKAP12 can potentiate AKAP5-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (Gao2011AKAP12). AKAP5 is capable of forming homo-oligomeric complexes, as demonstrated by its ability to oligomerize in vitro and in vivo, which may facilitate its interaction with multiple signaling partners (Gao2011AKAP5). These interactions highlight AKAP5's role as a scaffold protein that modulates the spatial and temporal aspects of cell signaling.
