# AKT1

## Overview
AKT1 is a gene that encodes the protein AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), which is a critical serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. The AKT1 protein plays a central role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is activated by growth factors and other extracellular signals. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism, as well as other functions such as angiogenesis and glucose uptake (Abeyrathna2015The; Manning2007AKT/PKB). Structurally, AKT1 contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a kinase catalytic domain, and a regulatory hydrophobic motif, which are essential for its activation and function (Pragna2017Identification). Dysregulation of AKT1, including mutations and overexpression, is implicated in various cancers and disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Keppler‐Noreuil2016Somatic; Revathidevi2019Akt).

## Structure
The AKT1 protein, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure. It consists of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus, a central kinase catalytic domain, and a C-terminal regulatory hydrophobic motif (Thirumal2019A; Pragna2017Identification). The PH domain is crucial for membrane localization, as it binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids, facilitating AKT1's activation and function (Pragna2017Identification; Kumar2013Cancer).

The secondary structure of AKT1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing interactions with other proteins and substrates. AKT1 can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Ajmani2010A).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of AKT1, occurring at key residues such as Thr308 and Ser473, which are essential for its activation (Thirumal2019A; Pragna2017Identification). AKT1 has several splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity and allow it to participate in various cellular processes (Pragna2017Identification).

## Function
AKT1, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is a central component of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, activated by growth factors, cytokines, and other stimuli. AKT1 is involved in promoting cell survival by inhibiting proapoptotic proteins and processes. It phosphorylates and inhibits several Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, such as BAD, and affects transcription factors like FOXO and p53, inhibiting their proapoptotic functions (Manning2007AKT/PKB).

AKT1 also plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and growth by phosphorylating targets that regulate the cell cycle, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 Kip1 and p21 Cip1/WAF1, leading to their reduced inhibitory effects on the cell cycle (Manning2007AKT/PKB). It activates mTORC1, which is essential for cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (Manning2007AKT/PKB).

In terms of metabolism, AKT1 enhances glucose uptake and lipid metabolism, playing a significant role in insulin signaling (Abeyrathna2015The). It is also involved in angiogenesis, mediating the secretion of VEGF and enhancing endothelial cell migration and survival (Abeyrathna2015The). AKT1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular responses to growth factors and stress (Martelli2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the AKT1 gene are implicated in various cancers and other disorders. In cancer, AKT1 is frequently overexpressed and hyperactivated, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting cell survival, proliferation, and growth. The E17K mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1 is particularly notable, as it enhances lipid binding, leading to constitutive membrane localization and phosphorylation, which increases its oncogenic potential. This mutation has been identified in breast, colorectal, ovarian, bladder, lung, pancreatic, endometrial, urothelial, and colorectal cancers (Vogiatzi2007Following; Mundi2016AKT; Revathidevi2019Akt).

AKT1 mutations are also associated with Proteus syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder. The c.49G→A, p.Glu17Lys mutation in AKT1 leads to activation of the AKT/PI3K pathway, resulting in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, causing mosaic overgrowth and tumor susceptibility (Keppler‐Noreuil2016Somatic).

In addition to mutations, alterations in the expression levels of AKT1 and its pathway components, such as PI3K and PTEN, contribute to cancer progression and resistance to therapies. Dysregulation of AKT1 is linked to resistance to treatments like cisplatin in lung cancer and androgen ablation in prostate cancer (Mundi2016AKT; Altomare2005Perturbations).

## Interactions
AKT1, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), a key interaction that occurs at the cell membrane and is disrupted by PI3K inhibition, highlighting its role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Ding2006A). AKT1 also binds to the RNA-binding protein HuD, which is essential for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. This interaction is specific to the active, phosphorylated form of AKT1 and is mediated by the linker region of HuD (Fujiwara2011Functional).

The interactome of AKT1 includes 213 unique proteins, with many involved in cell growth, survival, and the cell cycle. Notable interactors include CALM1, CDC37, and HSP90AA1, among others (Duggal2018Defining). AKT1 also interacts with α-actinin 4 (ACTN4), which is crucial for its translocation and activation at the cell membrane. Silencing ACTN4 reduces AKT phosphorylation and affects cell proliferation (Ding2006A).

The AH/PH domain of AKT1 mediates intermolecular interactions between AKT molecules, which is essential for its regulation and activation (Datta1995AHPH). These interactions underscore AKT1's central role in regulating various cellular functions.
