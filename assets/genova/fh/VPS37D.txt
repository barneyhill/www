# VPS37D

## Overview
VPS37D is a gene that encodes the VPS37D protein, a subunit of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-I (ESCRT-I). The VPS37D protein is integral to the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins, a process essential for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These MVBs are crucial for the degradation of membrane proteins and play a significant role in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, viral budding, and membrane repair (Carlton2010The). As a cytoplasmic protein, VPS37D is particularly active at endosomal membranes, where it aids in the recruitment and assembly of the ESCRT machinery, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and vesicular trafficking (Wunderley2013The). While specific functional details of VPS37D are less documented compared to other VPS37 family members, its role in the ESCRT-I complex underscores its importance in intracellular signaling and membrane-associated processes.

## Structure


## Function
VPS37D is a component of the ESCRT-I (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-I) complex, which plays a crucial role in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. This protein is involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are essential for the degradation of membrane proteins and the regulation of various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, viral budding, and membrane repair (Carlton2010The). In mammalian cells, the ESCRT-I complex includes several VPS37 family members, with VPS37D being one of them. These proteins contribute to the structural integrity and function of the ESCRT-I complex, facilitating the sorting and trafficking of ubiquitinated cargo within the cell (Wunderley2013The).

VPS37D, like other VPS37 proteins, is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at endosomal membranes, where it participates in the recruitment and assembly of the ESCRT machinery. This activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper vesicular trafficking and membrane dynamics (Carlton2010The). Although specific functional details of VPS37D in healthy human cells are less documented compared to other VPS37 family members, its involvement in the ESCRT-I complex suggests a significant role in intracellular signaling and membrane-associated processes.
