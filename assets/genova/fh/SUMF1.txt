# SUMF1

## Overview
The SUMF1 gene encodes the enzyme sulfatase modifying factor 1, also known as formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of sulfatase enzymes. This modification is essential for the activation of sulfatases, which are involved in the hydrolysis of sulfate esters in various biological processes. FGE is categorized as an oxygenase and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the conversion of a cysteine residue to formylglycine, a key step in sulfatase activation (DiezRoux2005SULFATASES; Sorrentino2022New). The SUMF1 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in cellular function and development. Mutations in SUMF1 can lead to multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), a severe genetic disorder characterized by the impaired activity of all sulfatases, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations (Annunziata2007Multiple; Schlotawa2011SUMF1).

## Structure
The SUMF1 gene encodes the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is crucial for the post-translational modification of sulfatases. The FGE protein is composed of 374 amino acids and includes a signal peptide of the first 33 N-terminal residues, which is cleaved after translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Landgrebe2003The). The protein contains a single domain classified as DUF323, spanning residues 87-367, and is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold (Schlotawa2007Molecular; Landgrebe2003The). This domain is highly conserved and includes three subdomains, with the C-terminal subdomain being a mutation hotspot in multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) patients (Landgrebe2003The).

The FGE protein also features a potential N-glycosylation site at Asn 141, indicating a common post-translational modification (Landgrebe2003The). The protein is known to form homodimers, suggesting a quaternary structure (Schlotawa2007Molecular). Structural analyses have identified critical residues involved in the protein's stability and catalytic activity, which are essential for its function in modifying sulfatases (Sabourdy2015Natural). The existence of splice variant isoforms of SUMF1 may contribute to its functional diversity (Schlotawa2007Molecular).

## Function
The SUMF1 gene encodes the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), which is crucial for the post-translational modification of sulfatase enzymes. This modification involves the conversion of a cysteine residue to formylglycine, a process essential for the activation of all known sulfatases. This conversion occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is necessary for sulfatases to perform their enzymatic functions, which include the hydrolysis of sulfate-containing macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans, steroid hormones, and sulfated lipids (DiezRoux2005SULFATASES; Sorrentino2022New).

SUMF1 is highly conserved across species and functions as an oxygenase, using oxygen to generate formylglycine via a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate. The protein is a glycoprotein present in the ER and secretory pathways, and its glycosylation status affects its function and secretion (Buono2009Sulfatase). SUMF1 interacts with several proteins, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53, which regulate its retention and secretion (Buono2009Sulfatase).

The activity of SUMF1 is essential for normal cellular processes, including lysosomal degradation and cellular signaling, impacting tissue development and maintenance. Deficiencies in SUMF1 function can lead to multiple sulfatase deficiency, characterized by impaired activity of all sulfatases (Schlotawa2011SUMF1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUMF1 gene are associated with Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deficiency of all known sulfatases. This condition leads to the accumulation of sulfated molecules, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms including developmental delays, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological issues (Annunziata2007Multiple; Schlotawa2020Multiple). MSD is caused by defects in the post-translational modification of sulfatases due to mutations in the SUMF1 gene, which encodes the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) crucial for sulfatase activation (Schlotawa2007Molecular).

The clinical severity of MSD varies depending on the specific mutations in the SUMF1 gene. Missense mutations often result in hypomorphic variants with residual enzymatic activity, while nonsense mutations typically lead to a complete loss of function (Schlotawa2020Multiple). For instance, the p.R349W mutation is associated with a severe phenotype due to drastically reduced protein stability and enzymatic activity, whereas the p.A279V mutation, linked to a milder phenotype, retains higher residual activity despite decreased protein stability (Schlotawa2007Molecular).

The variability in clinical outcomes is influenced by the type of mutation and its impact on FGE's stability and activity, underscoring the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in MSD (Sabourdy2015Natural).

## Interactions
The SUMF1 protein interacts with several other proteins that regulate its retention and secretion within the cell. It interacts with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a redox-dependent chaperone, which influences its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) versus its secretion. By modulating PDI levels, the balance between ER retention and secretion of SUMF1 can be adjusted (Buono2009Sulfatase). SUMF1 also interacts with ER-Golgi intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53 through its carbohydrate-recognition domain, promoting SUMF1 trafficking through the secretory pathway. Additionally, SUMF1 binds to the endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp44, which mediates ER-retrieval transport of SUMF1 (Buono2009Sulfatase).

Mutations in the SUMF1 gene can affect these interactions, leading to instability and altered secretion properties of the formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE), which SUMF1 encodes. Some FGE variants are retained and degraded within cells, while others are secreted more rapidly. These interactions with cellular retention machinery, including ERp44, PDI, and ERGIC-53, may be affected by mutations, contributing to the severity of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) (Schlotawa2011SUMF1).
