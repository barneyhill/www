# ABHD10

## Overview
ABHD10 is a human gene that encodes the enzyme abhydrolase domain containing 10, depalmitoylase, which is a member of the acyl protein thioesterases (APT) family. This enzyme is characterized by its α/β hydrolase domain and is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by ABHD10 is a mitochondrial S-depalmitoylase, playing a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial redox homeostasis and drug metabolism. It is particularly noted for its function in deglucuronidating mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide in the liver and modulating the S-palmitoylation status of mitochondrial proteins such as peroxiredoxin-5, thereby influencing antioxidant defense mechanisms (Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase; Cao2019ABHD10). The gene is located on chromosome 3q13.2 and is expressed ubiquitously, with significant expression in the testes and brown adipose tissue (Lord2013Mammalian).

## Structure
ABHD10 is a protein characterized by a canonical α/β hydrolase domain, which includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser100, His227, and Asp197. The catalytic serine is strategically located at the junction of two pockets: one is covered by a 'cap' domain with a hydrophobic interior, likely facilitating lipid chain insertion, while the other is open to the solvent for substrate binding (Cao2019ABHD10). This structural arrangement is distinct from APT1, which has a loop instead of a cap domain, potentially influencing the accessibility of the catalytic serine and contributing to ABHD10's slower turnover rate (Cao2019ABHD10).

The protein is a 306-residue polypeptide with a molecular weight of 34 kDa, encoded by five exons on chromosome 3q13.2 (Lord2013Mammalian). ABHD10 is ubiquitously expressed, with notable presence in the testes and brown adipose tissue, and is predicted to localize to mitochondria (Lord2013Mammalian; Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase). The protein's structure was elucidated through crystallization and X-ray diffraction, achieving a resolution of 1.66 Å, with 98% of residues in favored Ramachandran regions (Cao2019ABHD10). The structure includes a well-ordered MPD molecule and four strontium ions (Cao2019ABHD10).

## Function
The human gene ABHD10 encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in both drug metabolism and mitochondrial redox homeostasis. In the liver, ABHD10 is responsible for the deglucuronidation of mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide (AcMPAG), a process that is significant for detoxifying this immunotoxic metabolite. This activity helps mitigate potential adverse effects such as leucopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity associated with mycophenolate mofetil (Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase; Iwamura2012Human).

ABHD10 also functions as an S-depalmitoylase, specifically targeting mitochondrial proteins like peroxiredoxin-5 (PRDX5). This activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis by regulating the S-palmitoylation status of PRDX5, which affects its antioxidant capacity. By modulating the lipidation of PRDX5, ABHD10 influences the mitochondrial antioxidant defense mechanisms, thereby playing a protective role against oxidative stress (Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase; Cao2019ABHD10).

ABHD10 is localized in the mitochondria and is part of the acyl protein thioesterases (APT) family, highlighting its involvement in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase; Cao2019ABHD10).

## Interactions
ABHD10 is primarily known for its role as a mitochondrial S-depalmitoylase, interacting specifically with the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5). This interaction is crucial for regulating the S-palmitoylation status of PRDX5, particularly at the active site cysteine (Cys100), which is essential for its antioxidant function. ABHD10's depalmitoylation activity maintains PRDX5 in a state that allows it to effectively counteract oxidative stress by keeping Cys100 in a free thiol form, necessary for its catalytic activity (Cao2019ABHD10).

In the context of alcoholic liver disease, ABHD10's interaction with PRDX5 is significant for reducing oxidative stress and promoting hepatocyte function. The downregulation of ABHD10 leads to increased S-palmitoylation of PRDX5, which is associated with oxidative stress and impaired liver function. This interaction is negatively regulated by the TGFβ1 and EGF signaling pathways, which are linked to hepatotoxic injury and fibrosis (Li2023The).

ABHD10 is also a target of miR-19b-3p, which negatively regulates its expression. This interaction is part of a regulatory network involving the long non-coding RNA BC002059, which modulates myocardial infarction cell apoptosis through the miR-19b-3p/ABHD10 axis (Liao2022MiR19b3p).
