# EZH2

## Overview
The EZH2 gene encodes the enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit, a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which functions as a histone methyltransferase. This protein plays a pivotal role in epigenetic gene silencing by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression (Grzenda2013Functional; Lund2013EZH2). EZH2 is integral to the regulation of gene expression patterns that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell pluripotency, making it essential for normal development and cellular homeostasis (Lund2013EZH2). Dysregulation of EZH2, through mutations or overexpression, is implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, underscoring its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Goldsmith2019EZH2; Gan2018Epigenetic).

## Structure
The EZH2 protein is a key component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is involved in gene silencing through histone methylation. The protein consists of 746 amino acids and includes several important domains: the EED-interaction domain (EID), Domain I, Domain II, a cysteine-rich CXC domain, and the C-terminal SET domain, which is crucial for its histone methyltransferase activity (Duan2020EZH2:). The SET domain is responsible for transferring methyl groups to lysine residues on histones, specifically histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) (Tan2013EZH2:). The CXC domain, located N-terminal to the SET domain, is necessary for the catalytic activity of the SET domain (Mu2018EZH2).

EZH2 interacts with other PRC2 subunits, such as SUZ12 and EED, to form a functional complex. The interaction with EED is mediated by a 30-residue peptide within EZH2, which binds to the WD-repeat domain of EED, forming a stable complex (Han2007Structural). EZH2 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms like EZH2α and EZH2β, which differ in their exon composition and functional roles (Grzenda2013Functional; Mu2018EZH2). These isoforms contribute to the complexity of EZH2's regulatory functions in gene expression.

## Function
The EZH2 gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in gene silencing through histone methylation. Specifically, EZH2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, trimethylating histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), leading to transcriptional repression of target genes (Grzenda2013Functional; Lund2013EZH2). This activity is essential for maintaining a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, which is critical for normal development and the regulation of stem cell pluripotency (Lund2013EZH2).

In healthy human cells, EZH2 is involved in regulating cell fate decisions by stabilizing chromatin structure and maintaining long-term self-renewal potential, particularly in stem cells such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Lund2013EZH2). It achieves this by repressing pro-differentiation genes and promoting proliferation through increased expression of cell cycle progression genes (Lund2013EZH2). EZH2 is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by repressing tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN1a and CDKN1b, which are involved in cell cycle checkpoints (Lund2013EZH2).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin structure to influence gene expression patterns, ensuring proper cellular function and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Grzenda2013Functional; Lund2013EZH2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EZH2 gene are implicated in various cancers and have significant clinical implications. In follicular lymphoma (FL), EZH2 mutations, particularly at codon Y646, are prevalent and associated with increased H3K27 trimethylation, leading to the repression of proliferation checkpoint genes and affecting gene transcriptional profiles (Huet2017EZH2; Sneeringer2010Coordinated). These mutations are linked to a distinct epigenetic signature and poorer prognosis in patients (Huet2017EZH2).

In myeloid malignancies, EZH2 mutations often result in a loss of function, contributing to decreased H3K27 trimethylation and are associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (Khan2013Multiple; Guglielmelli2011EZH2). These mutations are also found in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where they are linked to worse overall and leukemia-free survival (Roy2014Driver).

EZH2 overexpression is observed in multiple myeloma (MM) and is associated with poorer prognosis, particularly in patients with certain genetic alterations like KRAS mutations (Goldsmith2019EZH2). In various cancers, EZH2 dysregulation contributes to chemoresistance and affects tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gan2018Epigenetic).

## Interactions
EZH2, a core component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. Within PRC2, EZH2 forms a complex with EED and SUZ12, which is essential for its histone methyltransferase activity. The interaction between EZH2 and EED is facilitated by a 30-residue peptide of EZH2 that binds to the WD-repeat domain of EED, crucial for PRC2's enzymatic function (Han2007Structural; Shi2017Structure). SUZ12 stabilizes EZH2 and the PRC2 complex, playing an allosteric role in stimulating EZH2's activity (Shi2017Structure).

EZH2 also interacts with other proteins such as PHF1 and PHF19, which stimulate its H3K27me3 activity, and JARID2, which facilitates PRC2 recruitment to chromatin (Shi2017Structure). In cancer cells, EZH2 forms complexes with proteins like LSD1, DNMT1, HDAC1, SMAD2, SMAD4, and β-CATENIN, regulating their stability through the recruitment of USP7, a deubiquitinase that prevents their degradation (Lei2019EZH2). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated state of cells and promoting tumorigenesis (Lei2019EZH2). Additionally, EZH2 interacts with non-coding RNAs such as Xist and HOTAIR, which are involved in recruiting PRC2 to specific genomic loci (Shi2017Structure).
