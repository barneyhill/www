# ARPC5

## Overview
The ARPC5 gene encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5, a critical component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and plays a pivotal role in actin filament nucleation and branching, essential for various cellular processes such as cell motility, vesicle trafficking, and receptor endocytosis (NunesSantos2024Inherited). ARPC5 exists in two isoforms, ARPC5A and ARPC5B, which are expressed in different tissues and may have distinct functional roles (Millard2002Identification). The protein is involved in cytokine signaling pathways, particularly affecting interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, which is crucial for immune function (NunesSantos2024Inherited). Mutations in the ARPC5 gene are linked to severe clinical conditions, including systemic inflammation and autoimmunity, and its expression is often altered in various cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target (Sindram2023ARPC5; Ming2023ARPC5).

## Structure
The ARPC5 protein is a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin filament nucleation and assembly. ARPC5 exists in two isoforms, ARPC5A and ARPC5B, which are encoded by genes located on different chromosomes: ARPC5A on chromosome 1 and ARPC5B on chromosome 9. These isoforms share 69% sequence identity, with ARPC5B being slightly longer at 153 amino acids compared to ARPC5A's 151 amino acids (Millard2002Identification).

Structurally, ARPC5 is described as a globular α-helical subunit within the Arp2/3 complex. It begins with a long NH2-terminal extension that interacts with other subunits such as p20, p40, and Arp2, and ends with a bundle of seven α helices (Robinson2001Crystal). This structural arrangement suggests that ARPC5 may reinforce interactions among these subunits or relay conformational changes within the complex.

The ARPC5 isoforms are involved in different cellular functions, with ARPC5A being highly expressed in haematopoietic tissues and ARPC5B in the brain, indicating potential functional distinctions (Millard2002Identification). The differences in solvent-exposed surfaces between the isoforms may lead to different binding partners, contributing to their distinct roles (Millard2002Identification).

## Function
The ARPC5 gene encodes a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching, playing a significant role in cell motility and structure. In healthy human cells, ARPC5 is crucial for the proper formation and function of the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell movement, vesicle trafficking, and receptor endocytosis (NunesSantos2024Inherited). The Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC5, facilitates the formation of branched actin networks, which are necessary for the formation of lamellipodia, podosomes, and invadopodia, structures important for cell motility (NunesSantos2024Inherited).

ARPC5 is expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T-cell blasts, and fibroblasts, contributing to the formation of Arp2/3 complexes that aid in cell movement and adhesion (NunesSantos2024Inherited). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and plasma membrane, aligning with its role in dynamic actin remodeling (NunesSantos2024Inherited). ARPC5 is also involved in cytokine signaling pathways, particularly affecting interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, which is crucial for immune function (NunesSantos2024Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARPC5 gene are associated with severe clinical conditions characterized by early-onset systemic inflammation, autoimmunity, and developmental abnormalities. A homozygous truncating mutation in ARPC5 can lead to a loss of function, resulting in severe early-onset systemic inflammation and early mortality. This mutation affects the actin cytoskeleton organization, leading to impaired cell migration and actin assembly, which are crucial for normal cellular functions (Sindram2023ARPC5).

In patients with ARPC5 mutations, there is a notable impairment in cell motility and cytokine signaling, particularly affecting interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathways. This results in recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation, along with physical abnormalities such as congenital heart defects and dysmorphisms (NunesSantos2024Inherited). The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with complete clinical penetrance observed in affected individuals (NunesSantos2024Inherited).

ARPC5 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression is often altered. In various cancers, including gliomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, ARPC5 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, tumor progression, and metastasis. Its expression correlates with immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment interactions, suggesting its role in tumor immunity and as a potential therapeutic target (Huang2022A; Ming2023ARPC5).

## Interactions
ARPC5 is a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching. It interacts with other subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC1, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, ARP2, and ARP3, forming a stable multiprotein complex that regulates the actin cytoskeleton (Millard2002Identification). ARPC5 has been shown to interact specifically with ARPC1 isoforms, ARPC1A and ARPC1B, which is crucial for the expression and function of these proteins within the complex (NunesSantos2023Inherited).

In addition to its role in the Arp2/3 complex, ARPC5 is involved in mRNA transport and translational regulation. It forms a protein-RNA complex with protamine mRNA, specifically Prm1, indicating a role in mRNA compartmentalization and translational suppression during male germ cell differentiation (Chang2012Interaction). ARPC5 also interacts with microRNAs to regulate the distribution of germ cell mRNAs, affecting their translation and localization within the cell (Chang2012Interaction).

ARPC5's interactions extend to its involvement in cell motility and microtubule organization, where it works alongside proteins such as PKCα and RHAMM to regulate the polarization of the microtubule-organizing center in smooth muscle cells (SilvermanGavrila2011Rear).
