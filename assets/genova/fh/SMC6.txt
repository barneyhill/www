# SMC6

## Overview
The SMC6 gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein family, specifically forming part of the SMC5/6 complex. This complex is integral to maintaining genomic stability through its roles in DNA repair, chromosome organization, and segregation. The SMC6 protein, characterized by its coiled-coil structure and ATPase activity, interacts with SMC5 to form a heterodimer essential for the complex's function. The SMC5/6 complex is involved in critical cellular processes, including homologous recombination and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and is active during specific phases of the cell cycle. Dysregulation or mutations in the SMC6 gene can lead to genomic instability and have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Aragón2018The; Potts2006Human; Nie2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
The SMC6 protein is a component of the Smc5/6 complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and chromosome organization. Structurally, SMC6 is part of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein family, characterized by a coiled-coil structure and ATPase activity. The protein contains multiple DNA-binding domains, including regions in its hinge domain and ATPase head domain, which contribute to its ability to bind DNA (Roy2015The).

The SMC6 protein forms a heterodimer with SMC5, and this dimerization is essential for its function. The hinge domains of SMC5 and SMC6 interact, allowing the complex to adopt a rod-shaped structure with flexible coiled-coil arms (GutierrezEscribano2020Purified; Serrano2020The). The complex also includes non-SMC elements (NSEs), such as Nse1, Nse3, and Nse4, which form subcomplexes and contribute to the overall quaternary structure (Aragón2018The).

Post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation mediated by the Nse2 subunit, are important for the function of the Smc5/6 complex, influencing its interactions and activities (GutierrezEscribano2020Purified). The presence of ATP enhances the DNA-binding activity of SMC6, indicating the importance of ATP hydrolysis in its function (Roy2015The).

## Function
The SMC6 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the SMC5/6 complex, which plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. This complex is involved in several key molecular processes, including DNA repair, chromosome assembly, and segregation during mitosis. The SMC5/6 complex is essential for the proper recruitment of topoisomerase IIα to chromosomes, which is crucial for forming an intact axial structure of mitotic chromosomes. In the absence of SMC5/6, there is improper deposition of topoisomerase IIα, leading to aberrant chromosome structures and increased replication-related DNA damage (GallegoPaez2014Smc56mediated).

The SMC5/6 complex also facilitates homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks by recruiting the cohesin complex to these breaks, maintaining the proximity of sister chromatids and promoting efficient DNA repair (Potts2006Human). It is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, where it binds to specific chromosomal sites such as centromeres and telomeres, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and preventing chromosomal instability (Aragón2018The). The complex's SUMO ligase activity is crucial for its function in maintaining genomic integrity (Diaz2018Scaffolding).

## Clinical Significance
The SMC6 gene, part of the SMC5/6 complex, plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and DNA repair. Alterations in SMC6 expression and mutations can lead to various clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), SMC6 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, especially in patients with immune cell infiltration, such as CD8+ T-cells and B-cells. This overexpression correlates with decreased survival rates, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in PAAD (Nie2022Comprehensive).

SMC6 mutations are also linked to defects in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in homologous recombination and the repair of collapsed replication forks. These defects can lead to genomic instability, contributing to cancer development and progression (Ampatzidou2006Smc56). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SMC6 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, similar to its role in other cancers like lung cancer and sarcoma (Nie2021Clinical).

The SMC6 gene's involvement in DNA repair and chromosome stability underscores its clinical significance, with mutations and dysregulation potentially leading to chromosomal instability syndromes and contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Aragón2018The; Ampatzidou2006Smc56).

## Interactions
The SMC6 protein is a core component of the Smc5/6 complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and genomic stability. This complex interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to perform its functions. SMC6, along with Smc5, forms the backbone of the complex, which includes non-SMC elements (Nse) such as Nse1-6. Nse4 bridges the ATPase head domains of Smc5 and Smc6, similar to the role of Scc1 in the cohesin complex (Wu2012The). The complex also involves interactions with the Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 subcomplex, which bridges the Smc5 ATPase head and the Smc6 neck (SoléSoler2020Smc56).

SMC6 interacts with DNA through multiple domains, including the hinge, arms, and ATPase head regions. It has a higher affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) compared to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Serrano2020The). The complex's recruitment to DNA lesions involves 1D diffusion along dsDNA and static interaction with ssDNA, allowing it to accumulate at lesions characterized by the proximity of dsDNA and ssDNA (Tanasie2022Stabilization). The Smc5/6 complex also interacts with the cohesin complex, facilitating its recruitment to double-strand breaks (DSBs) to promote sister chromatid homologous recombination (Potts2006Human).
