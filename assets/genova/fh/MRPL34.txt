# MRPL34

## Overview
MRPL34 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L34, a crucial component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. MRPL34 is characterized by its mitochondrial N-terminal addressing sequence, which is vital for its import into mitochondria, where it integrates into the mitoribosome and interacts with other ribosomal proteins and rRNA to ensure proper ribosomal assembly and function (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). The evolutionary conservation of MRPL34 across species underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and highlights its potential involvement in various diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and mitochondrial disorders (guo2023Assessing; Graack1999Identification).

## Structure
The MRPL34 protein is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. Its primary structure is encoded by the MRPL34 gene, and it is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The protein has a mitochondrial N-terminal addressing sequence, which is crucial for its import into mitochondria (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). 

In terms of secondary structure, specific residues such as R95 are highly conserved and play a significant role in the protein's stability and function (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). The tertiary structure of MRPL34 involves its interaction with other ribosomal proteins and rRNA, contributing to the assembly and stability of the mitoribosome (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). 

The quaternary structure of MRPL34 includes its integration into the mitochondrial ribosome, where it interacts with other proteins such as uL23 and uL24, which are important for the translation of hydrophobic proteins (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). The protein's role in the assembly of the mitoribosome is critical for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, such as cytochrome c oxidase subunits (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). 

Post-translational modifications and splice variants of MRPL34 have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
MRPL34 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins. These proteins are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells. MRPL34 is localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function.

In yeast, MRPL34 is involved in the translation of specific mitochondrial proteins, particularly hydrophobic subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, such as Cox1p and Cox3p. Mutations in MRPL34 can lead to impaired translation of these subunits, resulting in reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity and respiratory deficiencies (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial). The protein is also important for the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, interacting with other proteins in the exit tunnel, which is crucial for the translation of hydrophobic proteins (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial).

In mammals, MRPL34 is homologous to the bacterial L34 ribosomal protein and is encoded in the nuclear genome. It is translated in the cytoplasm and then imported into the mitochondria, where it becomes part of the mitoribosome (Graack1999Identification). The protein's role in human cells is inferred from its function in yeast and its evolutionary conservation across species.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MRPL34 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. MRPL34 is associated with chronic liver diseases, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A study using Mendelian randomization analysis identified MRPL34 as having a potential causal effect on NAFLD, with an odds ratio of 0.88, indicating a statistically significant association (guo2023Assessing). This suggests that changes in MRPL34 expression or function could influence the development of NAFLD and potentially other liver conditions.

In the context of eye development, MRPL34 has been studied in Drosophila, where it interacts with dystroglycan (DG) to regulate the differentiation of photoreceptor cells. Mutations in MRPL34 exacerbate the phenotypic effects of DG mutations, leading to disrupted eye development. The expression of an MRPL34 transgene can rescue these disruptions, highlighting its significant role in eye development and suggesting that similar mechanisms might be relevant in humans (Zhan2010Dystroglycan).

Overall, MRPL34's involvement in mitochondrial function suggests that its mutations or altered expression could contribute to mitochondrial disorders, impacting cellular energy metabolism and potentially leading to broader systemic effects.

## Interactions
MRPL34, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome. It is part of the 54S large subunit and interacts with other proteins such as uL23 and uL24, which are components of the exit tunnel through which newly synthesized peptides pass. These interactions are essential for the proper assembly of the mitoribosome, as mutations in MRPL34 can lead to altered sedimentation patterns and impaired ribosomal assembly (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial).

MRPL34 also interacts with mitochondrial rRNA, particularly the 21S rRNA, which is critical for its stability and function. The residue R95 in MRPL34 is identified as crucial for its interaction with rRNA, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the mitoribosome (Guedes‐Monteiro2017Mitochondrial).

In addition to its role in ribosomal assembly, MRPL34 is involved in protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome. It has been shown to interact with MRPL33, another mitochondrial ribosomal protein, suggesting a collaborative role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular processes related to mitochondrial function (guo2023Assessing). These interactions underscore the importance of MRPL34 in mitochondrial translation and energy production.
