# CALM3

## Overview
The CALM3 gene encodes calmodulin 3, a calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a pivotal role in intracellular calcium signaling. Calmodulin 3 is categorized as a calcium-binding protein and is integral to various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell division, and memory formation. The protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are essential for calcium ion coordination and are highly conserved across species. Upon binding calcium, calmodulin 3 undergoes conformational changes that enable it to interact with a wide array of target proteins, modulating their activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of enzymes, ion channels, and other proteins involved in critical physiological functions. The CALM3 gene's expression and the protein's activity are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in cardiac and bone tissues, where it influences processes such as cardiac contractility and bone resorption (Friedrich2009A; Andrews2020Structural; Colomer1994Expression).

## Structure
Calmodulin 3 (CALM3) is a calcium-binding messenger protein encoded by the CALM3 gene. The primary structure of CALM3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that coordinate calcium ions. These motifs are highly conserved and play a crucial role in calcium binding (Andrews2020Structural; Colomer1994Expression).

The secondary structure of CALM3 is predominantly helical, with the protein divided into N- and C-terminal domains. Each domain contains two paired EF-hand motifs, contributing to the protein's ability to bind calcium ions with high affinity (Andrews2020Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a compact, globular shape, allowing the protein to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, which is essential for its interaction with target proteins (Westerlund2018Effect).

CALM3 typically functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure. It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Colomer1994Expression). The protein's flexible central linker domain allows it to adopt various conformational states, facilitating its role in cellular signaling pathways (Andrews2020Structural).

## Function
The CALM3 gene encodes calmodulin 3, a calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling within cells. Calmodulin 3 is involved in various molecular processes by interacting with numerous target proteins, thereby influencing activities such as muscle contraction, cell division, and memory formation. It operates in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, modulating enzymes, ion channels, and other proteins (Colomer1994Expression).

In bone metabolism, CALM3 regulates the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by interacting with its calmodulin binding domain. This interaction is significant in osteoclast differentiation, functional bone resorption, and osteoclast apoptosis. During active bone resorption, calmodulin expression increases and concentrates at the ruffled border of osteoclasts, highlighting its role in bone health and metabolism (Zhou2014Comprehensive).

Calmodulin 3 is also essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is vital for cardiac contractile function and growth. It acts as an intracellular sensor for calcium ions, playing a significant role in regulating calcium-mediated cellular events (Friedrich2009A). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CALM3 gene are associated with several severe cardiac conditions, primarily Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT). These conditions are characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias due to disrupted calcium signaling in cardiac cells. LQTS associated with CALM3 mutations often presents with a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which can lead to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (Crotti2019Calmodulin; Reed2015CALM3). Specific mutations, such as CALM3-D130G, have been identified as causative for LQTS, with evidence suggesting a sporadic inheritance pattern (Reed2015CALM3). 

CPVT, another condition linked to CALM3 mutations, is characterized by exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. The CALM3-A103V mutation, for instance, has been associated with arrhythmogenic calcium waves and sparks, typical of CPVT (GomezHurtado2016Novel). 

In addition to cardiac conditions, a polymorphism in the CALM3 promoter region, 234T>A, has been implicated as a potential modifier gene for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), affecting the gene's expression levels and potentially influencing the severity of the disease (Friedrich2009A). These findings underscore the critical role of CALM3 in maintaining normal cardiac function and the severe consequences of its dysregulation.

## Interactions
Calmodulin 3 (CALM3) is a calcium-binding messenger protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. CALM3 is known to interact with p68 RNA helicase, a relationship essential for cell migration and metastasis. This interaction is calcium-dependent and facilitates the localization of calmodulin to the leading edge of migrating cells, which is critical for cell motility. The interaction between p68 and calmodulin allows p68 to function as a microtubule motor, transporting calmodulin to the leading edge, thereby promoting cell migration (Wang2013Interaction).

CALM3 also interacts with proteins involved in invadopodia formation, such as Src kinase and NHE1, an ion exchanger. These interactions are crucial for invadopodia assembly and function, which are important for cancer cell invasion. The binding of calmodulin to these proteins is essential for their activation and the subsequent invadopodia-mediated invasion process (Li2018The).

Additionally, CALM3 is identified as a partner of the cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), where it is known to inhibit NCX1 activity. This interaction is part of the broader calcium signaling pathway, which is significant in cardiovascular functions (Lubelwana2017Mapping).
