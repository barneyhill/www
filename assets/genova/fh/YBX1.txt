# YBX1

## Overview
YBX1 is a gene that encodes the Y-box binding protein 1, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational regulation, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair. The protein is characterized by its cold shock domain (CSD), which facilitates binding to nucleic acids, and a C-terminal domain that aids in protein-protein interactions. Y-box binding protein 1 functions as an RNA chaperone and is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, as well as in the cellular response to stress. It plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability through its involvement in DNA repair mechanisms. Clinically, alterations in YBX1 expression are associated with several cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis and treatment resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Dong2009RNAbinding; Prabhu2015Role; Sangermano2020Y).

## Structure
Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) is a multifunctional protein characterized by its cold shock domain (CSD), which is crucial for nucleic acid binding. The CSD adopts a classical OB-fold structure, consisting of five antiparallel β-strands forming a β-barrel, typical for nucleic acid-binding proteins (Kloks2002The; Yang2019Crystal). This domain is highly conserved and contains RNA-binding motifs RNP-1 and RNP-2, which are involved in specific and non-specific RNA and ssDNA binding (Kloks2002The).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of YBX1 is composed of alternating basic and aromatic regions, facilitating RNA binding and protein-protein interactions, and is essential for forming messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (Kloks2002The). The protein can form homodimers, with residues Tyr-99 and Asp-105 at the dimer interface being crucial for dimerization, which enhances its RNA-binding ability (Yang2019Crystal).

Phosphorylation, particularly at serine 102, plays a significant role in regulating YBX1's DNA binding affinity. This post-translational modification destabilizes the CSD, leading to reduced DNA binding affinity (Zhang2020Structural). The C-terminal extension of the CSD also contributes to DNA binding, providing an additional nucleic acid binding region (Zhang2020Structural).

## Function
YBX1 (Y-box binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in transcriptional and translational regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences, particularly the inverted CCAAT box (Y-box) sequence motif, to regulate the transcription of various cellular genes (Dong2009RNAbinding). YBX1 also binds to RNA, influencing mRNA stability and translation. It exhibits RNA chaperone activity, which includes RNA annealing, melting, and strand exchange activities, suggesting its role in destabilizing RNA structures and resolving RNA-RNA interactions (Dong2009RNAbinding).

In the cytoplasm, YBX1 is involved in mRNA regulation, associating with stress granules and processing bodies, which are structures that manage mRNA translation and stability under stress conditions (Somasekharan2015YB1). YBX1's interaction with mRNA can suppress its synthesis at the initiation stage, highlighting its role in posttranscriptional regulation (Skabkin2006Nonspecific).

YBX1 is also implicated in DNA repair mechanisms, interacting with various DNA repair proteins and participating in the DNA damage response, which is crucial for maintaining genome stability (Sangermano2020Y). Its nuclear localization is influenced by genotoxic stress, where it accumulates to assist in DNA repair processes (Izumi2001Y).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YBX1 gene, which encodes the Y-box binding protein 1, are implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of YBX1 is common in breast, lung, prostate, and other cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior (Johnson2019Why; Prabhu2015Role). In breast cancer, YBX1 overexpression is linked to mitotic failure and chromosomal abnormalities, contributing to cancer development (Sangermano2020Y). In lung cancer and mesothelioma, high YBX1 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes and resistance to chemotherapy (Johnson2019Why).

YBX1 also plays a role in immune evasion in cancers by promoting the expression of Th2 cytokines and interacting with immune regulatory molecules, such as PD-L1, which helps tumor cells evade immune destruction (Dinh2024Y-Box). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), YBX1 is essential for disease progression, and its depletion leads to delayed progression and improved survival (Perner2021YBX1).

In glioblastoma, YBX1 is overexpressed and associated with tumor invasion and resistance to treatment, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gupta2019Altered; Sangermano2020Y). These findings underscore the clinical significance of YBX1 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
YBX1 (Y-box binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as transcription regulation, mRNA splicing, and translation. YBX1 is a component of the mRNA spliceosome and is involved in pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation. It interacts with numerous proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (SYNCRIP), poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC). Novel interactions have been identified with IGF2BP3 and UPF1, which are implicated in cancer proliferation and metastasis (Wang2014C1QBP).

YBX1 binds to both DNA and RNA, with a preference for single-stranded forms. Its cold shock domain (CSD) is primarily responsible for RNA binding, while the C-terminal region binds to single-stranded DNA (Tanabe2015Thermodynamic; Yadav2016Structure). YBX1 can also interact with specific regulatory DNA sequences, modulating the transcription of genes related to cell division, apoptosis, and stress responses (Skabkin2006Nonspecific). The protein's ability to bind to nucleic acids is crucial for its function in regulating gene expression, including its role as a transcription factor and its involvement in mRNA translation (Skabkin2006Nonspecific).
