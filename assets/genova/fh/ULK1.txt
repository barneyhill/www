# ULK1

## Overview
ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which plays a critical role in the initiation of autophagy, a cellular process essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The ULK1 protein is a key component of the autophagy machinery, forming a complex with other proteins such as ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, which is activated under nutrient-deprived conditions. This kinase is regulated by major cellular pathways, including mTORC1 and AMPK, which modulate its activity in response to nutrient and energy status (Zachari2017The; Mizushima2010The). Beyond its primary role in autophagy, ULK1 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitophagy, neurite elongation, and immune response regulation, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (TAN2020Functions). The gene's dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, notably cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Garg2022In; Kumar2020A).

## Structure
ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase crucial for autophagy initiation. The primary structure of ULK1 includes a kinase domain, a proline/serine-rich region, and a conserved C-terminal domain (Khan2012Role). The kinase domain is characterized by a long activation loop, which is essential for substrate recognition and activity regulation (Kumar2020A). This domain belongs to the CAMK family and includes a small N-lobe, a hinge region, and a large C-lobe (Kumar2020A).

The secondary structure of ULK1 features a standard kinase fold with a unique large loop between the N- and C-terminal lobes (Zachari2017The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase, with a large basic patch opposite the ATP binding site, potentially involved in membrane binding or interaction with Atg13 (Lazarus2015Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, ULK1 forms a complex with other proteins such as ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, which are essential for its function in autophagy (Zachari2017The). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating ULK1 activity (Khan2012Role).

## Function
ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of autophagy, a cellular process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, ULK1 is part of a complex that includes ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, which is crucial for autophagosome formation. This complex is activated under nutrient-deprived conditions, such as amino acid starvation, and is regulated by the mTORC1 and AMPK pathways. mTORC1 inhibits ULK1 by phosphorylating it under nutrient-rich conditions, while AMPK activates ULK1 through phosphorylation when cellular energy levels are low (Zachari2017The; Mizushima2010The).

ULK1's kinase activity is essential for its function in autophagy, as it phosphorylates downstream targets, including components of the PI3KC3-C1 complex, to promote autophagosome formation. It also plays a role in mitophagy by phosphorylating mitochondrial proteins like FUNDC1, facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria (TAN2020Functions). Beyond autophagy, ULK1 is involved in other cellular processes, such as neurite elongation and the regulation of type I interferon-induced immune responses, highlighting its diverse roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis (TAN2020Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ULK1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, ULK1 is involved in autophagy regulation, and its mutations are frequently observed in uterine, lung, colon, and stomach tumors. These mutations often co-occur with those in its interactors, affecting autophagy regulation and potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Kumar2020A). In breast cancer, low ULK1 expression is associated with increased bone metastasis and poor prognosis. ULK1 deficiency leads to mitophagy impairment, resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone metastasis (Deng2020MAPK13).

In neurodegenerative disorders, ULK1 is linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Mutations in ULK1 can disrupt autophagy, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, which are characteristic of these disorders (Garg2022In). The gene's involvement in the mTOR signaling pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation can contribute to neurodegeneration (Garg2022In). ULK1's role in these pathways highlights its potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
ULK1, a serine/threonine kinase, is a central component in the regulation of autophagy, interacting with several key proteins to form the ULK1 complex. This complex includes ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, which are essential for autophagy initiation. ATG13 binds to ULK1 and ULK2, with a stronger interaction observed with ULK1, and is crucial for mediating the interaction between FIP200 and ULK1 (Jung2009ULKAtg13FIP200; Mercer2009A). The ULK1 complex also interacts with the ATG14-containing PtdIns3K complex, facilitated by ATG13, which is vital for autophagy signaling (Park2016The).

ULK1's activity is regulated by interactions with AMPK and mTORC1, which respond to cellular energy and nutrient status. mTORC1 inhibits ULK1 by phosphorylating it, while AMPK activates ULK1 through phosphorylation, promoting autophagy (Lin2016Structure). ULK1 also interacts with BECLIN-1 and VPS34, phosphorylating them to enhance autophagy initiation (Lin2016Structure; Zachari2017The).

ULK1's interactions extend to stress response and apoptosis, where it binds to stress granule proteins and has motifs for Caspase-3 and Caspase-7 cleavage, indicating a role in apoptosis (Demeter2020ULK1). These interactions highlight ULK1's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
