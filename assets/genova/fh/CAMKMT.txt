# CAMKMT

## Overview
CAMKMT, or calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase, is a gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for the post-translational modification of calmodulin, a pivotal calcium-binding messenger protein. The enzyme, categorized as a methyltransferase, specifically trimethylates lysine-115 on calmodulin, a modification that plays a critical role in modulating calmodulin's interactions with various target proteins, thereby influencing calcium-dependent signaling pathways. This methylation is essential for regulating numerous cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell division, and memory formation. The CAMKMT gene is located on chromosome 2p21 and is evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its importance in cellular function and development. Mutations or deletions in this gene are linked to several genetic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Magnani2010Calmodulin; Haziza2015Calmodulin; Bartholdi2013Further).

## Structure
The CAMKMT (calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase) enzyme is characterized by its ability to trimethylate lysine-115 in calmodulin, a calcium-dependent signaling protein. The primary structure of CAMKMT includes an AdoMet-binding motif typical of class I methyltransferases, which is crucial for its methyltransferase activity (Magnani2010Calmodulin). The enzyme is evolutionarily conserved across various species, indicating a significant role in calcium-dependent signaling pathways (Magnani2010Calmodulin).

The tertiary structure of CAMKMT has been modeled, revealing a catalytic domain that facilitates the specific methylation of lysine-115 in calmodulin. This specificity is partly attributed to unique C-and N-terminal flanking regions that are conserved across homologues and are thought to aid in binding calmodulin and docking lysine-115 into the active site (Magnani2010Calmodulin). 

CAMKMT is encoded by the human gene c2orf34, located at locus 2p21, a region associated with several genetic disorders (Magnani2010Calmodulin). The enzyme's activity can be influenced by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human gene, which affects its catalytic function (Magnani2010Calmodulin). The presence of splice variant isoforms has not been explicitly detailed in the available context.

## Function
CAMKMT (calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein. CAMKMT specifically catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine-115 in calmodulin, a modification that significantly influences the interaction of calmodulin with its target proteins, thereby affecting various calcium-dependent signaling pathways (Magnani2010Calmodulin). This methylation process is essential for modulating protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways in eukaryotic organisms, impacting cellular and developmental processes (Magnani2010Calmodulin).

The enzyme is evolutionarily conserved and contains signature motifs typical of class I methyltransferases, including an AdoMet-binding site, which is crucial for its methyltransferase activity (Magnani2010Calmodulin). CAMKMT is active in the cytoplasm, where it regulates cellular processes such as muscle contraction, cell division, and memory formation by influencing calcium signaling pathways (Magnani2010Calmodulin). The methylation state of calmodulin can vary in a tissue-dependent manner, affecting its activator properties with target enzymes and leading to phenotypic changes in growth and development (Magnani2010Calmodulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deletions in the CAMKMT gene are associated with several clinical conditions, particularly within the context of the 2p21 deletion syndrome. This syndrome involves the deletion of multiple genes, including CAMKMT, and is characterized by symptoms such as cystinuria, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and mitochondrial disease (Bartholdi2013Further; Haziza2015Calmodulin). The absence of CAMKMT leads to mitochondrial defects, including reduced activity in respiratory chain complexes I and IV, which are particularly evident in the brain and muscle tissues (Panneman2017Mining; Haziza2015Calmodulin). 

Patients with deletions involving CAMKMT often exhibit severe growth retardation, neonatal hypotonia, and moderate mental retardation, suggesting that the loss of CAMKMT function contributes significantly to these symptoms (Haziza2015Calmodulin). In mouse models, the absence of CAMKMT results in developmental delays, impaired motor function, and reduced muscle strength, further supporting its role in these clinical manifestations (Haziza2015Calmodulin). The gene's involvement in calcium-dependent signaling and potential epigenetic regulation may underlie its contribution to intellectual disabilities and other neurological features observed in affected individuals (Bartholdi2013Further).
