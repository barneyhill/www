# RPL22L1

## Overview
RPL22L1 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L22-like 1, which is a component of the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis and function, impacting processes such as translation and cell growth. RPL22L1 is active in both the nucleolus and cytoplasm, contributing to ribosomal assembly and cellular proliferation (O’Leary2013The). It is particularly significant in hematopoietic development, where it facilitates the expression of Smad1, a critical factor for hematopoietic stem cell emergence, distinguishing its function from its paralog RPL22 (Zhang2013Control). Additionally, RPL22L1 is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions, including autoregulation of its mRNA stability and interactions with its paralog RPL22, which regulates its expression (Fan2024Ribosomal). The gene's expression is clinically significant, particularly in cancer biology, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance (Rao2019RPL22L1).

## Function
RPL22L1 encodes a ribosomal protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. It is involved in cellular processes such as translation and cell growth. RPL22L1 is active in both the nucleolus and cytoplasm, contributing to ribosomal assembly and function, which impacts cellular proliferation and organismal development (O’Leary2013The).

In healthy human cells, RPL22L1 is essential for normal cell growth and proliferation. It is incorporated into ribosomes, where it influences ribosome composition and potentially affects transcript-specific translation. This incorporation is associated with increased cell proliferation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (O’Leary2013The).

RPL22L1 also plays a role in hematopoietic development. It is crucial for the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by facilitating the expression of Smad1, a critical effector of BMP4 signals necessary for HSC emergence. This function is distinct from its paralog RPL22, which has opposing effects on Smad1 expression. The balance between RPL22 and RPL22L1 is essential for regulating Smad1 expression and HSC emergence, indicating that RPL22L1 has functions beyond its role in the ribosome (Zhang2013Control).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPL22L1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). RPL22L1 is often overexpressed in CRC, especially when its paralog RPL22 is lost, which occurs in approximately 36% of CRC patients. This overexpression is associated with increased cellular transformation potential, poor prognosis, and reduced survival rates in CRC patients (Rao2019RPL22L1). High levels of RPL22L1 are linked to resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a common chemotherapy drug used in CRC treatment. This resistance is thought to be due to alterations in DNA repair proteins, such as increased MGMT and decreased MLH1 expression, which are influenced by RPL22L1 overexpression (Rao2019RPL22L1).

RPL22L1's role extends beyond CRC, as it is implicated in other cancers. In glioblastoma, alternative splicing of RPL22L1 leads to the production of an isoform that cannot bind to ribosomes but interacts with RNA molecules, contributing to a more aggressive tumor phenotype (Larionova2022Alternative). The gene's expression and interaction with its paralog RPL22 are crucial, as RPL22 normally represses RPL22L1 expression. Loss of RPL22 results in increased RPL22L1 levels, which can substitute for RPL22 in ribosome assembly and function, potentially influencing disease progression (O’Leary2013The).

## Interactions
RPL22L1, a ribosomal protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to bind to its own exons, suggesting a role in autoregulating its mRNA stability (Fan2024Ribosomal). RPL22L1 also interacts with RPL22, its paralog, in a regulatory capacity. RPL22 negatively regulates RPL22L1 expression, and when RPL22L1 is knocked out, RPL22 expression increases, indicating a compensatory mechanism between the two proteins (Fan2024Ribosomal). 

RPL22L1 is involved in the splicing of its own pre-mRNA, with potential stem loops identified in its intron 2 that overlap with the intronic splice site of its variant 3. This suggests that RPL22 binding mediates the repression of RPL22L1 (Fan2024Ribosomal). In the context of cancer, RPL22L1 is upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and is associated with higher Gleason grades, indicating its role in tumor progression. It interacts with RPS21, another ribosomal protein, and their expression levels are positively correlated in prostate cancer (Liang2019Identification). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RPL22L1 in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer biology.
