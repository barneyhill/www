# ZNF618

## Overview
ZNF618 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 618, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind specifically to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-modified DNA, classifying it as a DNA modification-restricted transcription factor (dmrTF) (Bai2021Proteome‐Wide). ZNF618 is implicated in various biological processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGF-β signaling pathways, and is involved in the cellular response to infections and tumor suppression (Brink2019Protein; Elati2023Dual). Clinically, alterations in ZNF618 have been associated with several health conditions, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its potential significance in genetic and disease research (Roberts2018Genetics; Haidar2017Diagnosis).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF618 has been implicated in various health conditions through its involvement in genetic mutations and expression alterations. In a study involving a Lebanese family with hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS), a mutation in ZNF618 (c.832G > T) was identified, leading to a premature stop codon. However, this gene was excluded as a candidate for the family's condition based on clinical characteristics, suggesting its mutation may not directly cause HFS (Haidar2017Diagnosis).

ZNF618 is also involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) through its rearrangement with NUTM1. This fusion is present in approximately 1% of childhood ALL cases and is associated with an excellent prognosis. The fusion may act similarly to those in nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma by repressing differentiation, although its precise role in leukemogenesis requires further study (Roberts2018Genetics).

Additionally, ZNF618 has been associated with other conditions through association studies, including cleft lip, high blood pressure, and kidney diseases. In women, it has been linked to brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness, indicating its potential involvement in cardiovascular health (Haidar2017Diagnosis).

## Interactions
ZNF618 is a zinc finger protein known for its specific interactions with modified DNA. It has been identified as a transcription factor that binds specifically to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-modified DNA in various cell lines, including HeLa, A549, and MCF-7. This binding activity categorizes ZNF618 as a DNA modification-restricted transcription factor (dmrTF), highlighting its role in the dynamic nature of protein-DNA interactions and its potential involvement in embryonic-related processes as DNA modifications progress (Bai2021Proteome‐Wide).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, ZNF618 has been observed to be upregulated in pre-symptomatic individuals compared to patients, suggesting its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGF-β signaling pathways (Brink2019Protein). However, in MCF7 cells, ZNF618 is excluded from the DNA interactome, indicating that its interactions with DNA are limited or regulated differently in this cell type (Trendel2024Mapping).

ZNF618 is also noted to be downregulated during T. annulata infection in bovine leukocytes, which may imply a role in tumor suppression or response to infection (Elati2023Dual).
