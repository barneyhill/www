# HCAR3

## Overview
HCAR3, or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various cellular processes, particularly within human keratinocytes. The protein product of HCAR3 plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, which are vital for maintaining mitochondrial energy output and cellular homeostasis (Pilar2023A). As a Gαi-coupled receptor, HCAR3 influences keratinocyte metabolism and migration, impacting processes such as skin wound healing and cellular respiration (Pilar2023A). The receptor's interactions with proteins like β-arrestin-2 and Gβγ subunits further modulate its signaling pathways, highlighting its complex regulatory network (Peters2020Natural). HCAR3's expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Wnorowski2021Alterations; Yang2021Identification).

## Function
HCAR3, or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes in human keratinocytes, including epithelial proliferation, migration, and cellular respiration. It is involved in integrating environmental signals into intracellular metabolic pathways, influencing keratinocyte biology by modulating oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial energy output (Pilar2023A).

HCAR3 is a Gαi-coupled receptor that affects keratinocyte metabolism by regulating the balance of metabolic substrates. Knockdown of HCAR3 results in increased reliance on fatty acids for oxidative phosphorylation, leading to energy defects, reduced respiratory capacity, and ATP production. This is accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation and an increase in lipid droplets, indicating a role in lipid metabolism (Pilar2023A).

In addition to its metabolic functions, HCAR3 influences keratinocyte migration, which is crucial for skin wound healing. It affects cell-to-cell interaction by influencing the detachment of cells from the monolayer, impacting the membrane localization of E-cadherin, a key adhesion molecule (Pilar2023A). These functions highlight HCAR3's critical role in maintaining epithelial cell homeostasis and adapting to stress conditions (Pilar2023A).

## Clinical Significance
HCAR3, or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), HCAR3 is significantly upregulated in inflamed intestinal tissues. This upregulation is associated with the kynurenine pathway, which is altered in IBD, suggesting that HCAR3 may play a role in the disease's inflammatory processes (Wnorowski2021Alterations; Spathakis2024Exploring). Successful treatment with infliximab, an anti-TNF-α therapy, normalizes HCAR3 expression, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wnorowski2021Alterations).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), HCAR3 expression is increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression correlates with patient survival time, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Yang2021Identification). In breast cancer, rare variants of HCAR3 have been identified, with some potentially affecting protein function and contributing to cancer cell proliferation (McGuire2021Rare). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in cancer biology, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
HCAR3, or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3, is known to interact with several proteins that influence its signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with β-arrestin-2, which is recruited upon activation by 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (3HO) but not by 3-hydroxydecanoic acid (3HDec). This interaction is crucial for the receptor's internalization and signaling, as demonstrated by the use of barbardin, an inhibitor that blocks arrestin-dependent endocytosis, which diminishes 3HO-induced signaling (Peters2020Natural). 

HCAR3 also interacts with Gβγ subunits, which play a role in its internalization and trafficking. These subunits modulate various effectors, including adenylyl cyclase isoforms and ERK, and are involved in the receptor's cAMP inhibitory response and ERK activation (Peters2020Natural). 

The receptor's interaction with dynamin-2 (dyn-2) is another critical aspect of its function. Dyn-2 is involved in the receptor's trafficking and internalization, with different dyn-2 mutants affecting HCAR3's cell surface expression and signaling pathways. The presence of dyn-2 mutants can lead to altered signaling, such as increased basal cAMP levels and reduced ERK activation (Peters2020Natural). These interactions highlight the complex network of proteins that regulate HCAR3's signaling and cellular effects.
