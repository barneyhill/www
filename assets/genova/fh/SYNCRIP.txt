# SYNCRIP

## Overview
SYNCRIP is a gene that encodes the synaptotagmin binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and distinct domains that facilitate its interaction with RNA and other proteins. SYNCRIP plays a critical role in RNA splicing, translation, transport, and degradation, and is particularly important in the post-transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) (Chen2020SYNCRIP). It is also involved in maintaining proteostasis and self-renewal in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by regulating protein homeostasis and stress responses (Herrejon2023RNA). Clinically, alterations in the SYNCRIP gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Vu2017Functional; Gillentine2021Rare).

## Structure
The SYNCRIP protein, also known as synaptotagmin binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein, is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and distinct domains. The protein contains three tandem RRMs, which are crucial for its RNA-binding capabilities. These RRMs, particularly the RRM2-3 domain, exhibit a typical β1α1β2β3α2β4 topology and are essential for the processing of pri-let-7a, a precursor microRNA (Chen2020SYNCRIP).

The N-terminal region of SYNCRIP includes an acidic domain (AcD) that forms a 5-helix bundle with a hydrophobic core and a network of basic and acidic residues on its surface. This domain is involved in interactions with the cytidine deaminase APOBEC1 and is unique to SYNCRIP and its close homolog hnRNP R (Beuck2016The; Hobor2018A). The AcD does not form a globular domain in its entirety, but a segment, AcD 24-107, forms a self-folding globular domain with an all alpha-helix architecture (Beuck2016The).

SYNCRIP also contains a non-canonical RNA-binding region known as the NURR domain, which is responsible for recognizing specific RNA sequences and contributes to high-affinity binding when coupled with the RRM domains (Hobor2018A). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which vary in their amino-terminal acidic domain or carboxy-terminal tail, potentially influencing its role in cellular processes (Chen2020SYNCRIP).

## Function
SYNCRIP, also known as synaptotagmin binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein, is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in RNA metabolism. In healthy human cells, SYNCRIP is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing, translation, transport, and degradation. It modulates alternative splicing of specific transcripts, such as SMN2, which is relevant in the context of spinal muscular atrophy (Chen2020SYNCRIP).

SYNCRIP is also crucial for the post-transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs). It interacts with components of the microprocessor complex, enhancing the processing of primary miRNAs like pri-let-7a, thereby influencing the expression of mature miRNAs. This regulation affects the expression of target proteins, impacting cellular functions and development (Chen2020SYNCRIP).

In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), SYNCRIP maintains proteostasis and self-renewal by regulating protein homeostasis and stress responses. It controls cellular polarity and division patterns through the translational regulation of CDC42, a GTPase protein essential for cytoskeleton dynamics (Herrejon2023RNA). SYNCRIP's role in these processes is critical for maintaining cellular integrity and function under stress conditions (Herrejon2023RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SYNCRIP gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. In neurodevelopmental disorders, SYNCRIP mutations can lead to developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy. Structural brain abnormalities such as dysmorphic ventricles and corpus callosum abnormalities are also observed. These mutations often involve de novo variants that affect the RNA recognition motif, impacting RNA-binding and leading to pathogenicity (Semino2021Further; Gillentine2021Rare).

In cancer, SYNCRIP plays a significant role in leukemia and colorectal cancer. In leukemia, SYNCRIP is essential for leukemia cell survival and proliferation. Its expression is elevated in acute myeloid leukemia, and its knockdown results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of leukemia cells (Vu2017Functional). In colorectal cancer, SYNCRIP is upregulated and associated with lower survival rates. It regulates DNMT3A expression, influencing tumor growth and patient survival (Li2024The).

SYNCRIP is also implicated in pancreatic cancer, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its expression is modulated by the long non-coding RNA lncNT5E (Zhang2020A).

## Interactions
SYNCRIP, also known as synaptotagmin binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It plays a significant role in the processing of pri-let-7a miRNA by interacting with the microprocessor complex, specifically binding to DGCR8, a component of this complex. This interaction is independent of RNA and is crucial for enhancing the processing of pri-let-7a, although SYNCRIP does not directly interact with Drosha, another component of the microprocessor complex (Chen2020SYNCRIP).

SYNCRIP contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), with the RRM2-3 domain being particularly important for RNA binding and processing. This domain interacts with RNA through conserved motifs, RNP1 and RNP2, and is essential for binding to pri-let-7a, facilitating its processing by the microprocessor complex (Chen2020SYNCRIP).

SYNCRIP also interacts with a specific sequence in miRNAs, known as the hEXO motif, through its NURR domain. This interaction is crucial for the exosomal partitioning of miRNAs, highlighting SYNCRIP's role in miRNA transport and cellular communication (Hobor2018A). These interactions underscore SYNCRIP's broader role in RNA metabolism and regulation.
