# ITGAM

## Overview
The ITGAM gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha M, which is a critical component of the Mac-1 integrin complex, also known as complement receptor-3 (CR3). This protein is a transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, where it plays a vital role in immune system functions, including cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and immune regulation. The integrin subunit alpha M, in conjunction with the beta-2 subunit (CD18), forms a heterodimer that facilitates leukocyte trafficking, phagocytosis of opsonized particles, and modulation of immune responses. The ITGAM gene and its encoded protein are of significant clinical interest due to their association with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where genetic variants can alter immune cell function and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Faridi2017CD11b; Maiti2014Combined; Fagerholm2013The).

## Structure
The ITGAM gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha M, which forms a heterodimer with the beta-2 subunit (CD18) to create the Mac-1 complex. This integrin is involved in cell adhesion and immune responses. The molecular structure of ITGAM includes several distinct domains and features. The alpha M subunit contains an inserted (I) domain, which is a major ligand-binding site characterized by seven amphipathic helices surrounding a hydrophobic β-sheet core. This domain can exist in 'open' and 'closed' conformations, regulated by metal-ion dependent adhesion sites (MIDAS) that chelate a Mg2+ ion, crucial for ligand binding (Rosetti2015A; Vorup-Jensen2018Structural).

The structure also includes a beta-propeller domain, which is involved in binding to iC3b, a fragment of the complement component C3 (Vorup-Jensen2018Structural). The cytoplasmic tail of the alpha M subunit interacts with filamin A domain 21 (FLNa-Ig21), forming a binary complex that is important for integrin regulation. This interaction involves an α-helical conformation of the membrane proximal residues (Zhiping2021Binary).

Post-translational modifications of ITGAM include glycosylation, which varies in the alpha chains (Vorup-Jensen2018Structural). The integrin undergoes conformational changes from a bent to an elongated state upon activation, which is critical for ligand binding (Vorup-Jensen2018Structural).

## Function
The ITGAM gene encodes the CD11b integrin, a component of the Mac-1 integrin complex, also known as alphaMbeta2 or complement receptor-3 (CR3). This integrin is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, where it plays a crucial role in the immune system (Morrison2013Leukocyte; Fagerholm2013The). 

In healthy human cells, Mac-1 integrin is involved in several key processes. It mediates the phagocytosis of iC3b-coated particles, such as apoptotic cells and pathogens, which is essential for the clearance of cellular debris and immune complexes, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune responses (Morrison2013Leukocyte; Fagerholm2013The). Mac-1 also facilitates leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation by binding to ICAM ligands on blood vessel endothelium, assisting in the crawling of neutrophils on the endothelium before extravasation (Fagerholm2013The).

Additionally, Mac-1 integrin functions as a negative regulator of immune cell signaling. It inhibits T-cell activation, restricts Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and influences Th17 cell differentiation, contributing to immune tolerance and suppression (Fagerholm2019Beta2Integrins; Fagerholm2013The). These activities highlight the integrin's role in regulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGAM gene, which encodes the CD11b protein, are significantly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and autoantibody production. Specifically, the nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1143679 (R77H) is strongly linked to SLE and its subphenotypes, such as lupus nephritis and discoid rash (Faridi2017CD11b; Maiti2014Combined). This variant results in reduced expression of the CD11b protein, impairing its ability to bind ligands like fibrinogen and vitronectin, which are crucial for immune functions such as phagocytosis and cell adhesion (Maiti2014Combined).

The rs1143679 variant is also associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by altering neutrophil functions, including phagocytosis and adhesion (Anaya2012Evaluation; Zhou2013Multiple). Additionally, rare variants such as F941V and G1145S in ITGAM have been identified, which significantly impair CR3-mediated phagocytosis, further implicating ITGAM in SLE pathogenesis (Roberts2014Resequencing). These genetic variations highlight the role of ITGAM in autoimmune disease susceptibility and the potential for targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
The ITGAM gene encodes the CD11b protein, which forms a heterodimer with CD18 to create the Mac-1 (CR3) receptor. This receptor is involved in various immune functions, including cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and complement activation. CD11b interacts with several ligands, such as fibrinogen (FBN), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and complement component iC3b, which are crucial for its role in leukocyte adhesion and migration (Zhou2013Multiple; Maiti2014Combined).

The rs1143679 variant in ITGAM results in a non-synonymous mutation that affects the binding of these ligands, reducing the receptor's ability to bind to fibrinogen and vitronectin by 3 to 5-fold compared to the wild-type. This mutation impacts the polarization of Mac-1 on the cell surface, impairing its interaction with ligands like ICAM1 and potentially leading to reduced phagocytosis and cytokine release (Maiti2014Combined).

At the nucleic acid level, the rs1143679 variant is located near the exon-3 splice donor site and within transcription factor binding sites, potentially disrupting splicing and transcription. The risk allele 'A' is associated with reduced ITGAM transcript and CD11b protein levels, affecting interactions with proteins such as Ku70/80, NF-kB, and EBF1, which influence gene expression and contribute to autoimmune processes (Maiti2014Combined).
