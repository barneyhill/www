# ABLIM1

## Overview
ABLIM1, or actin binding LIM protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and signaling. The ABLIM1 protein is characterized by its LIM domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a villin headpiece domain that binds to filamentous actin (F-actin), categorizing it as a cytoskeletal protein (Jin2018Actinbinding; Ohsawa2014ABLIM1). This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including osteoclast differentiation, cell motility, and intracellular signaling pathways (Jin2018Actinbinding). ABLIM1 is also implicated in several cancers, where it functions as a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, influencing pathways such as NF-κB signaling, and is involved in interactions with components like Rictor in mTORC2, affecting cell migration and actin polymerization (Dong2020Rictor; He2024ABLIM1). The gene's expression and splicing are regulated by various factors, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 and several types of cancer (Chen2020&lt; Ohsawa2014ABLIM1).

## Structure
The ABLIM1 protein is characterized by its structural domains, which include four LIM domains at the N-terminus and a villin headpiece (VHP) domain at the C-terminus. The LIM domains are zinc-binding motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, while the VHP domain is responsible for binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) (Jin2018Actinbinding; Ohsawa2014ABLIM1). These domains are crucial for the protein's function, particularly in linking the actin cytoskeleton to cell signaling pathways (Krupp2006Actin).

ABLIM1 is known to have multiple splice variants, with the human gene producing four isoforms. The splicing of ABLIM1 is regulated by factors such as MBNL1, CELF family proteins, and PTBP1, and is notably altered in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients, where exon 11 inclusion is decreased (Ohsawa2014ABLIM1). This exon codes for 28 amino acids and is located five amino acids downstream of the fourth LIM domain, playing a role in the splicing process (Ohsawa2014ABLIM1).

The protein is localized to the Z-disk in cardiac muscle, suggesting a role in mediating interactions between actin filaments and protein complexes at this site (Ohsawa2014ABLIM1).

## Function
ABLIM1 (actin binding LIM protein 1) is a crucial component in the regulation of actin dynamics, which is essential for various cellular processes. It is a LIM domain-containing protein that interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, playing a significant role in osteoclast differentiation and motility. During RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, ABLIM1 expression is upregulated, and its downregulation leads to suppressed osteoclast differentiation and bone resorptive activity. This is associated with decreased activation of JNK and reduced expression of critical transcription factors like c-Fos and NFATc1, which are essential for osteoclastogenesis (Jin2018Actinbinding).

ABLIM1 is involved in the formation of the F-actin ring, a structure important for bone resorption, and influences cell motility, as shown by reduced migration in preosteoclasts with ABLIM1 knockdown. This is linked to decreased activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and reduced Rac1 expression, indicating ABLIM1's role in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell migration (Jin2018Actinbinding). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function, impacting tissue development and repair (Jin2018Actinbinding).

## Clinical Significance
ABLIM1 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell signaling and structural organization. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ABLIM1 is overexpressed, and this heightened expression is associated with poor disease-free survival. It functions as a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting CRC growth and metastasis by targeting IκBα ubiquitination and activating NF-κB signaling. This activity accelerates tumor growth and invasion, making ABLIM1 a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CRC (He2024ABLIM1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ABLIM1 is a phosphorylation target of Rictor, a component of mTORC2, which is crucial for actin polymerization and cell migration. Alterations in ABLIM1 phosphorylation can significantly impact cell migration, contributing to the aggressive nature of HCC (Dong2020Rictor).

ABLIM1 also plays a role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through its interaction with the lncRNA ZNF667-AS1 and miR-1290. ZNF667-AS1 promotes ABLIM1 expression by sponging miR-1290, which otherwise suppresses ABLIM1. This regulatory network influences NPC progression, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies targeting these interactions (p&gt; Chen2020&lt; LncRNA).

## Interactions
ABLIM1 (actin binding LIM protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. ABLIM1 interacts with F-actin, organizing it into dense networks through its dematin-homologous region. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structure and organization of the cell cortex, as ABLIM1 associates with cell cortex proteins such as αII and βII spectrins, α adducin, and ankyrin-2 (Li2018abLIM1). The ΔLIM region of ABLIM1 is necessary for these interactions, as it shows strong associations with bundled F-actin and cortical proteins (Li2018abLIM1).

In colorectal cancer, ABLIM1 acts as a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacting with IκBα, a protein involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. ABLIM1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα, thereby activating NF-κB signaling, which contributes to cancer growth and metastasis (He2024ABLIM1). The interaction with IκBα is mediated through the HP domain of ABLIM1, and the ubiquitination activity is dependent on the 402-778 amino acid region of the protein (He2024ABLIM1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ABLIM1 interacts with Rictor, a component of mTORC2, which regulates ABLIM1 phosphorylation. This interaction influences actin polymerization and cell migration (Dong2020Rictor).
