# SUCLG2

## Overview
The SUCLG2 gene encodes the GDP-specific β subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), an enzyme integral to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle. This enzyme is categorized as a ligase, specifically involved in catalyzing the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, a key step in cellular energy metabolism that facilitates substrate-level phosphorylation and the production of GTP from GDP (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA). The protein encoded by SUCLG2 is predominantly expressed in anabolic tissues such as the liver and kidney, indicating its significant role in energy metabolism and anabolic processes (Lambeth2004Expression). Localized primarily within the mitochondrial matrix, the SUCLG2 protein is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and is implicated in various metabolic pathways, including amino acid and fatty acid catabolism, heme synthesis, and the regulation of lysine succinylation (Chinopoulos2019Mutated; Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA).

## Structure


## Function
The SUCLG2 gene encodes the GDP-specific β subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), an enzyme involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, a critical step in the TCA cycle that is coupled with substrate-level phosphorylation, producing GTP from GDP in the process (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA). The SUCLG2-encoded isoform of SCS is predominantly expressed in anabolic tissues such as the liver and kidney, suggesting its role in energy metabolism and anabolic processes (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA; Lambeth2004Expression).

In healthy human cells, SUCLG2 is primarily localized within the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation and energy metabolism (Chinopoulos2019Mutated). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis in cells, as it is involved in the production of GTP, which is essential for various cellular functions, including protein synthesis and other GTP-requiring processes (Lambeth2004Expression). SUCLG2 also plays a role in amino acid and fatty acid catabolism, heme synthesis, and the regulation of lysine succinylation, which has broader metabolic and epigenetic implications (Lancaster2023SuccinylCoA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUCLG2 gene have been associated with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), which are types of tumors that arise from chromaffin cells. In a study involving 352 patients with apparently sporadic PPGLs, researchers identified eight germline SUCLG2 mutations in 15 patients, accounting for 4.3% of the cohort. These mutations, along with loss of heterozygosity, resulted in decreased levels of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunit B. This led to aberrant respiration and the accumulation of succinate, a recognized oncometabolite, which is implicated in tumorigenesis (Vanova2021Novel).

The study also demonstrated that manipulating the SUCLG2 gene in human pheochromocytoma cells to create SUCLG2 knock-out cells confirmed a decrease in SDHB. This resulted in faulty assembly of mitochondrial complex II, altered respiration, and activity, further supporting the role of SUCLG2 mutations in the development of PPGL (Vanova2021Novel). These findings suggest that SUCLG2 plays a significant role in the etiology of these diseases, and larger-scale sequencing is recommended to further clarify the relationship between SUCLG2 and SDHx, particularly SDHB, in disease development (Vanova2021Novel).

## Interactions
SUCLG2, a subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, forms a heterodimeric complex with SUCLG1, the alpha subunit, to catalyze the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate in the citric acid cycle. This interaction is crucial for energy metabolism, as the enzyme complex plays a significant role in the Krebs cycle (Rouzier2010The). 

In the context of colorectal cancer, SUCLG2 is co-expressed with 741 proteins, suggesting its involvement in ribosome biogenesis and protein translation. The co-expressed proteins are distinct from those associated with other mitochondrial genes like HIGD1A and SLC25A24, indicating complementary functions in cellular processes (Zhang2021Multiomics). 

Despite its role in metabolic pathways, specific physical interactions of SUCLG2 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature. The protein's expression and localization studies suggest its presence in the cerebral microvasculature, potentially in endothelial cells or pericytes, but not in neurons or astroglial cells (Dobolyi2014Localization). This localization pattern implies a role in vascular functions, although direct interactions remain to be elucidated. 

Overall, while SUCLG2 is implicated in significant metabolic and cellular processes, detailed interaction studies are necessary to fully understand its role in various biological contexts.
