# CNOT3

## Overview
CNOT3 is a gene that encodes the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 3, a protein integral to the CCR4-NOT complex, which is a major eukaryotic deadenylase complex involved in mRNA metabolism. The protein plays a pivotal role in regulating mRNA deadenylation, stability, and translation, thereby influencing gene expression and various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Lau2009Human; Shirai2014Multifunctional). CNOT3 is characterized by its interaction with other subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, such as CNOT1 and CNOT2, and is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic stem cells (Chalabi2020The; Ghashghaei2024Translation). The gene's mutations and alterations are linked to several clinical conditions, including retinitis pigmentosa, intellectual developmental disorders, and moyamoya angiopathy, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Venturini2012CNOT3; Priolo2021CoOccurring; Pinard2020The).

## Structure
The human CNOT3 protein is a major isoform consisting of 753 amino acids and includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal coiled-coil domain (CNOT3-N-term), a linker region (CNOT3-Middle), and C-terminal regions comprising a NOT1 anchor region (NAR), a connector sequence (CS), and a NOT box domain (Ghashghaei2024Translation). The NOT box domain is critical for CNOT3's function, particularly in promoting leukemogenesis, as demonstrated by its essential role in leukemia cells (Ghashghaei2024Translation). 

CNOT3 interacts with other subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, including CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT4, CNOT6, and CNOT10/11, through both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. This interaction is crucial for the complex's ability to recognize slow-moving ribosomes (Ghashghaei2024Translation). The NOT box domain is specifically required for CNOT3's stable integration into the complex, as CNOT3 lacking this domain (CNOT3S) cannot interact with other subunits (Lau2009Human).

CNOT3 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the full-length isoform (CNOT3L) and a smaller isoform (CNOT3S) that lacks the NOT box (Lau2009Human). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it functions as a monomer within the complex (Lau2009Human).

## Function
CNOT3 is a crucial component of the CCR4-NOT complex, which plays a significant role in mRNA metabolism, including mRNA deadenylation, stability, and translation regulation. In healthy human cells, CNOT3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by modulating mRNA decay and transcriptional processes (Lau2009Human; Shirai2014Multifunctional). It acts as a core subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, contributing to the repression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) transcription, which is important for immune regulation (RodríguezGil2017The).

CNOT3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, as its loss can lead to metabolic disorders and impaired glucose tolerance (Chalabi2020The). In the context of hematopoietic stem cells, CNOT3 helps maintain these cells in an undifferentiated state, playing a critical role in their differentiation and proliferation (Ghashghaei2024Translation).

Overall, CNOT3's involvement in mRNA regulation and gene expression is vital for normal cellular function and organismal development, impacting processes such as energy metabolism, immune response, and stem cell maintenance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CNOT3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. CNOT3 acts as a modifier of PRPF31 mutations in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a genetic disorder affecting the retina. It functions as a negative regulator of PRPF31 expression, influencing the penetrance of PRPF31 mutations. Lower expression of CNOT3 in asymptomatic carriers allows for higher levels of PRPF31, compensating for the mutated allele and preventing symptoms (Venturini2012CNOT3).

CNOT3 is also linked to intellectual developmental disorder with speech delay, autism, and dysmorphic facies (IDDSADF). Pathogenic variants, particularly truncating mutations, support haploinsufficiency as the mechanism of disease, leading to developmental delay, speech issues, and distinctive facial features (Priolo2021CoOccurring).

Additionally, de novo variants in CNOT3 have been associated with moyamoya angiopathy (MMA), a cerebrovascular disease characterized by occlusion of large arteries, leading to strokes. These variants suggest a phenotypic overlap between MMA and neurodevelopmental disorders, expanding the clinical spectrum associated with CNOT3 mutations (Pinard2020The).

## Interactions
CNOT3, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in gene regulation and cell cycle progression. It interacts with other subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, including CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7, CNOT8, CNOT10, and CNOT11, forming a core part of this major eukaryotic deadenylase complex (martufi2014role). CNOT3's interaction with CNOT2 is particularly significant, as CNOT2 mediates CNOT3's presence within the complex (martufi2014role).

CNOT3 also interacts with Aurora B kinase, a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, especially during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This interaction is important for mitotic progression and is cell cycle-dependent (martufi2014role). In addition, CNOT3 interacts with RNA processing proteins, such as RNA helicases and proteins involved in transcription termination, indicating its role in RNA metabolism (martufi2014role).

In the context of leukemia, CNOT3 associates with translation machinery, including translation elongation factors like EEF1G and EEF1E, influencing protein synthesis and potentially promoting leukemogenesis (Ghashghaei2024Translation). These interactions highlight CNOT3's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
