# DNAJC10

## Overview
DNAJC10 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C10, also known as ERdj5. This protein is a co-chaperone involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a critical role in protein folding and quality control. As a member of the Hsp40 family, it assists in the degradation of misfolded proteins through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, contributing to cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of defective proteins (Hughes2019DnaJ). DNAJC10 is also implicated in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response mechanism, and interacts with various proteins to maintain protein homeostasis (Hughes2019DnaJ). Its involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in cellular processes, with implications in diseases such as Parkinson's and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Xiong2024Prediction; Yuan2016Systematic).

## Function
DNAJC10, also known as ERdj5, is a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) and functions as a co-chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It plays a crucial role in protein folding and quality control by assisting in the degradation of misfolded proteins through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. DNAJC10 facilitates the reduction of disulfide bonds in misfolded glycoproteins, aiding their retrotranslocation and subsequent degradation, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of defective proteins (Hughes2019DnaJ).

In healthy human cells, DNAJC10 is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the ER. It is part of the Hsp70 machinery, which is upregulated by heat stress, indicating its role in managing protein misfolding under stress conditions (Hughes2019DnaJ). The protein's activity is not limited to the ER, as it is part of a complex genetic network that affects developmental robustness and phenotypic diversity (Hughes2019DnaJ). DNAJC10's function in ERAD and its involvement in the UPR highlight its importance in cellular processes that ensure protein quality control and contribute to the organism's overall health and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DNAJC10 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the DNAJC10 variant rs13414223 has been identified as having a protective role. This variant is less frequent in PD patients compared to controls, suggesting it may help mitigate the risk of developing the disease (Yuan2016Systematic). DNAJC10 is expressed in brain regions affected by PD, such as the cortex and striatum, and its ortholog in C. elegans has shown protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases (Yuan2016Systematic).

In the context of cancer, DNAJC10 has been associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Low expression levels of DNAJC10 correlate with a higher risk score and lower survival probability in DLBCL patients, indicating its potential role in prognosis and treatment response (Xiong2024Prediction). Additionally, DNAJC10 is involved in autophagy regulation, which is significant in cancer biology, suggesting its broader implications in cancer progression and therapy (Xiong2024Prediction).

## Interactions
DNAJC10, also known as ERdj5, is involved in several protein interactions within the cell. It has been identified as a specific binding partner of the constitutive chaperone HSC70, but not with the heat-inducible form HSP70. This suggests a preferential interaction with HSC70, indicating distinct roles within the chaperone system (Ryu2020Proteomewide). DNAJC10 is also involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and the unfolded protein response (UPR), where it interacts with other proteins to facilitate the degradation of misfolded proteins (Hughes2019DnaJ).

In the context of cancer research, DNAJC10 has been identified as a moderate responder to the compound PLTFBH, which affects its protein levels in HN31 cancer cells (Alalem2022Mutant). However, specific details about its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided. DNAJC10's role in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses. Despite its involvement in these processes, detailed molecular interactions of DNAJC10 with specific proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
