# IER3

## Overview
The IER3 gene encodes the protein Immediate Early Response 3, which is a crucial component in various cellular processes, including stress response, apoptosis regulation, and cell cycle control. As an immediate early gene, IER3 is rapidly induced by stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and DNA-damaging agents, and it participates in several signaling pathways, including NF-kB, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/Akt (Arlt2011Role; Pawlikowska2010ATMdependent). The protein encoded by IER3 is involved in modulating apoptosis and cell survival, with its effects varying depending on the cellular context. It plays a significant role in the DNA damage response and mitochondrial function, influencing cellular energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production (Shen2008IEX1). IER3's interactions with other proteins, such as the B56 subunit of PP2A and TRAIL, further underscore its importance in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases (Garcia2014IER3; Liu2021TRAIL).

## Structure


## Function
The IER3 gene, also known as immediate early response 3, plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in stress response, apoptosis regulation, and cell cycle control. IER3 is rapidly induced by various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and DNA-damaging agents, and is involved in several signaling pathways such as NF-kB, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/Akt (Arlt2011Role; Pawlikowska2010ATMdependent). 

In healthy human cells, IER3 contributes to the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival. It can have both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects depending on the cellular context. For instance, IER3 can enhance apoptosis in response to TNFα and other stressors, while in other scenarios, it may protect against apoptosis, potentially influencing cell survival and proliferation (Arlt2011Role). 

IER3 also plays a critical role in the DNA damage response by facilitating the nuclear translocation of Mcl-1, a protein that helps maintain genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression. This function is crucial for efficient DNA repair and cell survival following genotoxic stress (Pawlikowska2010ATMdependent). 

Additionally, IER3 is involved in mitochondrial function by regulating the degradation of the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATPase inhibitor, IF1. This regulation helps maintain mitochondrial ATPase activity and balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, thereby influencing cellular energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production (Shen2008IEX1).

## Clinical Significance
IER3 plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation. In cancer, IER3 expression is linked to tumor progression and prognosis. It supports oncogenic effects in pancreatic cancer by sustaining ERK1/2 phosphorylation, crucial for Kras-driven tumor development. Deletion of IER3 in mouse models delays pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) development and reduces pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) incidence, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Garcia2014IER3). IER3 is also associated with poor survival in multiple myeloma, Sézary syndrome, and breast cancer, while in ovarian cancer, it correlates with a good prognosis due to its proapoptotic effects (Garcia2014IER3).

In obesity, IER3 is preferentially expressed in adipose progenitor cells from obese patients, linking it to obesity-related microenvironments characterized by inflammation and hypoxia (Ravaud2015IER3). IER3's role in immune regulation is highlighted by its involvement in autoimmune diseases like lupus and inflammatory bowel diseases, where its expression modulates immune responses and inflammation (Arlt2011Role). These findings underscore IER3's clinical significance across a range of conditions.

## Interactions
IER3, also known as Immediate Early Response 3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as apoptosis and proliferation. In pancreatic cancer, IER3 interacts with the B56 subunit of the PP2A enzyme, inhibiting its activity and sustaining ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is crucial for Kras G12D-driven tumor development (Garcia2014IER3). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), IER3 interacts with the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and migration of cancer cells. This interaction also inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for HCC (Liu2021TRAIL).

IER3 is also a substrate of the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This process is facilitated by the scaffold protein FHL2, which forms a ternary complex with MDM2 and IER3, enhancing the degradation of IER3 in cervical cancer cells (Jin2016Scaffold). These interactions highlight IER3's role in regulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a target in cancer therapy.
