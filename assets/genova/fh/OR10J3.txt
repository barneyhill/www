# OR10J3

## Overview
The OR10J3 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily J member 3, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a pivotal role in the sense of smell. The OR10J3 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium but is also found in other tissues, such as the skin, where it participates in various cellular processes, including proliferation and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive; Barnes2020Expert). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR10J3 has been implicated in conditions such as sensitive skin and breast cancer, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory and non-sensory biological pathways (Lee2009Candidate; Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
The OR10J3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Barnes2020Expert). The OR10J3 protein is involved in various cellular processes beyond olfaction, including roles in epidermal and keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production, as it is also expressed in the skin and other tissues (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

In the context of sensitive skin, OR10J3 and other olfactory receptor genes are downregulated, which may be linked to disturbances in epidermal homeostasis. However, it remains unclear whether this downregulation is a cause or consequence of sensitive skin (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). Additionally, OR10J3 has been associated with breast cancer risk, suggesting that genetic variations in this gene may influence disease susceptibility, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Lee2009Candidate).
