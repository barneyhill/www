# PRKACB

## Overview
The PRKACB gene encodes the protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit beta, a critical component of the protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme complex. As a serine/threonine kinase, this protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways by mediating the phosphorylation of target proteins in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The PRKACB gene is expressed in various tissues, with particularly high levels in the nervous system, where it contributes to neuroprotection and cellular processes such as metabolism, gene expression, and cell cycle regulation (Khamse2021Novela; Espiard2020PRKACB). The protein's structure includes a conserved kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity, and it undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation to maintain its active conformation (Søberg2018The). PRKACB is involved in numerous physiological processes and has been implicated in several diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and colorectal cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions (Yao2020Application; Espiard2018Activating).

## Structure
The PRKACB gene encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), which is a serine/threonine kinase. The primary structure of PRKACB includes a conserved kinase domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Søberg2018The). The secondary structure of the protein features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the smaller N-terminal lobe primarily involved in ATP binding and the larger C-terminal lobe containing most of the substrate-binding surface and catalytic machinery (Knighton1991Crystal; Søberg2018The).

The tertiary structure of PRKACB involves a bilobal kinase fold, with a cleft between the lobes that serves as the active site for ATP binding and catalysis (Knighton1991Crystal). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with regulatory subunits, forming a tetrameric enzyme complex (Espiard2020PRKACB).

Post-translational modifications of PRKACB include phosphorylation, which is necessary for its catalytic activity. For instance, the phosphorylation of Thr197 is essential for the active conformation of the kinase (Søberg2018The). The PRKACB gene also produces several splice variant isoforms, such as Cβ1, Cβ2, Cβ3, and Cβ4, which differ primarily in their N-terminal regions and exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns (Søberg2017Evolution; Søberg2018The).

## Function
The PRKACB gene encodes the beta subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), a crucial enzyme in cellular signaling pathways. PKA is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits, and it becomes active when cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binds to the regulatory subunits, releasing the catalytic subunits to phosphorylate target proteins (Espiard2020PRKACB). This phosphorylation process is essential for regulating various cellular functions, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (Espiard2020PRKACB).

In healthy human cells, PRKACB is involved in maintaining proper PKA activity, which is vital for controlling physiological processes such as metabolism and cell division (Espiard2020PRKACB). The gene is expressed at higher levels in the nervous system, particularly in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuroprotection and tau phosphorylation at Alzheimer's disease-related sites (Khamse2021Novela; Espiard2020PRKACB). PRKACB also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with tissue-specific expression patterns, indicating its involvement in distinct regulatory networks (Espiard2020PRKACB).

The PRKACB gene's expression and activity are crucial for maintaining energy balance and catecholaminergic activity, as evidenced by studies in knockout mice, which show altered energy expenditure and catecholamine metabolism (London2019The). These findings underscore the gene's importance in regulating metabolic processes and maintaining homeostasis in organisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRKACB gene, which encodes the beta subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), have been implicated in various diseases. In cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs), a somatic mutation known as S54L in the PRKACB gene leads to increased basal PKA activity, contributing to the development of Cushing's syndrome (CS) by disrupting normal enzyme activity and increasing cAMP sensitivity (Espiard2018Activating). This mutation affects the G-loop of the protein kinase, crucial for ATP and substrate binding, and is associated with larger tumor sizes compared to those with PRKACA mutations (Espiard2018Activating).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), low expression of PRKACB is linked to poorer overall survival, particularly in specific patient demographics such as males and whites. This suggests that PRKACB could serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC (Yao2020Application). PRKACB variants have also been associated with skeletal diseases and adrenocortical hyperplasia, with specific mutations like p.K286del and p.T300M affecting PKA activity and protein stability, potentially contributing to these conditions (Espiard2020PRKACB). Additionally, alterations in PRKACB have been linked to neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, through variations in a monomorphic (GCC) repeat (Khamse2021Novel).

## Interactions
The PRKACB gene encodes the beta subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. PRKACB forms part of the PKA holoenzyme complex, consisting of two catalytic subunits and a regulatory subunit dimer. Upon binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits, the catalytic subunits, including PRKACB, are released to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on specific substrate proteins such as C-Raf, RhoA, Src, and CUTL1, which are involved in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and invasion (CHEN2013PRKACB).

PRKACB also interacts with the cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory protein-1 (CARP-1) in brain tissue, influencing cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (CHEN2013PRKACB). Additionally, PRKACB is involved in the phosphorylation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), affecting its localization to lipid rafts (CHEN2013PRKACB).

The gene is subject to transcriptional regulation by c-MYC, which binds to the promoter region of PRKACB, leading to its activation and increased PKA activity independent of cAMP-mediated signaling (Wu2002cMYC). This interaction highlights the role of PRKACB in c-MYC-associated cellular transformation and tumorigenesis (Wu2002cMYC).
