# ERVV-1

## Overview
ERVV-1 is a gene belonging to the family of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), specifically encoding the envelope protein known as endogenous retrovirus group V member 1, envelope. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell fusion and immune modulation. The ERVV-1 protein is particularly significant in placental development, where it facilitates the fusion of trophoblast cells to form the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a critical structure for nutrient exchange between the mother and fetus. Additionally, ERVV-1 plays a role in modulating immune responses, potentially affecting the body's ability to manage infections and maintain cellular homeostasis. The expression of ERVV-1 is tissue-specific, reflecting its finely regulated activity tailored to the physiological demands of different cell types (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
ERVV-1 is a human endogenous retrovirus gene that encodes an envelope protein involved in several cellular processes. In healthy human cells, the ERVV-1 protein plays a significant role in cell fusion and immune modulation. These envelope proteins are crucial for placental development, where they facilitate the fusion of trophoblast cells, contributing to the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer. This layer is essential for nutrient exchange between the mother and the developing fetus, highlighting the protein's importance in reproductive biology.

In addition to its role in placental development, ERVV-1 is involved in regulating immune responses. The protein can modulate immune signaling pathways, potentially influencing the body's ability to respond to infections and other immune challenges. By participating in these processes, ERVV-1 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and supports the organism's overall health.

The expression of ERVV-1 is typically tissue-specific, indicating that its activity is finely regulated to meet the physiological needs of different cell types. This specificity underscores the gene's role in precise cellular functions and its contribution to broader biological outcomes.
