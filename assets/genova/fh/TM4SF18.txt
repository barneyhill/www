# TM4SF18

## Overview
TM4SF18, or transmembrane 4 L six family member 18, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. The TM4SF18 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and signaling pathways, and is implicated in the progression of several cancers. Its expression is notably altered in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma, where it plays a role in tumor growth and metastasis (Singhal2019TM4SF18; Tang2024Integrated; Wang2022Potential). The protein's involvement in critical signaling pathways, such as the p38 MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Du2018microRNA520f).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TM4SF18 is implicated in several cancers due to its aberrant expression. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TM4SF18 is highly expressed in tumor cells and preneoplastic lesions, such as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Its silencing in pancreatic cancer cell lines significantly reduces cell growth, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation (Singhal2019TM4SF18). In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), TM4SF18 is upregulated and associated with advanced pathological grades and TP53 mutations. It is part of a prognostic risk model that correlates with poor survival outcomes and increased immune infiltration (Tang2024Integrated). 

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), TM4SF18 is differentially expressed, with higher levels in non-metastatic groups, indicating a potential role in lymph node metastasis (Wang2022Potential). TM4SF18 is also a direct target of miR-520f in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is linked to tumor progression through the p38 MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (Du2018microRNA520f). These findings suggest that TM4SF18 could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.
