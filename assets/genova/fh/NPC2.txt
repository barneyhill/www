# NPC2

## Overview
The NPC2 gene encodes the NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2, a soluble glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the intracellular transport of cholesterol. This protein is primarily involved in the egress of cholesterol from lysosomes, a critical process for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Structurally, NPC2 is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold and a hydrophobic pocket that facilitates cholesterol binding and transfer. Functionally, NPC2 interacts with the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein to mediate cholesterol transport within lysosomes, a process essential for preventing the pathological accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids. Mutations in the NPC2 gene are linked to Niemann-Pick disease type C2, a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by severe neurological and hepatic symptoms due to disrupted cholesterol homeostasis (Millat2001NiemannPick; Xu2019The; Infante2008NPC2).

## Structure
The NPC2 protein is a small, soluble glycoprotein involved in cholesterol transport within cells. It consists of 151 amino acids, including a 19-amino-acid signal peptide, and is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold composed of seven β-strands arranged in two β-sheets (Friedland2003Structure; Xu2019The). This fold is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability (Friedland2003Structure). The primary sequences of NPC2 orthologs are highly conserved across mammalian species, with human and bovine NPC2 sharing 80% sequence identity (Friedland2003Structure).

The NPC2 protein features a hydrophobic pocket that serves as the cholesterol-binding site. This pocket is formed by several small cavities within the protein's interior, which are proposed to expand to accommodate cholesterol molecules (Friedland2003Structure). The protein's structure lacks a large cavity or tunnel typically seen in other sterol-binding proteins, but it includes a 'gate' formed by specific residues that may open to allow cholesterol binding (Friedland2003Structure).

NPC2 undergoes N-glycosylation, which contributes to the formation of different isoforms with varying molecular masses (Xu2019The). The protein is delivered to lysosomes via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor signal, indicating its role in lysosomal function (Xu2019The). NPC2 functions as a monomer and does not exhibit quaternary structure.

## Function
The NPC2 gene encodes a soluble protein that plays a critical role in the intracellular transport of cholesterol, particularly in the egress of cholesterol from lysosomes in human cells. NPC2 functions by binding cholesterol and facilitating its transfer between the NPC1 protein and lipid bilayers, which is essential for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Infante2008NPC2). This process involves the transfer of cholesterol derived from low-density lipoproteins (LDL) from lysosomes to other cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane (Infante2008NPC2).

NPC2 acts catalytically, accepting or donating cholesterol in a 'hit-and-run' manner, and accelerates the binding and release of cholesterol from NPC1, even at physiological temperatures (Infante2008NPC2). The protein is active in the lysosomal lumen, where it binds cholesterol with high affinity and facilitates its transport to various subcellular compartments (Klein2005NPC2). NPC2's function is crucial for preventing the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in lysosomes, a condition that can lead to Niemann-Pick Type C disease if disrupted (Xu2019The; Infante2008NPC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPC2 gene are associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in lysosomes, leading to neurological and liver dysfunction. NPC2 mutations account for approximately 5% of all NPC cases, with the majority being due to mutations in the NPC1 gene (Xu2019The; Park2003Identification). Clinical manifestations of NPC2 include neurological symptoms such as dementia, hallucinations, and cognitive impairments, often with frontal lobe involvement (Klünemann2002Frontal). 

The disease can present with severe early-onset symptoms, including pronounced lung involvement and rapid neurological decline, often leading to early death (Millat2001NiemannPick; Xu2019The). Common mutations in the NPC2 gene include nonsense mutations like E20X, which result in a severe phenotype with early termination of the protein (Millat2001NiemannPick; Park2003Identification). 

In some cases, mutations lead to a milder disease course with later onset and prolonged survival, depending on the specific genetic alteration (Millat2001NiemannPick). The NPC2 protein's role in cholesterol transport is crucial, and its dysfunction due to mutations disrupts cellular lipid homeostasis, contributing to the disease pathology (Xu2019The).

## Interactions
NPC2 interacts with the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein to facilitate cholesterol transport within lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for the transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, a process described as a 'hydrophobic handoff' (Wang2010Identification). The interaction between NPC2 and NPC1 is enhanced by the presence of cholesterol, which stabilizes the binding between NPC2 and NPC1's domain 2 (Deffieu2011Niemann–Pick). Specific mutations in NPC1, such as R518Q, can impair this cholesterol-dependent interaction, leading to cholesterol accumulation (Deffieu2011Niemann–Pick).

NPC2 also interacts with the middle lumenal domain (MLD) of NPC1, which is essential for cholesterol transfer. Mutations in the MLD can significantly decrease the binding affinity between NPC2 and NPC1, affecting cholesterol transport (Li2016Clues). Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have provided insights into the NPC1/NPC2 complex, supporting the 'hydrophobic handoff' model and highlighting the importance of low pH in facilitating cholesterol delivery (Qian2020Structural).

Additionally, NPC2 interacts with lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) within lysosomes, which is crucial for cholesterol efflux. This interaction is direct and involves the hydrophobic knob domain of NPC2 (McCauliff2019Intracellular).
