# CR1

## Overview
The CR1 gene encodes the complement C3b/C4b receptor 1, also known as the Knops blood group, which is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the regulators of complement activity (RCA) family. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the immune system by regulating the complement cascade, a crucial component of innate immunity. The CR1 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes multiple short consensus repeats (SCRs) that facilitate its interaction with complement components C3b and C4b, thereby aiding in the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. It is expressed on various cell types, including erythrocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells, where it contributes to processes such as phagocytosis and immune complex clearance. The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria, Alzheimer's disease, and leprosy, underscoring its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Krych‐Goldberg2001Structure–function; Panda2016CR1; Kucukkilic2018Complement; Liu2009The).

## Structure
The CR1 protein, also known as complement receptor type 1, is a type I membrane-bound glycoprotein that is part of the regulators of complement activity (RCA) family. It is composed of 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs), also known as complement-control-protein repeats (CCPs) or Sushi domains, each approximately 61 amino acids long. These domains are organized into four long homologous repeats (LHRs) labeled A to D, each containing seven SCRs (Liu2009The; Wong1989Structure). The primary structure of CR1 includes conserved cysteines and a tryptophan residue within each SCR (Liu2009The).

The secondary structure of CR1 is characterized by β-sheets and disulfide bonds, which contribute to the stability of the SCR domains (Liu2009The). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these SCR domains into LHRs, forming an elongated structure with two disulfide bonds at the ends (Liu2009The). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

CR1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Wong1989Structure).

## Function
Complement receptor type 1 (CR1), encoded by the CR1 gene, is a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the immune system. It is primarily involved in the regulation of the complement system, a key component of innate immunity. CR1 binds to complement fragments C3b and C4b with high affinity, facilitating the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells by transporting them to the liver and spleen for processing by macrophages (Krych‐Goldberg2001Structure–function; Liu2009The). 

CR1 exhibits decay-accelerating activity for C3 and C5 convertases, which helps in the regulation of complement activation and prevents damage to host tissues (Krych‐Goldberg2001Structure–function; Liu2009The). It also acts as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b, converting them into inactive forms that are less likely to trigger inflammation (Liu2009The). 

CR1 is expressed on various cell types, including erythrocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells, where it plays roles in phagocytosis, immune complex clearance, and modulation of B cell functions (Krych‐Goldberg2001Structure–function; Liu2009The). On B cells, CR1 is involved in inhibiting B cell receptor-induced functions, contributing to the regulation of immune responses (Erdei2021New).

## Clinical Significance
The CR1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in immune complex processing and complement regulation. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lower CR1 expression is associated with increased susceptibility, particularly in populations endemic to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This reduced expression is linked to specific CR1 polymorphisms, such as those in exon 22 and exon 33, which are more prevalent in SLE patients and may contribute to defective immune complex clearance (Panda2016CR1).

CR1 polymorphisms also influence susceptibility to malaria, with variations affecting erythrocyte rosetting and immune complex clearance, impacting the severity of Plasmodium falciparum infections (Khera2009Complement). In Alzheimer's disease, the CR1-B allele and SNP rs6656401 are associated with increased risk, potentially due to their effects on amyloid deposition and complement regulation (Kucukkilic2018Complement; Biffi2012Genetic).

CR1 is also linked to leprosy susceptibility, with certain haplotypes increasing risk. The rs3849266 and rs3737002 alleles are associated with higher susceptibility to multibacillary leprosy (Kretzschmar2018Complement). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in various immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
Complement receptor 1 (CR1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in the immune system. CR1 interacts with complement components C3b and C4b through its complement control protein (CCP) domains, facilitating the clearance of immune complexes and regulating complement activation (Jacquet2013Deciphering; SantosLópez2023Structural). CR1 has three main binding sites: Site 1 in CCPs 1-3 binds C4b, while Sites 2 and 3 in CCPs 8-10 and 15-17 bind both C3b and C4b, supporting factor I cofactor activity (SantosLópez2023Structural).

CR1 also interacts with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and L-ficolin, recognition proteins of the lectin complement pathway, through its CCP22-30 segment, particularly modules CCP24 and CCP25. This interaction involves ionic bonds between conserved lysine residues in the collagen stalks of MBL and acidic residues in CR1 (Jacquet2013Deciphering).

On erythrocytes, CR1 interacts with the scaffolding protein FAP-1, which links CR1 to the cytoskeleton. This interaction is mediated by PDZ motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of CR1 binding to PDZ domains of FAP-1, enhancing CR1's clustering and stability on the cell surface (Ghiran2008Ligation).
