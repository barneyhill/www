# TULP4

## Overview
TULP4, or Tubby Like Protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the tubby family of proteins, which are characterized by a distinctive carboxy-terminal tubby domain. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the protein's role in cellular processes such as ubiquitination. The TULP4 protein is implicated in cellular transport mechanisms, particularly in relation to ciliary function and signaling pathways, due to its association with the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A) protein subunit WDR35. TULP4 is evolutionarily conserved across various species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its interactions with components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes suggest a role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways. Despite its recognized importance, the specific substrates and detailed molecular functions of TULP4 remain to be fully elucidated (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

## Structure


## Function
TULP4 (TUB like protein 4) is a member of the tubby family of proteins, characterized by a carboxy-terminal tubby domain and a large amino terminus containing WD repeats and E3 ubiquitin ligase binding motifs. This structure suggests TULP4's involvement in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes, potentially acting as a bridge between specific substrates and components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (Mukhopadhyay2011The). 

TULP4 is related to the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A) protein subunit WDR35, indicating a possible role in cellular transport mechanisms, particularly in ciliary function or signaling pathways (Mukhopadhyay2011The). The protein's evolutionary conservation across species, including homologs in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, underscores its fundamental role in cellular processes (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

In terms of cellular localization, TULP4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Its specific molecular functions are linked to its structural motifs, although the exact substrates for its interactions remain unknown (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TULP4 gene have been implicated in various neurological and developmental conditions. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the circular RNA circTulp4, derived from the TULP4 gene, is downregulated in APP/PS1 mouse models of AD. This downregulation is associated with decreased neuronal differentiation, cell viability, and neurite growth, suggesting a potential role in AD pathogenesis (Ma2021RETRACTED:). The study indicates that circTulp4 may influence TULP4 expression, impacting nervous system functions and potentially serving as a biomarker or therapeutic target for AD (Ma2021RETRACTED:).

In velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), a chromosomal duplication at 6q25.3 involving TULP4 has been identified, which may contribute to developmental retardation and abnormal morphology, including craniofacial cleft and short stature (Wu2019Clinical). This suggests that TULP4 may play a role in the phenotypic manifestations of VCFS.

Although the study by Ma et al. was retracted, it initially proposed that circTulp4's regulation of TULP4 could influence Alzheimer's disease development, highlighting the need for further research into TULP4's role in neurodegenerative diseases (Ma2021RETRACTED:).

## Interactions
TULP4, a member of the tubby-like protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes. The carboxy-terminal tubby domain of TULP4 is known for its interactions with components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, specifically cullin 5 and elongins B and C. These interactions indicate a potential role for TULP4 in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways, although the specific substrates for these ligases remain unidentified (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

The amino terminus of TULP4 contains distinct domains, including a WD40 repeat region and a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) domain, which are involved in protein interactions (Mukhopadhyay2011The). TULP4's stability is regulated by acetylation and ubiquitination, with p300 and HDAC1 playing significant roles in this process. Acetylation by p300 increases TULP4 protein levels, while deacetylation by HDAC1 decreases them. This regulatory mechanism is conserved across tubby-like proteins, including TULP4 (Kerek2021A).

Additionally, TULP4 is associated with circTulp4, a circular RNA, which interacts with RNA polymerase II and U1 snRNP at the Tulp4 promoter region, suggesting a regulatory role in Tulp4 transcription (Ma2021RETRACTED:).
