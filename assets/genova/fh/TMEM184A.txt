# TMEM184A

## Overview
TMEM184A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 184A, which is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and vesicle trafficking. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM184A functions primarily as a heparin receptor, playing a pivotal role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis by modulating signaling pathways such as the MAPK pathway (Farwell2017Novel). The protein is expressed in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, where it influences cellular morphology and function through its interactions with heparan sulfate chains and growth factors (Field2022Involvement). Additionally, TMEM184A is implicated in testis differentiation, particularly in sex-specific signaling pathways within Sertoli cells, affecting germ cell fate (Svingen2009Ex). Its involvement in these diverse biological processes underscores its significance in both developmental and physiological contexts.

## Function
TMEM184A is a transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes, including angiogenesis and cellular signaling. It functions as a heparin receptor, playing a crucial role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In zebrafish models, TMEM184A is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, where it binds to heparin, inducing anti-proliferative signaling by activating DUSP1, which inactivates the MAPK pathway, leading to decreased cell proliferation (Farwell2017Novel). This protein is also involved in vesicle trafficking, influencing cellular morphology and function (Farwell2017Novel).

TMEM184A's interaction with heparan sulfate chains is significant for modulating the sequestration of growth factors and receptors, which is essential for proper angiogenesis. This interaction affects the modulation of VEGF and VEGFR interactions, impacting vessel permeability and cell survival (Farwell2017Novel). In zebrafish embryos, TMEM184A works synergistically with Vegfr2 to regulate the formation of intersegmental vessels, highlighting its role in vascular development (Field2022Involvement).

In the context of testis differentiation, TMEM184A is expressed in Sertoli cells and is implicated in sex-specific signaling pathways, influencing germ cell fate and preventing germ cells from entering meiosis (Svingen2009Ex).

## Interactions
TMEM184A is a transmembrane protein that functions as a heparin receptor and is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis. It is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, where it participates in anti-proliferative signaling by binding to heparin. This interaction induces the expression of DUSP1, leading to the inactivation of MAPK ERK1/2 and decreased cell proliferation (Farwell2017Novel). TMEM184A may also interact with heparan sulfate (HS) chains, which are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis through interactions with VEGF isoforms and their receptors. This interaction could stabilize proliferative signaling by sequestering growth factors and receptors (Farwell2017Novel).

In zebrafish embryos, TMEM184A is suggested to modulate angiogenesis through interactions with the Vegfr2 signaling pathway. Knockdown of TMEM184A results in increased endothelial cell proliferation but disrupts proper vessel organization, indicating that TMEM184A may modulate specific outcomes of Vegfr2 signaling (Field2022Involvement). The protein's interaction with heparin and its putative heparin binding domain are crucial for its function in angiogenesis, as increased expression of TMEM184A lacking the heparin binding domain results in a dominant negative effect on intersegmental vessel outgrowth (Field2022Involvement).
