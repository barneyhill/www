# OR2AE1

## Overview
The OR2AE1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily AE member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. The protein encoded by OR2AE1 is a transmembrane receptor that contributes to the complex process of olfactory signal transduction. Beyond its traditional role in olfaction, recent studies have highlighted the potential involvement of OR2AE1 in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may influence prognosis and therapy resistance (Xu2014Cancer; Ramesh2020Decoding). This dual role in sensory perception and disease pathogenesis underscores the multifaceted nature of OR2AE1, making it a subject of interest for further research in both sensory biology and clinical oncology.

## Clinical Significance
The OR2AE1 gene has been implicated in various cancer-related studies. In gastric cancer, OR2AE1 is part of a 9-gene signature used for cancer staging, which has shown high consistency with pathologist-determined stages, suggesting its potential role in refining cancer staging (Xu2014Cancer). In prostate cancer, mutations in OR2AE1 have been associated with therapy resistance, as observed in a rare subclone that expanded during treatment, indicating a possible link to poor survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients (Ramesh2020Decoding). 

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), OR2AE1 is identified as a protective factor for prognosis, with a hazard ratio less than 1, suggesting it may be associated with better outcomes in TNBC patients (Wang2022A). 

Additionally, OR2AE1 has been mentioned in studies related to endometriosis, although no specific diseases or conditions directly related to OR2AE1 mutations or expression alterations were discussed in this context (Golovchenko2022Sex). 

Overall, while OR2AE1 is primarily known for its role in olfactory function, emerging evidence suggests its involvement in cancer prognosis and therapy resistance, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
