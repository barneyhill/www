# QRFP

## Overview
The QRFP gene encodes the pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide, a neuropeptide involved in various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. This peptide functions as an endogenous ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR103, which is predominantly expressed in the hypothalamus and pancreatic islets, indicating its role in regulating feeding behavior and metabolic processes (Chartrel2016The; Prévost2019Neuropeptide). The QRFP protein, characterized by a pyroglutamylated N-terminus and a C-terminal RF-amide motif, interacts specifically with GPR103, facilitating its involvement in energy metabolism and appetite regulation (Iwama2024Structure). Additionally, QRFP's interaction with orexin/hypocretin receptors underscores its influence on feeding behavior, making it a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Cook2022The; Prévost2019Neuropeptide).

## Structure
The QRFP protein, also known as pyroglutamylated RF-amide peptide, is a 43-amino acid peptide hormone characterized by a pyroglutamylated N-terminus and a C-terminal RF-amide motif. This structure is crucial for its specific interaction with the GPR103 receptor, a class A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (Iwama2024Structure). The primary structure of QRFP includes a sequence that allows it to adopt an extended conformation without secondary structures, facilitating its interaction with the receptor (Iwama2023Structure).

The QRFP26, a truncated form of QRFP, retains similar agonist activity and is used in structural studies to understand its binding with GPR103. The C-terminal heptapeptide of QRFP26 fits vertically within the transmembrane domain of GPR103, interacting with transmembrane segments 2-7 and the extracellular loop 2 (Iwama2024Structure; Iwama2023Structure). The RF-amide motif is recognized by conserved residues in the receptor, highlighting a conserved recognition mechanism among RF-amide receptors (Iwama2023Structure).

Post-translational modifications of QRFP include pyroglutamylation, which is essential for its biological activity and receptor specificity (Iwama2024Structure). The structural dynamics of QRFP and its interaction with GPR103 are critical for understanding its role in physiological processes such as energy metabolism and appetite regulation (Iwama2024Structure).

## Function
The QRFP gene encodes the pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide, which plays a significant role in regulating energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism in healthy human cells. QRFP acts as an endogenous ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR103, primarily expressed in the hypothalamus and pancreatic islets, indicating its involvement in energy metabolism and feeding behavior (Chartrel2016The; Prévost2019Neuropeptide). 

QRFP influences glucose homeostasis by modulating insulin secretion and sensitivity. It reduces glucose-induced insulin release while enhancing insulin sensitivity, acting as an incretin to stimulate insulin release and potentiate insulin sensitivity in target tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue (Chartrel2016The; Prévost2019Neuropeptide). The neuropeptide is secreted by the gut in response to an oral glucose challenge, further supporting its role in glycemic regulation (Prévost2019Neuropeptide).

In the central nervous system, QRFP affects feeding behavior by interacting with the neuropeptide Y (NPY)/proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, promoting food intake through increased NPY expression and release (Chartrel2016The). QRFP's activity in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes (Prévost2019Neuropeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the QRFP gene, which encodes the neuropeptide 26RFa, have been implicated in several metabolic disorders. In particular, QRFP is a key regulator of glucose homeostasis, and its dysfunction may contribute to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies have shown that 26RFa deficiency in mice leads to impaired glucose regulation, characterized by a more sustained hyperglycemic peak during glucose tolerance tests and a lower rise in plasma insulin levels, suggesting a defect in insulin secretion (ElMehdi2020Glucose). In obese and hyperglycemic mice, the antihyperglycemic and insulinotropic effects of 26RFa are diminished, which is associated with a downregulation of its receptor, GPR103, in pancreatic islets and insulin target tissues (Prévost2019Neuropeptide).

The expression of 26RFa is significantly lower in the duodenum of mice fed a high-fat diet, and its plasma levels rise significantly during glucose tolerance tests in these mice, indicating a potential role in the development and maintenance of obesity (Prévost2019Neuropeptide). These findings suggest that the QRFP/26RFa system could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders such as obesity and T2DM.

## Interactions
QRFP, or pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide, interacts primarily with its receptor, GPR103, a class A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of various physiological functions, including energy metabolism and appetite. QRFP binds to both the extracellular domain (ECD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) of GPR103, with the C-terminal heptapeptide forming an extensive interaction network with transmembrane segments 2-7 and extracellular loop 2 (Iwama2024Structure; Iwama2023Structure). The C-terminal amidation of QRFP enhances charge complementarity with the receptor pocket, facilitating high-affinity binding and receptor specificity (Iwama2024Structure).

QRFP also interacts with orexin/hypocretin receptors, influencing feeding behavior. The effects of QRFP on food intake can be blocked by orexin receptor antagonism, indicating that QRFP's role in consummatory behavior is dependent on orexin/hypocretin receptor signaling (Cook2022The). In prostate cancer, QRFP activates several signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and Akt, which are involved in cell survival, proliferation, and migration. These interactions suggest a role for QRFP in cancer progression through these pathways (Kawan2018Involvement).
