# ZNF44

## Overview
ZNF44 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 44, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's function as they facilitate DNA binding, allowing ZNF44 to play a role in transcriptional regulation (Schmidt2004Adaptive; Bray1991Characterization). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of gene expression, and has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence cancer progression and phenotype (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa). ZNF44 is located on chromosome 16p11 and may undergo post-translational modifications that affect its function, although specific modifications have not been detailed (Bray1991Characterization). The study of ZNF44 is significant for understanding its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its implications in therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF44, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein family, plays a significant role in cancer biology. Alterations in the expression of ZNF44, potentially driven by human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), have been linked to cancer progression. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, HERVs can enhance the promoter activities of ZNF44, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation that may affect cancer phenotypes and progression (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa). The upregulation of ZNF44, along with other KRAB zinc-finger proteins, is associated with better disease conditions in various cancers, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive effect (Ito2020Endogenousa).

The study of ZNF44 in the context of cancer suggests that its expression is critical for suppressing cancer cell viability, as evidenced by CRISPR loss-of-function screening data (Ito2020Endogenousa). This implies that ZNF44 may play a role in modulating tumor suppressive pathways, potentially impacting cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. While the clinical significance of ZNF44 in other diseases is not explicitly detailed, its involvement in cancer highlights its importance in disease modulation and potential as a therapeutic target.
