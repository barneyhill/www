# ERBB2

## Overview
ERBB2, also known as HER2, is a gene that encodes the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. This protein is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase characterized by its extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular kinase domain. Unlike other EGFR family members, ERBB2 does not have a known direct ligand and is often found in a constitutively active conformation, which facilitates its role as a coreceptor. It primarily functions by forming heterodimers with other ErbB family receptors, such as ErbB3 and ErbB4, enhancing the activation of downstream signaling pathways critical for cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Roskoski2004The; Burgess2003An). The protein's overexpression or mutation is implicated in various cancers, making it a significant target for cancer therapies (Chmielecki2014Oncogenic; HerterSprie2013Activating).

## Structure
The ERBB2 protein, also known as HER2, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and is characterized by its unique structural features. It consists of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular region is composed of four domains: two large homologous domains (L1 and L2) and two cysteine-rich domains (CR1 and CR2), arranged in the order L1-CR1-L2-CR2 (FrancoGonzalez2012Conformational; Burgess2003An). 

ERBB2 is distinct in that it does not have a known direct ligand and is often in a constitutively extended conformation, resembling the ligand-bound state of other EGFR family members (Roskoski2004The; Burgess2003An). This configuration allows ERBB2 to readily form heterodimers with other ErbB receptors, particularly ErbB3, which is crucial for its signaling role (Roskoski2014The; Roskoski2004The).

The protein is heavily glycosylated, contributing significantly to its molecular mass (Burgess2003An). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are also common, playing a key role in its activation and signaling functions (Roskoski2014The). The transmembrane domain of ERBB2 forms a right-handed α-helical bundle, which is important for its dimerization and activation (Mineev2010Spatial).

## Function
The ERBB2 gene, also known as erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, encodes a protein that is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling processes that regulate cell differentiation, migration, and survival. ERBB2 is unique in that it does not bind directly to any known ligands but functions primarily as a coreceptor, forming heterodimers with other EGFR family members such as erbB3 and erbB4. This dimerization enhances ligand binding affinity and prolongs the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are essential for cell growth and survival (SanchezSoria2010ErbB; Negro2004Essential).

In cardiac myocytes, ERBB2 is involved in the neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cardiomyocyte survival and function. This pathway activates PI3K and AKT, protecting cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and promoting protein synthesis and hypertrophy through the mTOR pathway (SanchezSoria2010ErbB). ERBB2 is also implicated in the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, associated with cellular proliferation and hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes (SanchezSoria2010ErbB). The protein is localized to the T-tubule system in the heart, facilitating its role in maintaining cardiac function (Özcelik2002Conditional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ERBB2 gene, also known as HER2, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. ERBB2 is frequently amplified or overexpressed in breast cancer, where it is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis. This overexpression is linked to larger tumor size, lymph node involvement, and resistance to certain therapies, such as anti-estrogen treatments (Révillion1998ERBB2; Yarden2001Untangling). In breast cancer, ERBB2 positivity is more common in ductal carcinomas and is associated with higher histological grades and increased cellular proliferation (Révillion1998ERBB2).

ERBB2 alterations are also prevalent in gastric and gastroesophageal cancers, leading to the development of targeted therapies like trastuzumab and lapatinib (Chmielecki2014Oncogenic). Beyond these cancers, ERBB2 mutations and amplifications have been identified in a wide range of tumors, including lung, colorectal, ovarian, and bladder cancers (HerterSprie2013Activating). These mutations often occur in the extracellular and kinase domains, contributing to oncogenic signaling and tumor progression (Chmielecki2014Oncogenic).

ERBB2 mutations are often mutually exclusive with other oncogenic alterations, such as those in KRAS and EGFR, indicating distinct pathways of tumorigenesis (HerterSprie2013Activating). The presence of ERBB2 mutations can influence treatment decisions, as they may confer sensitivity or resistance to specific targeted therapies (HerterSprie2013Activating).

## Interactions
ERBB2, also known as HER2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that forms heterodimers with other members of the ErbB receptor family, such as EGFR (ErbB-1), ErbB-3, and ErbB-4. These interactions enhance signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, by increasing the phosphorylation and activation of the partner receptors (GrausPorta1997ErbB2). ERBB2 is a preferred heterodimerization partner, which is crucial for effective signaling and the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules (GrausPorta1997ErbB2).

ERBB2 interacts with various adaptor proteins, such as GRB2 and SHC, which are involved in RTK signaling pathways (Croucher2016Bimolecular). The ERBB2:ERBB3 heterodimer is particularly noted for its potent transforming capacity and unique binding partners, including FAM59A, which is involved in a noncanonical mechanism of ERK activation (Croucher2016Bimolecular). ERBB2 also interacts with ERBIN, a PDZ protein that helps localize ERBB2 to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, ensuring proper receptor function (Borg2000ERBIN:).

In cancer, ERBB2 overexpression leads to increased heterodimerization with other ErbB receptors, contributing to aggressive tumor behavior and therapeutic resistance (Spears2011In).
