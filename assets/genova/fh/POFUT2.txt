# POFUT2

## Overview
Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) is a gene that encodes an enzyme belonging to the glycosyltransferase family, specifically involved in the O-fucosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) in proteins. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification process, which is essential for the proper folding, secretion, and function of proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell signaling (Chen2012Structure; Holdener2019Protein). The POFUT2 enzyme is characterized by a GT-B fold structure, which facilitates its specific interaction with TSRs based on their three-dimensional conformation rather than their primary sequence (Chen2012Structure). The activity of POFUT2 is vital during embryonic development, influencing processes such as gastrulation through its impact on proteins like ADAMTS9 (Benz2016Genetic). Mutations in the POFUT2 gene are linked to developmental disorders, including Peters Plus Syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue functions (Vasudevan2015Peters).

## Structure
The human protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) is characterized by a GT-B fold, which is typical of glycosyltransferases and consists of two Rossmann-like domains with a β/α/β topology (Chen2012Structure). The N-terminal domain spans residues 22-242, while the C-terminal domain includes residues 243-429, forming an extended protein unit with a large central cavity (Chen2012Structure). This structure is crucial for its function in O-fucosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) (Chen2012Structure).

The crystal structure of POFUT2 was determined at a resolution of 3.0 Å and crystallized in space group P3 2 21, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, indicating a quaternary structure as a crystallographic dimer (Chen2012Structure). The GDP-fucose binding site is located in a narrow cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains, with the guanine purine base stabilized by stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds (Chen2012Structure).

POFUT2 contains fully structured loops and disulfide bonds that stabilize its conformation, and it has three N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties at specific residues, indicating occupied N-glycosylation sites (Chen2012Structure). The enzyme is specific for TSR modules due to critical 3D elements required for binding, which are absent in EGF repeats (Chen2012Structure).

## Function
Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-linked fucose to thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) in proteins. This post-translational modification occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is crucial for the proper folding and function of these proteins (Chen2012Structure; Holdener2019Protein). POFUT2 specifically recognizes and modifies TSRs based on their three-dimensional structure rather than their sequence, ensuring substrate specificity (Chen2012Structure).

The fucosylation by POFUT2 is essential for the secretion and stability of proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell signaling, such as members of the ADAMTS family of extracellular proteases (Holdener2019Protein; Schneider2017Biological). This modification is also important for the proper function of proteins like CCN1 and ADAMTS13, which play roles in angiogenesis, inflammation, and other cellular processes (Schneider2017Biological).

POFUT2's activity is critical during embryonic development, particularly in processes like gastrulation, where it affects the secretion and function of key proteins such as ADAMTS9 (Benz2016Genetic). The enzyme's role in modifying ECM-related proteins is vital for maintaining normal cellular processes and tissue organization (Holdener2019Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POFUT2 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, most notably Peters Plus Syndrome (PPS). PPS is characterized by a range of congenital abnormalities, including eye development defects, facial dysmorphia, short stature, and limb shortening. These symptoms are linked to secretion defects in a subset of proteins that require POFUT2 for proper folding and stability, particularly those with thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) (Vasudevan2015Peters; Holdener2019ADAMTS9).

In mouse models, POFUT2 mutations lead to severe gastrulation defects due to impaired secretion of ADAMTS9, a protein crucial for extracellular matrix organization. This results in developmental abnormalities such as disorganized tissues and lack of mesoderm, which are critical for normal embryonic development (Benz2016Genetic). The loss of ADAMTS9 function due to POFUT2 mutations disrupts tissue organization and differentiation during gastrulation (Benz2016Genetic).

The severity of PPS is less than that of a Pofut2-null phenotype, suggesting that only a subset of POFUT2 targets are involved in PPS pathology (Vasudevan2015Peters). This indicates that POFUT2 plays a critical role in maintaining proper protein folding and secretion, with its dysfunction leading to significant developmental disorders.

## Interactions
POFUT2 is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the O-fucosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) in various proteins. This post-translational modification is essential for the proper folding, secretion, and function of these proteins. POFUT2 specifically interacts with properly folded TSRs, recognizing their 3D structural elements rather than their primary sequence. Key interactions involve the recognition of disulfide patterns and sidechain stacking within the TSRs, which are crucial for efficient fucosylation (Chen2012Structure).

POFUT2 is involved in the secretion of ADAMTS9, a protein critical for normal gastrulation. The enzyme's interaction with ADAMTS9 is necessary for its secretion, as demonstrated by studies showing that ADAMTS9 is not secreted in the absence of POFUT2, despite being present in the cell lysate. This indicates that O-fucosylation by POFUT2 is essential for ADAMTS9's proper secretion and function (Benz2016Genetic).

In Toxoplasma gondii, POFUT2 is responsible for the O-fucosylation of microneme protein 2 (MIC2), which is crucial for its proper folding and localization. The absence of POFUT2 leads to misfolding and accumulation of MIC2 in the secretory pathway, affecting the parasite's ability to invade host cells (Bandini2019OFucosylation).
