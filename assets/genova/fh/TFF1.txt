# TFF1

## Overview
TFF1, or trefoil factor 1, is a gene that encodes a small, secreted protein known as trefoil factor 1, which is characterized by a single trefoil domain. This protein is part of the trefoil factor family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa. Trefoil factor 1 is primarily involved in mucosal protection and repair, exhibiting properties that enhance epithelial cell migration and inhibit apoptosis, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the epithelial barrier (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure). The protein is secreted by surface mucous cells in the stomach and is known for its ability to form monomeric, homodimeric, and heterodimeric structures, which are essential for its diverse biological functions (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure). TFF1's interactions with other proteins, such as gastrokine 2 and IgG Fc binding protein, further underscore its role in mucosal defense and immune response (Hoffmann2022SelfRenewal; Hoffmann2020Trefoil). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with gastric cancer, where its loss or reduced expression is linked to tumorigenesis, positioning TFF1 as a potential tumor suppressor (Carvalho2002Loss; Soutto2011Loss).

## Structure
TFF1 (trefoil factor 1) is a secreted protein characterized by a single trefoil domain, which includes a conserved cysteine-rich motif essential for its structural stability. The primary structure of TFF1 consists of 60 amino acids, including seven cysteine residues, with Cys VII located outside the conserved domain (Hoffmann2021Trefoila; Hoffmann2020Trefoil). The secondary structure is defined by a three-looped configuration stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds, forming a compact and stable fold (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure).

The tertiary structure of TFF1 has been elucidated using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, revealing a pronounced groove between the second and third loops, which may serve as a binding site for oligosaccharides or aromatic amino acid side chains (Hoffmann2021Trefoila). The quaternary structure of TFF1 includes its ability to exist in monomeric, homodimeric, and heterodimeric forms, with the homodimeric form often exhibiting greater biological activity (Hoffmann2020Trefoil; Braga2020Structure).

TFF1 can form disulfide-linked heterodimers with proteins such as gastrokine 2 (GKN2) and IgG Fc binding protein (FCGBP), contributing to its diverse functional roles in mucosal protection and immune defense (Hoffmann2022SelfRenewal; Hoffmann2020Trefoil). The presence of a free thiol group at Cys VII, masked by flanking acidic residues, allows TFF1 to be secreted as a monomer and participate in extracellular scavenging of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (Hoffmann2021Trefoil; Hoffmann2020Trefoil).

## Function
TFF1 (Trefoil Factor 1) is a protein primarily involved in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa. It is secreted by surface mucous cells in the stomach and plays a crucial role in mucosal protection and repair. TFF1 is predominantly found in a monomeric form with a unique free thiol group, which is highly reactive and acts as a scavenger for extracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, protecting the gastric surface from oxidative stress (Hoffmann2021Trefoila; Hoffmann2020Trefoil).

TFF1 is involved in epithelial repair by enhancing cell migration and inhibiting apoptosis, which is essential for maintaining the epithelial barrier function (Braga2020Structure). It modulates cell junctional complexes, contributing to the sealing of the paracellular space between cells (Braga2020Structure). TFF1 also plays a role in cell differentiation by delaying the G1-S phase transition and reducing apoptosis through the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and caspase activity (BossenmeyerPourié2002The).

In the context of Helicobacter pylori infection, TFF1 interacts with the bacteria, enabling its attachment to the gastric mucosa, while also suppressing H. pylori-induced inflammation and carcinogenesis (Braga2020Structure). The absence of TFF1 leads to the development of gastric carcinomas, highlighting its protective role in the gastric epithelium (Braga2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TFF1 gene are significantly associated with gastric cancer. TFF1 is often considered a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss or reduced expression is linked to the development and progression of gastric carcinoma. In gastric cancer, TFF1 expression is frequently lost due to mechanisms such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and promoter methylation, rather than mutations, which are rare (Carvalho2002Loss; Soutto2011Loss). The absence of TFF1 expression is observed in 40-60% of gastric carcinomas, and this loss is associated with increased activation of oncogenic pathways, including NF-κB and STAT3, which promote inflammation and tumorigenesis (Soutto2019Activation; Soutto2011Loss).

TFF1 mutations, although infrequent, have been identified in gastric adenomas and carcinomas, suggesting a potential role in impairing TFF1's biological function (Park2000Somatic). The gene's location on chromosome 21q22.3, a region commonly deleted in gastric cancer, further supports its role as a tumor suppressor (Park2000Somatic). TFF1's interaction with inflammatory pathways, particularly its ability to modulate NF-κB and STAT3 signaling, underscores its clinical significance in gastric cancer pathogenesis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Soutto2019Activation; Soutto2011Loss).

## Interactions
TFF1 (trefoil factor 1) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in gastric mucosal protection and repair. TFF1 forms a heterodimer with TFIZ1, a protein containing a BRICHOS domain, which is significant for its function as a gastric tumor suppressor (Westley2005Interaction). It also interacts with GKN2, forming a heterodimeric complex that exhibits synergistic antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on gastric cancer cells (Kim2017Heterodimeric). This interaction is crucial for inhibiting cell viability and proliferation, as well as inducing apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (Kim2017Heterodimeric).

TFF1 is involved in the gastric mucus barrier, where it forms a heterodimer with FCGBP, a protein associated with mucosal immune defense, suggesting a role in pathogen attachment and disease progression (Heuer2020The). TFF1 also interacts with mucins, specifically binding to MUC6, which may contribute to stabilizing the gastric mucus barrier (Heuer2020The). Additionally, TFF1 interacts with Helicobacter pylori, potentially aiding in the localization of the bacteria within the gastric mucus layer, which may influence the inflammatory response (Clyne2019The). These interactions highlight TFF1's multifaceted role in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity and its potential implications in gastric pathologies.
