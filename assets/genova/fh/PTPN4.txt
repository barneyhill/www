# PTPN4

## Overview
PTPN4 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 4, a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, and motility. The protein is characterized by its modular structure, comprising an N-terminal FERM domain, a central PDZ domain, and a C-terminal catalytic phosphatase domain, which collectively facilitate its localization and function within the cell (CailletSaguy2017Regulation; Chmielewska2021PTPN4). PTPN4 is widely expressed in human tissues and plays a critical role in dephosphorylating specific substrates, thereby modulating their activity and influencing pathways such as T cell receptor signaling and cell cycle regulation (Zhang2019Loss; Young2008The). Mutations in the PTPN4 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2020The; Chmielewska2021PTPN4).

## Structure
PTPN4 is a large modular protein consisting of 926 amino acids, localized in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (Chmielewska2021PTPN4). It comprises several domains: an N-terminal FERM domain, a central PDZ domain, and a C-terminal catalytic tyrosine phosphatase domain (CailletSaguy2017Regulation; Chmielewska2021PTPN4). The FERM domain anchors the protein to the plasma membrane, and its suppression results in the phosphatase being exclusively cytoplasmic (Chmielewska2021PTPN4). The PDZ domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the phosphatase domain is responsible for substrate dephosphorylation (CailletSaguy2017Regulation; Chmielewska2021PTPN4).

The inter-domain linker connecting the PDZ and phosphatase domains is flexible and predominantly disordered, with a predicted helix downstream of the PDZ domain (CailletSaguy2017Regulation). This linker plays a crucial role in the regulation of PTPN4's phosphatase activity through a mechanism of auto-inhibition (CailletSaguy2017Regulation). PTPN4 also contains proline-rich sequences that can bind to SH3 domains of signaling proteins, facilitating interactions with proteins like CrkI (Zhou2013PTPN4).

PTPN4 is activated through proteolysis by calpain, resulting in an active form that includes the PDZ and PTP domains (Chmielewska2021PTPN4). Variants in PTPN4, including truncations and missense variants, have been identified, some of which are located in the FERM, PDZ, and phosphatase domains (Chmielewska2021PTPN4).

## Function
PTPN4 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, motility, and signal transduction. It is widely expressed in human cells and plays a critical role in dephosphorylating specific proteins, thereby modulating their activity. PTPN4 interacts with proteins such as CrkI, negatively regulating CrkI-mediated cell proliferation and motility by dephosphorylating it. Overexpression of PTPN4 inhibits CrkI-mediated proliferation and wound healing, while its knockdown enhances these processes (Zhou2013PTPN4).

In T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, PTPN4 dephosphorylates the ITAM motif of the TCR ζ subunit, which negatively regulates NF-κB and AP-1 activation, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses (Young2008The). Despite its involvement in TCR signaling, PTPN4 is not essential for T cell development or effector functions, as evidenced by studies on PTPN4-deficient mice (Young2008The).

PTPN4 also influences the cell cycle by affecting the phosphorylation of proteins like STAT3 and Erk1/2, which are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation (Zhang2019Loss). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and cytomembrane, where it interacts with its substrates to exert its regulatory functions (Zhang2019Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTPN4 gene have been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and growth anomalies. Individuals with rare, heterozygous variants in PTPN4 often exhibit neurodevelopmental deficits, growth abnormalities, seizures, structural central nervous system anomalies, gait abnormalities, congenital heart defects, dermatological manifestations, and spinal and vertebral defects. These mutations are primarily de novo and are not found in major genetic databases, indicating their rarity and potential pathogenicity (Chmielewska2021PTPN4).

Specific cases have highlighted the diverse clinical manifestations associated with PTPN4 mutations. For example, an 11-year-old male with a c.715G>A mutation exhibited severe developmental delay, autism, and overgrowth, while a 23-month-old male with a c.191T>G mutation showed developmental delays and growth deficiency (Chmielewska2021PTPN4). The PTPN4 gene is also implicated in Rett syndrome-like features, characterized by language and hand skill impairments, gait abnormalities, and stereotypic hand movements (Hendriks2023Hereditable).

Alterations in PTPN4 expression have been observed in certain cancers, such as esophageal carcinoma, where its expression is statistically higher compared to normal tissues (Chen2020The). These findings underscore the gene's role in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
PTPN4, a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38γ, which binds with high affinity to PTPN4's PDZ domain, playing a role in inducing cell death by disrupting the PDZ domain's inhibition of phosphatase activity (CailletSaguy2017Regulation). PTPN4 also interacts with the oncoprotein CrkI, where the SH3 domain of CrkI binds to the proline-rich region of PTPN4. This interaction negatively regulates CrkI-mediated cell proliferation and motility by reducing CrkI phosphorylation levels (Zhou2013PTPN4).

In the context of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, PTPN4 dephosphorylates the ITAMs of the TCR ζ subunit, thereby regulating pathways such as NF-κB and AP-1. This interaction suggests a role in modulating immune responses, although PTPN4 is dispensable for T cell development due to potential redundancy with other phosphatases (Young2008The). PTPN4 also interacts with STAT3, specifically dephosphorylating it at Tyr705, which is crucial for suppressing STAT3's transcriptional activity and is linked to its tumor suppressor function in colorectal cancer (Zhang2019Loss).
