# TP53TG3D

## Overview
TP53TG3D is a gene that encodes the protein TP53 target 3D, which is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer progression and genetic selection. The protein is categorized as a target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. TP53 target 3D is implicated in the modulation of cellular responses to stress and DNA damage, contributing to its significance in oncological research. Alterations in the expression of TP53TG3D have been associated with increased risk and progression of colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Willems2023Using). Additionally, the gene is located in a genomic region that has undergone positive selection in certain populations, suggesting a role in cognitive and neuropsychological phenotypes (Khan2022Crosscontinental). Further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which TP53TG3D influences these diverse biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
TP53TG3D has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cancer progression and genetic selection. In colorectal cancer, TP53TG3D is identified as a top risk-increasing gene, with significant hazard ratios indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Willems2023Using). This suggests that alterations in TP53TG3D expression may contribute to the aggressiveness and poor prognosis of colorectal cancer.

In the context of genetic selection, TP53TG3D is associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome and is located in a genomic region with a high Population Branch Statistic (PBS) score, indicating positive selection in the Kho population from northwest Pakistan (Khan2022Crosscontinental). This association suggests that TP53TG3D may play a role in cognitive and neuropsychological phenotypes, although the specific clinical significance of mutations or expression changes in this context is not detailed (Khan2022Crosscontinental).

Overall, TP53TG3D's involvement in cancer and genetic selection highlights its potential clinical significance, particularly in colorectal cancer and genetic disorders, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and implications in these conditions.
