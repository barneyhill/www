# SPCS3

## Overview
SPCS3 is a gene that encodes the signal peptidase complex subunit 3, a non-catalytic component of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. The protein plays a crucial role in the maturation of ER-targeted and secretory proteins by facilitating the cleavage of signal sequences, a process essential for proper protein folding and cellular function (Zanotti2022The). Although SPCS3 itself does not possess enzymatic activity, it is integral to maintaining the structural integrity of the SPC's catalytic domain, thereby supporting the complex's overall function (Zanotti2022The). Additionally, SPCS3 is implicated in the quality control of membrane proteins, preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins and contributing to cellular homeostasis (Zanotti2022The).

## Function
SPCS3 is a subunit of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. The SPC is responsible for cleaving signal sequences from ER-targeted and secretory proteins, a crucial step in protein maturation and proper cellular function (Zanotti2022The). SPCS3, although not possessing catalytic activity, is essential for the SPC's function and cell growth. It plays a critical role in maintaining the structure of the catalytic domain, which is necessary for the SPC's activity (Zanotti2022The).

SPCS3 is part of the catalytic core of the SPC, working alongside SEC11A, and is involved in the SPC's function, including its hijacking by certain viruses for polyprotein cleavage (Zanotti2022The). The SPC's activity is not limited to signal sequence removal; accessory subunits like SPCS3 may have additional roles in substrate recognition, indicating a broader function in protein processing and quality control within the ER (Zanotti2022The). The SPC, with SPCS3 as a component, also contributes to the quality control of membrane proteins, ensuring proper protein folding and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to cellular stress (Zanotti2022The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SPCS3 is a subunit of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is involved in cleaving signal sequences from proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Within the SPC, SPCS3 interacts with other subunits, including SEC11A and SEC11C, forming part of the catalytic core essential for the complex's activity. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human SPC has revealed that SEC11A and SPCS3 form the catalytic core, highlighting the importance of SPCS3 in maintaining the structural integrity and catalytic function of the SPC (Zanotti2022The).

SPCS3 is also involved in the cleavage of noncanonical substrates, affecting the processing of these substrates to varying extents. While specific interactions of SPCS3 with other proteins or subunits are not detailed, its role in the SPC's function is emphasized, particularly in the context of membrane protein quality control (Zanotti2022The). Despite the lack of detailed interaction data, SPCS3's involvement in the SPC suggests it may engage transiently with substrates and regulatory proteins involved in protein processing, contributing to the complex's overall function in protein maturation and quality control.
