# CD46

## Overview
CD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein (MCP), is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, a crucial component of the innate immune response. The CD46 protein is characterized by its four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which facilitate its role as a cofactor for the serine protease factor I, aiding in the inactivation of complement components C3b and C4b on host cells (Cardone2011CD46; Aitkenhead2023Structure). This function is vital for preventing the immune system from targeting the body's own cells, thereby maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune damage (Liszewski2015Complement). CD46 is ubiquitously expressed on all nucleated cells and is involved in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses, including the regulation of T cells and the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Liszewski2005Emerging). Beyond its immune regulatory roles, CD46 is implicated in reproductive processes and serves as a receptor for various pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, which exploit its complement regulatory activities (Persson2010Structure).

## Structure
The CD46 protein, also known as membrane cofactor protein (MCP), is a type I transmembrane protein involved in complement regulation. It is composed of four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, each approximately 60 amino acids long, forming a central beta-barrel structure surrounded by flexible loops (Aitkenhead2023Structure; Casasnovas1999Crystal). The SCR domains are arranged in a linear fashion for SCR1 to SCR3, with SCR4 deviating to create a 'hockey stick' shape (Persson2010Structure). The interdomain interfaces, particularly between SCR3 and SCR4, are characterized by a large buried surface area and a significant kink, attributed to a proline-rich loop in SCR3 (Persson2010Structure).

CD46 is heavily glycosylated, with N-linked glycans at Asn49, Asn80, and Asn239, which likely shield the protein's concave side (Persson2010Structure). The glycosylation sites are conserved across species (Aitkenhead2023Structure). The protein also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that vary in the serine, threonine, and proline-rich (STP) region and the cytoplasmic tail (Persson2010Structure). These structural features and post-translational modifications suggest roles in protein interactions and orientation at the cell surface (Persson2010Structure).

## Function
CD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein (MCP), is a crucial component of the complement system, which is part of the innate immune response. It functions primarily as a cofactor for the serine protease factor I, facilitating the inactivation of complement components C3b and C4b deposited on host cells. This inactivation is essential to prevent the complement system from attacking the body's own cells, thereby maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune damage (Cardone2011CD46; Liszewski2015Complement).

CD46 is ubiquitously expressed on all nucleated cells and is involved in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. It plays a significant role in the regulation of T cells, particularly in the activation and generation of IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are important for immunosuppression and maintaining immune homeostasis (Liszewski2005Emerging; Cardone2011CD46).

Beyond its role in immune regulation, CD46 is involved in reproductive processes, such as protecting placental tissue and potentially playing a role in spermatozoa function (Liszewski2005Emerging). It also serves as a receptor for various pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, which exploit its complement regulatory activities (Persson2010Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD46 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to its role in immune regulation. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a significant condition linked to CD46 mutations, characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy resulting from uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway. These mutations account for 5-20% of aHUS cases, with clinical penetrance influenced by factors such as inflammation and pregnancy (Meyer2023Immunologic; Liszewski2015Complement). CD46 mutations are also implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), common variable immunodeficiency-like antibody deficiency, and pregnancy-related preeclampsia (Meyer2023Immunologic).

Alterations in CD46 expression or function can lead to immune dysregulation, as seen in increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and decreased IL-10 secretion in T cells of mutation carriers (Meyer2023Immunologic). These mutations can also affect mitochondrial function and respiration in T cells, contributing to immune-related conditions (Meyer2023Immunologic). Additionally, CD46 mutations have been linked to systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its broad impact on immune-related diseases (Liszewski2021Membrane). The presence of additional rare immune-related gene variants may further influence clinical outcomes in individuals with CD46 mutations (Meyer2023Immunologic).

## Interactions
CD46, also known as membrane cofactor protein (MCP), is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in immune regulation and pathogen recognition. CD46 interacts with complement proteins C3b and C4b, serving as a cofactor for their cleavage and preventing complement-mediated cell lysis. These interactions primarily involve the SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4 domains of CD46, with distinct but overlapping binding sites for C3b and C4b (Persson2010Structure).

CD46 also acts as a receptor for several pathogens. It interacts with viral proteins such as the adenovirus fiber knob and measles virus hemagglutinin, which bind to the SCR1 and SCR2 domains (Persson2010Structure). The glycoprotein H (gH) of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) specifically binds to the SCR2 and SCR3 domains of CD46, facilitating viral entry and cell fusion (Santoro2003Interaction).

Additionally, CD46 interacts with the Notch ligand Jagged1, which binds to the CCP1 and CCP2 domains. This interaction is crucial for T helper 1 (TH1) cell immunity and involves a distinct binding site from those used by complement proteins and viral ligands (Le2012The).
