# ZNF483

## Overview
ZNF483 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 483, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and the regulation of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) localization. ZNF483 is involved in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of human pluripotent stem cell self-renewal and the modulation of protein localization through its nuclear localization and export signals. Its interaction with MeCP2, a protein associated with Rett syndrome, underscores its significance in neuronal differentiation and potential therapeutic implications for neurodevelopmental disorders (Yasui2021Zinc).

## Function
ZNF483, or zinc finger protein 483, is a transcription factor involved in regulating neuronal differentiation and the subcellular localization of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). ZNF483 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger motifs. It possesses nuclear localization and export signals, allowing it to modulate the localization of other proteins, such as MeCP2, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation (Yasui2021Zinc).

ZNF483 plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation. Knockdown of ZNF483 results in decreased expression of stem cell markers and reduced NeuN expression, indicating its function as a neuronal differentiation accelerator (Yasui2021Zinc). The protein's interaction with MeCP2 is particularly important, as it can induce the cytosolic translocation of MeCP2, which is associated with changes in its phosphorylation patterns. This suggests that ZNF483 may act as a negative regulator of nuclear MeCP2 localization, potentially influencing gene expression during differentiation (Yasui2021Zinc).

ZNF483 is also involved in maintaining the self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells by interacting with tripartite motif protein 28 (TRIM28), highlighting its broader role in cellular processes beyond neuronal differentiation (Yasui2021Zinc).

## Interactions
ZNF483, or zinc finger protein 483, interacts with methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein associated with Rett syndrome. This interaction is significant in the context of neuronal differentiation. ZNF483 has been identified as a MeCP2-binding protein, and it plays a role in regulating the subcellular localization of MeCP2. Specifically, ZNF483 induces the cytosolic translocation of MeCP2, which is typically localized in the nucleus to regulate transcription. This translocation may be influenced by the phosphorylation of MeCP2, although the study did not find significant changes at the Ser-80 phosphorylation site, suggesting other sites might be involved (Yasui2021Zinc).

ZNF483 is also involved in maintaining the self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells and positively regulates cell growth and neuronal differentiation. The absence of ZNF483 in knockout cell lines resulted in decreased cell proliferation and altered expression of neuronal markers, indicating its role in these processes (Yasui2021Zinc). The interaction between ZNF483 and MeCP2 provides insights into the regulation of neuronal differentiation and the subcellular localization of MeCP2, highlighting the potential therapeutic implications for disorders like Rett syndrome (Yasui2021Zinc).
