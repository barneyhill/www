# CRYBA4

## Overview
The CRYBA4 gene encodes the protein crystallin beta A4, a member of the beta-crystallin family, which is integral to the structural composition of the eye lens. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a pivotal role in maintaining lens transparency and refractive properties by forming dimers and higher-order oligomers essential for lens stability (Wang2020In; Billingsley2006CRYBA4). Crystallin beta A4 is predominantly expressed in lens fiber cells, where it contributes to the high refractive index necessary for proper lens function (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). The protein's high conservation across species underscores its critical role in lens biology (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). Mutations in the CRYBA4 gene can lead to congenital cataracts and other ocular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in eye development and function (Wang2020In).

## Structure


## Function
The CRYBA4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the beta-crystallin family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the transparency and refractive index of the lens in the human eye. These proteins are major structural components of the lens, forming dimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers, which are essential for lens stability and function (Wang2020In; Billingsley2006CRYBA4). CRYBA4 is specifically expressed in lens fiber cells, where it contributes to the high refractive index and transparency required for proper lens function (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). 

The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in lens biology (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). In healthy human cells, CRYBA4 is involved in the regulation and differentiation of lens proteins, ensuring they maintain their correct conformation, which is vital for lens transparency (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). The expression of CRYBA4 is higher in neonatal lenses compared to adult lenses, highlighting its significant role during early eye development (Wang2020In). Mutations in CRYBA4 can disrupt these processes, leading to conditions such as congenital cataracts, characterized by lens opacity and impaired vision (Wang2020In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRYBA4 gene are associated with congenital cataracts, a condition characterized by the clouding of the lens in the eye, leading to visual impairment or blindness. These mutations can disrupt normal lens metabolism during the embryonic stage, slowing lens development and contributing to cataract formation (Wang2020In). The CRYBA4 gene is part of the crystallin family and plays a crucial role in maintaining lens transparency. Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in CRYBA4 can lead to amino acid substitutions that affect protein function, resulting in pathogenic phenotypes. Several nsSNPs, such as A9V, G64W, Y67N, L69P, S93P, and F94S, have been confirmed to be associated with congenital cataracts (Wang2020In).

The CRYBA4 gene is also linked to microphthalmia, a condition where one or both eyes are abnormally small. A specific mutation, c.242TrC (Leu69Pro), in exon 4 of CRYBA4 is associated with bilateral microphthalmia and cataracts, suggesting a role in both conditions (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). This mutation is predicted to disrupt the β-sheet structure, impairing protein folding and stability (Billingsley2006CRYBA4). Additionally, a partial duplication of the CRYBB1-CRYBA4 locus has been linked to autosomal dominant congenital cataract, indicating that gene dosage effects may also contribute to the condition (Siggs2017Partial).

## Interactions
The CRYBA4 protein, encoded by the CRYBA4 gene, is known to interact with several other crystallin proteins, which are crucial for maintaining lens transparency and function. It physically interacts with Betacrystallin B1 (CRYBB1) and Betacrystallin B2 (CRYBB2), forming complexes that are essential for lens structure. These interactions are significant for maintaining lens transparency and are implicated in DNA repair processes (Wang2020In). The CRYBA4 protein also interacts with DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2), suggesting a role in cellular responses to DNA damage (Wang2020In).

Mutations in CRYBA4, such as the G64W mutation, can disrupt its interaction with CRYBB1, leading to protein misfolding and decreased stability, which are associated with cataract formation. Despite this disruption, the G64W mutation does not affect CRYBA4's interaction with α-crystallin A (CRYAA), indicating selective interaction changes due to specific mutations (Li2019Biochemical). These interactions highlight the importance of CRYBA4 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the lens, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to ocular diseases such as congenital cataracts.
