# ZBTB3

## Overview
ZBTB3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 3 protein, which is a transcription factor involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding and a BTB/POZ domain that mediates protein-protein interactions, including the recruitment of corepressor complexes (Wang2023An; Costoya2007Functional). As a member of the BTB-ZF subfamily, ZBTB3 plays a crucial role in chromatin looping, influencing gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions (Wang2023An; Cheng2014Identification). It is particularly significant in the regulation of the IRF5 gene and is implicated in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells through its interaction with long noncoding RNAs and chromatin remodeling complexes (Wang2023An; Ye2018LncKdm2b).

## Structure
ZBTB3 is a protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger and BTB/POZ domains. The zinc finger domain facilitates DNA binding, while the BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, including dimerization and recruitment of corepressor complexes (Wang2023An; Costoya2007Functional). The BTB domain allows ZBTB3 to interact with transcriptional co-factors such as SIN3A, SMRT, and NCOR1, which recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) to promote chromatin deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Costoya2007Functional).

ZBTB3 is part of the BTB-ZF subfamily, which includes proteins with C2H2 or FLYWCH zinc finger domains (Cheng2014Identification). The protein's structure allows it to function as a transcriptional repressor and a structural regulator in chromatin looping, influencing gene expression (Wang2023An; Polman2012A). ZBTB3's role in chromatin looping is particularly significant in the context of the rs4728142 SNP, where it mediates allele-specific loop formation, affecting IRF5 promoter usage (Wang2023An).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may affect ZBTB3's function, and splice variants can lead to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Ye2018LncKdm2b).

## Function
ZBTB3 is a transcription factor characterized by zinc finger and BTB/POZ domains, playing a significant role in chromatin looping and gene regulation. In healthy human cells, ZBTB3 is involved in modulating chromatin structure, which influences gene expression by facilitating enhancer-promoter interactions. This is particularly evident in its role in regulating the IRF5 gene, where ZBTB3 mediates chromatin looping to modulate alternative promoter usage, affecting the expression of different IRF5 transcripts (Wang2023An).

ZBTB3 is also implicated in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). It is activated by the long noncoding RNA lncKdm2b, which promotes the ATPase activity of the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of ZBTB3. This activation is crucial for maintaining ESC pluripotency and self-renewal, as ZBTB3 binds to the promoter of the Nanog gene, a key pluripotency factor, thereby sustaining ESC self-renewal (Ye2018LncKdm2b).

ZBTB3's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation, by modulating the expression of target genes through its DNA-binding capabilities.

## Interactions
ZBTB3 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin looping and gene regulation. It contains a DNA-binding zinc finger domain and a transcription-repressing BTB/POZ domain, which are crucial for its function (Wang2023An). ZBTB3 preferentially binds to the rs4728142-A allele, influencing the expression of the IRF5 gene by mediating chromatin looping between the rs4728142-associated enhancer and the IRF5-short promoter (Wang2023An).

ZBTB3 interacts with other proteins such as CTCF and RAD21, suggesting its role as a structural regulator in chromatin interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown that ZBTB3 binding sites colocalize with CTCF and RAD21, indicating potential interactions with these proteins at the chromatin level (Wang2023An). The protein's BTB/POZ domain facilitates interactions with transcriptional co-repressors, mediating chromatin remodeling and gene silencing or activation (Wang2023An).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) have demonstrated ZBTB3's binding to specific DNA sequences at the rs4728142 locus, further supporting its role in chromatin looping and gene expression regulation (Wang2023An). These interactions highlight ZBTB3's involvement in modulating gene expression through complex protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.
