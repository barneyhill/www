# ZNF354C

## Overview
ZNF354C is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 354C, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). The protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression in endothelial cells and other tissues. It is involved in critical biological processes such as inhibiting endothelial angiogenic sprouting, which is essential for blood vessel formation (Oo2020ZNF354C). The protein's repressive activity is mediated by its KRAB domain, which interacts with co-repressors like TRIM28 to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Oo2020ZNF354C). ZNF354C is also expressed in the brain, where it may influence psychiatric symptoms, and its dysregulation has been associated with various clinical conditions, including depression and cancer (Matsunami2016GenomeWide; Liu2018Identification).

## Structure
ZNF354C is a transcriptional repressor protein that contains a KRAB domain, which is essential for its function in transcriptional repression (Oo2020ZNF354C). The protein is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein, characterized by zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding (Oo2020ZNF354C). These domains typically form secondary structures supported by a zinc ion, binding to cysteine and histidine residues, which are crucial for the protein's interaction with DNA (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

The KRAB domain within ZNF354C includes specific amino acid sequences such as MLE and DV, which are critical for its repressive activity. Mutations in these sequences, like MLE → KKK and DV → AA, can significantly affect the protein's function and its interaction with co-repressors such as TRIM28 (Oo2020ZNF354C). The protein's interaction with TRIM28 and its binding to chromatin are essential for its role in transcriptional repression (Oo2020ZNF354C).

While the primary structure of ZNF354C involves these specific amino acid sequences, detailed information on its tertiary or quaternary structures is not provided in the available context. The protein is highly stable, with a low turnover rate, as demonstrated by experiments using protein synthesis inhibitors (Oo2020ZNF354C).

## Function
ZNF354C is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor in endothelial cells. It plays a crucial role in inhibiting endothelial angiogenic sprouting, a process essential for blood vessel formation. The protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and interacts with double-stranded DNA, TRIM28, and the histone environment. Its repressive function is mediated by the KRAB domain, particularly the MLE amino acids, which are vital for its interaction with co-repressors like TRIM28. Mutations in these amino acids can abolish its repressive activity and its ability to inhibit angiogenic sprouting (Oo2020ZNF354C).

ZNF354C binds to specific target gene promoters, including RGS5, PATL2, HAP1, and NRAV, which are involved in various cellular processes. Overexpression of ZNF354C leads to the repression of a large number of genes, while its depletion results in increased expression of these genes. This indicates its role as a transcriptional repressor in regulating gene expression (Oo2020ZNF354C).

In addition to its role in endothelial cells, ZNF354C is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are implicated in psychiatric symptoms (Matsunami2016GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF354C has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role as a transcriptional repressor. Variants in the ZNF354C gene, particularly the SNP rs1863918, have been associated with an increased risk of depression in patients undergoing interferon-based therapy for chronic hepatitis C. The T allele of this SNP is linked to a higher likelihood of depression, potentially due to its influence on ZNF354C expression in brain regions associated with psychiatric symptoms (Matsunami2016GenomeWide).

In osteosarcoma, ZNF354C is down-regulated, suggesting it may function as a transcriptional repressor in bone development. Its reduced expression is associated with the pathology of osteosarcoma, indicating a potential role in tumor suppression (Liu2018Identification).

ZNF354C also plays a significant role in inhibiting endothelial angiogenic sprouting, a process crucial for new blood vessel formation. Alterations in its expression can impact cardiovascular health and tumor growth, as it regulates genes involved in these processes (Oo2020ZNF354C).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ZNF354C has been identified as a key transcription factor, although its specific functions in this cancer type require further investigation (Zhang2018Identification).

## Interactions
ZNF354C is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily in endothelial cells. It interacts with double-stranded DNA, TRIM28, and histones, forming complexes that contribute to its repressive function. The interaction with TRIM28 is particularly significant, as it is mediated by the KRAB domain of ZNF354C, which is crucial for its transcriptional repression activity. Specific amino acids within the KRAB domain, such as the MLE sequence, are essential for these interactions. Mutations in these amino acids can abolish the repressive effects of ZNF354C on gene expression and endothelial sprouting (Oo2020ZNF354C).

ZNF354C binds to specific DNA consensus motifs present in the promoters of numerous genes, leading to their transcriptional repression. This binding is a key mechanism by which ZNF354C regulates gene expression in endothelial cells (Oo2020ZNF354C). The protein's interaction with histones and its ability to form complexes with TRIM28 and DNA suggest that ZNF354C plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, contributing to its function as a transcriptional repressor (Oo2020ZNF354C).
