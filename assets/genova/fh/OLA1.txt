# OLA1

## Overview
The OLA1 gene encodes the protein Obg-like ATPase 1, which is a member of the Obg family of GTPases, characterized by its ATPase activity. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of protein synthesis, stress response, and cell cycle progression. OLA1 is expressed in most tissues and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating the antioxidant response and stabilizing heat shock proteins. It interacts with key cellular components such as HSP70 and the eIF2 complex, influencing protein synthesis and stress responses. Additionally, OLA1 is implicated in cancer biology and heart failure, where its expression levels and mutations can significantly impact disease progression and prognosis (Dubey2023Identification; Mao2013OLA1; Zhang2009OLA1).

## Structure
The human OLA1 protein, also known as Obg-like ATPase 1, is a member of the Obg family of GTPases, characterized by its ATPase activity. The primary structure of OLA1 consists of a sequence encoding a 396 amino acid protein (Dubey2023Identification). Its secondary structure includes 13 strands, 16 helices, and 23 coils, as indicated by structural analysis (Dubey2023Identification).

The tertiary structure of OLA1 features a GTPase domain, with a conserved G domain that includes specific sequence motifs (G1-G5) involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (KollerEichhorn2007Human). The protein's structure is composed of an N-terminal G domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal TGS domain. The cofactor AMPPCP is bound between the P-loop, helix α1, helix α9, and a loop following strand β6, with the triphosphate moiety tightly bound through a network of hydrogen bonds (KollerEichhorn2007Human).

Post-translational modifications of OLA1 may include phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The OLA1 gene also has splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and localization (Dubey2023Identification). The protein is expressed in most tissues and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein synthesis and stress responses (Mao2013OLA1).

## Function
OLA1 (Obg like ATPase 1) is a member of the Obg family of GTPases and functions primarily as an ATPase. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein synthesis, stress response, and cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, OLA1 is involved in the regulation of the antioxidant response through nontranscriptional mechanisms. It acts as a negative regulator, where its knockdown leads to increased resistance to oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and maintaining higher levels of reduced glutathione (Zhang2009OLA1).

OLA1 also plays a crucial role in the heat-shock response by stabilizing HSP70, a molecular chaperone. It binds to HSP70, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby enhancing cellular resistance to heat shock (Mao2013OLA1). Additionally, OLA1 is involved in translational control, where it regulates protein synthesis by inhibiting the formation of the eIF2 ternary complex, impacting the integrated stress response (Chen2015OLA1).

In terms of cell cycle regulation, OLA1 influences cell proliferation by modulating the expression of cell cycle regulators such as cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which is crucial for normal developmental progression (Ding2016OLA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OLA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In heart failure, OLA1 expression is significantly downregulated in failing heart tissues compared to non-failing ones. A notable mutation, 5144A>G, resulting in a Tyr254Cys change, has been identified in heart failure patients and is associated with disease-specific haplotypes. This mutation is predicted to be deleterious and may contribute to cardiomyocyte death during heart failure (Dubey2024Identification; Dubey2023Identification).

In cancer, OLA1 is often overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer, high OLA1 expression is linked to lower survival rates, and its knockout in cell lines reduces tumor growth. OLA1 promotes tumorigenesis through the activation of the HIF1α/CA9 axis (Liu2022OLA1). In breast cancer, lower OLA1 expression is associated with worse prognosis and increased tumor invasion, suggesting its role as a prognostic factor (Chen2015OLA1).

OLA1 also plays a role in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), where decreased expression leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction due to downregulation of mitochondrial SOD2 (Schultz2019Decreased).

## Interactions
OLA1, also known as Obg-like ATPase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. OLA1 directly binds to HSP70, a heat shock protein, stabilizing it by extending its half-life. This interaction occurs at the C-terminal variable domain of HSP70, which is also the binding site for CHIP, an E3 ligase. OLA1 competes with CHIP for binding to HSP70, thereby modulating HSP70 stability (Mao2013OLA1).

OLA1 interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, specifically binding to the α subunit of eIF2. This interaction inhibits the formation of the eIF2 ternary complex by suppressing the binding of Met-tRNAi Met to eIF2 in the presence of GTP, a process attributed to OLA1's GTPase activity (Chen2015OLA1). OLA1's interaction with eIF2 is crucial for regulating protein synthesis and the integrated stress response (Chen2015OLA1).

In cancer biology, OLA1 interacts with BRCA1, BARD1, and γ-tubulin, forming a complex that is essential for chromosome stability. This complex acts as a Ring-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the ubiquitin-like C-terminal TGS-domain of OLA1 is necessary for its interaction with BRCA1 and BARD1 (Landwehr2021The).
