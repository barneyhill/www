# C14orf28

## Overview
C14orf28 is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 14 open reading frame 28. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. While the precise biochemical function of the C14orf28 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is categorized as a non-kinase protein involved in oncogenic pathways. Research has demonstrated that C14orf28 is upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, where it plays a significant role in promoting tumor growth, inhibiting apoptosis, and facilitating metastasis (Yang2017C14orf28). Additionally, C14orf28 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis, by modulating the expression of key markers such as E-cadherin and vimentin (Yang2017C14orf28). The gene's expression is regulated by microRNAs, including miR-519d, which can suppress its oncogenic effects (Yang2017C14orf28). Beyond CRC, C14orf28 has been associated with poor survival outcomes in neuroblastoma, indicating its broader relevance in cancer progression (Giwa2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
C14orf28 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The gene is upregulated in CRC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, suggesting its role as an oncogene. Its overexpression is associated with more aggressive clinicopathologic features, such as larger tumor size, advanced stage, and distant metastases. Functional studies have shown that C14orf28 promotes CRC cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and enhances migration and invasion, contributing to the oncogenicity of CRC (Yang2017C14orf28).

C14orf28 also influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by decreasing E-cadherin and increasing vimentin levels, which are associated with enhanced migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells (Yang2017C14orf28). The gene is regulated by miR-519d, a microRNA that is downregulated in CRC tissues. miR-519d targets the 3' UTR of C14orf28, suppressing its expression and thereby inhibiting CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Yang2017C14orf28).

In addition to its role in CRC, C14orf28 has been mentioned in studies related to neuroblastoma, where its overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Giwa2020Identification). However, the specific clinical significance of C14orf28 in neuroblastoma requires further investigation.
