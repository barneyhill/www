# MYCBPAP

## Overview
MYCBPAP (MYCBP associated protein) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and ciliary function. The protein encoded by MYCBPAP is known to interact with MYCBP, a MYC binding protein, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation and gene expression (McReynolds2014Toward). Additionally, MYCBPAP is expressed in motile ciliated cells, indicating a potential role in ciliary function, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Patir2020The). Clinically, MYCBPAP has been associated with breast cancer, particularly in the context of lymphovascular invasion, and with male infertility, where its expression levels correlate with sperm quality and blastocyst development (Fidalgo2014Lymphovascular; McReynolds2014Toward). These associations underscore the gene's significance in both oncological and reproductive health contexts.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The MYCBPAP gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in MYCBPAP expression have been associated with breast cancer, particularly in the context of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and histologic grade. The gene is upregulated in tumors with LVI, suggesting a potential role in tumor invasion and metastasis (Fidalgo2014Lymphovascular). 

In the realm of reproductive health, MYCBPAP has been linked to male infertility. Studies have shown that MYCBPAP is underexpressed in sperm associated with poor blastocyst development, indicating its potential impact on embryo development and fertility outcomes (McReynolds2014Toward). 

Additionally, MYCBPAP has been identified as a gene associated with motile cilia, which are crucial for various physiological processes. Although its role in ciliopathies is not fully established, MYCBPAP's expression in motile ciliated cells suggests it may have implications in conditions related to cilia dysfunction (Patir2020The). 

Overall, MYCBPAP's involvement in these conditions highlights its significance in both cancer progression and reproductive health, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications.

## Interactions
MYCBPAP (MYCBP associated protein) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is known to interact with MYCBP (MYC binding protein), which plays a role in transcriptional regulation. This interaction suggests that MYCBPAP may participate in multiprotein complexes that influence gene expression, affecting cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (McReynolds2014Toward).

In the context of motile cilia, MYCBPAP has been identified as a gene associated with these structures. It is expressed in motile ciliated cells, as demonstrated by coexpression analyses and validation through single-cell transcriptomics and in situ hybridization experiments. This expression pattern indicates a potential role for MYCBPAP in ciliary function, although specific protein interactions within cilia are not detailed (Patir2020The).

MYCBPAP is also mentioned in studies related to spermatogenesis, where it is associated with decreased abundance in sperm samples linked to poor blastocyst development. This underexpression suggests a role in male fertility, potentially through interactions with other proteins involved in spermatogenesis, although specific partners are not identified in the provided context (McReynolds2014Toward).
