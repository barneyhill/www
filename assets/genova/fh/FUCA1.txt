# FUCA1

## Overview
The FUCA1 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase 1, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of fucose-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by hydrolyzing terminal L-fucose residues, thereby facilitating the recycling of these biomolecules. Alpha-L-fucosidase 1 is characterized by its broad substrate specificity, capable of cleaving various fucosyl linkages, and is involved in several physiological processes, including immune responses and signal transduction (Intra2007Comparative; Michalski1999Glycoprotein). The activity of FUCA1 is developmentally regulated and influenced by the tumor suppressor protein p53, linking its function to tumor suppression (Ishida2019Alpha‐L‐fucosidase‐1). Mutations in FUCA1 can lead to fucosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder, while its expression levels have implications in cancer prognosis and progression (Zhao2024CTCFactivated; Stepien2020Fucosidosis—Clinical).

## Structure
The FUCA1 gene encodes the alpha-L-fucosidase 1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of fucose-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids. The primary structure of FUCA1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a mature protein of 439 amino acids after processing from its full-length cDNA of 2053 base pairs (Chkioua2021Fucosidosis). The secondary structure includes a catalytic domain with an (α/β)8 barrel-like fold and a C-terminal domain with a β-sandwich structure (Chkioua2021Fucosidosis). 

The tertiary structure of FUCA1 is globular, with a highly conserved 3D structure that is similar to its bacterial counterparts, despite low sequence identity (Chkioua2021Fucosidosis). The enzyme's active site contains key residues, such as Asp225 and Glu275, which are essential for its catalytic function (Chkioua2021Fucosidosis). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may affect the stability and activity of FUCA1. The enzyme is primarily located in the lysosome and exhibits maximal activity at pH values between 4 and 7 (Fu2022Dual). Splice variants of FUCA1 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in distinct functions (Fu2022Dual).

## Function
The FUCA1 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase 1, which plays a critical role in the catabolism of fucosylated glycoconjugates in healthy human cells. This enzyme is primarily active in the lysosome, where it hydrolyzes terminal L-fucose residues from glycoproteins, glycolipids, and mucopolysaccharides, facilitating their degradation and recycling (Intra2007Comparative; Michalski1999Glycoprotein). Alpha-L-fucosidase 1 is involved in the removal of fucose residues from oligosaccharide chains, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of these molecules, a process that is crucial for normal cellular metabolism (OteroEstévez2013Decreased).

The enzyme exhibits a wide substrate specificity, capable of hydrolyzing various fucosyl linkages, including α-1,2, α-1,3, α-1,4, and α-1,6 (Fu2022Dual). It is involved in several physiological processes, such as immune responses, signal transduction, and sperm maturation, acting in a lectin-like fashion to mediate binding (Intra2007Comparative). The activity of FUCA1 is developmentally regulated and is influenced by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which can induce its expression, linking its function to tumor suppression (Ishida2019Alpha‐L‐fucosidase‐1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FUCA1 gene lead to fucosidosis, a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme α-L-fucosidase, resulting in the accumulation of fucose-containing glycolipids and glycoproteins in tissues. Clinical manifestations include progressive neurological deterioration, growth retardation, coarse facial features, recurrent respiratory infections, and angiokeratoma corporis diffusum. Fucosidosis is classified into two types: Type I, which is severe and often fatal within the first decade of life, and Type II, which is milder with a longer life expectancy (Willems1999Spectrum; Stepien2020Fucosidosis—Clinical; Chkioua2021Fucosidosis).

The FUCA1 gene is also implicated in cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FUCA1 expression is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. Enhancing FUCA1 expression reduces the invasion and migration of ccRCC cells, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor. FUCA1 is involved in autophagy, particularly in the fusion stage between autophagosomes and lysosomes, and its expression is regulated by the transcription factor CTCF (Zhao2024CTCFactivated). In thyroid cancers, FUCA1 expression is induced by wild-type p53, with higher levels observed in papillary thyroid cancers compared to anaplastic thyroid cancers (Tsuchida2017FUCA1).

## Interactions
FUCA1 (alpha-L-fucosidase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with USP35, a deubiquitinase that stabilizes FUCA1 by removing ubiquitin chains, preventing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays in various cell lines, including HEK293T, LoVo, and DLD-1 cells (Xiao2023USP35; Zhang2022USP35). The stabilization of FUCA1 by USP35 is associated with increased cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer cells (Xiao2023USP35).

FUCA1 also interacts with FUCA2, another fucosidase, which has been identified as having the closest interaction with FUCA1. This interaction is significant in the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where elevated serum levels of alpha-L-fucosidase, encoded by FUCA2, are indicative of a favorable prognosis (Zhao2024CTCFactivated). Additionally, FUCA1 is involved in the autophagy process, particularly in the fusion stage between autophagosomes and lysosomes, which is crucial for cargo degradation and cell death (Zhao2024CTCFactivated). These interactions highlight FUCA1's role in modulating tumor progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
