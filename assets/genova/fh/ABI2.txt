# ABI2

## Overview
ABI2 is a gene that encodes the protein Abl interactor 2, which is a member of the Abl-interactor family of adaptor proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell migration, and signal transduction. Abl interactor 2 is characterized by its structural domains, including an SH3 domain, proline-rich sequences, and PEST regions, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as the c-Abl tyrosine kinase (Dai1995Abi2). Functionally, Abl interactor 2 is crucial for processes such as adherens junction formation and synaptic plasticity, playing a significant role in both cellular morphogenesis and neuronal function (Grove2004Abi2Deficient). Alterations in ABI2 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may act as a tumor suppressor, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lv2024Inhibition).

## Structure
The ABI2 protein, also known as Abl interactor 2, is characterized by several structural features that facilitate its role in cellular processes. It contains an SH3 domain in its carboxy-terminal region, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. This domain shows significant identity with SH3 domains from other proteins such as cortactin and vav (Dai1995Abi2). The protein also includes proline-rich sequences with the consensus PXXP motif, serving as potential binding sites for other SH3 domain-containing proteins (Dai1995Abi2).

ABI2 has PEST regions, which are sequences enriched in serine/threonine, glutamate/aspartate, and proline residues, suggesting a role in protein degradation (Dai1995Abi2). The amino-terminal region is basic, while the carboxy-terminal portion is acidic, and a serine-rich region in the central part of ABI2 contains potential phosphorylation sites for various protein kinases (Dai1995Abi2). The protein is a substrate for c-Abl, with at least two tyrosines predicted to be optimal for phosphorylation (Dai1995Abi2). ABI2 is widely expressed in human tissues, with evidence of alternative splicing leading to different transcripts (Dai1995Abi2).

## Function
ABI2 (Abl Interactor 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration, and signal transduction. It is part of the Abl-interactor family of adaptor proteins and is involved in signaling pathways with Abl tyrosine kinases and Rac GTPase. ABI2 is localized at sites of actin polymerization in membrane structures and regulates actin dynamics, which are crucial for cell morphogenesis and migration (Grove2004Abi2Deficient).

In healthy cells, ABI2 is prominently observed at cell-cell borders, particularly at adherens junctions, where it colocalizes with proteins such as ß-catenin, F-actin, and E-cadherin. This localization is dynamic, with higher levels at nascent junctions, indicating its role in the early stages of adherens junction formation and intercellular adhesion (Grove2004Abi2Deficient). ABI2 is also involved in lamellipodia-driven adherens junction formation, potentially by stimulating Rac activity or targeting Rac-GEFs to specific membrane sites (Grove2004Abi2Deficient).

In neurons, ABI2 is associated with dendritic spines and synaptic markers, suggesting its involvement in synapse formation and maintenance. Its deficiency leads to abnormalities in dendritic spine morphology and density, which are linked to impairments in memory and learning (Grove2004Abi2Deficient). These functions highlight ABI2's critical role in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and synaptic plasticity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ABI2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In TNBC, ABI2 expression is significantly reduced, and its overexpression has been shown to suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. This suggests that ABI2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation (Lv2024Inhibition). The degradation of ABI2 is promoted by the E3 ligase CBLC, and inhibiting this ubiquitination process could enhance ABI2 levels, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC (Lv2024Inhibition).

In RCC, ABI2 expression is also decreased in tumor tissues compared to healthy kidney tissues, aligning with its proposed role as a tumor suppressor. Although the change in expression was not statistically significant, it was associated with the platelet/lymphocyte ratio, a potential prognostic marker in RCC (Ergun2020Association). These findings suggest that ABI2 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancers where its expression is altered.

## Interactions
ABI2, a protein encoded by the human ABI2 gene, is known for its interactions with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. ABI2 binds specifically to the SH3 domain of c-Abl both in vitro and in vivo, forming a complex that modulates c-Abl activity. This interaction involves dual SH3-proline interactions and may include contacts between tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences in ABI2 and the Abl SH2 domain (Dai1995Abi2). ABI2 is also a substrate for c-Abl, with at least two tyrosines being optimal for c-Abl phosphorylation (Dai1995Abi2).

ABI2's interaction with c-Abl is not limited to the SH3 domain, as it also involves binding to multiple surfaces on the c-Abl protein, including a proline-rich stretch downstream of the nuclear localization signal in the Abl carboxyl terminus (Dai1995Abi2). The interaction is specific, as ABI2 does not form complexes with other SH3-containing proteins like GAP, Crk, Grb2, Src, and the p67 protein from neutrophils (Dai1995Abi2).

ABI2 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and contains motifs associated with cytoplasmic signaling proteins and nuclear factors, suggesting it may function similarly to signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (Dai1995Abi2).
