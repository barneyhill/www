# KIF27

## Overview
KIF27 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 27, which is part of the kinesin-4 family of motor proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics, particularly in the formation and function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are essential for cellular motility and sensory functions. KIF27 is primarily active in the cytoplasm of ciliated cells, where it localizes to basal bodies and contributes to the stability and dynamics of microtubules. Unlike conventional kinesins, KIF27 acts as a microtubule-based tether, influencing microtubule growth and stability without requiring ATP hydrolysis. It interacts with proteins such as Fused/Stk36, which are necessary for the assembly of the central pair of microtubules in motile cilia, highlighting its role in ciliary dynamics. Alterations in KIF27 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including ciliopathies and certain cancers, underscoring its significance in human health (Zhong2023Multiple; Yue2018Altered; Reilly2019Ciliary).

## Function
KIF27 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a role in microtubule dynamics and is involved in cellular processes such as cilia formation and function. In healthy human cells, KIF27 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, particularly in ciliated cells, where it contributes to cellular motility and sensory functions. It localizes to the basal bodies in tracheal and oviduct epithelial cells, suggesting a specific role in motile cilia (Reilly2019Ciliary).

KIF27 is a slow processive motor with a high affinity for ATP and microtubules, which influences microtubule dynamics by reducing growth rates and the length of microtubule growth before catastrophe (Yue2018Altered). Despite its slow motility, KIF27 can stabilize the curvature of tubulin subunits at the microtubule plus end, a function that does not require ATP hydrolysis (Yue2018Altered). This suggests that KIF27 may act as a microtubule-based tether rather than a conventional transporter, potentially playing a role in regulating cilium tip structure (Yue2018Altered).

KIF27 interacts with Fused/Stk36, which is necessary for the assembly of the central pair of microtubules in motile cilia, indicating its involvement in ciliary dynamics (Reilly2019Ciliary).

## Clinical Significance
KIF27, a member of the kinesin superfamily, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Mutations or alterations in KIF27 expression have been associated with gastric cancer, where it is one of the top 10 commonly mutated genes, with a mutation rate exceeding 10% in stomach adenocarcinoma patients. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer (Zhong2023Multiple).

KIF27 is also involved in ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in cilia function. These conditions can lead to symptoms such as ciliary dyskinesias and recurrent pulmonary infections, although these typically require loss of function in both gene copies (Pua2013Novel). The gene's involvement in motile cilia processes links it to ciliopathies, which can manifest as developmental defects and diseases (Kalantari2020‘Kinesinopathies’:).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, KIF27 is part of a co-expression network with other kinesin-4 family genes, although its expression level does not significantly differ between tumor and normal tissues (Han2019Prognostic). Despite its involvement in these conditions, specific diseases directly associated with KIF27 mutations or expression alterations in humans remain underexplored.

## Interactions
KIF27, a member of the kinesin-4 family, is involved in interactions that are crucial for its role in motile cilia functions. It interacts with the protein Fused (also known as Stk36), which is essential for the assembly of the central pair of microtubules in motile cilia. This interaction suggests that KIF27 may participate in Fused-mediated functions, although Fused is not involved in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in vertebrates (Yue2018Altered; Reilly2019Ciliary).

KIF27 is also noted for its high affinity for microtubules, which is consistent across different nucleotide states, indicating a strong binding interaction with microtubules. This characteristic is linked to its slow motility and impaired chemomechanical coupling, which differentiates it from other kinesin motors (Yue2018Altered).

In addition to its interactions with microtubules, KIF27 shares a high sequence identity with KIF7, another kinesin-4 motor, and both are orthologues of the Drosophila protein Costal2 (Cos2). While KIF7 is involved in Hh signaling, KIF27 does not appear to have a conserved role in this pathway in vertebrates, highlighting a divergence in their functional interactions (Yue2018Altered; Klejnot2012Structural).
