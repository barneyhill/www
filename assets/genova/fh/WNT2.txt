# WNT2

## Overview
WNT2 is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 2, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical mechanism for cell-to-cell communication that influences cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The Wnt family member 2 protein is characterized by its cysteine-rich composition and is involved in various developmental processes, particularly through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Miller2001Thewnts; Wang2010WNT2). This protein plays a significant role in angiogenesis and vascular development, acting as an angiogenic growth factor in endothelial cells (Klein2009Wnt2). The WNT2 gene's expression and function are implicated in several diseases, including cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2016Emerging; Liu2022Wntβcatenin).

## Structure
The WNT2 protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids, with a notable composition of 38% alpha helix, 24% beta sheet, 36% coil, and 21% turn regions in its secondary structure (Kalhor2018Structural). The tertiary structure of WNT2 is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity and function (MacDonald2014Disulfide). WNT2 proteins are typically cysteine-rich, containing about 23-24 cysteines, which are essential for forming these disulfide bonds (Miller2001Thewnts).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and palmitoylation, are common in WNT2 and are vital for its secretion and activity. The protein undergoes acylation with palmitoleic acid, which has a higher binding affinity compared to palmitic acid, influencing its interaction with receptors like Fzd7 (Kalhor2018Structural). The hydrophobic nature of WNT2, particularly due to lipid presence at specific positions, is important for its function (Kalhor2018Structural). Alternative splicing of WNT2 may lead to different isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity in various biological processes (Sumithra2016Alternative).

## Function
WNT2 is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes secreted signaling proteins that play a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, WNT2 is involved in various developmental processes, particularly through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, as demonstrated in mouse granulosa cells where WNT2 influences the formation of adherens junctions involving β-catenin and E-cadherin (Wang2010WNT2). WNT2 acts through its receptor FZD9, affecting the localization and expression of β-catenin, a key transcription cofactor, and modulating the levels of GSK-3β, a kinase involved in β-catenin degradation (Wang2010WNT2).

WNT2 is also implicated in angiogenesis, particularly in non-sinusoidal endothelial cells, where it acts as an angiogenic growth factor. It is involved in the proliferation and morphogenesis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) through an autocrine signaling mechanism, targeting VEGFR2 and indicating a cross-activation with the VEGF signaling pathway (Klein2009Wnt2). This role in endothelial cell biology highlights its importance in angiogenesis and vascular development (Klein2007Wnt2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WNT2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of kidney development and disease, WNT2 is suggested to regulate renal cell invasiveness. Studies have shown that HEK-293T cells expressing WNT2 exhibit increased invasiveness in a collagen matrix, a process inhibited by RNAi against GSK-3β, indicating the involvement of GSK-3β in WNT2-induced invasion (Pulkkinen2008Wnt). This suggests a potential role for WNT2 in the invasive behavior of transformed cells, although further in vivo studies are needed to confirm this connection in kidney cancer models.

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), WNT2 expression is aberrantly increased, contributing to the hyperactivation of Wnt signaling pathways. This dysregulation is associated with disease pathogenesis, particularly in ulcerative colitis, where WNT2 expression is elevated (Shi2016Emerging). The role of WNT2 in IBD highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, as modulating Wnt pathways could reduce inflammation and disease progression.

Additionally, the WNT2 gene is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is critical in various diseases, including cancer. Dysregulation of this pathway can lead to tumorigenesis and resistance to therapies, underscoring the clinical significance of WNT2 in disease pathology (Liu2022Wntβcatenin).

## Interactions
WNT2 interacts with Frizzled receptors, particularly Fzd7 and Fzd9, to mediate its signaling effects. The interaction between WNT2 and Fzd7 involves hydrophobic and electrostatic forces, with specific residues at the interface playing crucial roles in the stability and function of the complex. This interaction is characterized by hydrogen bonds and involves two binding sites with distinct interaction types: polar-polar interactions in binding site 1 and polar-nonpolar and nonpolar-nonpolar interactions in binding site 2 (Kalhor2018Structural). In mouse granulosa cells, WNT2 co-localizes with FZD3 and FZD9, with FZD9 being the preferred receptor, as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Wang2010WNT2).

WNT2 also interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction influences cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in granulosa cells, with WNT2 overexpression leading to increased β-catenin levels and its translocation to the nucleus (Wang2010WNT2). In pancreatic cancer, WNT2 facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Xu2015Wnt2).
