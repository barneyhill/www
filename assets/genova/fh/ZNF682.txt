# ZNF682

## Overview
ZNF682 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 682, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression. The zinc finger protein 682 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Recent studies have highlighted the potential involvement of ZNF682 in cancer progression, particularly in the context of metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its significance in oncogenic pathways (Zengin2021Comprehensive; Ouyang2014Wholegenome).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF682 has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, particularly in the context of metastasis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mutations in ZNF682 are enriched in metastatic samples, suggesting a role in the metastatic process. These mutations are involved in transcription regulation, which may contribute to the cancer's ability to spread to other parts of the body (Ouyang2014Wholegenome). The study also notes that ZNF682, along with ZNF257, is upregulated in lung and bone metastases compared to primary breast adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential role as a metastasis gene (Ouyang2014Wholegenome).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZNF682 is included in the gene expression signature, which suggests its potential prognostic power in distinguishing risk groups. Although the specific role of ZNF682 in LUAD is not detailed, its inclusion in the expression signature indicates it may have clinical significance in this cancer type (Zengin2021Comprehensive).

Despite these associations, the functional role of ZNF682 in tumorigenesis, particularly in HCC, remains undefined, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its exact contributions to cancer progression and metastasis (Ouyang2014Wholegenome).
