# PGA4

## Overview
PGA4 is a gene that encodes the protein pepsinogen A4, a precursor to the digestive enzyme pepsin, which is classified as a protease. Pepsinogen A4 is synthesized and secreted by gastric chief cells in the stomach lining, where it plays a pivotal role in the digestive process by breaking down dietary proteins into peptides. The activation of pepsinogen A4 into pepsin occurs in the acidic environment of the stomach, a process essential for efficient protein digestion and nutrient absorption (Khan1998Molecular; Kageyama2002Pepsinogens). Beyond its digestive function, PGA4 has clinical significance in oncology, where its expression levels and genetic variations are studied as potential biomarkers for various cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma (Shen2020The).

## Function
Pepsinogen A4, encoded by the PGA4 gene, is a precursor to the digestive enzyme pepsin, which plays a crucial role in protein digestion within the stomach. In healthy human cells, pepsinogen A4 is secreted by gastric chief cells located in the stomach lining. These cells are specialized for the production and secretion of digestive enzymes, including pepsinogen A4, which is released into the gastric lumen (Kageyama2002Pepsinogens).

Upon secretion, pepsinogen A4 is activated in the acidic environment of the stomach. The low pH triggers the cleavage of the prosegment from the zymogen, converting it into active pepsin. This activation process involves a conformational change that exposes the enzyme's active site, allowing it to cleave peptide bonds in dietary proteins, thus facilitating their breakdown into smaller peptides (Kageyama2002Pepsinogens; Khan1998Molecular).

The activity of pepsin is essential for the efficient digestion of proteins, which is a critical step in nutrient absorption and overall digestive health. The regulation of pepsinogen A4 expression and its activation are tightly controlled processes, ensuring that protein digestion occurs optimally within the stomach (Kageyama2002Pepsinogens).

## Clinical Significance
PGA4 (pepsinogen A4) has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations serving as potential biomarkers for disease prognosis and diagnosis. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, higher expression of PGA4 is associated with improved survival rates, suggesting a protective role in this cancer type (Shen2020The). Conversely, PGA4 expression is decreased in thyroid carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma, indicating a potential role in the progression of these cancers (Shen2020The).

The mutation frequency of PGA4 is generally low across different cancer types, with less than 2% mutation frequency observed (Shen2020The). However, copy number variations (CNV) of PGA4 have been noted, with amplifications in lung adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and kidney chromophobe, and reductions in bladder urothelial carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma (Shen2020The). Despite these CNVs, PGA4's prognostic role appears to be independent of its expression levels, indicating that other mechanisms may be involved in its impact on cancer outcomes (Shen2020The).

PGA4 is also involved in cancer-related pathways, such as the K-RAS signaling pathway, bile acid metabolism, and mitotic G2 M phase, and is significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly with B cells, mast cells, and helper T cells (Shen2020The). These interactions suggest that PGA4 may influence tumor microenvironments and immune responses in cancer.
