# ADGRE2

## Overview
ADGRE2 is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E2 (EMR2), a member of the adhesion GPCR family. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a long extracellular domain with epidermal growth factor-like domains and a seven-pass transmembrane domain. EMR2 is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, and plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and cellular communication. It is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and other signaling pathways that regulate inflammation and immune cell differentiation. Mutations in ADGRE2 have been linked to vibratory urticaria, a condition characterized by hives and itching triggered by mechanical stimulation, and its expression levels have clinical significance in conditions like acute myeloid leukemia (I2021Stimulation; Boyden2016Vibratory; Yang2018Characterization).

## Structure
The ADGRE2 protein, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E2, is a member of the adhesion GPCR family characterized by a complex molecular structure. It features a long N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) with two to five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, depending on the isoform, which can be (EGF1,2), (EGF1,2,5), (EGF1,2,3,5), or (EGF1,2,3,4,5) (Nijmeijer2016Adhesion). These EGF-like domains are part of the fibrillin-like family I type and include a calcium-binding site (Krishnan2016Classification). The ECD also contains a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which facilitates autoproteolytic cleavage, resulting in a bipartite structure with an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) that remain non-covalently associated (Boyden2016Vibratory; Naranjo2020Critical).

The protein's seven-pass transmembrane domain (7TM) is highly similar to that of ADGRE3, while the ECD is most similar to ADGRE5, with only six amino acids difference (Nijmeijer2016Adhesion; Krishnan2016Classification). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may influence its function and interactions (Nijmeijer2016Adhesion). The protein undergoes GPS autoproteolysis, which is crucial for its function, as mutations affecting this process can impair cellular migration and signaling (Nijmeijer2016Adhesion; Boyden2016Vibratory).

## Function
The ADGRE2 gene encodes the EMR2 protein, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, which is primarily expressed in myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. EMR2 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and cellular communication. It is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes, a critical component of the innate immune response, through a signaling pathway that includes Gα16-dependent phospholipase C (PLC)-β activation, leading to downstream effects such as Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB activation, and Ca2+ mobilization (I2021Stimulation).

EMR2 is also implicated in the differentiation of macrophages and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Its activation promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-8 and TNF-α, and involves signaling pathways such as Gα16/PLC/Akt and NF-κB (I2017Activation). The protein's function as a mechanosensor in mast cells is suggested by its ability to respond to physical forces, which is crucial for processes like cellular migration and adhesion (Boyden2016Vibratory). EMR2's expression is upregulated during macrophage differentiation and is associated with systemic inflammatory conditions, indicating its role in immune regulation (I2017Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADGRE2 gene are associated with vibratory urticaria, a rare hereditary condition characterized by localized hives and itching triggered by mechanical stimulation of the skin. This condition is linked to a specific missense variant in the ADGRE2 gene, c.1475G→A, which results in a p.C492Y substitution. This mutation likely destabilizes an autoinhibitory interaction between the α and β subunits of the ADGRE2 protein, making mast cells more sensitive to vibration-induced degranulation, independent of IgE (Boyden2016Vibratory).

In addition to its role in vibratory urticaria, alterations in ADGRE2 expression have been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression levels of ADGRE2, among other adhesion G protein-coupled receptors, are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in AML patients. This upregulation is particularly significant in younger patients and is linked to poor molecular risk status (Yang2018Characterization).

The ADGRE2 gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its significance in both hereditary and acquired diseases, where mutations or altered expression can lead to abnormal cellular responses and disease progression.

## Interactions
ADGRE2, also known as EMR2, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor that participates in various protein interactions, influencing immune responses and cellular signaling. It interacts with dermatan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan, which plays a role in recruiting monocytes to inflamed synovium in rheumatoid arthritis (I2021Stimulation). ADGRE2 also binds to the monoclonal antibody 2A1, which can increase migration, adhesion, degranulation, and cytokine production in myeloid cells (Boyden2016Vibratory).

A missense mutation in ADGRE2, specifically the p.C492Y variant, affects its interaction with mast cells, leading to increased degranulation in response to vibration. This mutation causes the dissociation of the α and β subunits of ADGRE2, with the β subunit being constitutively active, suggesting that the α subunit normally inhibits its signaling (Boyden2016Vibratory).

ADGRE2 is involved in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes through interaction with FHR1, a regulatory protein of complement Factor H. This interaction is part of a signaling pathway that involves Gα16-dependent PLC-β activation, leading to downstream effects such as Akt, MAPK, NF-κB activation, and Ca2+ mobilization (I2021Stimulation).
