# TECPR2

## Overview
TECPR2 is a gene that encodes the tectonin beta-propeller repeat containing 2 protein, which is integral to cellular processes such as autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export. The protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including an N-terminal WD40 domain and a C-terminal TECPR domain, which facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein. TECPR2 interacts with various proteins involved in endomembrane trafficking, such as SEC24D and members of the ATG8 family, to regulate autophagosome formation and ER export (Stadel2015TECPR2; Fraiberg2020Lysosomal). Mutations in the TECPR2 gene are linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy with intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal health (OzLevi2012Mutation; Neuser2021Clinical).

## Structure
TECPR2 (tectonin beta-propeller repeat containing 2) is a multi-domain protein characterized by its complex molecular structure. The protein includes an N-terminal WD40 domain, a middle unstructured region, and a C-terminal TECPR domain. The WD40 domain consists of approximately 40 amino acids that form seven-bladed beta-propeller structures, which serve as platforms for protein complex assembly (Stadel2015TECPR2; Nalbach2023Spatial). The TECPR domain comprises six TECPR repeats, which also form beta-propeller-like structures, and is followed by a functional LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif (Stadel2015TECPR2; Fraiberg2020Lysosomal).

TECPR2 interacts with various proteins, including SEC24D, HOPS, and BLOC-1, which are involved in endomembrane trafficking and autophagy (Stadel2015TECPR2). The protein's interaction with ATG8-family proteins, particularly LC3B and LC3C, is crucial for its function in autophagy, facilitated by the LIR motif (Stadel2015TECPR2; Fraiberg2020Lysosomal). TECPR2 is also involved in the lysosomal targeting of autophagosomes, with its TECPR domain playing a key role in this process (Fraiberg2020Lysosomal).

Mutations in TECPR2, such as frameshift deletions, can lead to truncated and unstable protein variants, affecting its function and stability (TamimYecheskel2020A). These structural features and interactions highlight TECPR2's role as a scaffolding protein in various cellular processes.

## Function
The TECPR2 gene encodes the tectonin β-propeller containing protein 2, which plays a crucial role in autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export processes in healthy human cells. TECPR2 interacts with ATG8-family proteins, particularly LC3C, to regulate COPII-dependent ER export. It stabilizes SEC24D, a COPII coat protein, and is necessary for the correct assembly of COPII vesicles, which transport cargo from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Stadel2015TECPR2). TECPR2 acts as a multifunctional scaffold, interacting with SEC24D, HOPS, and BLOC-1, and is essential for maintaining protein levels of SEC24D and its partner SEC23A, which form the inner coat of COPII vesicles (Stadel2015TECPR2).

TECPR2 is also involved in autophagosome formation by stabilizing WIPI2, contributing to the formation of omegasomes and autophagosomes (Stadel2015TECPR2). It interacts with lipidated LC3C to facilitate efficient ER export of secretory cargo, and its dysfunction can lead to deregulation of SEC24D protein levels (Stadel2015TECPR2). TECPR2's role extends to stabilizing SEC23, affecting a broad range of cargo, and its depletion alters the subcellular distribution of its binding partners (Stadel2015TECPR2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TECPR2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to TECPR2 mutations is hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. This condition is caused by mutations that lead to a loss of function in the TECPR2 protein, disrupting autophagy and ER export processes, which are crucial for neuronal health (Stadel2015TECPR2; OzLevi2012Mutation). 

TECPR2 mutations also result in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy with intellectual disability (HSAN9). This condition is marked by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, and autonomic dysfunctions such as impaired temperature regulation and gastrointestinal motility (Neuser2021Clinical). The mutations often lead to a truncated protein that fails to interact properly with components of the secretory pathway, causing disturbances in protein trafficking and sorting (Nalbach2023Spatial).

In both HSP and HSAN9, the dysfunction in autophagy and protein trafficking due to TECPR2 mutations underscores the gene's critical role in maintaining neuronal integrity and function (Stadel2015TECPR2; TamimYecheskel2020A).

## Interactions
TECPR2 interacts with several proteins, particularly those involved in autophagy and membrane trafficking. It binds to members of the human ATG8 family, including GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3B, and MAP1LC3C, with a preference for the LC3 subfamily. These interactions are mediated through a canonical LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif at the C-terminus of TECPR2, which allows it to associate with ATG8 family members (Stadel2015TECPR2; Shalev2020Integrative).

TECPR2 also interacts with the COPII coat protein SEC24D, and this interaction is crucial for the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites and efficient ER export. The interaction with SEC24D is dependent on the presence of LC3C, highlighting the role of TECPR2 in stabilizing COPII components (Stadel2015TECPR2).

In addition, TECPR2 is involved with the HOPS complex, a key player in the endocytic pathway, and interacts with subunits such as VPS39 and VPS41. It also associates with the BLOC-1 complex, potentially recruiting it to membrane compartments in an LC3-dependent manner (Stadel2015TECPR2; Shalev2020Integrative). These interactions suggest TECPR2's role as a multifunctional scaffold protein, stabilizing its partners and preventing their degradation.
