# OVCH2

## Overview
OVCH2 is a gene that encodes the protein ovochymase 2, a protease involved in the male reproductive system. This protein is categorized as a protease due to its enzymatic activity in processing other proteins. Specifically, ovochymase 2 is secreted in the epididymis and is crucial for the maturation of sperm by processing the sperm surface protein ADAM3. This processing is essential for the sperm's ability to fertilize an egg, as it facilitates their passage through the uterotubal junction and binding to the zona pellucida. The gene's function is regulated through the lumicrine signaling pathway, involving the testis-secreted protein NELL2 and the ROS1 pathway, which are critical for epididymal differentiation and protease secretion. The absence of OVCH2 results in male infertility, underscoring its vital role in reproductive physiology (Kiyozumi2020NELL2mediated).

## Function
OVCH2, or ovochymase 2, is a protease that plays a critical role in the maturation of sperm in the male reproductive system. In healthy male mice, OVCH2 is secreted in the epididymis, where it is essential for the processing of the sperm surface protein ADAM3. This processing is crucial for sperm maturation and their ability to fertilize an egg. The absence of OVCH2 leads to impaired processing of ADAM3, resulting in male infertility due to the sperm's inability to pass through the uterotubal junction and bind to the zona pellucida (Kiyozumi2020NELL2mediated).

OVCH2 functions within the lumicrine signaling pathway, which involves the testis-secreted protein NELL2 signaling through the ROS1 pathway. This pathway regulates epididymal differentiation and the secretion of proteases like OVCH2, which are vital for the proper maturation of sperm and their fertilizing capability (Kiyozumi2020NELL2mediated). The activity of OVCH2 in the extracellular matrix suggests its involvement in tissue remodeling and cellular signaling, influencing various physiological processes (Kiyozumi2020NELL2mediated). This highlights the importance of OVCH2 in the male reproductive tract and suggests its potential role in processing other proteins necessary for sperm maturation.
