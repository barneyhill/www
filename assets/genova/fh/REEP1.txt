# REEP1

## Overview
REEP1 is a gene that encodes the receptor accessory protein 1, a member of the REEP/Yop1p family, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The REEP1 protein is characterized by its ability to induce high curvature and tubulization of the ER membrane, facilitated by its dual hairpin structure and reticulon homology domains (Angelotti2022Exploring). Additionally, REEP1 is involved in microtubule interactions, contributing to the alignment and distribution of ER tubules along the cytoskeleton, which is particularly important in neurons (Park2010Hereditary). Mutations in the REEP1 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its significance in maintaining neuronal structure and function (Shibata2024The). The protein's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative metabolism further underscores its role in cellular energy homeostasis and resistance to oxidative stress (Naef2023Converging).

## Structure
The REEP1 protein is characterized by its involvement in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is part of the REEP/Yop1p family. It features a dual hairpin structure with two conserved reticulon homology domains (RHD) that insert into the ER membrane, inducing high curvature and tubulization (Angelotti2022Exploring). The protein also contains a carboxy-terminal amphipathic helical domain (APH) that aligns parallel to the membrane, contributing to membrane destabilization and fusion (Angelotti2022Exploring).

REEP1 has a microtubule-binding domain (MTD) located between the RHD2 and APH, which facilitates interactions with microtubules (Angelotti2022Exploring). The protein's cytoplasmic carboxy terminus can bind to tubulin, suggesting a conserved microtubule-binding domain across REEP1-4 (Angelotti2022Exploring). Phosphorylation sites within the carboxy terminus are crucial for protein interactions, particularly with 14-3-3 proteins, and are necessary for forming higher-order oligomers (Angelotti2022Exploring).

Mutations in REEP1, particularly in the APH domain, can impair its ability to generate membrane curvature, leading to diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (Shibata2024The). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by its ability to homodimerize through its transmembrane domains (Shibata2024The).

## Function
REEP1 is a protein that plays a critical role in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and maintaining its structure in healthy human cells. It is part of the DP1/Yop1p protein family and is involved in generating high membrane curvature within the ER, which is essential for the formation of a unique vesicular compartment derived from the ER (Park2010Hereditary; Shibata2024The). REEP1 interacts with microtubules, facilitating the alignment of ER tubules along the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the distribution of the ER network, particularly in neurons with long axonal processes (Park2010Hereditary).

In addition to its structural role, REEP1 is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative metabolism. It interacts with proteins such as DRP1 and MFN2, which are essential for mitochondrial fission and fusion, respectively (Naef2023Converging). REEP1's function is significant in the context of oxidative stress, as it influences the bioenergetic capacity and metabolic functions of mitochondria, helping maintain cellular energy production and resistance to oxidative stress (Naef2023Converging). This protein is particularly enriched in neurons, where it contributes to maintaining axonal morphology and neuronal structure (Shibata2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the REEP1 gene are primarily associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), specifically spastic paraplegia 31 (SPG31). These mutations can include missense mutations, small insertions, deletions, and alterations affecting mRNA splicing and the 3′-UTR sequence, often leading to protein truncation and loss of function (Guglielmi2020A). Over twenty mutations in REEP1 have been linked to HSP, including point mutations and frameshifts that result in premature truncations of the carboxyl terminus, affecting protein interactions crucial for neuronal function (Björk2013REEPs).

REEP1 mutations can disrupt its interaction with microtubules and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network, leading to fewer interconnections in the ER and a more sheet-like appearance, which is significant in the pathogenesis of HSP (Park2010Hereditary). These mutations are also linked to distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis, indicating a broader impact on neurodegenerative conditions (Guglielmi2020A).

Patients with REEP1-related HSP often exhibit lower limb weakness, superficial sensory abnormalities, and neuropathy, with these symptoms being more frequent compared to other HSP-related mutations (Erfanian2019Genotype–phenotype). The genetic complexity and variability in clinical presentation highlight the significant role of REEP1 in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
REEP1 interacts with several proteins involved in hereditary spastic paraplegia, notably atlastin-1 and spastin. REEP1 and atlastin-1 colocalize in puncta along endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules, suggesting a direct interaction, which is confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation studies. Atlastin-1 interacts with REEP1 through its C-terminal fragment containing membrane-spanning segments. REEP1 also interacts with other atlastin family members, atlastin-2 and atlastin-3, which share similar membrane-spanning regions (Park2010Hereditary). 

The interaction of REEP1 with spastin is particularly significant with the M1 isoform of spastin, which colocalizes with REEP1 along bundled microtubules. M1 spastin is an integral membrane protein, and its interaction with REEP1 involves hydrophobic domains. These interactions are conserved across atlastin family members and species (Park2010Hereditary). 

REEP1 also plays a role in the ER-microtubule network, interacting with microtubules through its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This interaction is crucial for the distribution of the ER network, especially in long axonal processes of corticospinal motor neurons (Park2010Hereditary). 

Additionally, REEP1 interacts with proteins involved in ER shaping, such as reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, contributing to ER morphology and function (Park2010Hereditary).
