# CASK

## Overview
The CASK gene encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase, a multifunctional protein that is part of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This protein is characterized by its unique multi-domain structure, which includes a CaMK domain, two L27 domains, a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase domain. CASK functions as both a scaffolding protein and a kinase, playing a critical role in synaptic signaling, cell polarity, and membrane domain organization. It is involved in the assembly and localization of protein complexes at the plasma membrane, particularly in neural and epithelial cells. The protein's interactions with other synaptic proteins, such as neurexins and syndecans, are essential for its role in synaptic organization and transcriptional regulation. Mutations in the CASK gene are linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Pan2020Missense; Mori2023Diverse; Mukherjee2008CASK).

## Structure
The CASK protein is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and exhibits a unique multi-domain structure. It contains an N-terminal CaMK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase) domain, two L27 domains, a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase (GuK) domain (LaConte2013Structural; Mori2023Diverse). The CaMK domain is notable for its ability to function as a kinase without the typical requirement for Mg2+, due to substitutions in the Mg2+-coordinating residues, allowing it to bind ATP directly (Mukherjee2008CASK).

The PDZ domain is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in binding synaptic proteins such as neurexins and syndecans (LaConte2013Structural; Mukherjee2008CASK). The SH3 domain interacts with proline-rich regions, potentially regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Mori2023Diverse). The GuK domain is involved in binding transcription factors like TBR-1, influencing gene expression related to neuronal development (Mori2023Diverse).

CASK undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms that affect its interaction with other proteins and its structural conformation (Tibbe2021Functional). These splice variants are expressed in the fetal human brain and influence CASK's binding affinities and functional roles (Tibbe2021Functional).

## Function
The CASK gene encodes a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. CASK is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and functions as a scaffolding protein, organizing macromolecular complexes at specialized regions of the plasma membrane. It is involved in the targeting and localization of membrane-associated complexes, particularly in epithelial cells, where it localizes to the basolateral membrane and interacts with proteins such as syndecan-2 and protein 4.1, linking the extracellular matrix to the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Cohen1998Human).

CASK also exhibits kinase activity, functioning as a Mg2+-independent neurexin kinase. Its CaM-kinase domain can phosphorylate proteins like neurexin-1, which is crucial for synaptic function and development. This kinase activity is regulated by substrate recruitment through its PDZ domain, enhancing phosphorylation efficiency (Mukherjee2008CASK). CASK's dual role as a scaffolding protein and kinase integrates its functions in synaptic signaling, cell polarity, and membrane domain organization, contributing to normal cellular function and development (Mukherjee2008CASK; Nix2000hCASK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CASK gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily affecting brain development and function. These disorders include microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), and various epileptic syndromes such as Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (Mori2023Diverse). MICPCH is often linked to loss-of-function mutations, such as nonsense or frameshift mutations, which lead to more severe phenotypes, while XLID is associated with hypomorphic missense mutations (Mori2023Diverse).

CASK mutations can also result in congenital nystagmus, optic nerve hypoplasia, and sensorineural hearing loss (Najm2008Mutations; Hackett2009CASK). The gene's involvement in synaptic function and protein interactions, such as with neurexin and T-box transcription factor-1 (TBR1), is crucial for normal brain development. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to imbalances in synaptic inputs, contributing to the pathogenesis of epilepsy and intellectual disability (Pan2020Missense; Mori2023Diverse).

The clinical presentation of CASK-related disorders varies widely, influenced by the type of mutation and the patient's gender, with X chromosome inactivation playing a role in females (Mori2023Diverse; Zhang2022A).

## Interactions
CASK, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synaptic organization and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with Neurexin-1β through its PDZ domain, a binding that is essential for CASK's oligomerization and presynaptic localization (Pan2020Missense). Mutations such as G521V, Y723C, and W914R disrupt this interaction, affecting synapse development (Pan2020Missense).

CASK also forms complexes with Tbr1 and CINAP, linking it to transcriptional control in the nucleus. The Y723C and W914R mutations increase binding to CINAP but reduce binding to Tbr1, affecting transcriptional regulation (Pan2020Missense). The interaction with Tbr1 is crucial for nuclear translocation and gene expression regulation, as seen with the T724A mutation, which disrupts these processes (Huang2009CASK).

CASK interacts with SAP97, influencing postsynaptic receptor targeting, and with Liprin-α2, which is important for presynaptic scaffolding (Pan2020Missense). It also associates with GRIP1, PKCe, and RGS4, contributing to synaptic signaling through specific domain interactions (Hong2006CASK). These interactions highlight CASK's multifaceted role in neural function.
