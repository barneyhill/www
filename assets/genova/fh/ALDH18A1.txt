# ALDH18A1

## Overview
The ALDH18A1 gene encodes the enzyme Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), a bifunctional mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in amino acid biosynthesis, particularly in the conversion of glutamate to proline, ornithine, and arginine. This enzyme is categorized as a synthetase due to its role in catalyzing the formation of glutamate-5-semialdehyde, a precursor in the biosynthetic pathways of these amino acids. The ALDH18A1 gene is evolutionarily conserved across species, reflecting its essential function in cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with a range of genetic disorders, including cutis laxa and hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its clinical significance (Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate; Handley2014Loss). The enzyme's activity is integral to maintaining cellular antioxidant capacity and energy metabolism, further underscoring its importance in human health (Colonna2022Functional).

## Structure
The ALDH18A1 gene encodes a bifunctional mitochondrial enzyme involved in the conversion of glutamate to glutamyl semialdehyde, which is further converted into proline, ornithine, and arginine. The enzyme features two main domains: the glutamate 5-kinase (G5K) domain and the gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR) domain. The G5K domain includes 12 α-helices and 9 β-sheets, while the GPR domain comprises 18 α-helices and 15 β-sheets, both of which are crucial for substrate binding and transition state stabilization (Holmes2017Comparative).

The ALDH18A1 protein is derived from a gene fusion event involving bacterial ProB and ProA genes, resulting in the formation of the G5K-GPR gene. This fusion has led to a high degree of sequence identity across vertebrates and invertebrates, with conserved sequences in both domains (Holmes2017Comparative). The gene produces two major isoforms, ALDH18A1.long and ALDH18A1.short, which differ by a dipeptide sequence (Asn239-Val240) in the G5K domain. The long isoform is widely distributed across tissues, while the short isoform is expressed in gut cells and is inhibited by L-ornithine (Holmes2017Comparative).

## Function
The ALDH18A1 gene encodes the enzyme Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), which is crucial for the biosynthesis of proline and ornithine from glutamate in healthy human cells (Bicknell2008A; Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate). P5CS catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to glutamate-5-semialdehyde, which can be further converted to proline or ornithine. This process is essential for maintaining adequate levels of these amino acids, which are important for various metabolic functions, including protein synthesis and the urea cycle (Coutelier2015Alteration; Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate).

In enterocytes, P5CS is involved in ornithine synthesis, which is regulated by feedback inhibition by ornithine. In non-enteric cells, P5CS primarily facilitates proline synthesis (Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate). The enzyme is localized to the mitochondria, where it plays a role in forming homo-oligomers necessary for its function (Colonna2022Functional). P5CS activity is linked to the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and energy metabolism, affecting the expression of TCA cycle genes and other metabolic pathways (Colonna2022Functional). The enzyme's function is also associated with maintaining cellular antioxidant capacity, as it is involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione, a critical antioxidant (Colonna2022Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH18A1 gene are linked to a variety of genetic disorders, primarily affecting the skin and nervous system. Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type IIIA (ARCL3A) is associated with biallelic mutations in ALDH18A1, leading to symptoms such as loose skin, mental disability, and growth restrictions (Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate; Handley2014Loss). A dominant form, autosomal dominant cutis laxa type III (ADCL3), results from monoallelic mutations (Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate).

ALDH18A1 mutations also cause hereditary spastic paraplegia, with SPG9A being dominantly inherited and SPG9B recessively inherited. These conditions are characterized by progressive gait abnormalities and neurological symptoms (Chen2021Novel; Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate). The gene is also implicated in severe congenital cutis laxa with cardiovascular manifestations, where mutations lead to frameshifts and premature termination codons, resulting in reduced protein expression (Fischer2014Severe).

Additionally, ALDH18A1 mutations are linked to a neurocutaneous syndrome with connective tissue abnormalities and neurodevelopmental delays (Bicknell2008A). The gene's dysfunction is associated with altered lipid droplet formation, suggesting a link to mitochondrial dysfunction (Handley2014Loss). These mutations can lead to a spectrum of disorders with varying severity, often due to progressive loss of enzyme function (Marco‐Marín2020Δ1‐Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate).

## Interactions
ALDH18A1, also known as pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), is involved in several interactions that influence its function and regulation. In the context of neuroblastoma, ALDH18A1 interacts with the MYCN oncogene, forming a positive feedback loop. MYCN directly binds to the ALDH18A1 promoter, enhancing its expression, which in turn supports MYCN amplification. This interaction is confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which demonstrate N-MYC binding to the ALDH18A1 promoter (Guo2020Inhibition).

ALDH18A1 also regulates MYCN expression through a miRNA network, particularly involving miR-29b, miR-29a, and miR-193b. These miRNAs are implicated in the posttranscriptional modulation of MYCN expression, suggesting a complex regulatory network (Guo2020Inhibition). The miR-29b/SP1 autoregulatory loop is another mechanism through which ALDH18A1 influences MYCN expression, as SP1 targets the MYCN promoter (Guo2020Inhibition).

In hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG9, specific mutations in ALDH18A1 affect the enzyme's conformational changes during catalysis, although these mutations do not directly involve interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Magini2019P5CS).
