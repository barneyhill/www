# BMF

## Overview
BMF (Bcl2 modifying factor) is a gene that encodes a pro-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family, specifically classified as a BH3-only protein. The BMF protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, by interacting with and antagonizing prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins. This interaction is mediated through its BH3 domain, which is essential for its apoptotic function. BMF is typically sequestered in the cytoskeleton under normal conditions but translocates to the mitochondria in response to cellular stress signals, where it promotes apoptosis. The protein is also involved in various cellular stress responses, including anoikis and autophagy, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and hematological disorders (Morales2003Expression; Contreras2013Deacetylation; Grespi2010BH3only).

## Structure
BMF (Bcl2 modifying factor) is a pro-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family, characterized by its intrinsically unstructured nature. In solution, BMF lacks a well-defined secondary or tertiary structure, existing primarily in a random coil conformation. However, upon binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, the BH3 domain of BMF undergoes a conformational change, adopting an alpha-helical structure (Hinds2006Bim). This structural transition is typical of intrinsically unstructured proteins, which gain structure upon interaction with binding partners (Hinds2006Bim).

BMF contains a BH3 domain, which is crucial for its apoptotic function. This domain is a weakly conserved motif that includes hydrophobic residues and a specific sequence, LXXXGDE, essential for binding to other Bcl-2 family proteins (Hinds2006Bim). BMF exists in multiple isoforms, including Bmf CUG and Bmf S, which arise from alternative translation start sites. These isoforms have different N-terminal lengths but share similar apoptotic potential and subcellular localization (Grespi2010BH3only). The interaction of BMF with dynein light chain proteins, such as DYNLL1 and DYNLL2, promotes its dimerization and complex formation, which can stabilize its structure and function (Singh2019Dynein).

## Function
The BMF gene encodes a BH3-only protein that is a member of the Bcl-2 family, which plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis. In healthy human cells, BMF is typically sequestered to the cytoskeleton by binding to dynein light chain 2 (DLC2). Upon receiving stress signals, such as loss of cell attachment or serum deprivation, BMF is released and translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it binds to and antagonizes prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins, thereby promoting apoptosis (Morales2003Expression; Grespi2010BH3only).

BMF is involved in various cellular stress responses, including those that inhibit cap-dependent protein synthesis, such as hypoxia and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Under these conditions, BMF can be translated in a cap-independent manner, allowing it to act as a sentinel for stress-impaired protein translation machinery (Grespi2010BH3only). BMF also plays a role in anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for preventing detached cells from colonizing elsewhere (Piñon2008Bim).

In addition to its pro-apoptotic functions, BMF is implicated in the regulation of autophagy. Its expression is suppressed by IFN-γ in a p53-dependent manner, facilitating autophagy by reducing the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 (Contreras2013Deacetylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the BMF gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, BMF expression is crucial for inducing apoptosis in E-cadherin-negative cells, which are resistant to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death. The loss of E-cadherin leads to reduced BMF expression, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis by promoting anoikis resistance (Hornsveld2016Restraining). In melanoma, BMF plays a role in apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition. Its translocation to the cytosol is associated with increased apoptosis in sensitive melanoma cell lines, while its sequestration in resistant lines correlates with reduced apoptosis. This suggests that BMF localization is critical for its pro-apoptotic function in melanoma (VanBrocklin2009MitogenActivated).

BMF is also implicated in bone marrow failure (BMF) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Genetic analyses have identified mutations in BMF-related pathways in patients with these conditions, highlighting its role in hematological disorders (Zhang2014Genomic). These findings underscore the importance of BMF in regulating apoptosis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and hematological diseases.

## Interactions
BMF (Bcl2 modifying factor) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that interacts with various proteins to regulate apoptosis. BMF primarily interacts with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1, through its BH3 domain. These interactions are crucial for its pro-apoptotic activity, as BMF can inactivate these proteins, thereby promoting apoptosis (Grespi2010BH3only; Singh2019Dynein).

BMF also interacts with the dynein light chain (DYNLL), forming complexes that influence its stability and function. This interaction does not enhance BMF's binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins but is significant for its posttranslational stability, preventing degradation by the 20S proteasome (Singh2019Dynein). BMF can form ternary complexes with another BH3-only protein, Bim, and DYNLL, which are important for its apoptotic function (Singh2019Dynein).

Phosphorylation of BMF by p38 MAPK at specific sites, such as T72, disrupts its interaction with DLC2, a protein that sequesters BMF to the myosin V motor complex. This phosphorylation leads to BMF's translocation to mitochondria, enhancing its apoptotic activity (Zhi2021Noncanonical).
