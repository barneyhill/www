# CCDC88C

## Overview
The CCDC88C gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 88C protein, commonly referred to as DAPLE, which is a member of the hook-related protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a conserved N-terminal domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. DAPLE plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly in the non-canonical branch, where it regulates planar cell polarity and influences cell motility and polarity through interactions with proteins such as Dishevelled and G proteins. The protein's ability to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and its involvement in glycosylation processes underscore its significance in cellular architecture and neural development. Mutations in CCDC88C have been linked to neurological disorders, including congenital hydrocephalus and spinocerebellar ataxia, highlighting its clinical importance (Ruggeri2018Bi‐allelic; Tsoi2014A; Drielsma2012Two).

## Structure
The CCDC88C gene encodes the DAPLE protein, which is 2028 amino acids long and is part of the hook-related protein family. The protein structure includes a conserved N-terminal domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. The N-terminal domain contains a Hook domain, which is proposed to link organelles to microtubules, a characteristic of the HOOK protein family (Drielsma2012Two). The central coiled-coil domain is rich in leucine residues and contains three leucine zipper domains, showing homology to the myosin heavy chain, which allows DAPLE to homooligomerize (Drielsma2012Two). The C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif consists of the amino acids Gly-Cys-Val, which is crucial for binding the PDZ domain of Dishevelled, a scaffold protein in the Wnt signaling pathway (Ruggeri2018Bi‐allelic). This motif is essential for the protein's function in inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway and enhancing the non-canonical pathway by facilitating trimeric G protein activation (Ruggeri2018Bi‐allelic). Mutations in this region can disrupt these interactions, affecting Wnt signaling and contributing to congenital hydrocephalus (Drielsma2012Two).

## Function
The CCDC88C gene encodes the DAPLE protein, which plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly in the non-canonical branch. DAPLE is involved in regulating planar cell polarity, a process crucial for the proper orientation and function of cells, especially in ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles. This regulation is essential for the coordinated beating of cilia, which facilitates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, preventing conditions such as hydrocephalus (Takagishi2017Daple; Ruggeri2018Bi‐allelic).

DAPLE interacts with the Dishevelled protein through its PDZ-binding motif, inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway and promoting the non-canonical pathway. This interaction is vital for the activation of small GTPases like Rac, which are involved in cell migration and polarity (Marguet2021Neuropathological; Drielsma2012Two). The protein also contains a Gα-binding-and-activating (GBA) motif, which allows it to activate G proteins independently of GPCRs, contributing to apical cell constriction during embryonic development (Marivin2019GPCRindependent).

In healthy cells, DAPLE is active in the cytoplasm and at apical cell junctions, where it influences cell shape and tissue organization, playing a critical role in neural development and maintaining cellular architecture (Marivin2019GPCRindependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC88C gene are associated with several neurological disorders. Bi-allelic mutations in CCDC88C are a rare cause of severe congenital hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain damage. These mutations typically result in the loss of function of the protein due to truncation of binding motifs necessary for proper Wnt signaling, disrupting the PDZ binding site essential for DAPLE-DVl association. This disruption impairs cerebrospinal fluid flow, contributing to hydrocephalus and associated symptoms such as seizures and intellectual and motor delays (Marguet2021Neuropathological; Ruggeri2018Bi‐allelic).

In addition to hydrocephalus, a heterozygous mutation in CCDC88C has been linked to adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), specifically SCA40. This dominant form of SCA is associated with a missense mutation that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, leading to neuronal cell death and apoptosis. The mutation results in JNK hyperphosphorylation, which is implicated in cerebellar atrophy and the manifestation of ataxia symptoms (Tsoi2014A). These findings highlight the gene's role in different conditions depending on the nature of the mutation.

## Interactions
CCDC88C, also known as Daple, is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the G protein Gαi through its C-terminally located Gα-binding and activating (GBA) motif, facilitating non-canonical activation of Gαi (Dunkel2018Two). CCDC88C also interacts with the Wnt signaling protein Dishevelled (Dvl) via its PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which is crucial for activating the non-canonical Wnt/Rac pathway that regulates cell motility (Deng2024CCDC88C). 

The protein competes with Dvl for binding to Frizzled receptors, forming complexes with Gαi, which enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling (Deng2024CCDC88C). CCDC88C is also an O-GalNAc glycosylation substrate of GALNT6, which maintains its stability and promotes cell motility through glycosylation (Deng2024CCDC88C). This interaction is crucial for breast cancer cell migration and invasion, as GALNT6 enhances CCDC88C protein stability (Deng2024CCDC88C). 

These interactions highlight CCDC88C's role in modulating signaling pathways that influence cell behavior, particularly in the context of cancer metastasis and tumor suppression.
