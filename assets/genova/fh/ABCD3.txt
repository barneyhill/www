# ABCD3

## Overview
The ABCD3 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 3 protein, which is a type-IV ABC transporter located in the peroxisomal membrane. This protein plays a critical role in the transport of long-chain and branched-chain acyl-CoA molecules into peroxisomes, facilitating the β-oxidation of fatty acids, a vital metabolic process in lipid metabolism (Morita2012Peroxisomal). Structurally, ABCD3 forms a homodimer and features a nucleotide-binding domain and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for its function as a transporter (Li2024Structural). The gene's expression is regulated by PPARα and can be induced by fibrates, underscoring its importance in hepatic lipid metabolism (Morita2012Peroxisomal). Clinically, mutations in ABCD3 are associated with conditions such as oculopharyngodistal myopathy and have implications in colorectal cancer prognosis, highlighting its significance in both neuromuscular and oncological contexts (Cortese2024A; Zhang2020Abnormal).

## Structure
The ABCD3 protein is a type-IV ABC transporter that forms a two-fold symmetric homodimer, essential for its function as a transporter in the peroxisomal membrane (Li2024Structural). Each subunit of ABCD3 contains a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD). The TMD is composed of six transmembrane helices (TMs), which are tightly packed in the peroxisomal membrane leaflet but separate into two TM bundles in the cytosolic membrane leaflet (Li2024Structural). A notable structural feature is the domain swapping of helices TM4 and TM5 between the TMDs, a characteristic typical of type-IV ABC transporters (Li2024Structural).

The NBDs of ABCD3 exhibit a canonical fold but lack the crossover helix pair found in ABCD1, correlating with a higher basal ATPase activity in ABCD3 (Li2024Structural). Upon ATP binding, ABCD3 adopts an open conformation towards the peroxisome, with the NBDs dimerizing in a 'head-to-tail' mode (Li2024Structural). The ATP molecules are sandwiched between the Walker A motif from one NBD and the ABC signature motif from the other, inducing conformational changes that are transferred to the TMDs via coupling helices (Li2024Structural). These structural insights are crucial for understanding the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of ABCD3.

## Function
ABCD3, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, is primarily located in the peroxisomal membrane and plays a crucial role in the transport of long-chain and branched-chain acyl-CoA molecules into peroxisomes. This transport is essential for the β-oxidation of fatty acids, a key metabolic process in lipid metabolism (Morita2012Peroxisomal). ABCD3 is involved in the transport of specific acyl-CoA derivatives, including trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA (THCA-CoA) and dihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA (DHCA-CoA), which are intermediates in bile acid synthesis (Morita2012Peroxisomal). 

In healthy human cells, ABCD3 functions as an ATP-dependent pump, capturing acyl-CoA derivatives from the cytosolic side and transporting them into the peroxisome lumen through ATP-driven conformational changes (Morita2012Peroxisomal). This activity is vital for maintaining normal cellular function and metabolic processes, as evidenced by the accumulation of bile acid precursors and reduced β-oxidation of certain fatty acids in ABCD3-deficient models (Morita2012Peroxisomal). The expression of ABCD3 is regulated by PPARα and can be induced by fibrates, highlighting its role in hepatic lipid metabolism (Morita2012Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABCD3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A notable condition linked to ABCD3 is oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM), particularly in individuals of European ancestry. This condition is caused by a CCG repeat expansion in the 5′-UTR of the ABCD3 gene, leading to increased expression of the ABCD3 transcript. OPDM is characterized by symptoms such as ptosis, dysphagia, and distal muscle weakness, with muscle biopsies showing rimmed vacuoles and intranuclear inclusions (Cortese2024A). The repeat expansion is larger in affected individuals, especially females, and is associated with a shared ancestral haplotype (Cortese2024A).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ABCD3 expression levels are altered, with mRNA levels significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This reduced expression is linked to poorer prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC patients. High ABCD3 expression is associated with biological processes like apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Zhang2020Abnormal). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ABCD3 in both neuromuscular and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
ABCD3, a peroxisomal membrane transporter, is known to interact with various proteins, influencing its function in cellular processes. In bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), ABCD3 interacts with the INTS7 protein. This interaction is significant for the proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of BM-MSCs, primarily by suppressing oxidative stress. The interaction between INTS7 and ABCD3 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, highlighting its role in cellular viability and differentiation pathways (Liu2021INTS7–ABCD3).

ABCD3 does not appear to have direct interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins in the context of its structural role in peroxisomal acyl-CoA translocation. Structural studies have focused on its interaction with substrates like phytanoyl-CoA and ATP, which are crucial for its function in transporting fatty acids into peroxisomes. These interactions involve specific binding patterns and conformational changes necessary for substrate translocation, but do not involve other proteins or nucleic acids (Li2024Structural).

Overall, ABCD3's interactions are primarily related to its functional role in cellular metabolism and differentiation, with significant implications for oxidative stress regulation and substrate transport.
