# ZNF616

## Overview
ZNF616 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 616, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. The ZNF616 gene is located on chromosome 19 and has been associated with various biological processes, including epigenetic regulation and cancer pathogenesis. Research has indicated that ZNF616 may play a role in the development or progression of certain tumors, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and may also be involved in sex-specific epigenetic modifications (Kang2015Integrated; Luijk2018Autosomal). Despite these associations, the detailed mechanisms by which ZNF616 influences these processes remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The ZNF616 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), ZNF616 is located in chromosomal regions with recurrent copy number alterations, suggesting its potential involvement in tumor development or progression (Kang2015Integrated). However, the specific clinical significance of ZNF616 mutations or expression changes in GISTs remains unclear.

In the study of autosomal genetic variation and DNA methylation, a variant near the ZNF616 gene was identified as having female-specific effects on X-chromosome DNA methylation. This variant did not show significant interaction effects in males but had consistent effects across the X-chromosome in females, indicating a possible role in sex-specific epigenetic regulation (Luijk2018Autosomal).

While these studies suggest a potential role for ZNF616 in disease, particularly in cancer and epigenetic regulation, the precise clinical implications of its mutations or expression alterations require further investigation. The current research highlights the need for more detailed studies to understand the impact of ZNF616 on disease pathogenesis and progression.
