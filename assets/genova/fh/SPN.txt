# SPN

## Overview
The SPN gene encodes the protein sialophorin, also known as CD43, which is a transmembrane protein prominently expressed on the surface of leukocytes. Sialophorin plays a crucial role in modulating immune cell interactions and responses, primarily through its involvement in cell adhesion and migration. It is characterized by its antiadhesive properties, which are mediated by sialylated glycans that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as Siglec-7 and members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton (Decker2019Genomescale; Yoshimura2021Identification). These interactions are significant in the context of immune responses and cancer, where SPN's expression and glycosylation can influence the efficacy of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, SPN is located within the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, which is associated with various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential clinical significance in both cancer and immune-related conditions (Giannuzzi2022Possible; Leone2024Understanding).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The SPN gene, also known as sialophorin or CD43, plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and has been implicated in various clinical conditions. Alterations in SPN expression can impact the efficacy of CD3 bispecific antibodies (bsAb) used in cancer immunotherapy. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SPN is highly expressed and modified by sialylated core 2 O-glycans, which may confer anti-adhesive properties that limit T cell-tumor cell interactions, thereby reducing T cell-mediated tumor cell killing. Knockout of SPN in AML cell lines has been shown to enhance T cell clustering and tumor cell lysis, suggesting that SPN acts as a barrier to effective immune response (Decker2019Genomescale).

SPN is also located within the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, which is associated with various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Copy number variations (CNVs) in this region, including those affecting SPN, have been linked to altered leukocyte counts, such as lymphopenia and neutropenia, potentially contributing to immune system dysfunction (Giannuzzi2022Possible; Leone2024Understanding). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of SPN in both cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
SPN, also known as sialophorin or CD43, is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins. It acts as a counter-receptor for Siglec-7 on K562 cells, a human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of sialylated glycans on SPN, which contribute to its antiadhesive properties. The binding between Siglec-7 and SPN involves polyvalent glycans, and the interaction is stronger when a cluster of ligands is involved (Yoshimura2021Identification).

SPN also interacts with proteins such as ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family members, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton. This connection influences cell adhesion and migration, playing a role in immune responses. In the context of cancer, SPN's expression and glycosylation can modulate interactions with T cells, affecting the efficacy of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. For instance, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SPN's anti-adhesive properties limit tumor cell clustering with T cells, thereby reducing the efficacy of CD3 bispecific antibody-mediated T cell killing (Decker2019Genomescale). These interactions highlight SPN's role in modulating immune cell behavior and its potential impact on cancer therapies.
