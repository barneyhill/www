# TAP2

## Overview
The TAP2 gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex, which plays a crucial role in the immune system. TAP2 is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and functions as a transmembrane protein. It forms a heterodimer with TAP1, facilitating the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process is essential for the loading of peptides onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are then presented on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells. The TAP2 protein's structure includes a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domain, both of which are critical for its function in peptide translocation and immune surveillance (Koch2004Functional; Abele2004The). Deficiencies or mutations in TAP2 can lead to impaired immune function, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Matamoros2001Molecular; LankatButtgereit2002The).

## Structure
The TAP2 protein is a component of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. It forms a heterodimer with TAP1, essential for antigen processing. TAP2 consists of 686 amino acids and includes a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) and a hydrophilic, highly conserved cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (Koch2004Functional). The TMD of TAP2 is predicted to have nine transmembrane segments, which are crucial for peptide translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Koch2004Functional; Abele2004The).

The N-terminal domain of TAP2 is unique and plays roles in ER targeting, assembly, stabilization of the TAP complex, peptide binding and transport, and interaction with viral inhibitors (Koch2004Functional). The C-terminal tail of TAP2 is crucial for its ATP binding and catalytic function, influencing the nucleotide binding states and transport activity (Bouabe2003The). TAP2's ATP binding site is characterized by slow nucleotide dissociation kinetics, and its C loop, which interacts with ATP's γ-phosphate, is degenerated compared to other ABC transporters (Abele2004The).

Post-translational modifications of TAP2 include glycosylation, which is common among ABC transporters. The structural organization of TAP2, including its interaction with tapasin, is crucial for its role in the peptide-loading complex essential for MHC I antigen presentation (Abele2004The).

## Function
The TAP2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex, which is essential for the immune system's function. TAP2, along with TAP1, forms a heterodimeric complex that facilitates the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function; LankatButtgereit2002The). This process is crucial for the loading of peptides onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are then presented on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells, enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate infected or malignant cells (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function; Matamoros2001Molecular).

The TAP complex is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, and its function is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis, which induce conformational changes necessary for peptide transport (Abele2004The; Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function). The transmembrane domains of TAP1 and TAP2 are involved in peptide binding and transport, with the complex showing a preference for peptides with specific amino acid characteristics (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function). The proper function of TAP2 is vital for maintaining immune surveillance and response, as deficiencies or mutations can lead to impaired immune function, such as in Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome type I (Matamoros2001Molecular; LankatButtgereit2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TAP2 gene can lead to a condition known as type I bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS), characterized by a significant reduction in the expression of HLA class I molecules on the cell surface. This deficiency results in recurrent bacterial infections, particularly affecting the respiratory tract, and can also cause necrotizing granulomatous skin lesions. Despite the impaired antigen presentation, patients with TAP2 deficiencies typically do not suffer from severe viral infections, likely due to compensatory immune mechanisms (Zimmer2005Clinical; Gadola2000TAP).

TAP2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Specifically, the TAP2-665 GG genotype has been linked to a significantly higher risk of these conditions (OzbasGerceker2013Association).

In addition, rare missense variants in TAP2 have been implicated in autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, within certain populations. These variants may disrupt normal protein interactions and antigen processing pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases (Alharthi2022Complex).

## Interactions
TAP2, a component of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex, engages in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in the immune system. TAP2 forms a heterodimer with TAP1, facilitating the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading onto MHC class I molecules, a key step in antigen presentation (Hulpke2012Direct). The N-terminal domain of TAP2, known as TMD0, acts as an autonomous interaction scaffold, independently interacting with tapasin, a crucial adapter molecule in the peptide-loading complex. This interaction occurs in a 1:1 stoichiometry, even in the absence of known ER retention signals, highlighting the role of TMD0 as an interaction hub in the antigen-processing machinery (Hulpke2012Direct).

TAP2 also interacts with viral proteins that can inhibit its function. Viral proteins such as ICP47, US6, UL49.5, BNLF2a, and CPXV012 target TAP transporters to block peptide translocation, thereby affecting MHC-I-peptide assembly in the ER (Padariya2021Structural). These interactions are influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms and cancer-associated mutations, which can alter TAP2's structural stability and binding affinity (Padariya2021Structural). TAP2 mutations, such as R373H, can affect peptide binding and transport processes, further impacting its interactions with TAP1 and other proteins (Padariya2021Structural).
