# KRTAP10-1

## Overview
KRTAP10-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-1, which is a member of the KAP10 family. This protein is primarily involved in the structural integrity and function of hair, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. The KRTAP10-1 protein is characterized by a high sulfur content due to cysteine residues, which facilitate disulfide bond formation, and is noted for its evolutionary conservation across species, indicating its fundamental role in hair development (Litman2023Ancient; Rogers2006Human). The gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3 and is part of the M lineage of keratin-associated proteins, which are specifically expressed in the hair cortex and have evolutionary roots linked to metallothionein (Litman2023Ancient). KRTAP10-1 has also been implicated in various clinical conditions, including osteosarcoma and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms and as a biomarker (Zhang2018Analyzing; Albawardi2021Copy).

## Structure
The KRTAP10-1 gene encodes a keratin-associated protein that is part of the KAP10 family, located on chromosome 21q22.3. The proteins in this family are characterized by a high sulfur content, primarily due to the presence of cysteine residues, which facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds. The primary structure of KRTAP10-1 includes a pentameric repeat structure with monocysteine and dicysteine repeats, accounting for 24.3-27.4 mol% of the protein. It also contains a significant amount of serine (19.3-22.3 mol%), along with proline, alanine, and valine (Rogers2006Human).

The secondary structure of KRTAP10-1 likely involves alpha-helices, a common feature in keratin-associated proteins, although specific details are not provided in the available literature. The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the context provided. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, but specific modifications for KRTAP10-1 are not mentioned in the sources. The protein's structure is strongly homologous to sheep KRTAP10-1, indicating evolutionary conservation across species (Rogers2006Human). The KAP10 family, including KRTAP10-1, is noted for encoding some of the largest known KAP proteins (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP10-1, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair. This protein is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the integrity and texture of hair fibers by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that provides mechanical strength and resilience (Litman2023Ancient). The KRTAP10 family, to which KRTAP10-1 belongs, is characterized by its specific expression in a narrow region of the hair fiber cuticle, indicating its specialized role in hair structure (Litman2023Ancient).

KRTAP10-1 is part of the M lineage of KRTAPs, which is more associated with hair-specific expression and has evolutionary roots linked to metallothionein, a protein known for its role in metal ion binding and detoxification (Litman2023Ancient). This lineage is conserved across species, highlighting its importance in hair development and maintenance (Litman2023Ancient). The presence of KRTAP10-1-like proteins in non-mammalian organisms suggests that these proteins have ancient evolutionary origins and may have been co-opted for hair production in mammals (Litman2023Ancient).

## Clinical Significance
The KRTAP10-1 gene has been implicated in several conditions due to its mutations and alterations. In osteosarcoma, KRTAP10-1 is identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Zhang2018Analyzing). The gene also exhibits a high mutation rate in carotid paragangliomas, although its specific role in tumorigenesis is not fully understood (Snezhkina2019Novel). 

In the context of genetic polymorphisms, KRTAP10-1 is associated with triple nucleotide polymorphisms (TNPs) in exonic regions. These TNPs, found in multiple exomes, are generally considered benign, but they highlight the gene's variability and potential impact on protein function (Rosenfeld2010Novel). 

Furthermore, copy number alterations in the KRTAP10 family, including KRTAP10-1, have been observed in prostate cancer, particularly in individuals of African ancestry. This suggests a possible link between KRTAP10-1 and cancer susceptibility or progression, although specific clinical implications remain unclear (Albawardi2021Copy). 

Overall, while KRTAP10-1 is associated with various conditions, further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.
