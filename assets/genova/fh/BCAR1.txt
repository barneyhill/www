# BCAR1

## Overview
BCAR1, also known as Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 1, is a gene that encodes the p130Cas protein, a member of the CAS family of scaffold proteins. The p130Cas protein is a crucial component in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in cell adhesion, migration, and mechanotransduction. As a scaffold protein, p130Cas facilitates the assembly of multi-protein complexes, playing a pivotal role in signal transduction processes that regulate cell motility, survival, and proliferation. It is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a substrate-binding domain with multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with various signaling molecules. The phosphorylation of p130Cas is essential for its function in focal adhesion dynamics and integrin-mediated signaling, impacting processes such as chemotaxis and apoptosis. BCAR1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in normal cellular functions and its potential implications in cancer progression and metastasis (Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1; Tikhmyanova2009CAS; Camacho2015p130CasBCAR1).

## Structure
The BCAR1 protein, also known as p130Cas, is a member of the CAS family of scaffold proteins. It is composed of 870 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa, which is higher than predicted due to extensive phosphorylation (Tikhmyanova2009CAS). The protein features several key domains: an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a large substrate-binding domain with 15 repetitions of the YxxP motif, a proline and serine-rich region, and a C-terminal domain with a highly conserved four-helix bundle known as the Focal Adhesion Targeting (FAT) domain (Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1; Camacho2015p130CasBCAR1).

The SH3 domain binds to polyproline motifs in protein substrates and is involved in interactions with focal adhesion proteins like FAK and vinculin, playing a crucial role in mechanosensing (Camacho2015p130CasBCAR1). The substrate domain is intrinsically unstructured and contains multiple tyrosine residues that undergo phosphorylation, enabling interactions with proteins possessing SH2 domains (Tikhmyanova2009CAS). Phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is essential for BCAR1's role in signal transduction, affecting cell motility, adhesion, and survival (Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1). The protein's localization to focal adhesions and potentially to cell-cell junctions and the nucleus is influenced by its phosphorylation state (Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

## Function
BCAR1, also known as p130Cas, is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. It is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion turnover, which is crucial for cell movement, and acts as a mechanosensor, responding to extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity and tension (Tikhmyanova2009CAS). BCAR1 is phosphorylated by FAK and SRC kinases during cell attachment, creating binding sites for adaptor proteins like CRK and CRKL, which recruit other molecules leading to the activation of RAC, a small GTPase. This activation results in membrane ruffling, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and cell migration (Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

BCAR1 is also involved in integrin-mediated signaling, particularly in immune cells, and plays a role in chemotaxis, apoptosis, and anoikis (Tikhmyanova2009CAS). It acts as a scaffold for proteins necessary to support ERK1/2 activation, crucial for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Tikhmyanova2009CAS). In the context of bone metabolism, BCAR1 functions as a mechanosensor in osteoclasts and osteocytes, regulating bone resorption and remodeling (Jimi2022The). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in normal cell function, particularly in response to mechanical and chemical signals from the environment (Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

## Clinical Significance
The BCAR1 gene, encoding the p130Cas protein, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In breast cancer, BCAR1 supports ErbB2 downstream signaling, promoting invasion and metastasis, and is associated with resistance to tamoxifen in HER2+ subtypes (Zhu2022Novel; Camacho2015p130CasBCAR1). In prostate cancer, high BCAR1 expression correlates with disease progression and early PSA recurrence, particularly in ERG-negative cases, and is linked to aggressive tumor features and genomic instability (Heumann2018High).

In lung cancer, BCAR1 is often overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhu2022Novel; Jiang2020High). BCAR1 mutations have also been reported to contribute to ovarian cancer susceptibility and are linked to poor clinical outcomes (Zhu2022Novel; Camacho2015p130CasBCAR1).

Overall, BCAR1 plays a significant role in cancer cell growth and invasion, suggesting that its down-regulation could be a therapeutic strategy (Camacho2015p130CasBCAR1).

## Interactions
The BCAR1 gene encodes the p130Cas protein, which is a scaffold protein involved in forming multi-protein signaling complexes. It has a modular structure with various binding motifs, allowing it to interact with multiple proteins. The p130Cas protein includes an N-terminal Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, a substrate-binding domain with 15 YxxP motifs for tyrosine phosphorylation, and a C-terminal domain with binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domains of Src. These structural features enable p130Cas to interact with proteins such as Crk, Crk-L, CRKII, Nck, FAK, PYK2/RAFTK, FRNK kinases, PTP1B, PTP-PEST phosphatases, and others like C3G, CMS, CIZ, and Vinculin (Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1).

In the context of breast cancer, p130Cas rapidly and transiently associates with estrogen receptor alpha in a complex that includes Src kinase and the p85 subunit of PI3K, which is crucial for the regulation of estrogen-dependent cytosolic signaling pathways (Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1). In ErbB2-positive breast cancer, p130Cas forms part of a functional molecular complex with ErbB2, c-Src, and Fak, essential for the invasive behavior of cancer cells (Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1).

The interaction between mutant TP53 protein, specifically the R273H mutation, and BCAR1 is significant in cancer cell invasion. BCAR1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binds to TP53 R273H, a process dependent on Src family kinases (SFKs) (Guo2020Mutant). This interaction is crucial for promoting cancer cell invasion (Guo2020Mutant).
