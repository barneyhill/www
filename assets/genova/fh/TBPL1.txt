# TBPL1

## Overview
TBPL1 (TATA-box binding protein like 1) is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein-like 1, which is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in facilitating the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerases I and II, particularly at TATA-less promoters. TBPL1 is essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and nucleolar organization, playing a critical role in the synthesis and processing of rRNA, which is vital for ribosome assembly and protein synthesis. It also participates in the transcription of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and is involved in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress response. TBPL1's interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids underscore its importance in maintaining nucleolar architecture and its potential implications in cancer-related pathways (Akhtar2011TBPrelated; Khosraviani2023Nucleolar; Felício2023Functional).

## Function
TBPL1 (TATA-box binding protein like 1) is a crucial regulator of transcription in human cells, particularly involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and nucleolar organization. It functions by interacting with RNA polymerases I and II (Pol I and Pol II) at the intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), facilitating the recruitment and function of these polymerases. This interaction is essential for maintaining nucleolar architecture and the synthesis and processing of rRNA, which are critical for ribosome assembly and protein synthesis (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar).

TBPL1 is also involved in the transcription of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) at the IGS, which are important for nucleolar structure and function. Its deficiency leads to reduced levels of these ncRNAs, affecting nucleolar organization and rRNA production (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar). TBPL1's role extends to the transcription initiation from TATA-less promoters, such as those containing TCT motifs, which are crucial for the expression of ribosomal protein genes (Felício2023Functional).

In addition to its role in rRNA biogenesis, TBPL1 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression related to cell cycle regulation and stress response, highlighting its importance in cellular differentiation and organismal development (Felício2023Functional).

## Clinical Significance
TBPL1 has been implicated in various cancer-related processes, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pulmonary carcinoid tumors. In NSCLC, TBPL1 is identified as a significant hub gene involved in drug resistance mechanisms, especially in the context of resistance to EGFR-TKIs, a class of targeted cancer therapies (Bommu2020Gene). In pulmonary carcinoid tumors, TBPL1 is linked to the NF-ĸB pathway, which is known to promote cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and treatment resistance (Asiedu2018Pathways). 

The gene has also been studied in the context of desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT), where a synonymous mutation in TBPL1 was identified, although the clinical significance of this mutation remains unclear (Ferreira2016A). 

TBPL1's role in transcription regulation and its interactions with RNA polymerases I and II are crucial for maintaining nucleolar structure and ribosome biogenesis. Disruption in TBPL1 function can lead to compromised nucleolar organization and rRNA biogenesis, although specific diseases directly resulting from these disruptions have not been detailed (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar). 

Overall, TBPL1's involvement in cancer pathways and its regulatory functions in transcription highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.

## Interactions
TBPL1, also known as TBP-related factor 2 (TRF2), is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcription regulation. It interacts with RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), facilitating the synthesis of non-coding RNAs essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar). TBPL1 is enriched at rDNA IGS sites with TCT motifs, which it recognizes in the absence of a TATA box, promoting Pol II transcription initiation from TATA-less promoters (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar).

TBPL1 forms complexes with TFIIA and TFIIB, and in HeLa cells, it interacts with TFIIA-like factor (ALF), a germ cell-specific paralog of TFIIA (Akhtar2011TBPrelated). It also associates with TIPT2 and geminin, synergistically activating the TATA-less NF1 promoter (Pitulescu2009TIPT2). TBPL1's interactions extend to components of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) complex and the DNA replication element binding factor (DREF) in Drosophila, indicating its role in diverse transcriptional processes (Akhtar2011TBPrelated). These interactions highlight TBPL1's critical function in transcription regulation and nucleolar organization.
