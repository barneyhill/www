# PRKAR2A

## Overview
PRKAR2A is a gene that encodes the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type II regulatory subunit alpha, a crucial component of the protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit within the PKA complex, which is pivotal in the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. The PRKAR2A-encoded protein plays a significant role in modulating the activity and localization of PKA by binding to its catalytic subunits and anchoring the enzyme to specific cellular sites. This regulation ensures that PKA activity is precisely controlled, facilitating the phosphorylation of various downstream targets involved in essential cellular processes such as metabolism, cell division, and gene expression. The protein's regulatory function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been linked to tumorigenesis, particularly in hematopoietic tissues, underscoring its potential role in tumor suppression (Liu2015Haploinsufficiency; Saloustros2015Hematopoietic; Zynda2014Protein).

## Structure


## Function
PRKAR2A encodes a regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), specifically the type II-α regulatory subunit. In healthy human cells, PRKAR2A plays a crucial role in the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. It forms part of the PKA holoenzyme, which consists of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. The binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to the regulatory subunits, including PRKAR2A, leads to the release and activation of the catalytic subunits. These activated catalytic subunits then phosphorylate various downstream targets, influencing numerous cellular processes such as metabolism, cell division, and gene expression (Liu2015Haploinsufficiency).

PRKAR2A is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it regulates the localization and activity of PKA by tethering the enzyme to specific cellular locations. This regulatory function ensures that PKA activity is tightly controlled and only activated in response to appropriate signals (Zynda2014Protein). The protein's role in maintaining normal cellular functions is underscored by studies showing that its deficiency can lead to tumor development, particularly in hematopoietic tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumor suppression (Saloustros2015Hematopoietic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRKAR2A gene, which encodes the RIIα regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), have been implicated in various diseases, particularly hematopoietic neoplasms and bone-related conditions. In mouse models, deficiency in Prkar2a has been associated with a predisposition to hematopoietic malignancies, including histiocytic sarcomas and diffuse large B cell lymphomas. This suggests a potential tumor suppressor role for PRKAR2A in hematopoietic tissues (Saloustros2015Hematopoietic).

In the context of bone development, haploinsufficiency of PRKAR2A, along with PRKAR1A, has been shown to improve bone phenotype in mice, indicating that PRKAR2A may play a role in bone pathology. Mice with haploinsufficiency for PRKAR2A and PRKAR1A exhibited improved bone organization and mineralization, suggesting that PRKAR2A mutations could have clinical significance in bone-related diseases such as those seen in Carney Complex (CNC) (Liu2015Haploinsufficiency).

These findings highlight the importance of PRKAR2A in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential involvement in disease processes when mutated or dysregulated. Further research into PRKAR2A could provide insights into therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

## Interactions
The PRKAR2A gene encodes the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type II regulatory subunit alpha, which is a component of the protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme. PRKAR2A interacts with the catalytic subunit of PKA, acting as a dominant-negative peptide that inhibits the enzyme's function. This interaction is crucial for the increased long-term survival of prostate cancer cells treated with taxanes, as it mediates a protective effect against the drug (Zynda2014Protein). The N-terminal domain of PRKAR2A, responsible for dimerization and binding to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), is not necessary for this protective effect, indicating that the interaction with the catalytic subunit is the key mechanism (Zynda2014Protein).

PRKAR2A also plays a role in tethering the PKA enzyme to specific cellular locations, maintaining the catalytic subunit in an inactive state until an appropriate signal is received (Zynda2014Protein). The study suggests that PRKAR2A may interact with other proteins involved in the PKA signaling pathway, potentially affecting the cell's response to cytotoxic drugs, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Zynda2014Protein).
