# PKNOX1

## Overview
PKNOX1, also known as PREP1, is a gene that encodes the PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a homeodomain transcription factor, which plays a critical role in regulating gene expression during development and differentiation. PKNOX1 forms heterodimers with other proteins, such as PBX1, to modulate the transcription of genes essential for cellular differentiation and development. It is also involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating nuclear mechanics, impacting mechanotransduction pathways. Alterations in PKNOX1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Purushothaman2022The; Ye2018MiR‐17; Knoepfler1997Meis1).

## Function
PKNOX1, also known as PREP1, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating nuclear stiffness and mechanotransduction in cells. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of nuclear envelope proteins such as SUN1, SUN2, and LAP2, which are crucial for maintaining nuclear mechanics. The depletion of PREP1 results in softer nuclei and altered expression of these proteins, affecting the actomyosin network and focal adhesion complexes. This disruption impacts mechanosignaling pathways essential for processes like embryogenesis and differentiation (Purushothaman2022The).

PKNOX1 also forms heterodimers with Pbx1, influencing the transcription of genes involved in development and differentiation. This interaction is crucial for cooperative DNA binding that regulates gene transcription (Knoepfler1997Meis1). In addition, PKNOX1 is known to maintain genomic stability by preventing excessive heterochromatin formation, which is associated with repressive chromatin marks (Iotti2011Homeodomain).

In healthy cells, PKNOX1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to control the expression of target genes, influencing cellular differentiation and development (Ye2018MiR‐17).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PKNOX1 gene, also known as Prep1, have been implicated in various diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer. In the context of metabolic diseases, aberrant expression of PKNOX1 is linked to hepatic glucose and lipid dysmetabolism, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The miR-17 family of microRNAs regulates PKNOX1 expression, and their reduced expression can lead to PKNOX1 overexpression, contributing to these metabolic disorders (Ye2018MiR‐17).

PKNOX1 also plays a role in tumor suppression. Its deficiency in mice leads to spontaneous tumor development and accelerates lymphomagenesis, suggesting its function as a tumor suppressor. In human tumors, low levels of PKNOX1 expression have been observed, indicating its potential relevance in cancer development (Longobardi2010Prep1). Additionally, PKNOX1 is involved in mechanotransduction, and its loss affects nuclear stiffness and the expression of nuclear envelope proteins, which can impact processes like embryogenesis and differentiation, potentially leading to developmental disorders (Purushothaman2022The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PKNOX1 expression alterations in various diseases.

## Interactions
PKNOX1, also known as PREP1, is a transcription factor that interacts with several proteins to form functional complexes crucial for its role in gene regulation. It primarily interacts with PBX1, a cofactor that aids in the stabilization and nuclear translocation of PKNOX1, enabling its transcriptional activity. This interaction is facilitated by two distinct sites within the PBC domain of PBX1, with the HR2 domain of PKNOX1 playing a critical role in binding (Bruckmann2020Mapping).

PKNOX1 also competes with MEIS1 for binding to PBX1, as both target the same domains, making their dimerization with PBX1 mutually exclusive. This competition is significant because neither PKNOX1 nor MEIS1 possesses a nuclear localization signal and relies on PBX1's signal for nuclear entry. The dimerization with PBX1 enhances the DNA-binding affinity of these proteins and prevents the nuclear export of PBX1 (Blasi2017A).

In addition to its interactions with PBX1 and MEIS1, PKNOX1 can form a ternary complex with anterior HOX proteins, which is important for regulating HOX gene expression. This complex formation is crucial for various developmental processes and cellular differentiation (Blasi2017A).
