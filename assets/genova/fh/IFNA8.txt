# IFNA8

## Overview
IFNA8 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon alpha 8, a member of the type I interferon family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system's response to viral infections. The protein interferon alpha 8 is categorized as a cytokine, a type of signaling molecule that is crucial for the activation and regulation of immune cells. It exerts its effects primarily by inducing the expression of antiviral proteins and modulating immune responses to enhance the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens. The gene IFNA8 is subject to evolutionary conservation, indicating its essential role in maintaining immune function across human evolution (Manry2011Evolutionary). Variations in IFNA8 have been linked to susceptibility to diseases such as severe malarial anemia and asthma, underscoring its clinical significance in immune-related conditions (Kempaiah2012Reduced; Chan2006Variation).

## Structure


## Function
IFNA8, a member of the type I interferon family, plays a critical role in the immune response against viral infections. It is involved in the activation of immune cells and the upregulation of antiviral proteins. IFNA8 functions primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression to enhance antiviral defense mechanisms (Pestka2004Interferons).

The protein encoded by IFNA8 is known for its potent antiviral activity, which is crucial for the suppression of viral replication. For instance, in the context of HIV, CD8+ lymphocytes transfected with IFNA8 can suppress HIV replication by over 90%, highlighting its significant role in antiviral defense (Killian2013CD8+Lymphocytes). IFNA8 is also involved in the regulation of immune responses, as evidenced by its role in severe malarial anemia, where genetic variations in its promoter region can influence susceptibility to the disease (Kempaiah2012Reduced).

The evolutionary conservation of IFNA8, under strong purifying selection, underscores its essential and nonredundant role in immunity, maintaining its function across human evolution (Manry2011Evolutionary). This suggests that IFNA8 is a robust target of purifying selection, preserving its critical functions in host defense mechanisms (Manry2011Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The IFNA8 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in immune response regulation. Alterations in IFNA8 expression have been associated with asthma and atopy. Specifically, IFNA8 shows significant associations with asthma when combined with other genes like IFNB1, suggesting that its role in disease susceptibility may depend on specific genetic interactions (Chan2006Variation). The gene's expression is also linked to different immune responses to allergens, with IFNA8 being part of a broader genetic framework influencing asthma and atopy risk (Chan2006Variation).

In the context of cancer, IFNA8 has been identified as a significant factor in gastric cancer prognosis. It is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression. A prognostic model including IFNA8 has shown that patients with lower expression levels have better survival outcomes, highlighting its role in disease progression (Jiang2022Identification).

Additionally, IFNA8 expression is regulated by factors such as CTCF, which can repress its transcription by blocking enhancer-promoter interactions. This regulation is crucial during viral infections, where IFNA8 expression is part of the immune response (Feng2013Bioinformatics).
