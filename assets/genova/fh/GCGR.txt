# GCGR

## Overview
The GCGR gene encodes the glucagon receptor, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in glucose and lipid metabolism. This receptor is primarily expressed in the liver and various extrahepatic tissues, where it mediates the physiological effects of glucagon, a hormone crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Upon glucagon binding, the glucagon receptor undergoes conformational changes that activate intracellular signaling pathways, notably increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The receptor's structure is characterized by seven transmembrane helical domains and a large N-terminal domain, which are essential for its ligand-binding and signaling functions. Mutations in the GCGR gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in energy balance and metabolic health (Campbell2015Islet; Siu2013Structure; Zhou2009Homozygous).

## Structure
The glucagon receptor (GCGR) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the receptor protein, which includes a large N-terminal domain with six conserved cysteines forming three disulfide bridges (Roberts2011Analysis). The secondary structure of GCGR features seven transmembrane helical domains arranged in a serpentine pattern, typical of GPCRs (Roberts2011Analysis). 

The tertiary structure of GCGR reveals distinct features compared to class A GPCRs. The N-terminal end of helix I is longer, extending three additional helical turns above the extracellular membrane boundary, which may be involved in glucagon binding (Siu2013Structure). The extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) is longer and plays a role in peptide ligand interactions (Siu2013Structure). The ligand binding pocket is wider and deeper than in class A receptors, and the intracellular side of helix VII shows an inward shift (Siu2013Structure).

GCGR undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and deubiquitination, which influence its trafficking and signaling (Kaur2020Agonistactivated). These modifications are crucial for the receptor's recycling and function, facilitated by deubiquitinases such as USP33 and STAMBP (Kaur2020Agonistactivated).

## Function
The glucagon receptor (GCGR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by mediating the effects of glucagon, a hormone secreted by pancreatic α cells. In healthy human cells, GCGR is primarily expressed in the liver but is also found in various extrahepatic tissues, including the brain, heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and adipose tissues (Campbell2015Islet; Charron2015Lack). Upon glucagon binding, GCGR activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which in turn stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, processes essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting (Siu2013Structure).

GCGR also influences lipid metabolism by reducing triglyceride and cholesterol levels and stimulating fatty acid oxidation (Charron2015Lack). In the central nervous system, GCGR is involved in energy homeostasis, influencing food intake and energy expenditure (Campbell2015Islet). The receptor's activation is marked by a conformational change that facilitates G protein coupling, essential for its signaling functions (Mattedi2020A). These molecular processes underscore GCGR's role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to overall energy balance and metabolic health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GCGR gene, which encodes the glucagon receptor, are associated with several clinical conditions. A notable mutation is the homozygous P86S mutation, which results in significantly reduced glucagon binding and cAMP production. This mutation is linked to hyperglucagonemia, α cell hyperplasia, and the development of islet cell tumors, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) (Zhou2009Homozygous). 

In Gcgr-deficient mice, the absence of functional glucagon receptors leads to pancreatic α cell hyperplasia and the development of PNETs, which serve as a model for similar human conditions. These mice exhibit hyperglucagonemia and dysplastic islets, with some cells expressing both glucagon and insulin, indicating abnormal differentiation (Yu2011Pancreatic). The development of PNETs in these mice suggests that complete inhibition of glucagon signaling could pose significant safety risks, such as tumor formation (Yu2011Pancreatic).

Additionally, GCGR mutations are linked to a rare form of glucagonoma syndrome, where patients may experience hyperaminoacidemia due to disrupted glucagon signaling (Dean2017Interrupted). These findings highlight the critical role of GCGR in maintaining normal glucose and amino acid metabolism, and the potential consequences of its dysfunction.

## Interactions
The glucagon receptor (GCGR) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that primarily interacts with the Gs protein upon activation by glucagon. This interaction leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is crucial for glucose metabolism regulation (Hilger2019Structural). The receptor undergoes significant conformational changes upon ligand binding, particularly involving transmembrane helices, which facilitate the engagement with the G protein (Hilger2019Structural).

GCGR also interacts with various antibodies that modulate its activity. Monoclonal antibodies such as mAb1 and mAb23 have been developed to inhibit glucagon action by targeting the extracellular domain (ECD) of GCGR. These antibodies block glucagon binding and influence receptor activity by stabilizing inactive receptor states. mAb1 competes directly with glucagon for binding sites, while mAb23 acts as an inverse agonist, reducing constitutive activity (Koth2012Molecular). The interaction of these antibodies with the ECD highlights the potential for developing novel allosteric regulators targeting GCGR (Koth2012Molecular).

Additionally, the receptor's conformational states are influenced by peptide ligands, which stabilize the open conformation of GCGR, facilitating interactions with the extracellular loop regions and the transmembrane domain (Yang2015Conformational).
