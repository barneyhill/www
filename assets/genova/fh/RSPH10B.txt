# RSPH10B

## Overview
RSPH10B is a gene that encodes the protein radial spoke head 10 homolog B, which is a crucial component of the radial spoke head complex in mammalian cilia. This protein plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of the RS3 complex, a subset of the radial spoke complexes involved in ciliary motility. The RSPH10B protein is characterized by a C-terminal globular domain and an N-terminal Dyp-30 motif, which contribute to its specific structural roles within the radial spoke complex (Meng2024Multiscale; Meng2023Highresolution). Unlike other radial spoke proteins, RSPH10B is uniquely involved in the RS3 head, where it substitutes one Rsph1 arm, indicating its distinct function in RS-CP interaction and cilia motion regulation (Meng2024Multiscale). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of axonemal complexes, highlighting its importance in the proper functioning of ependymal cilia (Meng2024Multiscale).

## Structure
The RSPH10B protein is a component of the radial spoke head complex in mammalian cilia, playing a role in the structural integrity and function of the RS3 complex. The protein features a C-terminal globular domain that fits well into a hook-like density, and its N-terminal Dyp-30 motif is held in a wing-like density, indicating specific structural roles within the radial spoke complex (Meng2024Multiscale; Meng2023Highresolution). 

RSPH10B is involved in the assembly of the RS head-neck complex, although it shows limited association with Rsph16, suggesting it may not be a standard component of the RS1/RS2 head-neck complex (Meng2023Highresolution). The protein's presence in the RS3 head, where it substitutes one Rsph1 arm, highlights its unique structural role compared to other radial spoke proteins (Meng2024Multiscale).

The protein's structure is crucial for ciliary motility, and its involvement in the RS3 complex suggests a distinct role in RS-CP interaction and cilia motion regulation (Meng2023Highresolution). The specific domains and structural features of RSPH10B contribute to its function in maintaining the integrity of the radial spoke complex.

## Function


## Interactions
RSPH10B is involved in the structure and function of cilia, particularly within the radial spoke (RS) complexes. It is a component of the RS3 head complex, where it substitutes one Rsph1 arm. The C-terminal globular domain of RSPH10B fits into a hook-like density, indicating its structural role within the RS3 complex. RSPH10B interacts with other proteins such as Rsph4a and Rsph9, contributing to the complex network of interactions within the RS3 structure (Meng2024Multiscale; Meng2023Highresolution).

Despite its presence in the RS3 complex, RSPH10B shows limited interactions with Rsph16, suggesting it may not be a standard component of the RS1/RS2 head-neck complex. This limited interaction is supported by its weak detection in cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses, indicating that RSPH10B might form a distinct complex separate from RS1/RS2 (Meng2024Multiscale; Meng2023Highresolution).

The presence of RSPH10B in the RS3 complex and its interactions with other RS proteins highlight its potential role in regulating ciliary motion and maintaining the structural integrity of the axonemal complexes in ependymal cilia (Meng2024Multiscale).
