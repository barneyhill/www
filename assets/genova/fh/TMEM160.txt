# TMEM160

## Overview
TMEM160 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 160, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. TMEM160 has been identified as a key player in the stabilization of PD-L1 protein expression, a mechanism that is crucial for tumor immune evasion and resistance to radiotherapy in colorectal cancer. The protein achieves this by inhibiting the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of PD-L1, thereby promoting its stability. Additionally, TMEM160 interacts with SPOP, a component of cullin-RING E3 ligases, further influencing the degradation pathways of PD-L1. These interactions underscore the potential of TMEM160 as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating immune responses in cancer (Dai2024TMEM160).

## Interactions
TMEM160 is known to interact with the PD-L1 protein in the context of colorectal cancer. This interaction was identified using the BioGRID database and confirmed through various experimental methods, including immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, and GST pull-down assays. These experiments demonstrated that TMEM160 and PD-L1 co-localize in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of cancer cells and directly interact with each other. TMEM160 stabilizes PD-L1 protein expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination-dependent degradation, which is crucial for tumor immune evasion and radiotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer (Dai2024TMEM160).

TMEM160 also interacts with SPOP, a component of cullin-RING E3 ligases, which targets specific substrates for degradation. TMEM160 competitively binds to PD-L1 with SPOP, preventing SPOP-mediated degradation of PD-L1 and promoting its stability. This interaction was observed in colorectal cancer cell lines such as HCT116 and DLD1, where overexpression of TMEM160 reduced the interaction between SPOP and PD-L1, leading to decreased ubiquitination of PD-L1 (Dai2024TMEM160). These interactions highlight TMEM160's role in modulating PD-L1 expression and its potential implications in tumor progression and immune evasion.
