# FBXW11

## Overview
FBXW11 is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 11, also known as β-TrCP2, which is a critical component of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its F-box motif and multiple WD40 repeats, which facilitate its role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW11 is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation, by controlling the stability of key regulatory proteins (Kim2015Substrate; Coyaud2015BioIDbased). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions within the SCF complex and with its substrates (Zhuang2024The). FBXW11 is implicated in several signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB, and plays a significant role in glucose homeostasis, cell migration, and potentially oncogenic processes (Kim2015Substrate; Coyaud2015BioIDbased).

## Structure
FBXW11, also known as F-box and WD repeat domain containing 11, is a protein that is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It contains an F-box motif, which is crucial for its recruitment into the SCF complex through interaction with SKP1 (Jin2004Systematic). The protein also features multiple WD40 repeats, which form a beta-propeller structure that facilitates substrate binding (Mudhasani2016Protein). These structural elements are essential for its role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.

FBXW11 is involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of protein degradation pathways targeting proteins like c-MYC and cyclin E (Jin2004Systematic). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with substrates and other components of the SCF complex (Zhuang2024The).

In bovines, the FBXW11 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in three splice variants: FBXW11-tv1, FBXW11-tv2, and FBXW11-tv3. These variants maintain the integrity of the F-box-like domain, D domain of β-TrCP, and WD40 domain, although they differ in their N-terminal sequences (LIU2021DNA).

## Function
FBXW11, also known as β-TrCP2, is a crucial component of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This process is essential for regulating protein stability and function within cells (Kim2015Substrate; Coyaud2015BioIDbased). FBXW11 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation, by controlling the degradation of key regulatory proteins (Coyaud2015BioIDbased).

In healthy human cells, FBXW11 is involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis through its interaction with TBC1D4, which is important for insulin-dependent trafficking of the GLUT4 glucose transporter (Kim2015Substrate). It also influences cell migration and possibly cell fusion and multinucleation by regulating the stability of RAPGEF2, a guanine exchange factor for RAP1/2 small GTPases (Kim2015Substrate). Additionally, FBXW11 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB, which are crucial for cell proliferation and immune responses (Coyaud2015BioIDbased).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBXW11 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and lymphocytic leukemia. In colorectal cancer, FBXW11 is significantly upregulated, contributing to the maintenance of stem-cell-like properties and promoting liver metastasis. This is achieved through the regulation of HIC1-mediated SIRT1 transcription, which enhances tumor cell viability, migration, invasion, and sphere formation. High FBXW11 expression is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, indicating its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Yao2021FBXW11).

In lymphocytic leukemia, FBXW11 expression is upregulated in patients, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This upregulation stimulates cell proliferation and tumor formation through the activation of the NF-κB and β-catenin/TCF signaling pathways. High levels of FBXW11 expression are linked to increased tumor growth and cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a molecular target for leukemia treatment (Wang2018Fbxw11).

FBXW11 also plays a role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, where its overexpression impairs repopulation capacity by affecting maintenance and differentiation, potentially contributing to conditions like Fanconi anemia and aplastic anemia (Wang2022Fbxw11).

## Interactions
FBXW11, also known as β-TrCP2, is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with substrates such as β-catenin and IκBα, targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which is crucial for the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling, respectively (Wang2018Fbxw11; Frescas2008Deregulated).

FBXW11 also interacts with RAPGEF2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction affects the subcellular localization of RAPGEF2 and is involved in processes like cell-cell fusion and multinucleation (Kim2015Substrate). The interaction between FBXW11 and RAPGEF2 is mediated by specific degron motifs within RAPGEF2, which are necessary for FBXW11 binding (Kim2015Substrate).

Additionally, FBXW11 is implicated in the degradation of other proteins such as the prolactin receptor and CDC25A, highlighting its role in various signaling pathways and cellular stress responses (Frescas2008Deregulated). These interactions underscore the importance of FBXW11 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in oncogenic processes.
