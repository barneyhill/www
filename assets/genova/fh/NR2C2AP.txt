# NR2C2AP

## Overview
The NR2C2AP gene encodes the nuclear receptor 2C2 associated protein, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with nuclear receptors. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator, playing a crucial role in modulating the activity of nuclear receptor 2C2 (NR2C2) by inhibiting its binding to target gene elements. The NR2C2AP gene has been implicated in cognitive functions, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to general cognitive ability (Kornilov2019GenomeWide). Additionally, alterations in the NR2C2AP gene, such as copy number variations, have been observed in certain cancers, including breast cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Rodrigues‐Peres2019Copy).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The NR2C2AP gene has been associated with general cognitive ability through genome-wide significant association studies. It is hypothesized to play a role in repressing NR2C2-mediated transactivation by inhibiting the binding between NR2C2 and TR4-response elements in target genes. This gene's association with cognitive ability is primarily driven by two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs10424365 and rs34282046. The latter SNP is a nonsynonymous mutation that affects nine alternative transcripts of the RFXANK gene, which is involved in MHC class II expression and acts as a transcriptional regulator of neural stem/progenitor cells in mice. Despite this mutation, it is predicted to be benign by PolyPhen2, and no direct link between NR2C2AP mutations and specific diseases has been established. However, its potential role in cognitive ability suggests that alterations in NR2C2AP could impact cognitive functions (Kornilov2019GenomeWide).

In the context of breast cancer, copy number alterations (CNAs) involving NR2C2AP have been identified on chromosome 19, which are associated with later disease stages and a family history of breast cancer. These CNAs are linked to pathways involved with alternative splicing and polymorphisms, although their clinical significance remains uncertain (Rodrigues‐Peres2019Copy).
