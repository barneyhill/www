# PARP4

## Overview
PARP4, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, which is involved in various cellular processes such as DNA repair, chromatin modulation, and transcription regulation. The protein encoded by PARP4, also known as vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VPARP), is a large and complex enzyme that plays a crucial role in the vault complex, a ribonucleoprotein structure in eukaryotic cells. Unlike other PARP family members that generate poly(ADP-ribose) chains, PARP4 uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to attach ADP-ribose as a monomer, contributing to its unique functional properties (Ünlü2020Investigation). The protein is characterized by several domains, including the MVP-Interaction (MINT) domain and the BRCT domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its recruitment to the vault complex (Ünlü2020Investigation; Lodwick2024Structural). PARP4's involvement in maintaining genomic stability and its interactions with proteins such as the major vault protein (MVP) and hnRNPM underscore its significance in cellular stress responses and potential implications in cancer pathogenesis (Lee2024PARP4; Lodwick2024Structural).

## Structure
PARP4, also known as vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family and is characterized by its large size and complex structure. The protein contains several domains, including the MVP-Interaction (MINT) domain, which facilitates its recruitment to the vault cage, a large ribonucleoprotein complex in eukaryotic cells (Lodwick2024Structural). The MINT domain is crucial for binding to the major vault protein (MVP) through specific electrostatic interactions, such as a salt bridge between PARP4's K1618 and MVP's D214 (Lodwick2024Structural).

PARP4 also contains a BRCT domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, contributing to its functional diversity (Ünlü2020Investigation). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms (Ünlü2020Investigation).

Structurally, PARP4 shares a common NAD-binding motif with other PARP family members, such as PARP1 and PARP2, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Ünlü2020Investigation). The protein's interaction with NAD+ is facilitated by a recessed pocket within the MVP, which stabilizes NAD+ through electrostatic interactions (Lodwick2024Structural). This interaction is crucial for PARP4's role in the vault complex, potentially regulating cargo selection and subcellular localization (Lodwick2024Structural).

## Function
PARP4, also known as vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VPARP), is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromatin modulation, transcription, and replication. It is the largest member of the PARP family and is part of a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complex known as the vault complex (Ünlü2020Investigation). PARP4 is catalytically active and uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a substrate to attach ADP-ribose as a monomer, unlike other PARPs that generate poly(ADP-ribose) chains (Ünlü2020Investigation).

In healthy human cells, PARP4 is involved in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of single-strand DNA breaks. It is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing processes such as transcription regulation and apoptosis (Ünlü2020Investigation). PARP4's recruitment to the vault complex via the major vault protein (MVP) suggests it may regulate vault activity by modifying MVP, other components, or encapsulated cargo, potentially affecting subcellular localization and cargo selection (Lodwick2024Structural). The interaction of PARP4 with NAD+ within the vault cage provides atomic-level details of the protein-binding interface, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses and DNA repair mechanisms (Lodwick2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PARP4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, thyroid, and lung adenocarcinoma. In breast and thyroid cancers, specific germline mutations such as G496V and T1170I have been associated with increased cancer risk, with the T1170I variant being more prevalent in cancer patients compared to controls (Ikeda2015Germline). In lung adenocarcinoma, PARP4 is identified as a novel tumor suppressor, with mutations and copy number loss leading to reduced mRNA expression and poorer overall survival (Lee2024PARP4). The I1039T mutation in PARP4, found in lung cancer cohorts, results in lower protein levels and is predicted to destabilize the protein, contributing to tumorigenicity (Lee2024PARP4).

PARP4's interaction with the splicing regulator hnRNPM is crucial for regulating splicing events, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to dysregulated splicing, which is significant in lung adenocarcinoma pathogenesis (Lee2024PARP4). Despite its potential role in cancer, some studies have not found a significant association between PARP4 variants and cancer susceptibility, highlighting the complexity of its involvement in tumor biology (Cirello2019Genetic; Prawira2019Assessment). Overall, PARP4's role in cancer appears to be multifaceted, involving both genetic mutations and alterations in gene expression and interactions.

## Interactions
PARP4 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It is a component of the human vault complex, where it interacts with the major vault protein (MVP). This interaction is characterized by electrostatic complementarity, with specific residues such as PARP4's K1618 and MVP's D214 forming a salt bridge, and hydrogen bonding between residues like PARP4 S1614 and MVP R169 (Lodwick2024Structural). PARP4's interaction with MVP is crucial for the stability and dynamics of the vault cage, and it is suggested that PARP4 may regulate vault activity by modifying MVP or other components (Lodwick2024Structural).

PARP4 also interacts with hnRNPM, a nuclear protein involved in RNA regulation, including splicing and mRNA stability. This interaction is significant in the context of lung adenocarcinoma, where PARP4 and hnRNPM together influence splicing events, potentially affecting tumorigenicity (Lee2024PARP4). The interaction between PARP4 and hnRNPM is predominantly observed in the nuclear fraction of cells, and PARP4 may ADP-ribosylate hnRNPM, altering its splicing activity (Lee2024PARP4). These interactions highlight PARP4's role in both structural complexes and regulatory processes within the cell.
