# ACAD10

## Overview
ACAD10 is a gene located on chromosome 12q24.1 that encodes the protein acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 10, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation. This protein is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) family and plays a critical role in the β-oxidation pathway, specifically in the metabolism of 4-hydroxy fatty acids. Unlike other ACAD family members, ACAD10 exhibits a unique catalytic mechanism that does not require external electron acceptors, instead transferring electrons back onto the substrate. The protein contains both a kinase domain and an ACAD domain, facilitating the phosphorylation and conversion of 4-hydroxyacyl-CoAs into enoyl-CoAs, respectively. Additionally, the presence of a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) domain suggests a regulatory function. ACAD10 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and brain, and its activity is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Paquay2024ACAD10; Ye2004Cloning).

## Structure
The ACAD10 protein is encoded by the ACAD10 gene located on chromosome 12q24.1 and consists of 1059 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 118.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.05 (Ye2004Cloning). It contains a conserved acyl-CoA dehydrogenase domain spanning from residues Ser-655 to Lys-1056, which aligns with 97.7% identity in the NCBI database (Ye2004Cloning). Although specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ACAD10 are not provided, it is suggested that ACAD10 may share structural similarities with other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, such as LCAD, due to sequence similarity (Narayanan2024Structural). This implies a potential large substrate-binding cavity, similar to LCAD, which accommodates bulky substrates (Narayanan2024Structural).

ACAD10 is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation and is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and brain (Bloom2020ACAD10; Ye2004Cloning). The protein's expression is influenced by the downregulation of mTORC1 and reduced expression of mitochondrial complexes (Bloom2020ACAD10). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ACAD10 are not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
The ACAD10 gene encodes a protein that is part of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) family, which plays a crucial role in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. ACAD10 is involved in the metabolism of 4-hydroxy fatty acids, facilitating their entry into the β-oxidation pathway. This process is essential for the breakdown of fatty acids to produce energy in cells (Paquay2024ACAD10). ACAD10 is unique among ACADs as it does not require external electron acceptors; instead, electrons are transferred back onto the substrate, indicating a distinct catalytic mechanism (Paquay2024ACAD10).

The protein contains a kinase domain and an ACAD domain, which are involved in the phosphorylation of 4-hydroxyacyl-CoAs and the subsequent conversion into enoyl-CoAs, respectively (Paquay2024ACAD10). ACAD10 is localized to the mitochondria, where it metabolizes shorter-chain 4-hydroxy fatty acids, contributing to energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Paquay2024ACAD10). The presence of a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) domain suggests a regulatory role, potentially in feedback inhibition of the kinase activity (Paquay2024ACAD10). ACAD10's activity is crucial for the elimination of degradation products from various pathways, potentially acting as a disease modifier under certain pathological conditions (Paquay2024ACAD10).

## Clinical Significance
Variants in the ACAD10 gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ACAD10 are linked to early-onset type 2 diabetes, especially in populations such as the Pima Indians, who have a high incidence of this condition. These genetic variations may impair insulin sensitivity by disrupting mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, leading to increased intracellular lipid metabolites and insulin resistance (Bian2010Variants; Bloom2017Investigating).

In mouse models, ACAD10 deficiency has been linked to obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. These mice exhibit abnormal weight gain, increased adiposity, and elevated insulin levels, which are indicative of metabolic dysfunctions similar to those observed in human T2DM (Bloom2017Investigating). The deficiency also results in ectopic lipid accumulation in muscle and liver tissues, contributing to the development of insulin resistance (Bloom2017Investigating).

Additionally, ACAD10 has been implicated in the metabolism of 4-hydroxy fatty acids, which are intermediates in lipid metabolism. Alterations in ACAD10 function may act as disease modifiers in conditions with increased lipid peroxidation, such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes (Paquay2024ACAD10).
