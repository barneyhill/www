# FANCM

## Overview
FANCM is a gene that encodes the FA complementation group M protein, a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery in human cells. The protein is categorized as a DNA translocase, playing a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) and facilitating replication fork remodeling. FANCM is integral to the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, where it collaborates with other proteins to recognize and process DNA damage, thereby preventing genomic instability. The protein's structure includes a translocase domain and a pseudo-nuclease domain, which, despite lacking nuclease activity, contributes to its DNA binding capabilities. FANCM's interactions with various proteins, such as the MHF1/MHF2 heterodimer and FAAP24, underscore its multifaceted role in DNA repair and replication stress response. Mutations in the FANCM gene have been linked to increased risks of certain cancers and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in human health (Xue2015Functions; Fouquet2017A; Basbous2019A).

## Structure
The FANCM protein is a DNA repair protein with a complex molecular structure. It features an N-terminal translocase domain, which includes two RecA-like domains, Hel1 and Hel2, separated by an insert domain known as Hel2i. The Hel2i domain is crucial for substrate selectivity and is involved in branch migration and structure-specific DNA binding (Abbouche2024Mechanism). The Hel2i domain also plays a significant role in FANCM's ATPase activity, which is necessary for DNA translocation (Abbouche2024Mechanism).

FANCM forms a pentameric complex with the MHF1/MHF2 heterodimer, which is structurally similar to histone H3-H4. This complex is essential for FANCM's DNA binding capabilities and genome stability (Basbous2019A). The interaction between FANCM and the MHF1-MHF2 tetramer is mediated by a 'dual-V' shaped structure, which is crucial for FANCM's function in DNA repair (Tao2012The).

The protein also contains a pseudo-nuclease domain homologous to the ERCC4 nuclease domain, although it lacks essential residues for nuclease activity (Basbous2019A). FANCM's structure-specific DNA binding properties are influenced by associated proteins like FAAP24, RMI1:RMI2, hCLK2, and PCNA (Abbouche2024Mechanism). The Hel2i domain is evolutionarily conserved and is also found in other human translocases involved in RNA metabolism (Abbouche2024Mechanism).

## Function
The FANCM gene encodes a DNA motor protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. FANCM is involved in several key cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, replication fork remodeling, and R-loop resolution. It is a part of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) that can obstruct DNA replication. FANCM works with FAAP24 and the MHF complex to recognize and target ICLs, facilitating their repair through monoubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2, incision of the ICL, and homologous recombination (Xue2015Functions).

FANCM also plays a role in DNA replication under normal conditions and in response to replication stress, helping to prevent replication fork stalling and assisting in restarting damaged forks. It activates the ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint, stabilizing replication forks and preventing the firing of dormant replication origins (Xue2015Functions). FANCM's translocase activity is crucial for maintaining the stability of common fragile sites (CFSs) by promoting fork reversal and preventing double-strand break formation (Wang2018The). These functions are vital for preventing genome instability and the accumulation of DNA damage in healthy cells (Xue2015Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FANCM gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in DNA repair. A homozygous mutation in FANCM has been linked to non-syndromic primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in a consanguineous family. This mutation results in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents like Mitomycin C and affects FANCD2 monoubiquitination, leading to increased chromosome breakages and rearrangements. The mutation is thought to cause meiotic defects and oocyte apoptosis, contributing to POI (Fouquet2017A).

FANCM mutations are also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly early-onset and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Studies have identified FANCM nonsense pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2-negative patients, suggesting a predisposition to hereditary breast cancer. Specific variants, such as FANCM:c.5101C>T, are linked to a higher risk of TNBC (Schubert2019The). The rs144567652 variant, which causes exon 22 skipping, has been associated with familial breast cancer risk, although its significance varies across populations (MoralesPison2023Association).

Despite its involvement in DNA repair, FANCM has been excluded from the group of bona fide Fanconi anemia (FA) genes, although its mutations can predispose individuals to cancer and affect chemosensitivity (Fouquet2017A).

## Interactions
FANCM is a DNA translocase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to maintain genomic stability. It forms a complex with the MHF1/MHF2 heterodimer, which enhances its DNA binding and branch migration activities. This complex is crucial for suppressing meiotic crossovers and maintaining genome stability (Basbous2019A). FANCM also interacts with the FAAP24 protein, which helps recruit the FA core complex to DNA lesions, facilitating the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key step in the Fanconi anemia pathway (Xue2015Functions; Basbous2019A).

FANCM's interaction with PCNA, mediated by a PIP-box motif, is essential for promoting replication traverse of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and is stimulated under replication stress (Rohleder2016FANCM). It also interacts with the Bloom's syndrome complex, including the BLM helicase, to facilitate DNA repair and prevent crossover events (Xue2015Functions; Basbous2019A).

FANCM is involved in ATR/Chk1 signaling, interacting with HCLK2 and TopBP1 to promote checkpoint activation and prevent unscheduled degradation of Chk1 (Xue2015Functions; Basbous2019A). These interactions highlight FANCM's role in DNA damage response and replication fork stability.
