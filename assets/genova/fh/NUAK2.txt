# NUAK2

## Overview
NUAK2 is a gene that encodes the NUAK family kinase 2, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including stress response, cell migration, and proliferation. As a member of the AMP-related kinase family, NUAK2 is activated under conditions of cellular stress, such as energy deprivation and oxidative stress, and plays a crucial role in mediating pro-survival signaling pathways (van2021NUAK1; Namiki2011AMP). The protein encoded by NUAK2 is integral to the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing processes like neural tube closure and TGF-β signal transduction (van2021NUAK1). NUAK2's interactions with other proteins, such as MYPT1 and CYFIP2, underscore its significance in cellular adhesion, migration, and cancer progression (Yamamoto2008Identification; Li2021NUAK2). The gene's involvement in various cancers, including melanoma, breast, and liver cancer, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Namiki2011AMP; Singh2022The; Yuan2018NUAK2).

## Structure


## Function
NUAK2, a member of the AMP-related family of kinases, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in response to cellular stress. It is activated by conditions such as increased AMP or decreased ATP levels, glucose or glutamine deprivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In skeletal muscle cells, NUAK2 helps protect against stress-induced apoptosis by mediating the pro-survival Rho signaling pathway (van2021NUAK1).

NUAK2 is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle cell contraction through the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), which affects the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2) and stabilizes actin stress fibers (van2021NUAK1). It also plays a role in the Hippo pathway by promoting YAP/TAZ signaling through a feedback loop involving the phosphorylation of LATS1, which is crucial for processes like neural tube closure during embryogenesis (van2021NUAK1).

In the context of TGF-β signaling, NUAK2 is transcriptionally induced in a TβRI-and SMAD4-dependent manner and associates with SMAD3, enhancing its stability and supporting TGF-β signal transduction (van2021NUAK1). This highlights NUAK2's involvement in modulating transcriptional outputs and cellular responses to growth factors.

## Clinical Significance
The NUAK2 gene is implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including melanoma, breast cancer, and liver cancer. In melanoma, NUAK2 is frequently amplified, particularly at the 1q32 locus, and its high expression is associated with increased tumor thickness, poor relapse-free survival, and enhanced tumor growth and migration (Namiki2011AMP). NUAK2's role in melanoma is linked to its regulation of mTOR expression and its impact on cell proliferation and migration (Namiki2011AMP).

In breast cancer, NUAK2 is associated with ferroptotic cell death, acting as a regulator of ferroptotic sensitivity by reducing mRNA levels of the antiferroptotic enzyme GPX4. NUAK2 amplifications are prevalent in about 25% of breast cancer cases, often co-occurring with MDM4, which inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor (Singh2022The).

In liver cancer, NUAK2 is a critical target of the YAP protein in the Hippo signaling pathway, essential for YAP-driven hepatomegaly and tumorigenesis. Inhibiting NUAK2 can suppress YAP-dependent cancer cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in YAP-driven cancers (Yuan2018NUAK2).

NUAK2 is also involved in apoptosis resistance and cell cycle regulation, with its expression upregulated upon CD95 receptor stimulation, suggesting a pro-survival role in various cancers (Molina2021NUAK).

## Interactions
NUAK2, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of NUAK2 is with the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1). NUAK2 phosphorylates MYPT1, which is part of the myosin phosphatase complex, affecting its activity and thereby regulating actomyosin tension and cell adhesion (Zagórska2010New; Yamamoto2008Identification). This interaction is crucial for processes such as cell migration and proliferation, particularly in cancer cells (Yuan2018NUAK2).

NUAK2 also interacts with cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) in cervical cancer cells. This interaction is significant for cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Knockdown of NUAK2 leads to increased CYFIP2 expression, suggesting a regulatory relationship between these proteins (Li2021NUAK2).

In the context of liver cancer, NUAK2 is a critical target of the YAP signaling pathway. It forms a feedback loop that enhances YAP activity by regulating actomyosin tension, which is essential for YAP-driven cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Yuan2018NUAK2). These interactions highlight NUAK2's role in various cellular and pathological processes.
