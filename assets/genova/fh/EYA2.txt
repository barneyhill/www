# EYA2

## Overview
EYA2 is a gene that encodes the EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 2, a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. As a member of the Eyes absent homolog (EYA) protein family, EYA2 is characterized by its dual function as a transcriptional coactivator and a phosphatase, facilitated by its conserved C-terminal Eya domain. This domain is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Zhang2021Eya2; Liu2021EYA2). EYA2 interacts with proteins such as DACH and SIX to form transcription complexes that regulate gene expression, impacting cell proliferation and differentiation (Liu2021EYA2). The gene exhibits tissue-specific expression and has been implicated in various cancers, where it can function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (GAO2015Aberrant; Liu2021EYA2).

## Structure
The EYA2 protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal Eya domain (ED), which is 271 amino acids long and is crucial for its phosphatase activity and protein-protein interactions (Zhang2021Eya2; Liu2021EYA2). This domain is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of enzymes, indicating its role in catalytic functions (Zhang2021Eya2). The N-terminal region of EYA2 is more variable and is involved in transcriptional activation, although specific structural details of this region are not provided in the context (Zhang2021Eya2).

EYA2 can form complexes with other proteins, such as DACH1, which enhances its transcriptional activation capabilities, particularly in the regulation of the SOCS3 gene (Liu2021EYA2). This interaction suggests a quaternary structure where EYA2 functions as part of a larger protein complex. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. Splice variants of EYA2 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions, but specific variants are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The EYA2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional coactivator with phosphatase activity, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is part of the Eyes absent homolog (EYA) protein family and is characterized by a conserved ED domain, which facilitates interactions with proteins such as DACH (Dachshund) and SIX (Sine Oculis Homeobox) to form a transcription complex. This complex translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates cell proliferation and DNA damage repair, essential processes in development and disease (Liu2021EYA2).

EYA2 is involved in the regulation of cell polarity and innate immunity through its phosphorylation by the Abelson tyrosine kinase, which recruits it to the cytoplasm (Liu2021EYA2). The gene exhibits tissue-specific expression and plays varying roles in different types of tumors, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, by inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through SOCS3-mediated mechanisms (Liu2021EYA2).

In healthy human cells, EYA2 is active in the nucleus and is involved in cell differentiation, development, and repair processes. Its phosphatase activity is crucial for dephosphorylating target proteins, which is important for its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling (GAO2015Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
EYA2 (EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 2) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In epithelial ovarian cancer, EYA2 is up-regulated, with its overexpression linked to shorter overall survival in advanced cases. It functions as a transcriptional activator, promoting tumor growth and progression (Zhang2005Transcriptional). In lung adenocarcinoma, EYA2 is aberrantly upregulated, with hypomethylation contributing to its increased expression. This upregulation is associated with oncogenesis and poor prognosis (GAO2015Aberrant).

In breast cancer, EYA2 expression is higher in more aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer, and is associated with poor survival outcomes. Its overexpression promotes tumor proliferation (Xu2019EYA2). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EYA2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, often due to aberrant methylation, correlates with aggressive tumor progression. High EYA2 expression is linked to a favorable prognosis, and it suppresses HCC progression through the SOCS3-mediated blockade of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Liu2021EYA2). These findings highlight EYA2's complex role in cancer, acting as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the tissue context.

## Interactions
EYA2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. It is a direct binding partner of SIX proteins, functioning as a transcriptional co-activator. This interaction is crucial for promoting oncogenic functions, such as in breast cancer, where EYA2 knockdown blocks the ability of SIX1 overexpression to induce TGFβ signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Kingsbury2019Regulation). EYA2 also interacts with DACH proteins, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays showing a physical interaction between Dach2 and Eya2, although no direct interaction was detected between Dach2 and Six1 (Heanue1999Synergistic).

In the context of cancer, EYA2's interaction with SIX1 is essential for its role in promoting cell invasiveness, as seen in astrocytoma cells where EYA2 overexpression upregulates MMP9 expression through the ERK signaling pathway (Wen2017Eya2). EYA2 also interacts with DACH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma, where this interaction suppresses cancer progression via SOCS3-mediated blockade of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Liu2021EYA2). These interactions highlight EYA2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
