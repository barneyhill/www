# CDIN1

## Overview
The CDIN1 gene encodes the protein CDAN1 interacting nuclease 1, which is a member of the Holliday junction resolvase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of histone supply during the S-phase of the cell cycle, primarily through its interactions with other proteins such as Codanin-1 and ASF1A. CDIN1 functions as a negative regulator of the histone chaperone Asf1, sequestering it in the cytoplasm to modulate DNA synthesis and chromatin assembly. The protein's interactions are crucial for maintaining proper chromatin dynamics and ensuring cell-cycle progression. Mutations in the CDIN1 gene are linked to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA-I), a rare hereditary disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis. These mutations often disrupt the protein's interaction with Codanin-1, contributing to the pathogenesis of CDA-I (Ask2012Codanin1; Stojaspal2023Inherited).

## Structure
The CDIN1 protein predominantly forms α-helices with intermittent short β-strands, comprising approximately 45% α-helix and 13% β-sheet in its secondary structure (Stojaspal2023Inherited). The protein includes two helix-turn-helix DNA binding domains spanning amino acids 4-129, a Treponema pallidum domain (TPD) from amino acids 135-265, and a nuclease domain between amino acids 161-259 (Méndez2020Congenital). The TPD domain may be associated with a zinc finger domain, which typically functions as an interaction module linking DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules (Méndez2020Congenital).

In terms of quaternary structure, CDIN1 forms a complex with Codanin1Cterm in a 1:1 stoichiometry, primarily as a heterodimer, but also potentially as a heterotetramer (Stojaspal2023Inherited). The molecular weight of the heterodimer is approximately 60 kDa, while the heterotetramer is around 118 kDa (Stojaspal2023Inherited). CDIN1 predominantly forms homodimers in solution, while Codanin1Cterm is primarily monomeric, and together they form heterodimers (Stojaspal2023Inherited). The protein is stable at room temperature with a thermal stability (melting temperature) of 48 °C (Stojaspal2023Inherited). The study does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of CDIN1.

## Function
The CDIN1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in regulating histone supply during the S-phase of the cell cycle. It is a component of a cytosolic complex that includes Asf1, histones H3 and H4, and Importin-4. CDIN1 interacts with Asf1 in a histone-independent manner, suggesting a regulatory role in histone chaperoning (Ask2012Codanin1). The protein acts as a negative regulator of Asf1, sequestering it in the cytoplasm to inhibit DNA synthesis and regulate histone supply during chromatin replication (Ask2012Codanin1). This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper chromatin assembly and DNA replication, as it ensures the correct dynamics of Asf1 and histone interactions (Ask2012Codanin1).

CDIN1 is primarily cytosolic, and its stability is dependent on its interaction with CDAN1, as CDIN1 levels decrease when CDAN1 is degraded (Sedor2024Mechanism). The protein's interaction with Asf1 is thought to be regulated by post-translational modifications, allowing Asf1 to shuttle into the nucleus for chromatin assembly (Ask2012Codanin1). This regulation is essential for cell survival and cell-cycle progression, highlighting CDIN1's fundamental biological role (Ask2012Codanin1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDIN1 gene are associated with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA-I), a rare hereditary disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. CDA-I is primarily caused by biallelic mutations in the CDIN1 and CDAN1 genes, which account for approximately 90% of all cases (Stojaspal2023Inherited). These mutations disrupt the interaction between CDIN1 and Codanin1, leading to the pathogenesis of CDA-I (Stojaspal2023Inherited). Specific mutations in CDIN1, such as Y94C, Y94S, C156Y, and L178Q, have been identified as contributing to the disease by disrupting the binding with Codanin1Cterm (Stojaspal2023Inherited).

The CDIN1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the Holliday junction resolvase family, and its function is suggested to be involved in erythropoiesis. Variants such as p.Leu136Val, p.Tyr247Cys, and p.Ile273Thr have been identified in patients with CDA, and these are predicted to be pathogenic, potentially affecting erythroid maturation (Méndez2020Congenital). The mutations in CDIN1 are associated with a more severe form of CDA-I, characterized by delayed differentiation and increased proliferation of erythroblasts (Scott2020Recapitulation).

## Interactions
CDIN1, also known as CDAN1 interacting nuclease 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly with Codanin-1 and ASF1A. CDIN1 interacts directly with the C-terminus of Codanin-1, forming a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry and binding with low nanomolar affinity. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of both proteins, and mutations in the interacting regions are associated with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA-I) (Stojaspal2023Inherited).

CDIN1 also forms a complex with ASF1A, a histone chaperone, using a histone mimic helix and a B-domain to sequester ASF1A in the cytoplasm. This interaction prevents ASF1A from binding to histones, thereby regulating histone supply. The binding is competitive with histone H3-H4, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for histone delivery (Jeong2024CODANIN1).

The stability of CDIN1 is dependent on its interaction with Codanin-1, as demonstrated by the destabilization of CDIN1 upon degradation of Codanin-1. This interaction primarily occurs in the cytosol, and previous reports of nuclear localization may be due to nonspecific antibodies (Sedor2024Mechanism).
