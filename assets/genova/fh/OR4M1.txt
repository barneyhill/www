# OR4M1

## Overview
OR4M1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily M member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory system (Olender2016The). OR4M1 is expressed not only in the olfactory epithelium but also in other tissues such as the testis and potentially the ovaries, indicating a broader physiological role beyond olfaction (Kerslake2021A). The receptor is also involved in glucose metabolism, acting as a primary receptor for the hormone asprosin, which is significant in glucose homeostasis (Kerslake2021A). Furthermore, OR4M1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and metabolic disorders, and is associated with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorder (Alhazmi2024Copy; Raka2021Human).

## Function
OR4M1 is a gene that encodes the olfactory receptor 4M1, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4M1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation (Olender2016The).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4M1 is expressed in other tissues, including the testis and possibly the ovaries, suggesting a broader physiological role. In the ovarian microenvironment, OR4M1 may have an auto/paracrine regulatory function, potentially influencing fertility and ovarian function (Kerslake2021A). The receptor is also implicated in glucose metabolism regulation, as it is considered the primary receptor for the glucogenic hormone asprosin, which is involved in glucose homeostasis (Kerslake2021A).

In the context of ectopic expression, OR4M1 has been associated with various disorders, including metabolic and neurological conditions. Its expression is modified in Alzheimer's disease, indicating potential diagnostic features for biomarker analysis in neurological disorders (Raka2021Human). However, specific functions of OR4M1 in healthy cells remain less defined.

## Clinical Significance
The OR4M1 gene, encoding an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and metabolic disorders. In ovarian cancer, OR4M1 expression is significantly upregulated, with higher levels observed in early-stage cancers compared to late-stage ones. This suggests a potential role in tumor progression and the ovarian tumor microenvironment (Kerslake2022Differential; Kerslake2021A). The gene's expression in circulating cells associated with ovarian cancer also decreases as treatment progresses, indicating its potential involvement in treatment response (Kerslake2022Differential).

In metabolic disorders, OR4M1, the human ortholog of the olfactory receptor OLFR734, is involved in glucose metabolism. It is moderately expressed in liver tissues, suggesting a role in gluconeogenesis. Mutations in OR4M1 could potentially affect glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Li2019OLFR734).

Additionally, OR4M1 is associated with copy number variations in autism spectrum disorder, particularly in the 14q11.2 region. These variations are linked to seizures, motor and cognitive delays, and autistic traits, although the direct clinical significance of OR4M1 mutations remains unclear (Ünsel2020The; Alhazmi2024Copy).
