# VAC14

## Overview
VAC14 is a gene that encodes the VAC14 protein, a critical component of the PIKFYVE complex involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. The VAC14 protein functions as a scaffold within this complex, facilitating the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) levels, which are essential for various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and endomembrane integrity (Schulze2014The; Sbrissa2004A). The protein is characterized by multiple HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions, allowing VAC14 to interact with other regulatory proteins such as Fab1 kinase and Fig4 phosphatase (Alghamdi2023Functional). VAC14 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomal membranes, where it plays a role in regulating endolysosomal and autophagic pathways (Sbrissa2004A). Mutations in the VAC14 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in neural function and its potential impact on neurological health (Zhang2007Loss; Liao2019Novel).

## Structure
The VAC14 protein is integral to the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) levels and acts as a scaffold within the PIKFYVE complex. It consists of 880 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa (Alghamdi2023Functional). Sequence analysis has identified that VAC14 contains between 9 and 21 HEAT repeats, which are helix-loop-helix motifs known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Alghamdi2023Functional). These repeats suggest a role in interacting with other regulatory proteins such as Fab1 kinase and Fig4 phosphatase.

The C-terminal region of VAC14, specifically residues 500 to 880, is crucial for its self-interaction, which is essential for the assembly of the Fab1 complex (Alghamdi2023Functional). Within this region, specific motifs such as F560, L564, I582, R584, and S651, W652, C653 are critical for multimerization, indicating their importance in the protein's quaternary structure (Alghamdi2023Functional). These motifs are located within conserved regions, including a leucine-rich repeat and a HEAT repeat, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Alghamdi2023Functional).

VAC14 also interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through a novel internal PDZ-recognition motif, specifically the sequence -G-D-H-L-D- from amino acids 773 to 777, which is crucial for binding (Lemaire2006Binding). This interaction highlights the functional significance of specific internal sequences in VAC14's structure.

## Function
VAC14 is a crucial component of the PIKFYVE complex, which plays a significant role in phosphoinositide metabolism in mammalian cells. It acts as a positive regulator of the PIKfyve enzyme, which is responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI(5)P) (Sbrissa2004A). These lipids are essential for various cellular functions, including membrane trafficking, protein sorting, and maintaining endomembrane integrity (Sbrissa2004A).

VAC14 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomal membranes, where it influences the morphology and function of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Sbrissa2004A). It is involved in regulating endolysosomal and autophagic pathways, impacting vacuole size and protein accumulation (Schulze2014The). In neurons, VAC14 is present in both dendrites and axons, where it modulates synaptic function by regulating the endocytosis of AMPA receptors and influencing synaptic signaling (Zhang2012Modulation).

The VAC14/PIKfyve/FIG4 pathway is also implicated in the regulation of synaptic strength and neurotransmitter release, highlighting its importance in neural function and its potential link to neurological disorders (Zhang2012Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VAC14 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. Childhood-onset striatonigral degeneration (SNDC) is characterized by early onset dystonia, spasticity, and neurodegeneration, often with preserved cognitive function. MRI findings in SNDC patients typically show abnormalities in the basal ganglia, and in some cases, the thalamus and brain stem are also involved (Karaoğlu2021Expanding; Liao2019Novel). VAC14 mutations have also been linked to Yunis-Varón syndrome (YVS), a severe condition involving skeletal defects, neurological deficits, and often early lethality. This syndrome is marked by intracytoplasmic vacuolation in brain tissues and other organs (Lines2017YunisVarón).

In addition to SNDC and YVS, VAC14 mutations can lead to juvenile parkinsonism-dystonia, which may respond to deep brain stimulation (de2019VAC14). The gene's role in phosphoinositide metabolism is crucial for neural cell survival, and its dysfunction can result in enlarged endolysosomal vacuoles and neurodegeneration (Zhang2007Loss). VAC14-related disorders are often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutations affecting the gene's ability to regulate phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, a key component in cellular membrane processes (Taghavi2017A).

## Interactions
VAC14 is a scaffold protein that interacts with several other proteins, forming complexes crucial for cellular processes. It is a component of the PIKFYVE complex, which includes the lipid kinase PIKFYVE and the phosphatase FIG4. This complex regulates the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate, essential for endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Schulze2014The; Sbrissa2004A).

VAC14 also interacts with VPS16 and VPS53, which are part of complexes necessary for endosome and lysosome assembly and trafficking. VPS53 is involved in the Golgi-associated retrograde protein complex, while VPS16 is a component of the CORVET and HOPS complexes (Schulze2014The). Additionally, VAC14 interacts with Rab GTPases, such as Rab9 and Rab7, and their regulators, including TBC1D15, a Rab7 GTPase-activating protein. These interactions are important for membrane dynamics and identity (Schulze2014The).

VAC14 also binds to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through a PDZ domain, with the interaction mediated by a novel internal PDZ-recognition motif within VAC14 (Lemaire2006Binding). These interactions highlight VAC14's role in regulating membrane budding, fusion, and trafficking.
