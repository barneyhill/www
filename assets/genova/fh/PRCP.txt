# PRCP

## Overview
Prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) is a gene that encodes a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. The PRCP protein is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and inflammation through its participation in the kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems. It functions by converting angiotensin I and II into the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin II-(1-7), thereby influencing vascular homeostasis. PRCP is expressed in several tissues, including the kidney, liver, lung, and placenta, and is active both intracellularly and on cell membranes. The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by interactions with various inhibitors and substrates, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy cellular functions. Alterations in PRCP expression or function have been linked to conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and preeclampsia, underscoring its clinical significance (ShariatMadar2002Identification; Wang2006Prolylcarboxypeptidase; Adams2013Prolylcarboxypeptidase).

## Structure
The human prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) is a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PRCP consists of a single polypeptide chain of 451 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 58,000 as determined by SDS-PAGE (Tan1993Sequencing). The secondary structure includes an α/β hydrolase domain, which is characterized by a prototypical α/β hydrolase fold, and a novel SKS domain that caps the active site (Soisson2010Structural). 

The tertiary structure of PRCP reveals a catalytic triad composed of Ser 179, Asp 430, and His 455, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This triad is part of a unique charge-relay system involving His 456 and Arg 460, contributing to the enzyme's acidic pH optimum (Soisson2010Structural). PRCP also features a hydrophobic pocket formed by Met 183, Met 369, Trp 432, and Trp 459, crucial for substrate recognition (Soisson2010Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, PRCP exists as a dimer in solution, as evidenced by its crystallographic dimerization interface (Soisson2010Structural). The protein undergoes extensive glycosylation at five canonical sites, which contributes to its high solvent content in crystals (Soisson2010Structural).

## Function
Prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) is a serine protease that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the activation of plasma prekallikrein (PK) on endothelial cells, which is crucial for the kallikrein-kinin system, influencing blood pressure regulation and inflammation (ShariatMadar2002Identification). PRCP is expressed on the membranes of endothelial cells and is involved in the conversion of angiotensin I and II to angiotensin II-(1-7), shifting their effects from vasoconstrictive to vasodilatory, thereby promoting nitric oxide and prostacyclin formation (ShariatMadar2002Identification).

PRCP also plays a role in angiogenesis and vascular repair by influencing endothelial cell growth, apoptosis, and migration. It is crucial for cell migration and sprouting, with PRCP-deficient cells showing impaired angiogenesis and delayed wound healing (Adams2013Prolylcarboxypeptidase). The enzyme is active both intracellularly in lysosomes and extracellularly on cell membranes, with high expression in organs such as the kidney, liver, lung, and placenta (Kehoe2016Prolyl). PRCP's activity in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining vascular homeostasis and promoting healthy cell function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PRCP gene have been linked to several health conditions. PRCP deficiency is associated with increased blood pressure, glomerular lesions, and cardiac dysfunction, occurring independently of changes in circulating and cardiac angiotensin II levels (Maier2017Prolylcarboxypeptidase). In the context of kidney disease, particularly in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertensive mice, reduced PRCP expression and activity in clipped kidneys may impair the degradation of angiotensin II, potentially exacerbating hypertension (Grobe2015Loss).

PRCP is also implicated in obesity, as it degrades the peptide neurotransmitter a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH), which regulates appetite and metabolism. Inhibitors of PRCP can counteract obesity, suggesting that changes in PRCP expression levels can influence body weight regulation (Palmiter2009Reduced).

Additionally, PRCP polymorphisms, such as the E112D variant, have been associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, particularly in women with chronic hypertension. This polymorphism may affect PRCP protein function or expression, contributing to higher blood pressure and preeclampsia risk (Wang2006Prolylcarboxypeptidase). PRCP depletion in mice leads to vascular dysfunction, hypertension, and a prothrombotic state, linked to increased reactive oxygen species and endothelial cell dysfunction (Adams2011Murine).

## Interactions
Prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the activation of plasma prekallikrein (PK) to kallikrein. PRCP acts as an endothelial cell prekallikrein activator, requiring the binding of PK to high molecular weight kininogen (HK) for activation. This interaction is crucial for the kallikrein-kinin system, which plays a role in blood pressure regulation and inflammation (ShariatMadar2002Identification).

PRCP interacts with angiotensin II, which can inhibit its activity in activating PK. This interaction highlights PRCP's role in the renin-angiotensin system, where it cleaves angiotensin I and II, converting them to angiotensin II-(1-7), a vasodilatory peptide (ShariatMadar2002Identification; ShariatMadar2004Recombinant).

The enzyme is also inhibited by various serine protease inhibitors, such as DFP and PMSF, and specific inhibitors like antipain and prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors. These interactions suggest that PRCP's activity is tightly regulated by its interaction with these inhibitors (ShariatMadar2002Identification; ShariatMadar2004Recombinant).

PRCP's expression and activity on endothelial cell membranes are biologically relevant, as demonstrated by its significant reduction in PK-generating activity when PRCP expression is downregulated (ShariatMadar2004Recombinant).
