# SNX8

## Overview
SNX8, or sorting nexin 8, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and endosomal sorting. The protein, also named sorting nexin 8, is a member of the SNX-BAR family, characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain and a BAR domain. These domains are crucial for binding phosphoinositides and inducing membrane curvature, respectively, facilitating the protein's role in membrane dynamics and cellular homeostasis (van2010SNX–BAR; Yang2020Sorting). SNX8 is implicated in various cellular processes, including lysosome reformation, endosome-to-Golgi transport, and host defense mechanisms (Li2024SNX8). Its functional significance extends to clinical contexts, where alterations in SNX8 expression are associated with neurodegenerative diseases and lysosomal storage disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024SNX8; Xie2019SNX8).

## Structure
SNX8 (sorting nexin 8) is a member of the sorting nexin family characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain, which is crucial for binding phosphoinositides and targeting the protein to specific membrane domains (TEASDALE2001A; Yang2020Sorting). The PX domain in SNX8 is related to the Phox homology domain family and is involved in protein-protein interactions, featuring a conserved Arg-Arg-Tyr-Xaa-Asp(Glu) motif and a proline-rich motif important for these interactions (TEASDALE2001A).

SNX8 also contains a BAR domain, which is involved in membrane bending and tubulation, forming a dimer that can create a curved structure (van2010SNX–BAR; Yang2020Sorting). This domain is significant for its role in endosomal sorting and trafficking, particularly in the transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus (van2010SNX–BAR).

The protein is involved in lysosome reformation and endosome-to-Golgi transport, with implications in lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Li2024SNX8). SNX8 does not contain putative transmembrane domains or signal peptides, and it has stretches of amino acids capable of forming coiled-coil structures, which are potential sites for protein-protein interactions (TEASDALE2001A). Specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of SNX8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
SNX8 (sorting nexin 8) is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and endosomal sorting, playing a crucial role in lysosome reformation and tubulation. It is part of the SNX-BAR family, which is characterized by the presence of BAR domains that induce membrane bending and promote the formation of membrane tubules, essential for lysosomal and endosomal processes (Li2024SNX8; Yang2020Sorting). SNX8 interacts with LAMP1, a lysosome marker, and binds to phosphoinositides PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2, which are enriched on lysosomes, facilitating its recruitment to lysosomal membranes (Li2024SNX8). 

In healthy human cells, SNX8 is involved in endosome-to-Golgi transport and is active in the endosomal compartments of the cell, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and membrane dynamics (Yang2020Sorting). The protein's role extends to host defense against pathogens and possibly inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Li2024SNX8). SNX8's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining lysosomal function and preventing lysosomal storage disorder phenotypes by enabling lysosome reformation and tubulation (Li2024SNX8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SNX8 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), decreased expression of SNX8 is observed in both human patients and mouse models. This reduction is associated with increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, a hallmark of AD, due to impaired non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Xie2019SNX8; Suzuki2021A). Overexpression of SNX8 has been shown to reduce Aβ levels and improve cognitive function in AD models, suggesting a protective role against AD pathology (Xie2019SNX8; Suzuki2021A).

SNX8 is also implicated in lysosomal storage disorders. It plays a crucial role in lysosome reformation, and its deficiency leads to LSD-like phenotypes, including enlarged lysosomes and cholesterol accumulation. Overexpression of SNX8 can rescue these phenotypes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for LSDs (Li2024SNX8).

Additionally, SNX8 deletions have been associated with neurodevelopmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral problems, highlighting its significance in neurological development (Mastromoro2020Small).

## Interactions
SNX8 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the innate immune response to DNA viruses through its interaction with MITA (also known as STING). SNX8 mediates the trafficking and activation of MITA by recruiting the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34, which is essential for MITA's movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to perinuclear microsomes. This interaction is critical for the production of interferons and cytokines in response to DNA virus infections (Wei2018SNX8).

SNX8 also interacts with LAMP1-positive lysosomes, playing a significant role in lysosome tubulation and reformation. It binds to phosphoinositides PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2 on lysosomes, which is crucial for preventing lysosomal storage disorder phenotypes (Li2024SNX8).

In endosomal recycling, SNX8, the human homolog of the yeast protein Mvp1, interacts with the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1. This interaction is important for membrane scission and the formation of endosomal recycling tubules. SNX8 forms homodimers and is involved in a retromer-independent recycling pathway, highlighting its role in endosomal sorting and membrane dynamics (Suzuki2021A).
