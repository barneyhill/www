# RABL2B

## Overview
RABL2B is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The protein, known as RAB, member of RAS oncogene family like 2B, plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling and transport, particularly in the context of ciliary function and male fertility. As a small GTPase, RABL2B is involved in the localization and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) within mammalian primary cilia, facilitating anterograde transport along the ciliary axoneme through interactions with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery (Dateyama2019RABL2). Additionally, RABL2B is crucial for sperm tail assembly and motility, impacting male fertility by mediating protein transport into the growing sperm tail (Lo2012RABLike; Hosseini2017The). Mutations in the RABL2B gene have been associated with infertility and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Hosseini2017The; Duan2020Rabl2). Furthermore, altered expression of RABL2B has been linked to survival outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in cancer (Anand2020Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Function
RABL2B is a small GTPase that plays a crucial role in the localization and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in mammalian primary cilia. It is involved in the anterograde transport of proteins along the ciliary axoneme, interacting with components of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, specifically the IFT-B complex (Dateyama2019RABL2). RABL2B is recruited to the mother centriole at the ciliary base through distal appendage proteins such as CEP164 and CEP83, which are essential for its localization (Dateyama2019RABL2).

In addition to its role in ciliary function, RABL2B is significant in male fertility. It is expressed in the human testis and is involved in sperm intra-flagellar transport, which is essential for the delivery of proteins into the growing sperm tail. This function is crucial for sperm tail assembly and motility, impacting male fertility (Lo2012RABLike; Hosseini2017The). Mutations in RABL2B have been linked to infertility due to defects in sperm tail structure and function (Hosseini2017The). RABL2B's activity is regulated by GTP, and it is associated with the Golgi apparatus, playing a role in cellular processes like protein transport and signal transduction (Lo2012RABLike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RABL2B gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly affecting male fertility and ciliary function. In the context of male infertility, specific intronic variants in the RABL2B gene, such as 50776482 delC, have been associated with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and immotile short tail sperm (ISTS) defects. These variants potentially alter the splicing of RABL2B pre-mRNA, suggesting a role in the development of these infertility conditions (Hosseini2017The).

RABL2B is also implicated in ciliary signaling, where mutations can lead to significant developmental disorders. For instance, RABL2B mutations can impair ciliary signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog signaling, resulting in phenotypes like polydactyly and other developmental abnormalities (Duan2020Rabl2). Additionally, RABL2B is involved in the localization of G-protein coupled receptors in primary cilia, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions reminiscent of ciliopathies, including male infertility and obesity (Dateyama2019RABL2).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), altered expression of RABL2B is associated with patient survival outcomes. High transcript levels of RABL2B correlate with better survival, while downregulation is linked to poorer outcomes, highlighting its potential prognostic significance in cancer (Anand2020Comprehensive).

## Interactions
RABL2B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular signaling and transport. RABL2B interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, specifically associating with the IFT-B1 complex through the IFT81/74 heterodimer. This interaction is dependent on the GTP-bound state of RABL2B, as it does not co-purify with the complex in the absence of a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue (Boegholm2022The). The IFT81-IFT74 complex enhances GTP hydrolysis to inactivate RABL2B during intraflagellar transport, which is essential for the timing of GTP hydrolysis and proper functioning of RABL2B in this process (Boegholm2022The).

RABL2B is also recruited to the ciliary base by CEP19, and its GTP-bound form is incorporated into IFT trains, which is essential for initiating anterograde transport (Boegholm2022The). The interaction with CEP19 is crucial for RABL2B's localization to the mother centriole, which is necessary for the proper localization of ciliary G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Dateyama2019RABL2). These interactions highlight the role of RABL2B in ciliary function and its involvement in the trafficking and localization of ciliary proteins.
