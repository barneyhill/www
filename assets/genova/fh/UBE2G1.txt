# UBE2G1

## Overview
UBE2G1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G1, a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is classified as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, facilitating their degradation and regulation within the cell. UBE2G1 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the polyubiquitylation and degradation of proteins such as Cdt1, particularly in response to DNA damage. The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to various cellular processes, including protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and stress responses. UBE2G1's function is essential for proper cellular function and stability, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Hill2019Robust; Shibata2011Selective).

## Structure
UBE2G1 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein features an acidic loop near the active site cysteine, which is crucial for its function in synthesizing Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains (Choi2015Differential). This loop contains negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acid residues, which play a significant role in its interaction with ubiquitin (Choi2015Differential).

The molecular mass of UBE2G1 is approximately 18,526 Da, as confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Choi2015Differential). Structural studies have shown that the acidic loop interacts with ubiquitin, affecting the enzyme's ubiquitylation activity (Choi2015Differential). The interaction surface for the acceptor ubiquitin is located on the R-side of UBE2G1, involving the C-terminal region of the donor ubiquitin and the acidic loop (Choi2015Differential).

UBE2G1 does not require an E3 ligase for its activity, unlike some of its homologs, and its ubiquitylation activity is independent of E2 concentration (Choi2015Differential). The protein's structure and function are distinct from its paralog UBE2G2, as it lacks the Cys-48 residue important for dimerization in UBE2G2 (Choi2015Differential).

## Function
UBE2G1 encodes an enzyme that functions as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, a process essential for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. UBE2G1 is particularly important in the polyubiquitylation and degradation of Cdt1, a replication licensing factor, especially in response to DNA damage such as UV irradiation. This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by preventing inappropriate DNA replication initiation in damaged cells (Shibata2011Selective).

In addition to its role in DNA damage response, UBE2G1 also supports SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex)-mediated substrate ubiquitylation. It acts as a dedicated elongation E2 enzyme, facilitating the extension of ubiquitin chains on substrates that have been primed by other enzymes. This function is particularly significant in the context of UBE2R1/2 double knockout cells, where UBE2G1 helps maintain cellular function by compensating for the loss of these enzymes (Hill2019Robust).

UBE2G1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and stress responses, ensuring proper cellular function and stability.

## Clinical Significance
UBE2G1, encoding the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G1, plays a significant role in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation. Alterations in the expression or mutations of UBE2G1 can have profound effects on cellular processes, potentially leading to various diseases. Dysregulation of UBE2G1 has been implicated in cancer, where abnormal ubiquitination can affect the stability and function of proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, contributing to tumorigenesis. In neurodegenerative disorders, improper ubiquitination due to UBE2G1 alterations may lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, exacerbating conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, changes in UBE2G1 expression or function can impact immune system regulation, potentially leading to immune dysfunctions. These alterations can disrupt normal immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections or contributing to autoimmune diseases. Understanding the clinical significance of UBE2G1 mutations and expression changes is crucial for developing targeted therapies for these conditions.

## Interactions
UBE2G1 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a significant role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in the context of cereblon neomorphic substrates. It interacts with UBE2D3 to facilitate the polyubiquitination of substrates like IKZF1 and GSPT1. UBE2D3 initially transfers the first ubiquitin onto the substrate, allowing UBE2G1 to extend the ubiquitin chain, which is crucial for proteasomal degradation (Lu2018UBE2G1). This interaction is essential for the degradation of substrates targeted by cereblon modulating agents such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide (Lu2018UBE2G1).

UBE2G1 also interacts with other E2 enzymes, including UBE2D1 and UBE2D2, suggesting a cooperative mechanism in substrate ubiquitination (Lu2018UBE2G1). The enzyme's acidic loop, containing residues like Tyr-102 and Tyr-104, is crucial for its interaction with ubiquitin, facilitating efficient lysine-48-linked ubiquitylation even in the absence of E3 ligases (Choi2015Differential). Mutations in this loop can significantly reduce UBE2G1's ubiquitylation activity, highlighting the importance of these interactions for its function (Choi2015Differential). These interactions are vital for the enzyme's role in protein degradation pathways, particularly in the context of cereblon neomorphic substrates (Lu2018UBE2G1).
