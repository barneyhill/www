# SPDYE11

## Overview
SPDYE11 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E11, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family known for its role in cell cycle regulation. The protein functions primarily as a modulator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are crucial for cell cycle progression. SPDYE11 is expressed in a variety of human tissues, including the testis, spleen, and brain, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological processes (Wang2018Extensive). Notably, SPDYE11 also modulates α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting intracellular calcium signaling, which is vital for neurotransmission and other cellular functions (Rex2017A). The gene's expression and function have been linked to clinical contexts such as cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Mostovoy2021Genomic; Wang2018Extensive).

## Function
SPDYE11, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, is involved in regulating the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). This gene is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, spleen, bone marrow, skin, placenta, stomach, appendix, and lymph node, indicating its diverse roles in human biology (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE11 is also implicated in early brain development, potentially through its expression in the prefrontal cortex and its involvement in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks that may influence gene expression via microRNAs (Wang2018Extensive).

In terms of molecular function, SPDYE11 has been identified as a modulator of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR), influencing calcium flux without affecting receptor surface expression (Rex2017A). This modulation suggests a role in intracellular calcium signaling, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including neurotransmission and cell cycle regulation (Mostovoy2021Genomic). SPDYE11's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus further supports its involvement in cell cycle checkpoints, ensuring proper cell division and function (Rex2017A).

## Clinical Significance
SPDYE11, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer. Alterations in the expression levels of SPDYE11 are considered prognostic biomarkers in different cancer types, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis (Wang2018Extensive). The gene's expression is notably tissue-specific, with significant expression in the testis, and it may have diverse functions in other tissues, including the development of the prefrontal cortex in fetuses (Wang2018Extensive).

SPDYE11 has also been associated with structural variations at the 7q11.23 locus, which is linked to microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. These structural variations could potentially impact phenotypic outcomes, although the specific clinical significance of SPDYE11 mutations remains to be fully elucidated (Mostovoy2021Genomic).

In the context of neurological function, SPDYE11 has been identified as a modulator of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR), influencing calcium flux. This modulation could have implications for diseases involving cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, although the exact clinical impact of SPDYE11 in these conditions requires further investigation (Rex2017A).
