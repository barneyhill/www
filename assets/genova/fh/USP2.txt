# USP2

## Overview
USP2 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 2) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a type of cysteine protease involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability, localization, and interactions. The protein encoded by USP2 is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. It is involved in various cellular functions, including cell cycle control, apoptosis, metabolism, and circadian rhythm regulation. Dysregulation of USP2 is associated with several diseases, notably cancer, where it influences tumor progression and prognosis. Additionally, USP2 has implications in male fertility, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Renatus2006Structural; Bedard2011Mice; Luo2022Ubiquitin).

## Structure
USP2 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 2) is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a conserved catalytic domain typical of cysteine proteases. The catalytic domain of USP2 spans residues 259-605 and is crucial for its enzymatic activity, featuring a catalytic triad composed of cysteine, histidine, and asparagine (Renatus2006Structural; Zhang2011Contribution). The structure of USP2 resembles a 'cupped hand' and is organized into three domains: the thumb, palm, and fingers. The thumb consists of seven helices, while the fingers include a four-stranded β-sheet and a helix, which are absent in USP7. The palm domain connects the fingers and thumb, formed by several β-strands and α-helices (Renatus2006Structural).

USP2 exists in multiple isoforms, including USP2a, USP2b, and USP2c, which result from alternative splicing. These isoforms share a similar C-terminal domain but differ in the length of their N-terminal domains (Luo2022Ubiquitin). The zinc binding site, coordinated by four cysteine residues, is present but not required for deubiquitinating activity (Renatus2006Structural). USP2's structure is crucial for its function in regulating various cellular processes, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases such as cancer (Luo2022Ubiquitin).

## Function
USP2 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 2) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation. This activity is essential for regulating protein stability, intracellular localization, and protein-protein interactions in healthy human cells (Renatus2006Structural; Luo2022Ubiquitin). USP2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, where it stabilizes Cyclin D1, a protein necessary for G1/S phase progression (Luo2022Ubiquitin). It also influences apoptosis by stabilizing HDM2, which promotes p53 degradation, and RIP1, which can lead to apoptosis (Luo2022Ubiquitin).

USP2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, affecting cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Luo2022Ubiquitin). It plays a role in metabolism by regulating lipoprotein clearance and glucose metabolism, and it is involved in the circadian clock by controlling the nuclear entry of PER1 and stabilizing CRY1, which affects clock-controlled gene expression (Luo2022Ubiquitin). These functions highlight USP2's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target for various physiological and metabolic disorders (Luo2022Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the USP2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. USP2 is highly expressed in various cancers, including breast, bladder, and prostate cancer, and is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), USP2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and cancer stem cell maintenance (Luo2022Ubiquitin). In prostate cancer, USP2a stabilizes fatty acid synthase (FAS), and its inhibition can induce apoptosis, suggesting its role in cell survival (Graner2004The). USP2 also stabilizes oncogenic proteins like Cyclin D1, promoting cell cycle progression and tumor growth. Inhibition of USP2 with small molecules like ML364 accelerates Cyclin D1 degradation, leading to cell cycle arrest in cancer models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Davis2016Small).

In addition to cancer, USP2 plays a role in male fertility. Mice lacking USP2 exhibit severe subfertility due to defects in sperm motility and fertilization, indicating its importance in reproductive health (Bedard2011Mice). These findings underscore the diverse clinical significance of USP2 in both oncological and reproductive contexts.

## Interactions
USP2 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 2) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates the p53 tumor-suppressor protein. USP2 deubiquitinates Mdm2, leading to its accumulation and promoting Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Ventii2008Protein). USP2 also interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein FAS, inhibiting its degradation and protecting prostate cancer cells from apoptosis (Ventii2008Protein).

USP2 has been shown to interact with the KCNQ1 potassium channel, counteracting its downregulation mediated by the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2. This interaction is independent of the PY motif, which is necessary for Nedd4-2's interaction with KCNQ1, indicating that USP2 can bind to KCNQ1 regardless of Nedd4-2's presence (Krzystanek2012Deubiquitylating). USP2 also interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and Nedd4-2, decreasing ubiquitylation and increasing the surface function of ENaC. The interaction with Nedd4-2 is independent of posttranslational modifications, suggesting a regulatory role in Na+ reabsorption (Oberfeld2011Ubiquitinspecific).

These interactions highlight USP2's role in modulating protein stability and function, impacting processes like apoptosis, ion channel regulation, and cancer progression.
