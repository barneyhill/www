# IL12RB1

## Overview
The IL12RB1 gene encodes the interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 1 (IL-12Rβ1), a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by forming part of the receptor complexes for interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23). These receptor complexes are crucial for the differentiation and function of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are essential for adaptive immune responses against intracellular and extracellular pathogens, respectively (Robinson2015IL12Rβ1:; Ford2012Inflammatory). The IL-12Rβ1 protein is characterized by its large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, and it is primarily expressed on immune cells such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (van2013IL12Rβ1; Floss2015Insights). Mutations in the IL12RB1 gene can lead to immunodeficiencies, such as Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD), highlighting its critical role in immune function (Bustamante2014Mendelian; van2013IL12Rβ1).

## Structure
The IL12RB1 gene encodes the IL-12Rβ1 protein, a type I transmembrane receptor involved in immune signaling. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 70.5 kDa in humans and features a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (van2013IL12Rβ1; Floss2015Insights). The extracellular region comprises five fibronectin type III domains, with the first two forming the cytokine binding region, which includes specific cytokine receptor family signatures such as two Cys-Cys pairs and the [STGL]xWSxWS motif (van2013IL12Rβ1). 

The IL-12Rβ1 protein is glycosylated and interacts with the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, with critical residues like Y143, L116, V117, and S118 involved in this interaction (Floss2015Insights). The cytoplasmic domain contains box 1 and box 2 cytokine receptor motifs, essential for signal transduction (van2013IL12Rβ1). 

Alternative splicing of IL12RB1 results in two main isoforms, 662 and 660 amino acids long, differing only in their terminal amino acids, with no known functional differences (Floss2015Insights). A third isoform, lacking the transmembrane domain, is localized intracellularly and is the most abundant in unstimulated human leukocytes (Floss2015Insights).

## Function
The IL12RB1 gene encodes the interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 1, a critical component of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. This protein is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in immune responses by facilitating the signaling of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23) (Robinson2015IL12Rβ1:; Ford2012Inflammatory). In healthy human cells, IL-12Rβ1 is involved in the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, which are essential for adaptive immunity. Th1 cells are crucial for producing interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine vital for defense against intracellular pathogens like mycobacteria, while Th17 cells are important for responses against extracellular bacteria and fungi (van2013IL12Rβ1).

IL-12Rβ1 must associate with IL-12Rβ2 or IL-23R to form functional receptor complexes that bind IL-12 or IL-23, respectively. These complexes activate intracellular signaling pathways involving Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, leading to the transcription of genes involved in immune responses (van2013IL12Rβ1; Hoeve2003IL‐12). The receptor is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where it enhances cytotoxic activity and promotes Th1 cell differentiation, contributing to pathogen defense (Robinson2015IL12Rβ1:; Ford2012Inflammatory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL12RB1 gene, which encodes the interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 1, are primarily associated with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD). This condition is characterized by a heightened vulnerability to infections by weakly pathogenic mycobacteria, such as those from the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and environmental mycobacteria, as well as other intracellular pathogens like Salmonella (Bustamante2014Mendelian; van2013IL12Rβ1). IL12RB1 deficiency is the most common genetic cause of MSMD and results from autosomal recessive mutations that often lead to premature stop codons, disrupting the function of the IL-12Rβ1 protein (van2013IL12Rβ1; Jong1998Severe).

Patients with IL12RB1 mutations may also experience severe tuberculosis, invasive salmonellosis, and mucocutaneous candidiasis due to impaired IL-23-dependent IL-17 immunity (Bustamante2014Mendelian; Ouederni2013Clinical). The clinical presentation of IL12RB1 deficiency is heterogeneous, with some individuals remaining asymptomatic while others suffer from severe infections or early death (van2013IL12Rβ1; Sogkas2017First). The condition exhibits incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals with the mutations will develop symptoms (van2013IL12Rβ1). Genetic testing is recommended for family members of affected individuals to identify carriers and manage potential risks (Bustamante2014Mendelian).

## Interactions
The IL12RB1 protein is a critical component of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23) receptor complexes. It physically interacts with IL12RB2 to form a high-affinity receptor for IL-12, which is essential for effective intracellular signaling and immune responses. This interaction is necessary for the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells and the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, both of which are crucial for pathogen defense (Robinson2015IL12Rβ1:; Presky1996A).

IL12RB1 also interacts with IL-23R to form the IL-23 receptor complex. This complex is involved in the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which play a role in inflammatory and autoimmune responses. The IL-23 receptor complex utilizes the same Jak-STAT signaling pathway as the IL-12 receptor, with IL12RB1 associating with TYK2 and JAK2 kinases to mediate signal transduction (van2013IL12Rβ1; Parham2002A).

Isoform 2 of IL12RB1, which lacks signaling domains, may have a regulatory role by competing with isoform 1 for receptor access or by influencing Th1/Th17 lineage commitment (Ford2012Inflammatory).
