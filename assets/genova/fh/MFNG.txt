# MFNG

## Overview
The MFNG gene encodes the protein MFNG O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, commonly referred to as Manic Fringe, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the Notch signaling pathway. This protein plays a critical role in modulating cell communication and development by adding N-acetylglucosamine to O-fucose residues on epidermal growth factor-like repeats of Notch receptors, a process known as O-fucosylation. This modification affects the interaction between Notch receptors and their ligands, such as Delta and Jagged, thereby influencing Notch signaling dynamics (Moloney2000Fringe). MFNG is particularly significant in developmental biology, where it regulates processes like the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), essential for heart valve development (Yang2023MFNG). Additionally, MFNG's expression and function have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as a prognostic factor and influence tumor progression through its effects on cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration (Gao2023MFNG; Gong2023A).

## Function
The MFNG gene encodes the Manic Fringe protein, a glycosyltransferase involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell communication and development. MFNG modifies Notch receptors by adding N-acetylglucosamine to O-fucose residues on epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a process known as O-fucosylation. This modification influences the interaction between Notch receptors and their ligands, such as Delta and Jagged, thereby modulating Notch signaling (Moloney2000Fringe).

In healthy human cells, MFNG plays a significant role in regulating the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a process essential for heart valve development. By modulating Notch signaling, MFNG promotes the transition of endothelial cells to mesenchymal cells, which is necessary for the formation of cardiac structures like valves and septa (Yang2023MFNG). MFNG's activity is particularly critical during embryonic development, where it is highly expressed in the atrioventricular canal and outflow tract, regions vital for heart development (Yang2023MFNG).

The protein's function extends to influencing cell migration and invasion, as demonstrated by its ability to enhance these processes in endothelial cells, further underscoring its role in developmental biology (Yang2023MFNG).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MFNG gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. High expression of MFNG is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including osteosarcoma, lung adenocarcinoma, thymoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, endocervical adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma (Gao2023MFNG; Gong2023A). In osteosarcoma, high MFNG expression correlates with worse survival outcomes and is considered an independent prognostic factor (Gao2023MFNG). The gene's role in promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells suggests its involvement in tumor progression (Gao2023MFNG).

In a broader cancer context, MFNG expression is linked to the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, with reduced expression potentially increasing cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Gong2023A). The gene's expression is also negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in tumors, indicating a potential role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Gong2023A). Additionally, MFNG's involvement in the Notch signaling pathway, crucial for cell fate and proliferation, highlights its complex role in cancer, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the cancer type (Gong2023A).

## Interactions
MFNG (Manic Fringe) is involved in modulating interactions within the Notch signaling pathway. It acts as a glycosyltransferase, modifying Notch receptors by adding N-acetylglucosamine to O-fucose residues on epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, which influences receptor-ligand interactions. MFNG specifically enhances the binding of Delta ligands to Notch receptors while inhibiting the binding of Jagged ligands (Moloney2000Fringe; Yang2023MFNG).

MFNG has distinct effects on NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 receptors. It inhibits the activation of NOTCH1 by JAG1 and JAG2 and similarly inhibits NOTCH2 activation by these ligands. However, MFNG does not significantly enhance NOTCH2 activation by DLL1, unlike Lunatic Fringe (LFNG), which enhances NOTCH2 activation by both DLL1 and DLL4 (Kakuda2020Canonical). MFNG's inhibitory effect on JAG1-NOTCH2 activation may involve multiple EGF repeats, as suggested by the EGF12V mutation, which allowed LFNG to inhibit JAG1-NOTCH2 activity but had no effect on MFNG (Kakuda2020Canonical).

In the context of cis interactions, MFNG enhances the Notch1-Dll1 interaction, reducing Notch1 availability as Dll1 expression increases. Conversely, it weakens the Notch1-Jag1 interaction, as high levels of Jag1 do not reduce Notch1 availability to background levels (LeBon2014Fringe).
