# CCDC12

## Overview
CCDC12 is a gene located on chromosome 3p21.31 that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 12. This protein is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif often associated with proteins involved in structural support, intracellular transport, and signal transduction (Fan2012Isolation). CCDC12 plays a crucial role in erythroid differentiation, influencing the development of hematopoietic stem cells into mature erythrocytes, and is involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Fan2012Isolation). Beyond its role in normal cellular processes, CCDC12 has been implicated in colorectal cancer, where it acts as a proto-oncogene, promoting tumor development and metastasis through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (Du2022CCDC12). The gene's expression and function in cancer highlight its potential as a therapeutic target, underscoring its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure


## Function
The CCDC12 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in erythroid differentiation, a process where hematopoietic stem cells develop into mature erythrocytes. In the human erythroleukemia K-562 cell line, CCDC12 has been shown to promote early erythroid differentiation. This is evidenced by the up-regulation of CD235 (glycophorin A), a marker of erythroid differentiation, and the modulation of globin expression, including β-globin and γ-globin levels (Fan2012Isolation).

CCDC12 influences cell growth, as its overexpression accelerates growth, while knockdown results in slower proliferation. This suggests a role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Fan2012Isolation). The protein encoded by CCDC12 contains a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that is common in proteins involved in structural support, intracellular transport, and signal transduction. This domain may contribute to its function in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating intracellular communication (Fan2012Isolation).

The gene is located on chromosome 3p21.31, and while its broader cellular functions remain unexplored, its involvement in erythroid differentiation highlights its importance in hematopoietic processes (Fan2012Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC12 gene has been implicated in colorectal cancer, particularly in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). It is significantly overexpressed in COAD tissues compared to normal colon tissues, as confirmed by various experimental techniques such as immunohistochemical staining and RNA-Seq data analysis (Du2022CCDC12). CCDC12 is considered a proto-oncogene, promoting tumor development and invasion through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is crucial for cancer metastasis. This process is regulated via the Snail pathway, with CCDC12 overexpression leading to upregulation of EMT markers like E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail (Du2022CCDC12).

Genome-wide association studies have identified a significant correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs8180040 and CCDC12 expression, suggesting a genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer linked to this gene (Du2022CCDC12). Knockdown of CCDC12 in colon cancer cell lines results in reduced tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion, alongside increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Du2022CCDC12). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CCDC12 in colorectal cancer development and progression, highlighting its role as an oncogene in this context.
