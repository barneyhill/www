# ABHD2

## Overview
ABHD2 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 2, acylglycerol lipase, which is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family. This protein functions primarily as a serine hydrolase enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, playing a critical role in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols and esters into free fatty acids and glycerol. ABHD2 is characterized by its conserved lipid hydrolase domain and is implicated in various biological processes, including sperm activation and oocyte maturation, through its involvement in the endocannabinoid signaling pathway (Nader2024Progesterone; Baggelaar2019ABHD2). Additionally, ABHD2 is involved in calcium signaling and cellular lipid homeostasis, with significant roles in the liver and endoplasmic reticulum (Price2023Lipidomic; Yun2017Regulation). The protein's activity and expression have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and vascular diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2022TDP43; Yamanoi2016Suppression).

## Structure
ABHD2 is a serine hydrolase that belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family, characterized by a conserved lipid hydrolase domain with a GxSxG motif, which is typical for this protein family (Nader2024Progesterone; Lord2013Mammalian). The protein consists of 425 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa (Lord2013Mammalian). It is encoded by 11 exons located on chromosome 15q26.1 (Lord2013Mammalian).

ABHD2 contains a lipase domain crucial for its biological function, particularly in processes like oocyte maturation (Nader2024Progesterone). The protein also has an acyltransferase domain, which is close to the human HxxxD consensus, but with an asparagine (Asn) replacing the aspartate (Asp) residue (Nader2024Progesterone). The full structure, including the lipase domain, is necessary for its function, as demonstrated by the non-functionality of the shorter isoform, ABHD2.L, which lacks the C-terminal end of the α/β hydrolase domain (Nader2024Progesterone).

ABHD2 is predicted to be a single-pass type II membrane protein, although this has not been experimentally confirmed (Lord2013Mammalian). The protein is involved in lipid metabolism and has been linked to various biological processes, including sperm activation and oocyte maturation (Nader2024Progesterone; Baggelaar2019ABHD2).

## Function
ABHD2, also known as lung alpha/beta hydrolase 2, is a serine hydrolase enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. It functions as a triacylglycerol (TAG) lipase and ester hydrolase, playing a role in the breakdown of lipid molecules into free fatty acids and glycerol (M.2016Molecular). ABHD2 is part of the α/β hydrolase superfamily and is characterized by conserved motifs typical of the catalytic triad in hydrolases, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (M.2016Molecular).

In cellular biology, ABHD2 is involved in the regulation of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), influencing calcium signaling and cell death processes. It is localized to the ER and plays a role in the transfer of calcium from the ER to mitochondria, which is important for cellular processes such as bioenergetics and ATP production (Yun2017Regulation). ABHD2's activity in lipid metabolism is also significant in the liver, where it metabolizes phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin, impacting mitochondrial lipid synthesis and homeostasis (Price2023Lipidomic). These functions highlight ABHD2's role in maintaining cellular lipid balance and calcium signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ABHD2 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In ovarian cancer, particularly high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), suppression of ABHD2 is associated with anoikis resistance, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis. Low expression of ABHD2 correlates with increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways, which are linked to platinum resistance and worse survival outcomes in patients (Yamanoi2016Suppression). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ABHD2 is upregulated by TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, which enhances the stability of ABHD2 mRNA. This upregulation promotes lipid metabolism, leading to increased free fatty acids and reactive oxygen species, which suppress apoptosis and facilitate cancer cell proliferation. Targeting the TDP-43/ABHD2 pathway is suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC (Liu2022TDP43).

In vascular biology, ABHD2 plays a role in regulating smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and intimal hyperplasia. Mice lacking ABHD2 exhibit increased SMC migration and neointimal hyperplasia, suggesting its involvement in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis (Miyata2005Increase). 

ABHD2 deficiency is also implicated in the development of pulmonary emphysema, as seen in mice models where its absence leads to increased macrophage infiltration, inflammation, and apoptosis, mirroring human emphysema progression (Jin2009Agerelated).

## Interactions
ABHD2 is involved in various physiological processes, but specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature. However, ABHD2 is known to interact functionally with components of the endocannabinoid signaling pathway. It acts as a progesterone-dependent 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) hydrolase, which is crucial for sperm hyperactivation by opening the CatSper channel in spermatozoa (Baggelaar2019ABHD2). 

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, interacts with ABHD2 mRNA by binding to UG-rich sequences in its 3ʹUTR. This interaction enhances the stability and expression of ABHD2 mRNA, thereby influencing lipid metabolism and suppressing apoptosis in cancer cells (Liu2022TDP43). 

While the STRING protein-protein association network database predicts a potential interaction between ABHD2 and ABHD18, this has not been experimentally validated (Price2023Lipidomic). Overall, while ABHD2's functional roles are well-documented, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
