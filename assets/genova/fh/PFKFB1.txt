# PFKFB1

## Overview
The PFKFB1 gene encodes the enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 1, a bifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. This enzyme is part of the kinase family and is involved in the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a key regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The PFKFB1 protein is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where it modulates metabolic pathways in response to hormonal signals and metabolic states (Houddane2017Role; Bartrons2018Fructose). Its activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in the liver, where it responds to glucagon by altering its kinase and phosphatase activities to balance glucose production and utilization (Houddane2017Role). Additionally, PFKFB1 is implicated in cancer metabolism and cellular responses to hypoxia, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Xie2024LILRB4; Minchenko2003Hypoxic).

## Structure
The PFKFB1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 family, which plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. The gene contains 17 exons and produces four known splicing variants: PFKFB1-201, PFKFB1-202, PFKFB1-203, and PFKFB1-204. These variants are involved in glucose metabolism regulation in non-malignant tissues and are overexpressed in cancer cells (Kotowski2021Role).

The PFKFB1 protein has a bifunctional nature, with distinct kinase and phosphatase domains. The 2-Kase domain is located near the N-terminal end, while the 2-Pase domain is near the C-terminal end. The molecular weight of these functional domains ranges from 55 kDa to 90 kDa (Kotowski2021Role). The protein structure includes three distinct pockets: two in the 2-Kase domains for ATP and F-6-P, and one in the 2-Pase domain for F-2,6-P, which are relevant for drug design (Kotowski2021Role).

In liver tissues, PFKFB1 transcripts include an additional exon encoding the N-termini, which can be phosphorylated in response to glucagon. This phosphorylation enhances bisphosphatase activity while reducing kinase activity, promoting glucose synthesis in the liver (Kotowski2021Role).

## Function
The PFKFB1 gene encodes the liver isoform of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in regulating glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. This enzyme is bifunctional, possessing both kinase and phosphatase activities, allowing it to synthesize and degrade fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP), a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) (Houddane2017Role; Bartrons2018Fructose). In the liver, PFKFB1 is primarily involved in balancing glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in response to hormonal signals. For instance, glucagon stimulates the phosphorylation of PFKFB1 by protein kinase A (PKA), leading to the inactivation of its kinase activity and activation of its phosphatase activity. This results in decreased levels of Fru-2,6-BP, reducing glycolytic flux and enhancing gluconeogenesis (Houddane2017Role).

PFKFB1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue, with different isoforms being regulated by distinct promoters (Houddane2017Role). The regulation of PFKFB1 is crucial for maintaining glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis, particularly in the liver, where it responds to metabolic states and hormonal cues to modulate glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways (Hue1987Role).

## Clinical Significance
PFKFB1 plays a significant role in cancer metabolism, particularly in multiple myeloma (MM). Alterations in PFKFB1 expression are associated with poor prognosis in MM patients, as its overexpression supports tumorigenic activities by enhancing glycolysis and maintaining the metabolic status of cancer cells (Xie2024LILRB4). The LILRB4-STAT3-PFKFB1 pathway is crucial for MM cell proliferation, and blocking LILRB4, which regulates PFKFB1 expression, can inhibit MM growth, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Xie2024LILRB4).

PFKFB1 is also involved in the cellular response to hypoxia, a condition often encountered in tumors. Under hypoxic conditions, PFKFB1 expression is induced, contributing to the adaptation of cells by promoting glycolysis, which is essential for energy production when oxygen is limited (Minchenko2003Hypoxic). This regulation is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors, which enhance PFKFB1 expression in various tissues, indicating its role in conditions where oxygen delivery is compromised, such as ischemic disorders (Minchenko2003Hypoxic).

While specific diseases directly resulting from PFKFB1 mutations are not detailed, its role in metabolic regulation suggests that alterations in its expression could impact conditions like cancer and metabolic syndrome, where energy metabolism is disrupted.
