# KCNJ3

## Overview
KCNJ3 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 3, also known as Kir3.1. This protein is a critical component of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, which are integral membrane proteins involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating cellular excitability. Kir3.1, as part of these channels, plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including cardiac rhythm regulation and neuronal signaling. The protein typically forms heterotetrameric complexes with other GIRK subunits, such as Kir3.4, to function effectively in different tissues, including the heart and brain. Mutations in the KCNJ3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as cardiac arrhythmias and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Yamada2011Association; Yamada2019Mutant).

## Structure
The KCNJ3 gene encodes the Kir3.1 protein, a subunit of the G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels. These channels are characterized by a primary structure that includes two transmembrane domains (M1 and M2), a pore-forming loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Schoots1997Genomic; Yamada2019Mutant). The secondary structure of Kir3.1 involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the formation of the channel's pore (Yamada2019Mutant). 

The tertiary structure of Kir3.1 involves the arrangement of these helices and sheets to form a functional ion channel. The quaternary structure typically involves the formation of homo- or hetero-tetrameric complexes, which are essential for the channel's function in the plasma membrane (Rezania2016Overexpression). 

Kir3.1 is subject to common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Schoots1997Genomic). The KCNJ3 gene also produces several splice variant isoforms, including GIRK1a, GIRK1c, and GIRK1d, which have distinct effects on cellular behavior and are implicated in different physiological and pathological processes (Rezania2016Overexpression).

## Function
The KCNJ3 gene encodes the GIRK1 subunit, a component of the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. These channels are crucial for maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating the duration of action potentials in cells. In the central nervous system, GIRK channels, including those formed by KCNJ3, typically exist as heterotetramers with other GIRK subunits, such as GIRK2. This configuration allows them to play diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues, contributing to neuronal excitability and signal transduction of various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Yamada2011Association).

In the heart, KCNJ3 combines with KCNJ5 to form the acetylcholine-activated potassium channel (IKACh), which is specifically expressed in the atrium. This channel plays a crucial role in heart rate regulation by mediating the effects of parasympathetic stimulation, leading to heart rate slowing. The IKACh channel is a heterotetramer of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 subunits, and its activation by acetylcholine results in hyperpolarization of pacemaker cells, decreasing their automaticity and contributing to the negative chronotropic effect (Yamada2019Mutant).

GIRK channels, including those encoded by KCNJ3, are also involved in various physiological processes such as pain perception, learning and memory, anxiety behavior, and reward mechanisms (Rezania2016Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNJ3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly cardiac and psychiatric disorders. In the context of cardiac health, KCNJ3 mutations are associated with hereditary bradyarrhythmias and atrial fibrillation (AF). A specific mutation, KCNJ3 c.247A>C, p.N83H, has been identified in a Japanese family with autosomal dominant bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node dysfunction and atrio-ventricular block. This mutation results in a gain of function in the IKACh channel, leading to increased basal current and open probability, which contributes to the arrhythmic phenotype (Yamada2019Mutant). The study also identified other mutations, such as KCNJ3 p.N496H, which are associated with AF and may contribute to atrial repolarization heterogeneity (Yamada2019Mutant).

In psychiatric disorders, KCNJ3 has been identified as a susceptibility candidate for schizophrenia. Studies have shown significant associations between certain SNPs in KCNJ3 and schizophrenia in the Chinese population. Additionally, KCNJ3 expression is down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting its involvement in these conditions (Yamada2011Association). The gene's role in regulating neural excitability through GIRK channels may contribute to the pathophysiology of these psychiatric disorders (Yamada2011Association).

## Interactions
KCNJ3, also known as GIRK1, is a subunit of G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. It forms part of a complex with other GIRK subunits, such as KCNJ5 (GIRK4), to modulate ion channel activity. These channels are activated by the G-protein β/γ subunits, which are released upon receptor stimulation, leading to the opening of the channel and allowing potassium ions to flow into the cell (Rezania2016Overexpression). 

In cardiac tissue, KCNJ3 is part of a network with other inward rectifier potassium channels, including KCNJ2 and KCNJ5. These proteins share molecular partners, indicating that they are part of a larger interaction network crucial for cardiac electrophysiology (Maurya2023Outlining). The study by Maurya et al. identified 174 protein interactors for KCNJ3, highlighting its role in complex protein networks that influence cardiac function (Maurya2023Outlining).

In the context of breast cancer, different splice variants of KCNJ3, such as GIRK1a and GIRK1c, have been shown to enhance malignancy-related parameters, while GIRK1d acts as a dominant negative component, suggesting that these variants interact differently within cellular environments (Rezania2016Overexpression).
