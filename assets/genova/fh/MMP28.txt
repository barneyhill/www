# MMP28

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 28 (MMP28), also known as epilysin, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent endopeptidase belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing crucial roles in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and various pathological processes. The MMP28 protein is distinguished by its typical MMP domain structure, including a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif essential for its enzymatic activity (Illman2008Epilysin; Lohi2001Epilysin). MMP28 is expressed in a variety of tissues and is involved in processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), myelination in the nervous system, and macrophage polarization, influencing immune responses and fibrotic outcomes (Rodgers2009Expression; Gharib2013MMP28). Its expression is altered in several diseases, including cancer and pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gobin2019A; Simonova2020Abnormal).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 28 (MMP28), also known as epilysin, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family characterized by a typical MMP domain structure. The primary structure of MMP28 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide domain with a conserved PRCGVTD sequence, a catalytic domain with a unique HEIGHTLGLTH sequence, a hinge region, and a hemopexin-like domain (Illman2008Epilysin; Lohi2001Epilysin). The catalytic domain contains a zinc-binding motif essential for its enzymatic activity (Illman2008Epilysin).

The secondary structure of MMP28 likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of MMPs, contributing to the folding necessary for its function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form the active enzyme, with the hemopexin domain aiding in substrate recognition and inhibitor interactions (Illman2008Epilysin).

MMP28 may form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on this are limited. Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which may explain the observed molecular weight variations in different isoforms (Pavlaki2011Furin). Splice variants of MMP28 exist, with some lacking exon 4, which affects the structure of the catalytic domain (Lohi2001Epilysin).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 28 (MMP28), also known as epilysin, is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, influencing cell function and response to the microenvironment. It is expressed in various normal tissues, including the skin, nervous system, and several tumors, and plays a role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), leading to the loss of E-cadherin and increased expression of MMP-9 and MMP-14 (Rodgers2009Expression).

MMP28 is associated with the ECM and cell surface via heparan sulphate proteoglycans, and its activity is regulated by proprotein convertases. The enzyme's expression is increased in osteoarthritis patients and oral squamous cell carcinomas. MMP28 also affects myelination in the nervous system, with increased expression in demyelinating lesions (Rodgers2009Expression). In the context of macrophage biology, MMP28 promotes macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, which is associated with anti-inflammatory responses and tissue repair, influencing immune responses and fibrotic outcomes in the lung (Gharib2013MMP28).

MMP28 is involved in processes such as wound healing and cancer, with its expression being enhanced in basal keratinocytes during wound healing and in various cancers (Illman2008Epilysin). It is also implicated in epithelial cell survival, particularly in the lung, where it protects against apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or treatment with a protein kinase inhibitor (Manicone2011Epilysin).

## Clinical Significance
MMP28, also known as epilysin, has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In pulmonary fibrosis, MMP28 promotes macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, which is associated with tissue repair and fibrosis. The absence of MMP28 results in impaired M2 polarization and reduced fibrotic responses, suggesting its significant role in regulating macrophage function and fibrosis (Gharib2013MMP28).

In cancer, MMP28 expression is altered in several types. It is downregulated in multiple cancer types, including lung squamous and adenocarcinoma subtypes, which may suggest a role in cancer suppression or a less aggressive cancer phenotype (Gobin2019A). In breast cancer, MMP28 exhibits abnormal hypermethylation in its promoter region, particularly associated with HER2-positive tumors, indicating a potential regulatory role in cancer progression (Simonova2020Abnormal).

MMP28 is also involved in the immune response, as it is positively correlated with the infiltration levels of certain immune cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a role in modulating the immune microenvironment (Liu2023Identification). These findings highlight the diverse roles of MMP28 in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 28 (MMP28), also known as epilysin, participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and signaling. MMP28 is known to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through sulphated glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulphate, which facilitates its binding to the ECM and cell surface (Rodgers2009Expression). This interaction is significant for its role in modulating cell adhesion and migration, particularly through integrins, such as the β1 subunit, which mediate increased adhesion to fibronectin and collagen type II (Rodgers2009Expression).

MMP28 also influences the expression and activity of other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Overexpression of MMP28 leads to increased expression of MMP2, MMP19, and TIMP3, with enhanced MMP-2 activity confirmed through gelatin zymography (Rodgers2009Expression). This suggests that MMP28 may regulate the activity of other MMPs and TIMPs, potentially affecting tissue remodeling and cellular responses.

Additionally, MMP28's interaction with cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans is suggested by its competition with heparin, indicating a role in substrate specificity and cell surface binding (Rodgers2009Expression). These interactions highlight MMP28's involvement in complex regulatory networks within the cellular microenvironment.
