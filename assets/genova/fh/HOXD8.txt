# HOXD8

## Overview
HOXD8 is a gene that belongs to the homeobox (HOX) gene family, which is known for encoding transcription factors that play a pivotal role in developmental processes. The protein encoded by HOXD8, homeobox D8, is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, thereby influencing gene expression patterns crucial for embryonic development, particularly in establishing the anterior-posterior body axis and limb formation (Yu2020HOX; Mansour2017HOXD8). Homeobox D8 is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and vascular development, and is expressed in specific endothelial cell types, indicating its role in cellular differentiation and positional identity (Toshner2014Transcript). The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to several cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Gonçalves2020HOX; Paço2020Methylation).

## Structure
The HOXD8 protein is part of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors characterized by a conserved 60-amino acid homeodomain responsible for DNA binding. The primary structure of HOXD8 includes this homeodomain, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Yu2020HOX). The secondary structure of HOXD8 is predicted to involve the formation of three helices in the N-terminus region, although the presence of poly-A and poly-P residues may hinder the formation of a stable ternary structure (Mansour2017HOXD8). 

The tertiary structure of HOXD8 involves the folding of these helices, but specific details about the quaternary structure are not provided in the available literature. The SWISS-MODEL server analysis identified a template protein with 65.79% sequence identity, which aids in understanding the potential structural conformation of HOXD8 (Mansour2017HOXD8). 

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of HOXD8 are not detailed in the provided context, and further research would be necessary to elucidate these aspects. The role of HOXD8 in various cancers, such as colorectal and ovarian cancer, highlights its significance in cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation (Sun2018Potential; Mansour2017HOXD8).

## Function
HOXD8 is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors that play a crucial role in providing cells with positional information during embryogenesis. These transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gene expression necessary for the development of the anterior-posterior body axis and limb formation (Mansour2017HOXD8). In endothelial cells, HOXD8 is part of a specific HOX gene signature that is associated with the positional identity of these cells. It is highly expressed in blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) compared to pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), suggesting a role in distinguishing endothelial cells based on their origin and potentially influencing angiogenesis and vascular development (Toshner2014Transcript).

HOXD8 is also involved in the programming of angiogenesis, as evidenced by its expression in the endothelium of the cardiovascular system during fetal development, particularly in the developing cardiac area and major vessels (Toshner2014Transcript). The gene's expression is significant during the peak of lung angiogenesis in fetal development, indicating its fundamental role in endothelial biology and vascular development (Toshner2014Transcript).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXD8 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HOXD8 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with higher tumor grades and poorer survival rates. Overexpression of HOXD8 in TNBC cell lines has been shown to decrease cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis by modulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Zhang2021HOXD8).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), hypermethylation of HOXD8 is observed in short-term survivors, suggesting a role in prognosis. The gene's expression patterns in gliomas indicate its potential involvement in tumor progression (Gonçalves2020HOX).

HOXD8 is also noted as a potential therapeutic target in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and is involved in distinguishing long- and short-term glioblastoma survivors. Its methylation status is considered a biomarker in gastric cancer, affecting cell proliferation (Paço2020Methylation).

In leukemia, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), no significant changes in HOXD8 expression levels were observed, suggesting its limited role in these conditions (Saraymen2023Evaluation).

## Interactions
HOXD8 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly with other members of the HOX gene family. It can inhibit the trans-activation function of the HOXD9 protein on the HCR target through interactions that do not require DNA binding. This inhibition is mediated by the amino terminus and helix 1 region of the HOXD8 homeo domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Zappavigna1994Specificity). HOXD8 can establish protein-protein contacts with HOXD9 in solution, independent of DNA, and this interaction is mediated by the amino terminus/helix 1 subregion of both homeo domains (Zappavigna1994Specificity).

HOXD8 also interacts with at least six HOX proteins from different clusters and paralogous groups, indicating a broad capacity for protein-protein interactions within the HOX family (Zappavigna1994Specificity). The specificity of these interactions is influenced by the amino terminus/helix 1 region of the homeo domain, which serves as a protein-protein contact interface (Zappavigna1994Specificity). These interactions are critical for the functional specificity of HOX proteins, as they can modulate the activity of other HOX proteins, such as HOXD9 and HOXD10, through inhibitory mechanisms (Zappavigna1994Specificity).
