# FGF7

## Overview
FGF7, also known as the fibroblast growth factor 7 gene, encodes a protein commonly referred to as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). This protein is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is characterized by its involvement in a wide range of biological processes, including cell growth, development, and tissue repair. FGF7 is particularly notable for its role in epithelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, acting primarily through the FGFR2-IIIb receptor, which is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues (Braun2004Fibroblast; Powers2000Fibroblast). The protein's structure includes a unique heparin-binding domain and a conserved hydrophobic patch that facilitate its interactions with receptors and co-receptors, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are crucial for its biological activity (Zinkle2019Structural; Ye2001Structural). FGF7's functions are essential in processes like wound healing and tissue regeneration, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, gastric diseases, and certain cancers (Zhou2019Mir4553p1; Shang2018miR‐381‐3p; Shaoul2006Elevated).

## Structure
FGF7, also known as keratinocyte growth factor, is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family characterized by a core homology domain of approximately 120 amino acids forming a β-trefoil fold composed of 12 β-strands (Zinkle2019Structural; Belov2013Molecular). This structure is flanked by variable N- and C-terminal extensions (Zinkle2019Structural). The β-trefoil fold is a common feature among FGFs, providing a stable framework for receptor and heparin binding (Belov2013Molecular).

The FGF7 protein includes a unique heparin-binding (HB) domain, which differs from those in FGF1 and FGF2. This domain is characterized by a dispersed positive surface charge, affecting its interaction with heparin oligosaccharides (Ye2001Structural). Specific residues such as Arg-18 and Asn-92 contribute to this unique charge distribution, influencing FGF7's binding affinity and specificity for heparin (Ye2001Structural).

FGF7's structure also features a conserved hydrophobic patch involved in receptor binding, with residues like Phe-16 and Tyr-22 playing crucial roles (Ye2001Structural). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with FGFR2b, facilitated by specific contacts in the D3 domain of the receptor, which are crucial for its specificity (Zinkle2019Structural; Belov2013Molecular).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), also known as keratinocyte growth factor, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of epithelial cells. It is primarily secreted by fibroblasts and acts in a paracrine manner, targeting epithelial cells through the FGFR2-IIIb receptor, which is predominantly expressed by these cells (Braun2004Fibroblast; Powers2000Fibroblast). FGF7 is involved in various cellular processes, including wound healing, tissue repair, and cytoprotection. It stimulates the division and proliferation of epithelial cells, such as skin keratinocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, and protects them from damage caused by radiation and oxidative stress (Braun2004Fibroblast).

In the context of tissue repair, FGF7 is upregulated following epithelial injury, promoting reepithelialization and the expression of cytoprotective genes (Braun2004Fibroblast). It also plays a significant role in the regeneration of renal tubules and the repair of the intestinal epithelium, particularly in inflammatory conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Braun2004Fibroblast; Powers2000Fibroblast). FGF7's activity is crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and facilitating recovery from injury, highlighting its importance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FGF7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), FGF7 is upregulated, contributing to increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. This upregulation is linked to the activation of the RAS/ERK signaling pathway, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of PAH (Zhou2019Mir4553p1).

FGF7 is also associated with gastric diseases, where its expression is elevated in conditions such as gastric inflammation and gastric cancer. This upregulation is linked to epithelial cell hyperplasia and is thought to contribute to gastric tumorigenesis. The regulation of FGF7 in these conditions is primarily posttranscriptional, with increased levels of FGF7 protein observed in gastric pathologies (Shaoul2006Elevated).

In cervical cancer, FGF7 acts as an oncogene, with its expression being upregulated in cancerous tissues. This upregulation is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting that FGF7 contributes to the progression of cervical cancer (Shang2018miR‐381‐3p).

## Interactions
FGF7, also known as keratinocyte growth factor, primarily interacts with the FGFR2IIIb receptor, a specific isoform of the fibroblast growth factor receptor found in epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for mesenchyme-to-epithelium signaling, which is essential for organ development and tissue patterning (Zinkle2019Structural; Ye2001Structural). The specificity of FGF7 for FGFR2IIIb is achieved through specific contacts with alternatively spliced loop regions in the immunoglobulin-like domain 3 (D3) of the receptor (Zinkle2019Structural).

FGF7 also interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which serve as co-receptors and are important for stabilizing the FGF-FGFR complex. This interaction promotes the formation of a 2:2 FGF:FGFR dimer necessary for activating the intracellular kinase domains of FGFRs (Zinkle2019Structural). The heparin-binding domain of FGF7 is unique and requires specific heparan sulfate motifs, which influence its localization, stability, and trafficking in the microenvironment (Ye2001Structural).

Additionally, FGF7's interaction with heparan sulfate is weaker compared to other FGFs like FGF1 and FGF2, due to its unique surface charge distribution and specific structural requirements (Ye2001Structural). These interactions are crucial for FGF7's role in processes such as wound healing and tissue repair.
