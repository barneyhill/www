# CALCOCO2

## Overview
CALCOCO2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as Calcium Binding and Coiled-Coil Domain 2, which functions as a ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptor. This protein plays a pivotal role in selective autophagy, a cellular process that targets specific components for degradation and recycling, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. CALCOCO2 is particularly involved in xenophagy, where it targets intracellular pathogens for degradation, contributing to the innate immune response. Additionally, it is essential for mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, which is crucial for reducing oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial quality. The protein interacts with various microtubule-associated proteins and is involved in modulating proinflammatory signaling pathways, acting as a molecular circuit breaker to prevent excessive inflammation. CALCOCO2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is implicated in several diseases, including multiple sclerosis, glioma, and viral infections, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Mohamud2018CALCOCO2NDP52; Cui2021Calcium‑binding; Di2021A).

## Function
The CALCOCO2 gene encodes a protein known as Calcium Binding and Coiled-Coil Domain protein, which functions as a ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptor. In healthy human cells, CALCOCO2 plays a crucial role in selective autophagy, a process that targets specific cellular components for degradation and recycling. It is involved in xenophagy, where it targets intracellular pathogens for degradation, thereby contributing to innate immunity. CALCOCO2 interacts with microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B, and GABARAP-like proteins to regulate the targeting and maturation of pathogen-containing autophagosomes (Verlhac2015Dual; Cui2021Calcium‑binding).

CALCOCO2 is also essential for mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial quality and reducing oxidative stress (Di2021A). It acts as a docking platform for MYO6-bound endosomes, facilitating autophagosome maturation (Verlhac2015Dual). In the context of cellular signaling, CALCOCO2 modulates proinflammatory signaling by regulating NFKB activation, acting as a molecular circuit breaker to reduce excessive inflammation (Till2013Autophagy). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it maintains cellular homeostasis by protecting the cytosol from bacterial infections and regulating immune responses (Cui2021Calcium‑binding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CALCOCO2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a natural variant of CALCOCO2, specifically the G140E mutation, is associated with decreased susceptibility to the disease. This variant enhances the removal of damaged mitochondria and reduces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, following B cell stimulation, which may contribute to its protective effect against MS (Di2021A).

In glioma, a type of brain tumor, CALCOCO2 is highly expressed, and its silencing has been shown to inhibit cell growth and increase apoptosis in glioma cell lines. This suggests that CALCOCO2 plays a significant role in glioma progression and could be a potential target for gene therapy (Tian2020CALCOCO2).

In the context of viral infections, CALCOCO2 is involved in the propagation of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). It facilitates virophagy and impairs the host's antiviral response by promoting the degradation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, thereby enhancing viral replication (Mohamud2018CALCOCO2NDP52).

Altered expression of CALCOCO2 has also been linked to heart failure, particularly in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), where it is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac remodeling (GilCayuela2019The).

## Interactions
CALCOCO2, also known as NDP52, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in autophagy and cellular processes. It interacts with microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (MAP1LC3)B and MAP1LC3C, which are essential for autophagosome maturation (Verlhac2015Dual). CALCOCO2 also binds to sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1/p62), a key player in selective autophagy, and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein, indicating its involvement in autophagic processes (Cui2021Calcium‑binding).

In the context of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, CALCOCO2 interacts with the processing body (PB) scaffolding protein Pat1b, facilitating the disassembly of PBs through autophagy (Robinson2023Kaposi’s). This interaction is crucial for the degradation of specific PB components, such as Dcp1a, during KSHV infection (Robinson2021Kaposi’s).

CALCOCO2 also plays a role in mitophagy by interacting with proteins like RB1CC1 and ATG9A, which are involved in the initiation of autophagic membranes on ubiquitin-coated mitochondria (Yamano2020Two). These interactions highlight CALCOCO2's role in linking damaged mitochondria to the autophagy machinery.
