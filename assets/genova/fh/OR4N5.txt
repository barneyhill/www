# OR4N5

## Overview
The OR4N5 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily N member 5, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a pivotal role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Wang2024A). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR4N5 has been implicated in influencing taste preferences, such as the perception of cilantro's flavor, through genetic variations (Hayes2013Do; mauer2011genetic). The receptor's expression and potential roles in other physiological processes are subjects of ongoing research, highlighting its broader significance in sensory perception (Wang2024A).

## Function
The OR4N5 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Wang2024A). The binding of odorants to OR4N5 activates intracellular signaling cascades, contributing to the responses of olfactory sensory neurons (Wang2024A).

In addition to its role in olfactory perception, OR4N5 has been associated with taste preferences, particularly in the context of cilantro preference. A significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the OR4N5 gene has been linked to the perception of cilantro's 'soapy' flavor, influencing individual taste preferences (Hayes2013Do; mauer2011genetic). This suggests that OR4N5 may have broader implications in sensory perception beyond olfaction.

While the primary function of OR4N5 in healthy human cells is related to olfactory perception, its expression and potential roles in other tissues and physiological processes remain areas of ongoing research (Wang2024A).
