# ANKMY1

## Overview
ANKMY1 is a human gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and MYND domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat and MYND domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function, with ankyrin repeats facilitating protein-protein interactions and the MYND domain potentially playing a role in transcriptional regulation. The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the assembly and function of the central apparatus of mammalian sperm axoneme, where it interacts with several other proteins. The structural features of ANKMY1, including its modular architecture and potential post-translational modifications, suggest a complex role in cellular regulatory networks (Svirid2017Direct; Zhu2024Incell).

## Structure
ANKMY1 is a human gene encoding a protein that features ankyrin repeat and MYND domains. Ankyrin repeats are prevalent protein motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's structural stability and functional versatility. The MYND domain is a zinc-binding motif, often implicated in transcriptional regulation, suggesting a role in modulating gene expression. The presence of these domains indicates that the ANKMY1 protein may participate in complex regulatory networks within the cell.

The protein's structure is likely influenced by post-translational modifications, which can alter its activity and localization. These modifications may include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or other chemical changes that impact the protein's function and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of ANKMY1 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct structural and functional properties. These variants could result in differences in domain composition or arrangement, further diversifying the protein's role in cellular processes.

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ANKMY1 are not provided, the presence of ankyrin repeats and MYND domains suggests a modular architecture that supports diverse biological functions. The interplay between these domains and potential post-translational modifications underscores the complexity of ANKMY1's structural and functional landscape.

## Interactions
ANKMY1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly within the central apparatus (CA) of mammalian sperm axoneme. It interacts with the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CCDC180, GRK3, and the N-terminal globular domains of CFAP99, suggesting its role in the assembly of the C1-MOSP structure, a component of the CA. ANKMY1 is positioned near the RS8 interface with CFAP54, indicating its potential involvement in CA-RS interactions (Zhu2024Incell).

In addition to its role in the sperm axoneme, ANKMY1 has been identified as a potential protein partner for TBXAS1, a human thromboxane synthase, through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. This interaction suggests that ANKMY1, which contains ankyrin repeats known for mediating protein-protein interactions, may recognize structural motifs of TBXAS1. However, the study emphasizes that these are potential partners and may include extraneous proteins (Svirid2017Direct).

Despite these findings, there is no evidence from the provided context that ANKMY1 interacts with nucleic acids. The interactions described are primarily protein-protein, contributing to its role in cellular structures and processes.
