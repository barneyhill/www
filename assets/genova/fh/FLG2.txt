# FLG2

## Overview
The FLG2 gene encodes the protein filaggrin-2, which is a member of the S100 fused-type protein family. Filaggrin-2 plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of the epidermal barrier, contributing to skin hydration and protection against environmental insults. It is primarily expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis, where it undergoes proteolytic processing to fulfill its functions. Structurally, filaggrin-2 is similar to filaggrin and is involved in the aggregation of keratin filaments, essential for the structural integrity of the stratum corneum. The protein also exhibits antimicrobial properties, particularly through its C-terminal fragments, which interfere with bacterial replication. Variants in the FLG2 gene have been associated with skin-related conditions such as atopic eczema and leg ulcers, underscoring its clinical significance in epidermal barrier function and skin health (Dębińska2022Genetic; Wu2009Molecular; Hansmann2015SkinDerived).

## Structure
The FLG2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the S100 fused-type protein family, featuring an open reading frame of 7176 nucleotides, resulting in a protein of 2391 amino acids (Wu2009Molecular). The primary structure of FLG2 includes a large central repetitive region with two types of tandem repeats: A-type and B-type. The A-type domain consists of nine conserved repeats characterized by four regularly spaced phenylalanine residues, while the B-type domain consists of fourteen conserved repeats without regularly spaced phenylalanine (Wu2009Molecular). These repeats are rich in histidine and glutamine, which are precursors to natural moisturizing factors (Wu2009Molecular).

The protein features an S100/ICaBP type calcium-binding domain and an EF-hand domain at its amino terminus (Wu2009Molecular). The S100 domain, located within amino acids 2-95, specifically binds to SASPase, suggesting a role in regulating SASPase auto-activation (Donovan2020Filaggrin). FLG2 undergoes proteolytic processing, and its fragments exhibit antimicrobial properties, particularly the C-terminal fragments, which interfere with bacterial DNA replication (Hansmann2015SkinDerived). The protein is processed by endoproteases to generate major products, similar to filaggrin, and is involved in forming cross-links with neighboring proteins through transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions (Wu2009Molecular).

## Function
The FLG2 gene encodes filaggrin-2, a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the epidermal barrier in human skin. Filaggrin-2 is involved in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation and cornification, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the stratum corneum (SC) (Pendaries2015In; Wu2009Molecular). It is primarily expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis, specifically in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, where it is proteolytically processed and deposited (Wu2009Molecular).

Filaggrin-2 is structurally similar to filaggrin and is involved in the aggregation of keratin filaments, which is essential for maintaining skin hydration and providing a barrier against environmental insults (Wu2009Molecular). The protein contains a high proportion of histidine and glutamine residues, which are precursors to natural moisturizing factors like urocanic acid, important for skin hydration (Wu2009Molecular). Additionally, filaggrin-2 contributes to the production of natural moisturizing factor components and helps control the pH at the stratum corneum surface, providing photoprotection to the epidermis (Pendaries2015In).

In addition to its structural role, filaggrin-2 has antimicrobial properties. Its C-terminal fragments exhibit potent antimicrobial activity, particularly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by interfering with bacterial replication (Hansmann2015SkinDerived). This antimicrobial activity is crucial for protecting skin areas frequently exposed to environmental microbes (Hansmann2015SkinDerived).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FLG2 gene are associated with several skin-related conditions. The FLG2 rs12568784[T] variant is identified as a risk factor for atopic eczema and eczema-associated asthma, with a significant association observed in European children. This variant is linked to allergic sensitization and the complex phenotype of asthma plus eczema, suggesting that FLG2 gene variants contribute to the progression from atopic eczema to other allergic conditions due to epidermal barrier dysfunction (Dębińska2022Genetic). 

In sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients, a stop codon variant in the FLG2 gene is associated with an increased risk of leg ulcers. This variant is believed to impair the skin barrier, increasing susceptibility to inflammation and infection, which may contribute to ulcer development (de2019Wholeexome). The rs12568784 variant in FLG2, which results in a premature stop codon, is also associated with persistent atopic dermatitis in African Americans, potentially causing a loss of function in the protein filaggrin-2 and impairing skin barrier function (de2019Wholeexome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FLG2 in skin barrier-related disorders.

## Interactions
Filaggrin 2 (FLG2) is known to interact with the skin aspartic acid protease (SASPase), particularly through its N-terminal domain (FLG2Nter). This interaction is crucial for the autoactivation of SASPase, which plays a significant role in the processing of profilaggrin to its intermediate isoforms, essential for skin hydration and barrier function (Donovan2020Filaggrin). The interaction between FLG2Nter and SASPase was identified using yeast two-hybrid analyses and confirmed through surface plasmon resonance studies, demonstrating that FLG2Nter specifically binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase (Donovan2020Filaggrin).

Immunohistochemical studies have shown partial co-localization of FLG2Nter and SASPase in the stratum granulosum of human skin, suggesting that this interaction occurs in the differentiated layers of the epidermis (Donovan2020Filaggrin). The interaction is hypothesized to take place in the acidic environment of lamellar bodies, where SASPase is secreted, facilitating its autoactivation (Donovan2020Filaggrin). This regulatory role of FLG2Nter in SASPase activation underscores its importance in epidermal homeostasis and barrier formation (Donovan2020Filaggrin).
