# GNB1L

## Overview
GNB1L is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit beta 1-like protein, which is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of DNA replication and repair. The protein shares structural similarities with the beta subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are integral to signal transduction pathways. Functionally, GNB1L plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), such as ATM and ATR, which are essential for the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stability (Zhao2022Genome-scale). The protein's interactions with the TTT and RUVBL1/2 complexes facilitate the stabilization of replication forks and prevent double-strand breaks during DNA replication (Zhao2022Genome-scale). GNB1L is also implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, due to its location in the 22q11.2 region, a known hotspot for genetic variations associated with these conditions (Chen2011Evidence). The gene's knockout in mice results in embryonic lethality, underscoring its essential role in early development (Chen2011Evidence).

## Structure
The GNB1L gene encodes a protein that shares similarities with the beta subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which play a crucial role in signal transduction. The primary structure of the GNB1L protein consists of specific amino acid sequences that form distinct domains. These domains are essential for the protein's function in cellular signaling pathways.

In terms of secondary structure, the GNB1L protein may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of GNB1L involves the three-dimensional folding of these secondary elements, allowing the protein to achieve its functional form necessary for interaction with other cellular components.

The quaternary structure of GNB1L could involve the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the protein's activity and interactions, potentially altering its role in signal transduction pathways.

Splice variants of the GNB1L gene may lead to the production of different isoforms, each with potentially distinct functions. These isoforms allow for a diversity of roles in cellular processes, reflecting the complexity and adaptability of the GNB1L protein in human physiology.

## Function
The GNB1L gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), including ATM and ATR, which are essential for the DNA damage response and cell viability under replication stress (Zhao2022Genome-scale). GNB1L interacts with the TTT and RUVBL1/2 complexes to promote the biogenesis of newly synthesized PIKKs, similar to the function of TELO2 (Zhao2022Genome-scale). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by stabilizing replication forks and preventing double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication (Zhao2022Genome-scale).

GNB1L is also involved in preventing replication catastrophe, a condition characterized by extensive single-stranded DNA that can lead to DSB formation (Zhao2022Genome-scale). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may impact neuronal signaling and development, given its association with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism (Chen2011Evidence). The gene's knockout in mice results in embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in early development (Chen2011Evidence). GNB1L's function in healthy human cells is primarily linked to its role in DNA repair pathways and maintaining genome integrity (Zhao2022Genome-scale).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GNB1L gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. The gene is located in the 22q11.2 region, a hotspot for structural variations associated with these conditions. A balanced translocation disrupting GNB1L has been linked to both ASD and schizophrenia, suggesting shared genetic influences modulated by gene dosage (Chen2011Evidence). In ASD, specific missense variants in the GNB1L gene, such as R88W, R283Q, and V290M, have been identified, although these variants do not consistently co-segregate with ASD diagnoses, indicating the presence of additional risk factors (Chen2011Evidence).

In schizophrenia, reduced expression of GNB1L has been observed in the prefrontal cortex of affected individuals, supporting its potential role in the disorder (Ishiguro2008Supportive). Studies have shown that GNB1L expression is lower in schizophrenic brains compared to controls, and this reduction is not solely due to antipsychotic treatment (Ishiguro2008Supportive). The gene's involvement in schizophrenia is further supported by evidence of its association with deficits in prepulse inhibition, a schizophrenia endophenotype, in mouse models (Prasad2008Candidate).

## Interactions
The GNB1L protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of DNA replication stress response and PIKK protein biogenesis. GNB1L interacts with the TTT complex, which includes TELO2, TTI1, and TTI2, as well as all six members of the PIKK family: DNA-PKcs, ATM, ATR, mTOR, SMG1, and TRRAP. These interactions were identified using affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-based interaction proteomics, and confirmed by streptavidin pulldowns, immunoblot analysis, and a NanoBRET assay, which demonstrated a physical interaction between GNB1L and TELO2 (Zhao2022Genome-scale).

GNB1L is essential for the biogenesis of PIKK proteins, including ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs. Its interaction with TELO2 is crucial for the stability and biogenesis of these proteins, as evidenced by the impaired PIKK levels observed in a TELO2 mutant deficient in GNB1L binding (Zhao2022Genome-scale). The GNB1L-TELO2 interaction is part of a larger complex involving the TTT-RUVBL1/2 cochaperone complex, which is suggested to be the dominant pathway for PIKK biogenesis in human cells (Zhao2022Genome-scale). These interactions highlight GNB1L's role in maintaining genome integrity and cellular response to DNA damage.
