# KLK11

## Overview
KLK11, or kallikrein-related peptidase 11, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme belonging to the kallikrein family, which is characterized by its trypsin-like specificity. This gene is located on chromosome 19 and is part of a larger cluster of kallikrein genes that are known for their roles in various physiological processes, including cellular signaling and tissue remodeling (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Emami2007New). The protein product of KLK11, kallikrein-related peptidase 11, is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and undergoes activation through proteolytic cleavage. It is expressed in multiple human tissues, such as the skin, stomach, prostate, and ovary, where it contributes to processes like skin desquamation and the modulation of cellular environments (Mavridis2010Prognostic; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). KLK11 has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis in various cancers, including colorectal adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer (Alexopoulou2014KLK11; Shigemasa2004Human).

## Structure
KLK11, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, is a serine protease with a trypsin-like specificity due to a conserved aspartic acid residue in its substrate-binding pocket. This specificity allows KLK11 to accept amino acids with large hydrophobic side chains, similar to chymotrypsin (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Emami2007New). The protein is synthesized as a single-chain preproenzyme and undergoes activation through limited proteolysis, a common feature among kallikrein-related peptidases (Emami2007New).

Structurally, KLK11 shares similarities with other kallikreins, which typically have two hydrophobically interacting domains of six-stranded β-barrels and an α-helix, with the catalytic triad located at the interface between these domains (Emami2007New). The kallikrein loop, a structural element affecting substrate access, is absent or shorter in KLK11 compared to other kallikreins like KLK1-3 (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

KLK11 is subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus before secretion (Kryza2016The). The gene also produces splice variants, resulting in different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Kryza2016The).

## Function
KLK11, or kallikrein-related peptidase 11, is a serine protease enzyme involved in various physiological processes. It is part of a family of enzymes encoded by genes located on chromosome 19, which are synthesized as inactive zymogens and activated through specific proteolytic cleavage, often by trypsin-like enzymes (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). KLK11 is expressed in several human tissues, including the skin, stomach, prostate, and ovary, where it plays roles in cellular signaling and tissue remodeling (Mavridis2010Prognostic).

In the skin, KLK11 is part of a proteolytic cascade that is crucial for maintaining epidermal barrier homeostasis. It is activated by KLK5, which is a key enzyme in the cascade, and its activity is influenced by the skin's pH gradient and water content (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). KLK11's trypsin-like specificity allows it to participate in processes such as skin desquamation, where it may contribute to the degradation of desmosomal proteins, facilitating the shedding of skin cells (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

While KLK11's specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in proteolytic cascades suggests a role in modulating cellular environments and influencing physiological processes such as tissue remodeling and cellular signaling.

## Clinical Significance
KLK11 (kallikrein related peptidase 11) has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis. In colorectal adenocarcinoma, KLK11 mRNA is significantly overexpressed in malignant tumors compared to noncancerous tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor disease-free and overall survival, making KLK11 a potential prognostic marker for this cancer type (Alexopoulou2014KLK11).

In ovarian cancer, KLK11 expression presents a complex picture. Some studies suggest that high KLK11 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes, indicating its role as an unfavorable prognostic marker (Shigemasa2004Human). However, other research indicates that KLK11 positivity is associated with increased progression-free and overall survival, particularly in early-stage and lower-grade ovarian carcinomas, suggesting a favorable prognosis in these cases (Borgoño2003Favorable).

KLK11 also acts as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), where its under-expression is linked to increased cell proliferation and invasion. Upregulation of KLK11 in LSCC cells reduces tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2021KLK11).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, KLK11 is upregulated in tumor tissues and is associated with worse overall survival, suggesting its role as a negative prognostic factor (li2020diagnostic).

## Interactions
KLK11, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, is involved in various interactions that influence cancer progression and other physiological processes. KLK11 participates in the degradation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), which is linked to elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in breast cancer patients. This interaction suggests a role for KLK11 in modulating IGF signaling pathways, impacting cancer cell phenotype and progression (Avgeris2012Kallikreinrelated).

KLK11 is also involved in the proteolytic activation of several proteases and cell surface receptors, contributing to tumorigenic stimuli in breast cancer. Its expression is influenced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which is overexpressed in advanced breast cancer, and it stimulates KLK11 expression along with the B1 bradykinin receptor (OZTURK2021Kallikrein).

In skin physiology, KLK11 is activated by KLK5, suggesting a cascade reaction in the skin. This activation is part of a broader network of kallikrein-related peptidases that regulate various skin processes (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). However, specific details on KLK11's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented in the available literature.
