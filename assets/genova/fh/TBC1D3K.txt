# TBC1D3K

## Overview
TBC1D3K is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3K, which is part of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family. This family is known for its role in regulating intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics, primarily through its function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases. The TBC1 domain family member 3K protein is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle transport and signal transduction pathways, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Alterations in the expression or function of TBC1D3K have been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research and therapeutic development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
