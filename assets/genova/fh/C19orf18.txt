# C19orf18

## Overview
C19orf18, or chromosome 19 open reading frame 18, is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes a protein of the same name. The protein encoded by C19orf18 is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain largely unexplored (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite this, emerging research suggests that C19orf18 may play a role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. Alterations in the expression of C19orf18 have been associated with prognostic outcomes in several types of cancer, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others (Ershov2023Uncharacterized; Chen2021Predictive). Additionally, the gene has been implicated in DNA methylation patterns linked to epithelial ovarian cancer risk (Fridley2014Methylation). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of the C19orf18 protein in these and other biological contexts.

## Clinical Significance
C19orf18 has been implicated in several cancers, with alterations in its expression levels associated with disease prognosis. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), low expression levels of C19orf18 correlate with unfavorable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker in these cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). In ovarian granulosa cell tumors (GCTs), C19orf18 has been identified as a deleted gene in some tumors, although its specific role in these tumors remains unexplored (Caburet2015Combined).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), C19orf18 is down-regulated in high proliferative groups, which are associated with poor prognosis, indicating its potential involvement in tumor proliferation dynamics (Chen2021Predictive). Additionally, in bladder cancer, C19orf18 is considered a protective gene within a lactate-related gene signature used to predict patient outcomes, with lower expression levels associated with better prognosis (Hu2022A).

C19orf18 is also linked to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk through DNA methylation patterns, with specific CpG sites near the gene showing significant differential methylation between cancer cases and controls (Fridley2014Methylation).
