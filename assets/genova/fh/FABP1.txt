# FABP1

## Overview
FABP1, or fatty acid binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes the liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the transport and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic molecules within cells. L-FABP is predominantly expressed in the liver, but it is also present in other tissues such as the intestines, kidneys, and lungs, where it plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Structurally, L-FABP is characterized by a beta-barrel motif that allows it to bind multiple ligands, including fatty acids and xenobiotics, facilitating their transport to various cellular compartments. The protein's interactions with nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), underscore its importance in regulating lipid-mediated transcriptional programs and cellular processes like inflammation and metabolism (Hughes2015Fatty; Amiri2018Diverse; Smathers2011The).

## Structure
The human gene FABP1 encodes the liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), which is part of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. The primary structure of FABP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a compact protein with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa (Smathers2011The). The secondary structure is characterized by ten antiparallel beta strands that form a beta-barrel, a common motif among fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) (Zimmerman2002New). This beta-barrel structure creates a central cavity that is water-filled and allows for the binding of fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands (Smathers2011The).

The tertiary structure of L-FABP includes a helix-turn-helix motif that acts as a portal for fatty acid access and egress, contributing to its unique ability to bind two fatty acids simultaneously, unlike other FABPs (Storch2009Structural). This structure also facilitates the binding of various endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, indicating its role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Smathers2011The). L-FABP does not typically form quaternary structures, and there is no specific mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The human gene FABP1 encodes the liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), which plays a crucial role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic molecules. L-FABP is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, where it constitutes 2-5% of the cytosolic protein and is also found in enterocytes, renal tubular cells, and the alveolar epithelium of the lung (Kim2016Cytokinelike; Amiri2018Diverse). This protein facilitates the uptake, transport, mitochondrial oxidation, and esterification of fatty acids, contributing significantly to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (McKillop2019Role; Kim2016Cytokinelike).

L-FABP has a large hydrophobic binding pocket that allows it to bind multiple ligands simultaneously, including long-chain fatty acids, acyl-coenzyme A, and various xenobiotics (McKillop2019Role). It plays a key role in mediating the transport of these ligands to different cellular destinations, such as lipid droplets, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the nucleus, where it influences lipid-mediated transcriptional programs (McKillop2019Role; Amiri2018Diverse). L-FABP is also involved in regulating cellular processes such as inflammation, immunity, metabolism, and energy homeostasis (Smathers2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FABP1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In colorectal carcinomas, particularly those with microsatellite instability (MSI), there is a significant loss of FABP1 expression. This loss is associated with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and an inflammatory response mediated by the interferon gamma (IFNγ) pathway. The study suggests that the high immune response in MSI colorectal carcinomas may disrupt the balance of FABP1 and PPARγ, leading to decreased FABP1 expression (Wood2017Fatty).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FABP1 expression varies, with both decreased and increased levels reported. Down-regulation of FABP1 is noted in about 10% of HCC cases and correlates with poor differentiation and high expression of β-catenin and glutamine synthetase. Conversely, high FABP1 expression is associated with VEGF-A, suggesting a role in tumorigenicity through VEGFR2-mediated pathways (McKillop2019Role; Amiri2018Diverse).

Polymorphisms in the FABP1 gene, such as the rs2919872 G>A variant, are associated with altered serum triglyceride levels. This polymorphism affects FABP1 promoter activity, potentially linking FABP1 gene variation to lipid metabolism disorders (Peng2015Association).

## Interactions
FABP1, or fatty acid binding protein 1, is known to interact with various proteins, particularly nuclear receptors. It plays a significant role in modulating the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in a ligand-selective manner. FABP1 enhances the transcriptional activity of PPARα in the presence of specific ligands such as oleic acid, fenofibric acid, and GW7647, but not fenofibrate, indicating a selective interaction based on the ligand involved (Hughes2015Fatty). 

The interaction between FABP1 and PPARα is facilitated by the transport of lipophilic ligands to the nucleus, where FABP1 and PPARα are in close proximity, suggesting a direct interaction. This interaction is ligand-dependent, with FABP1 promoting PPARα activation by GW7647 (Hughes2015Fatty). 

FABP1 also interacts with other nuclear receptors such as PPARγ, and its role extends to the transport and metabolism of various ligands, including drugs and endogenous compounds like ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC). The binding of ∆9-THC to FABP1 induces conformational changes that may affect its ability to activate PPARα (Huang2018Structural). These interactions highlight FABP1's role in cellular signaling and lipid metabolism.
