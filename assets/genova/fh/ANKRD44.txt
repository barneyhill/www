# ANKRD44

## Overview
ANKRD44 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 44 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The ANKRD44 protein is a component of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex, a member of the PPP family of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, where it functions as part of a regulatory subunit involved in substrate recognition for dephosphorylation by the catalytic subunit PPP6C (La2019ANKRD44; Stefansson2008Protein). The protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, suggesting its involvement in cytoplasmic signaling pathways (Stefansson2008Protein). ANKRD44 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including potential roles in cancer drug resistance and bone mineral density regulation, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated (La2019ANKRD44; Tan2021Identification).

## Structure
ANKRD44 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat domains, which are common structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically consist of 30-34 amino acid residues and adopt a helix-turn-helix conformation with short loops at the N and C termini (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The ankyrin repeat domains in ANKRD44 contribute to its structural stability and folding, with conserved residues such as Glycine, Alanine, and Leucine playing crucial roles (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The TPLH motif initiates the first α-helix and forms a turn stabilized by hydrogen bonds, while the hydrophobic core is formed by conserved hydrophobic residues in the anti-parallel helices (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

The ANKRD44 protein is involved in forming the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex, which includes other ankyrin repeat proteins like ANKRD28 and ANKRD52 (Stefansson2008Protein). This complex is implicated in the recognition of phosphoprotein substrates for dephosphorylation by the catalytic subunit PPP6C (La2019ANKRD44). ANKRD44 lacks a unique C-terminal tail present in related proteins ANKRD28 and ANKRD52, suggesting distinct functional roles (Stefansson2008Protein). Specific post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although detailed structural information on tertiary or quaternary structures is not provided in the available sources.

## Function
ANKRD44 encodes a protein that is part of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex, which is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. The protein contains ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular signaling or structural organization (Stefansson2008Protein). ANKRD44, along with other ankyrin repeat proteins such as ANKRD28 and ANKRD52, forms a regulatory subunit of the PP6 complex, which is a member of the PPP family of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases (La2019ANKRD44). This complex is involved in recognizing phosphoprotein substrates that are dephosphorylated by the catalytic subunit PPP6C, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways (Stefansson2008Protein).

The PP6 complex, including ANKRD44, is predominantly cytoplasmic, indicating its potential function in the cytoplasm (Stefansson2008Protein). The ankyrin repeat proteins, including ANKRD44, are suggested to have distinct biological functions, contributing to the regulation of PP6 activity and specificity (Stefansson2008Protein). Although the specific function of ANKRD44 in healthy human cells is not explicitly detailed, its involvement in the PP6 complex suggests a role in maintaining normal cellular function and stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKRD44 gene have been implicated in trastuzumab resistance in HER2-like breast cancer. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ANKRD44, predicted to be deleterious, was found in 50% of patients with a partial response to trastuzumab treatment. This SNP results in the loss of a repeat domain in the ANKRD44 protein, affecting its structure and stability, and is associated with increased activation of the NF-κβ pathway through the TAK1/Akt pathway, contributing to drug resistance and a more aggressive cancer phenotype (La2019ANKRD44).

Silencing ANKRD44 in HER2-like breast cancer cell lines has been shown to lead to partial resistance to trastuzumab, increased cell proliferation, and altered cell metabolism, including increased glycolysis. This suggests that ANKRD44 mutations may impair the function of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex, of which ANKRD44 is a part, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes associated with cancer progression (La2019ANKRD44).

Additionally, ANKRD44 has been associated with bone mineral density regulation, although its specific role in bone and muscle metabolism remains unclear (Tan2021Identification).

## Interactions
ANKRD44 is a component of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex, which is part of the PPP family of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases. It forms a putative regulatory ARS subunit along with ANKRD28 and ANKRD52. This ARS subunit is involved in recognizing phosphoprotein substrates that are dephosphorylated by the catalytic subunit PPP6C (La2019ANKRD44). ANKRD44, also known as ARS-B, is one of the ankyrin repeat proteins identified in association with PP6, suggesting it plays a role in the specificity of substrate recognition within the PP6 complex (Stefansson2008Protein).

The interaction of ANKRD44 with the PP6 complex is inferred from its structural similarity to other ankyrin repeat proteins like ANKRD28, which has been shown to associate with PP6 catalytic and regulatory subunits. This suggests that ANKRD44 may have similar interactions, although specific physical interactions of ANKRD44 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed (Stefansson2008Protein). The ankyrin repeat domains in ANKRD44 are likely involved in protein-protein interactions, serving as a scaffold or adaptor within the PP6 complex (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).
