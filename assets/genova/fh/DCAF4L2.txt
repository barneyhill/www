# DCAF4L2

## Overview
DCAF4L2 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 4 like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and cellular regulation. The DCAF4L2 protein functions as an adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a significant role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular processes by modulating the stability of specific proteins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the cell cycle (Zhang2020LncRNA). DCAF4L2 has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes (Zhang2020LncRNA; Cheng2019The).

## Function
DCAF4L2 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 4 like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular regulation. The DCAF4L2 protein functions as an adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating cell cycle progression, and responding to DNA damage. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes by modulating the stability of specific proteins (Zhang2020LncRNA).

In healthy human cells, DCAF4L2 plays a role in cellular processes such as protein ubiquitination, which is crucial for the regulation of protein turnover and function. The ubiquitin-proteasome system, in which DCAF4L2 is involved, is vital for controlling the levels of proteins that regulate the cell cycle, signal transduction, and other critical cellular functions. By participating in these processes, DCAF4L2 helps ensure proper cellular function and organismal development, although specific organismal outcomes in healthy cells are not detailed in the available context (Zhang2020LncRNA).

## Clinical Significance
DCAF4L2 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The long non-coding RNA ST8SIA6-AS1, which is upregulated in HCC tissues, promotes the expression of DCAF4L2, contributing to tumor progression. This upregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes, such as shorter overall survival and more advanced pathological grades in patients with HCC (Zhang2020LncRNA). ST8SIA6-AS1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-129e5p, which normally targets the 3ʹ-UTR of DCAF4L2, thereby facilitating DCAF4L2 expression. This mechanism suggests that DCAF4L2 plays a significant role in HCC progression by promoting cell migration and invasion (Zhang2020LncRNA).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), DCAF4L2 is overexpressed and is involved in cell migration and invasion, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Zhang2020LncRNA; Cheng2019The). The overexpression of DCAF4L2 in HCC cells can reverse the inhibitory effects of ST8SIA6-AS1 knockdown on cell migration and invasion, further highlighting its role in cancer progression (Zhang2020LncRNA). These findings suggest that DCAF4L2 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers where it is dysregulated.
