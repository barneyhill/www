# PACSIN3

## Overview
PACSIN3 is a gene that encodes the protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 3, which is a member of the PACSIN family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of an F-BAR domain, which is involved in membrane binding and tubulation, and a C-terminal SH3 domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. PACSIN3 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as membrane remodeling, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle trafficking. It is particularly significant in glucose transport in adipocytes, where it influences the trafficking and plasma membrane localization of glucose transporters like GLUT1. The protein's interactions, notably with the TRPV4 cation channel, underscore its role in regulating membrane association and cellular homeostasis. Alterations in PACSIN3 expression or function can have clinical implications, potentially contributing to neurological disorders and other diseases (Sumoy2001PACSIN; Roach2007PACSIN3; Cuajungco2006PACSINs).

## Structure
PACSIN3 is a protein characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in membrane remodeling and protein interactions. The protein contains an F-BAR domain, which is crucial for membrane binding and tubulation. This domain forms a dimer with a crescent shape, consisting of six α-helices per monomer, with the main dimerization interface formed by two neighboring helices α1 (Bai2012Rigidity). A unique feature of the PACSIN3 F-BAR domain is the wedge loop between helices α2 and α3, which is more rigid compared to PACSIN1 and PACSIN2. This rigidity influences the formation of low curvature tubules with a diameter of approximately 100 nm (Bai2012Rigidity).

PACSIN3 also contains a C-terminal SH3 domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions. This domain interacts with the proline-rich region (PRR) of other proteins, such as TRPV4, in a class I orientation. The SH3 domain includes a five-stranded beta-sheet core and a long loop that acts as a 'lid' for recognition and binding (Goretzki2018Structural).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could affect its function and interactions (Sumoy2001PACSIN). PACSIN3 is expressed as a 424 amino acid protein with a calculated mass of 48.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.7 (Sumoy2001PACSIN).

## Function
PACSIN3 is a protein involved in cellular membrane remodeling, particularly in processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle trafficking. It is a member of the PACSIN family, which includes PACSIN 1, 2, and 3, and is characterized by the presence of an F-BAR domain crucial for membrane deformation. Unlike PACSIN 1 and 2, which can induce both high and low curvature tubules, PACSIN3 is limited to generating low curvature tubules due to the rigidity of its wedge loop. This rigidity affects the lateral interactions between dimers, influencing the diameter of the tubules formed (Bai2012Rigidity).

PACSIN3 also plays a significant role in glucose transport in adipocytes. During the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes, PACSIN3 expression increases, suggesting its involvement in the trafficking of glucose transporters such as GLUT1. Overexpression of PACSIN3 enhances glucose uptake by increasing GLUT1 plasma membrane localization, indicating its specific role in GLUT1 trafficking (Roach2007PACSIN3). PACSIN3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in vesicle formation and transport.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PACSIN3 gene can have significant clinical implications. Changes in PACSIN3 expression or mutations may disrupt cellular processes, potentially contributing to the development of neurological disorders. The gene's involvement in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization suggests that its dysregulation could affect neuronal function and structure, leading to various neurological conditions. Additionally, PACSIN3's role in endocytosis and its interactions with other proteins are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in these interactions may influence disease mechanisms, potentially playing a role in cancer progression. The precise mechanisms by which PACSIN3 alterations contribute to these diseases are still under investigation, but its impact on cellular processes highlights its potential significance in disease pathology. Understanding the clinical significance of PACSIN3 mutations and expression changes is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies for related conditions.

## Interactions
PACSIN3 interacts with the TRPV4 cation channel, specifically binding to its amino terminus. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domain of PACSIN3, which binds to a proline-rich domain (PRD) in TRPV4. The binding is crucial for regulating TRPV4's plasma membrane association, as PACSIN3 increases the ratio of TRPV4 associated with the plasma membrane compared to its intracellular presence. This suggests that PACSIN3 blocks the endocytosis of TRPV4, leading to its accumulation at the plasma membrane (Cuajungco2006PACSINs).

The interaction between PACSIN3 and TRPV4 is specific, with a triple-proline motif within the PRD of TRPV4 identified as the binding site for PACSIN3. Mutations in this motif or in the SH3 domain of PACSIN3 can significantly reduce or abolish the interaction. This specificity is highlighted by the fact that PACSIN3, but not PACSIN1 or PACSIN2, affects TRPV4's subcellular distribution (Cuajungco2006PACSINs).

PACSIN3 also interacts with the F-BAR domain, which is conserved between PACSIN1 and PACSIN3. This interaction suggests a structural model for intermolecular rearrangements upon binding to target proteins, potentially enabling the PACSIN F-BAR domain to attach to the plasma membrane (Goretzki2018Structural).
