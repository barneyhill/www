# ARHGAP23

## Overview
ARHGAP23 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 23, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which plays a critical role in the regulation of signal transduction pathways by inactivating Rho GTPases. These pathways are essential for various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal recombination, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression. Rho GTPase activating protein 23 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in modulating cellular architecture and dynamics by influencing cell shape and motility. The protein's expression in diverse tissues such as the placenta, prostate, hippocampus, and brain medulla underscores its involvement in a wide range of physiological processes. Furthermore, ARHGAP23 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in several cancer types (Xu2013RhoGAPs; Liu2023Pan‑cancer).

## Function
ARHGAP23 encodes a protein that is part of the Rho family of small GTPases, which are crucial for regulating various signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. These proteins function as molecular switches, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. In healthy human cells, ARHGAP23 plays a significant role in the negative regulation of the Rho/Rac/cell division cycle, impacting processes such as cytoskeletal recombination, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression (Liu2023Pan‑cancer).

ARHGAP23 is involved in the regulation of cell migration, survival, adhesion, and proliferation by interacting with transmembrane receptors to transmit extracellular signals, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, prostate, hippocampus, and brain medulla, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Liu2023Pan‑cancer).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates signaling pathways that affect cellular architecture and function. By inactivating Rho GTPases, ARHGAP23 influences cell shape and motility, contributing to the regulation of cellular dynamics and structural integrity (Liu2023Pan‑cancer).

## Clinical Significance
ARHGAP23 has been identified as a potential biomarker in various cancers due to its differential expression and prognostic significance. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high expression of ARHGAP23 correlates with poor prognosis, with patients exhibiting lower expression levels showing better outcomes. This suggests that ARHGAP23 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in this cancer type (Liu2023Pan‑cancer). In contrast, low expression of ARHGAP23 is associated with improved overall survival in cancers such as colon adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, while high expression correlates with better survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and thymoma (Liu2023Pan‑cancer).

ARHGAP23 is also involved in the regulation of immune cell infiltration in tumors, which may influence cancer progression and patient outcomes (Liu2023Pan‑cancer). The gene's expression is linked to DNA methylation changes in various cancers, which could affect its role in tumor biology (Liu2023Pan‑cancer). Additionally, ARHGAP23 interacts with the p53 protein, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which is crucial for tumor suppression. Alterations in ARHGAP23 expression or function could impact p53-mediated processes, potentially affecting cancer development and progression (Xu2013RhoGAPs).
