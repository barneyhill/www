# MORN5

## Overview
MORN5, or MORN repeat containing 5, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of multiple MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the MORN5 protein may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. The MORN5 gene is particularly significant in the context of craniofacial development, where it is implicated in the fusion of facial prominences. Disruptions in MORN5 expression have been associated with craniofacial developmental disorders, such as cleft lip and/or palate, highlighting its importance in normal facial morphogenesis (Cela2016MORN5). The gene's expression is modulated by the BMP signaling pathway, and it is known to interact with other regulatory molecules, such as Noggin and retinoic acid, which further influence craniofacial development (Cela2016MORN5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the MORN5 gene have been implicated in craniofacial developmental disorders, particularly in the formation of cleft lip and/or palate. MORN5 is crucial for the fusion of facial prominences during craniofacial development, and disruptions in its expression can lead to these common birth defects (Cela2016MORN5). The gene's expression is regulated by BMP signaling pathways and is downregulated by Noggin and retinoic acid (RA) treatment, which are known to influence craniofacial morphology (Cela2016MORN5). 

Research in chicken embryos has shown that downregulation of MORN5, either through treatment with Noggin and RA or via siRNA targeting, results in significant changes in the expression of genes within the BMP pathway. This includes increased expression of genes such as GDF2, ENG, and TGFβR2, while BMP5 is downregulated, suggesting that MORN5 normally represses certain genes involved in BMP signaling (Cela2016MORN5). These findings indicate that MORN5 plays a regulatory role in craniofacial development, and its altered expression may contribute to the development of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in humans (Cela2016MORN5).
