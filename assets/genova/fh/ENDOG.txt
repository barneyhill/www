# ENDOG

## Overview
Endonuclease G (ENDOG) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme known as endonuclease G, which is categorized as a DNA/RNA non-specific nuclease. This enzyme is primarily involved in the degradation of nucleic acids and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial DNA replication and apoptosis. The protein is synthesized as a precursor with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved upon import into the mitochondria to form the active enzyme (Kalinowska2005Regulation). In healthy cells, endonuclease G is sequestered within the mitochondria, preventing it from interacting with nuclear DNA and thus averting unintended genomic degradation (Kalinowska2005Regulation). During apoptosis, however, it translocates to the nucleus, where it contributes to chromatin degradation by interacting with various nuclear components (Vařecha2011Endonuclease). The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in several diseases, including mitochondrial myopathy and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, highlighting their importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Wang2023Cytoplasmic; Nasca2022Biallelic).

## Structure
Endonuclease G (ENDOG) is a mitochondrial protein characterized by its involvement in DNA degradation. The primary structure of ENDOG consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes critical residues such as His-141, Asn-163, and Asn-172, essential for its catalytic activity and magnesium coordination (Wu2009Mutagenesis). The secondary structure of ENDOG features a ββα-Me-finger fold, a common motif among sugar-nonspecific nucleases, which includes a histidine residue acting as a general base for catalysis (Wu2009Mutagenesis).

The tertiary structure of ENDOG is defined by a ββα-metal finger topology, crucial for its nuclease activity, and involves a magnesium ion coordinated by specific residues (Loll2009Crystal). The quaternary structure of ENDOG involves its assembly into a homodimer, which is essential for its DNA-binding and endonuclease activity (Lin2016Crystal). This dimeric conformation is critical for optimal function, as mutations that disrupt dimerization result in reduced activity (Lin2016Crystal).

ENDOG may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and function. The presence of splice variant isoforms can lead to structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
Endonuclease G (ENDOG) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in both mitochondrial DNA replication and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, ENDOG is primarily localized within the mitochondria, where it is involved in maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and function. It is synthesized as a zymogen with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved upon translocation into the mitochondria to form the mature nuclease (Kalinowska2005Regulation). Although initially thought to be crucial for mitochondrial replication, studies suggest that its primary role in healthy cells is not directly related to mitochondrial DNA metabolism, as indicated by the similar mitochondrial DNA copy number in oocytes from EndoG heterozygous mutants and wild-type animals (Kalinowska2005Regulation).

ENDOG is a DNA/RNA non-specific nuclease that prefers single-stranded DNA and RNA over duplex DNA, and it is highly specific for (dG)n.(dC)n tracts in DNA (Diener2010Role). In healthy cells, ENDOG is compartmentalized within the mitochondria, preventing it from degrading genomic DNA (Kalinowska2005Regulation). The regulation of ENDOG involves interactions with proteins such as Hsp70, which helps maintain its levels through proteasomal degradation, ensuring that ENDOG does not induce unwanted cell death under normal conditions (Lee2013CHIP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ENDOG gene have been linked to several diseases. ENDOG is implicated in mitochondrial myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness and multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. Biallelic variants in ENDOG have been associated with symptoms such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, myalgia, and exercise intolerance. These variants can lead to a reduction in ENDOG protein levels, affecting mtDNA maintenance and contributing to the disease phenotype (Nasca2022Biallelic).

ENDOG also plays a role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It promotes lipid accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through the mTORC2-AKT-ACLY pathway. Overexpression of ENDOG increases lipid synthesis, while its knockout reduces lipid accumulation and ER stress, alleviating NAFLD symptoms. This effect is particularly pronounced in female mice, suggesting a sex-specific influence (Wang2023Cytoplasmic).

In Parkinson's disease, ENDOG acts as a downstream executor of α-synuclein cytotoxicity, contributing to neuronal damage. It is also involved in genome instability in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting cancer development. These findings highlight ENDOG's significant role in various pathological conditions through its impact on mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and cellular stress responses (Wang2023Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
Endonuclease G (ENDOG) is known to participate in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly during apoptosis. It translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin components to facilitate DNA degradation. ENDOG has been shown to interact with histone H2B and DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOPO2a) in apoptotic cells. These interactions were confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis in HeLa and SK-N-SH cell lines, indicating that these interactions are not cell line-specific (Vařecha2011Endonuclease).

The interaction between ENDOG and histone H2B is characterized by a stability value of 215 kcal/mol and an interaction energy of -20 kcal/mol. For TOPO2a, the interaction is more complex, with stability values of 372 kcal/mol and 636 kcal/mol for different parts of the protein, and interaction energies of -9 kcal/mol and -14 kcal/mol, respectively (Vařecha2011Endonuclease).

ENDOG also forms a complex with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which aids in its translocation to the nucleus during apoptosis, enhancing its activity in DNA fragmentation (Lin2016Crystal). These interactions suggest that ENDOG plays a crucial role in the apoptotic degradation of nuclear DNA.
