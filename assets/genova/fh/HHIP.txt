# HHIP

## Overview
The HHIP gene encodes the Hedgehog-interacting protein, a critical component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is involved in various developmental processes and cellular functions. The protein acts as an antagonist within this pathway by binding to Hedgehog ligands, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh), thereby inhibiting their interaction with the primary receptor, Patched (Ptc) (Beachy2010Interactions). Structurally, HHIP is characterized by a 6-bladed β-propeller domain, which is essential for its interaction with Hh ligands, and additional domains that facilitate its regulatory functions (Bishop2009Structural). The protein's ability to modulate Hh signaling is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Li2020Downregulation).

## Structure
The human hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP) is a crucial component of the hedgehog signaling pathway, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is involved in directing the protein to its proper cellular location (Huo2000Determination). The ectodomain of HHIP features a 6-bladed β-propeller domain, which is linked to two epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat domains. This β-propeller domain has a large protrusion forming a negatively charged patch, which is significant for its interaction with hedgehog ligands (Bishop2009Structural). The EGF repeats exhibit a linear conformation, and there is suggested flexibility between these domains, potentially important for the protein's function (Bishop2009Structural).

The HHIP protein also contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions (Bürglin2008The). Post-translational modifications of HHIP may include glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Huo2000Determination). The protein's quaternary structure includes a dimeric form for the full-length ectodomain, while a truncated version lacking the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain is monomeric, suggesting a role for this domain in dimerization (Bishop2009Structural).

## Function
The HHIP gene encodes the Hedgehog-interacting protein, which functions as a crucial regulator of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in healthy human cells. HHIP acts as an antagonist by binding to Hedgehog ligands, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), and sequestering them, thereby inhibiting the pathway's activity. This regulation is essential for processes like cartilage development, nerve development, and axon guidance (Bishop2009Structural; Kwong2014Shhmediated).

HHIP can function both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously, meaning it can inhibit Shh signaling within the cell that expresses it and in neighboring cells. This is achieved by binding and sequestering Shh, preventing it from activating the pathway in adjacent cells (Kwong2014Shhmediated). HHIP is also involved in maintaining normal airway structure and function by attenuating aerobic glycolysis and cell hyperproliferation, particularly in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Li2021Hedgehog).

In the bone marrow, HHIP expressed by stromal cells inhibits Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signaling, which is important for regulating the proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and preventing excessive cell proliferation (Kobune2012Stromal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HHIP gene have been implicated in various cancers. In papillary thyroid cancer, a novel G516R mutation in the HHIP gene was identified, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a role in tumor progression. This mutation was found in metastatic lymph nodes but not in primary tumors, indicating intra-tumor heterogeneity and its potential involvement in cancer metastasis (Lee2018Whole).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the HHIP gene is often down-regulated due to genetic and epigenetic alterations, such as DNA hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity. This down-regulation is linked to increased Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activity, which is associated with cancer cell growth. Restoring HHIP expression has been shown to reduce Hh pathway activity and inhibit cancer cell growth, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Tada2008DownRegulation).

The HHIP gene's expression is also decreased in other cancers, including lung, stomach, and colorectal cancers, compared to normal tissues. This suggests that HHIP may serve as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Tada2008DownRegulation).

## Interactions
The human gene HHIP encodes the Hedgehog-interacting protein, which plays a crucial role in modulating the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway by binding to Hh ligands such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh). HHIP functions as an inhibitor of Hh signaling by sequestering these ligands, thereby preventing them from interacting with their primary receptor, Patched (Ptc) (Beachy2010Interactions; Li2020Downregulation). 

The interaction between HHIP and Hh ligands involves a β-propeller domain in HHIP, which adopts a lollipop-like structure. This domain contains loops that extend from different blades, with the loop from blade 3 being particularly important for binding. The side chain of Asp 383 from HHIP coordinates the Hh-bound zinc ion, displacing a water molecule, which is crucial for the interaction (Beachy2010Interactions). Zinc and calcium ions play significant roles in the Hh-HHIP interface, with zinc contributing to the binding interface and calcium preventing electrostatic repulsion (Bishop2009Structural). 

HHIP competes with other proteins such as Ptc, Cdo, and Boc for binding to Hh ligands, as their binding sites on the Hh proteins overlap (Beachy2010Interactions). This competitive binding highlights the complex regulatory role of HHIP in the Hh signaling pathway.
