# ACOT13

## Overview
ACOT13 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 13, which is a member of the type II acyl-CoA thioesterase family. This enzyme is characterized by its 'hot dog' domain structure, a common motif among thioesterases, and is involved in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoA) (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Swarbrick2020Structure). The protein is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids, thereby influencing energy production and lipid signaling pathways (Brocker2010Evolutionary). ACOT13 is expressed in oxidative tissues and is associated with mitochondrial function, contributing to processes such as hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and energy homeostasis (Swarbrick2020Structure). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical outcomes, including its potential role as a biomarker in ovarian cancer and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (Lv2023Low; Du2021Identification).

## Structure
The ACOT13 protein, also known as thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2), is part of the TE8 thioesterase family and is characterized by a single hotdog fold domain, a common structural motif in thioesterases (Swarbrick2020Structure). The secondary structure of ACOT13 is arranged as α1-β1-β2-α2-β3-β4-β5-β6, with the catalytic active site located at the interface of a hotdog dimer. This active site involves an Asp residue in the middle of the central α2 helix, a Ser residue on the β3-strand of one hotdog chain, and an Asn residue on a loop connecting β2-α2 of the other chain (Swarbrick2020Structure). The quaternary structure of ACOT13 is a tetramer of hotdog domains arranged in a back-to-back configuration of double hotdog dimers, observed in both the apo and substrate-bound forms (Swarbrick2020Structure). ACOT13 is associated with mitochondria and is expressed in oxidative tissues, playing roles in regulating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. It is also involved in heat production and thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue, and is regulated by PPARα (Swarbrick2020Structure).

## Function
ACOT13, or acyl-CoA thioesterase 13, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoA) (Brocker2010Evolutionary). This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids, which are important for energy production and lipid signaling pathways. ACOT13 is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it influences various metabolic pathways and contributes to cellular energy homeostasis (Brocker2010Evolutionary).

The enzyme is part of the type II acyl-CoA thioesterase family, which is characterized by structural motifs such as the 'hot dog' domain, a conserved feature despite sequence divergence among family members (Brocker2010Evolutionary). Although ACOT13 shares limited sequence similarity with other type II proteins, it is involved in maintaining the balance of free and activated fatty acids within cells, impacting processes such as β-oxidation, energy production, and ketone body formation (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The specific function of ACOT13 in healthy human cells remains under investigation, but its role in lipid metabolism suggests it is integral to maintaining cellular and organismal energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACOT13 gene have been linked to various clinical outcomes, particularly in ovarian cancer. In ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC), low ACOT13 expression is associated with poorer overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-free survival. It is also linked to increased resistance to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug, and a lower tumor mutation burden (TMB), which may affect treatment response (Lv2023Low). In ovarian cancer (OC) more broadly, high ACOT13 expression correlates with better prognosis and improved responses to immunotherapy, particularly anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapies. This suggests that ACOT13 could serve as a predictive marker for immunotherapy outcomes (Xie2024Low).

ACOT13 has also been implicated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Mutations in ACOT13 were identified in patients with ADPKD, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis, although the exact clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated (Du2021Identification). These findings highlight the potential of ACOT13 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
ACOT13, or acyl-CoA thioesterase 13, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that may influence its role in cellular processes. Studies using the GeneMANIA and STRING databases have identified several proteins that interact with ACOT13. According to GeneMANIA, these include THEM5, THEM7, THEM4, PCTP, ACOT7, ACOT12, and ACOT11. STRING database analysis also identifies interactions with MCAT, ACOT9, ACOT1, ACOT12, PCTP, TDP2, ACOT11, and ACOT7 (Xie2024Low). These interactions suggest that ACOT13 may participate in multiprotein complexes or engage in transient interactions, potentially affecting mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.

The functional implications of these interactions have been explored through Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, indicating that ACOT13 is associated with mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly (Xie2024Low). However, specific details on the physical nature of these interactions, such as whether they are activating or inhibitory, are not provided in the available data. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and effects of ACOT13's interactions with these proteins.
