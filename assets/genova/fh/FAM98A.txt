# FAM98A

## Overview
FAM98A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the protein family with sequence similarity 98 member A, which is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and cancer progression. The FAM98A protein is characterized by a divergent N-terminal calponin homology (CH)-like domain and C-terminal heptad repeats that form a coiled-coil structure, facilitating its localization to stress granules and interaction with other proteins (Li2019FAM98A; Zheng2018FAM98A). As a component of stress granules, FAM98A plays a crucial role in cellular stress responses, protecting mRNAs and promoting recovery under adverse conditions (Ozeki2018FAM98A). Additionally, FAM98A is implicated in cancer biology, where it forms complexes with proteins such as DDX1 and PRMT1, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and survival (Akter2017FAM98A). Its involvement in various signaling pathways and interactions with other proteins underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Zheng2018FAM98A).

## Structure
FAM98A is a protein characterized by a divergent N-terminal calponin homology (CH)-like domain and C-terminal heptad repeats that form a coiled-coil structure (Li2019FAM98A; Zheng2018FAM98A). The N-terminus of FAM98A, comprising approximately 80 amino acids, is predicted to form two helices, while the remaining residues are rich in poly-G and poly-Q sequences, which may hinder the formation of a stable tertiary structure (Akter2017FAM98A). The C-terminal region is glycine-rich and is critical for the protein's localization to stress granules (Ozeki2018FAM98A).

FAM98A is part of the NN-CH family, which includes proteins with a similar CH domain and is involved in cell cycle regulation and kinetochore function (Zheng2018FAM98A). The protein is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as arginine methylation by PRMT1, which is significant in its role in cancer progression (Li2019FAM98A; Zheng2018FAM98A). FAM98A forms molecular complexes with proteins like DDX1, C14orf166, and FAM98B, which are implicated in cancer progression (Akter2017FAM98A).

## Function
FAM98A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in response to stress conditions. The FAM98A protein is a component of stress granules, which are cytoplasmic aggregates of proteins and RNAs that form in response to cellular stress, such as heat, osmotic shock, or oxidative stress. These structures are crucial for cell survival as they protect mRNAs and promote cellular recovery under stress conditions (Ozeki2018FAM98A).

FAM98A localizes to stress granules in HeLa cells when exposed to stressors like arsenite, sorbitol, heat, and hydrogen peroxide. Its localization is confirmed by co-localization with G3BP1, a known stress granule marker. The C-terminal region of FAM98A, rich in glycine and containing low-complexity regions, is essential for its accumulation in stress granules. This region facilitates the protein's association with other stress granule-localized proteins, such as DDX1, ATXN2, ATXN2L, and NUFIP2 (Ozeki2018FAM98A).

While the study does not directly address FAM98A's function in healthy human cells outside of stress conditions, its role in stress granules suggests it may be involved in broader cellular stress responses, contributing to cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation (Ozeki2018FAM98A).

## Clinical Significance
FAM98A is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In breast cancer, FAM98A acts as a tumor promoter, and its expression is directly targeted and suppressed by microRNA-26a (miR-26a), which functions as a tumor suppressor. The downregulation of FAM98A by miR-26a leads to reduced cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment (Liu2021MicroRNA‑26a).

In endometrial carcinoma, FAM98A is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its deficiency inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, potentially through the regulation of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes like BAX and BCL2. FAM98A expression is inversely correlated with miR-142-3p levels, indicating a regulatory pathway that could be targeted for therapy (Li2019FAM98A).

FAM98A is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it is necessary for the expression of PRMT1, a protein involved in cancer progression. Knockdown of FAM98A reduces cell proliferation and colony formation, highlighting its role in colorectal cancer malignancy (Akter2017FAM98A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FAM98A promotes cell proliferation through the p38-ATF2 signaling pathway. Its overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, making it a potential target for NSCLC treatment (Zheng2018FAM98A).

## Interactions
FAM98A is known to participate in several protein interactions that are significant in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with FAM98B, PRMT1, DDX1, and C14orf166, which is implicated in colorectal cancer progression. This complex is crucial for the expression of PRMT1, a protein overexpressed in several cancers, including colorectal cancer (Akter2017FAM98A). FAM98A and FAM98B are structurally similar and can bind to each other, with FAM98B forming homodimers (Akter2017FAM98A).

FAM98A also interacts with stress granule-localized proteins such as DDX1, ATXN2, ATXN2L, and NUFIP2, playing a role in stress granule organization. The C-terminal region of FAM98A, containing a low complexity (LC) region, is essential for its accumulation in stress granules (Ozeki2018FAM98A).

In the context of lysosome positioning, FAM98A interacts with PLEKHM1 and NDEL1. These interactions are important for lysosome positioning and secretion, particularly in osteoclasts, where they help in coupling lysosomes to microtubules (Fujiwara2016PLEKHM1DEF8RAB7). These interactions highlight FAM98A's involvement in diverse cellular functions and its potential role in disease progression.
