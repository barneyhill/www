# NALCN

## Overview
The NALCN gene encodes the sodium leak channel, non-selective, a unique transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining neuronal excitability and the resting membrane potential. Unlike traditional voltage-gated ion channels, the NALCN protein is a nonselective, noninactivating, and voltage-independent channel that allows a continuous influx of sodium ions, contributing to the depolarization of neurons. This channel forms a complex with auxiliary proteins, including UNC79, UNC80, and FAM155A, which are essential for its proper function and localization within the cell membrane (Lu2010Extracellular; Xie2020Structure). NALCN is widely expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in various physiological processes, such as respiratory and circadian rhythms, as well as synaptic function (Lu2010Extracellular; CochetBissuel2014The). Mutations in the NALCN gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Bouasse2019Functional; He2023NALCN).

## Structure
The NALCN protein is a voltage-modulated sodium-selective channel complex with a unique structure compared to canonical voltage-gated ion channels. It consists of four homologous repeats, each containing six transmembrane helices, forming a 4 × 6 transmembrane helix structure typical of voltage-gated ion channels (Zhou2022Architecture; Kang2020Structure). The channel's selectivity filter is characterized by an 'EEKE' sequence, which is distinct from other ion channels (Xie2020Structure).

The NALCN protein forms a quaternary complex with auxiliary subunits FAM155A, UNC79, and UNC80, which are crucial for its function and localization. The FAM155A subunit interacts with the extracellular loops of NALCN, stabilizing the channel within the membrane (Xie2020Structure). The UNC79 and UNC80 subunits form a super-coiled heterodimeric assembly on the cytoplasmic side, interacting with the NALCN-FAM155A subcomplex and playing a role in channel regulation (Zhou2022Architecture).

The NALCN protein lacks the IFM motif found in other sodium channels, which is associated with fast inactivation, consistent with its lack of fast inactivation (Kang2020Structure). The C-terminal domain forms a calmodulin-like helical domain, interacting with the III-IV linker, which is involved in sodium exit and channel function (Kang2020Structure).

## Function
The NALCN gene encodes a sodium leak channel that plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability and the resting membrane potential in human cells. This channel is part of a complex with auxiliary proteins such as UNC79, UNC80, and FAM155A, which are essential for its function and stability (Lu2010Extracellular; Xie2020Structure). NALCN is a nonselective, noninactivating, voltage-independent channel that allows a constant influx of sodium ions, contributing to the depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which is crucial for neuronal signal transduction (Lu2010Extracellular; Xie2020Structure).

NALCN is widely expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in various physiological processes, including respiratory rhythm, circadian rhythms, and synaptic function (Lu2010Extracellular; CochetBissuel2014The). The channel's activity is modulated by extracellular calcium levels and is activated by a reduction in calcium concentration, which increases the sodium leak current and enhances neuronal excitability (Lu2010Extracellular; Impheng2021The). This calcium-dependent modulation involves a signaling cascade with a G protein-coupled receptor and the UNC79/UNC80 complex (Lu2010Extracellular). NALCN's function is also influenced by neuropeptides and hormones, indicating its role in broader physiological contexts (CochetBissuel2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NALCN gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Two primary conditions linked to NALCN mutations are congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD) syndrome, and infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF). CLIFAHDD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is characterized by gain-of-function mutations, leading to higher current densities and slower inactivation of the NALCN channel (Bouasse2019Functional; Liao2022Case). IHPRF, on the other hand, is inherited recessively and results from loss-of-function mutations, causing severe hypotonia and developmental delays (Karimi2020&lt; p&gt; A).

NALCN mutations have also been implicated in cancer, where they are associated with cancer metastasis and nonmalignant cell dissemination. Loss-of-function mutations in NALCN can lead to increased cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor (Rahrmann2022The). Alterations in NALCN expression are linked to various cancers, including glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and are associated with tumor progression and immune response (He2023NALCN). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NALCN in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
The NALCN protein forms a complex with UNC79, UNC80, and FAM155A, which is essential for its function in neurons. NALCN is the pore-forming subunit of this hetero-tetrameric channel complex. UNC79 and UNC80 are large proteins that interact with NALCN through specific cytosolic motifs known as UNIMs (UNIM-A, UNIM-B, and UNIM-C) located on NALCN's loop regions. These interactions are crucial for the proper localization and function of the NALCN channel (Kang2022Structure).

UNC80 acts as a bridge between NALCN and UNC79, facilitating the formation of the NALCN-UNC79-UNC80 complex. This interaction is important for the surface localization of NALCN and its function in neuronal excitability. UNC80's C-terminal region is particularly important for its dendritic localization, and mutations in this region can lead to severe phenotypes due to mislocalization (Lu2010Extracellular; Wie2020Intellectual).

FAM155A is another component of the complex, aiding in the membrane localization of NALCN. The assembly of the NALCN-FAM155A subcomplex occurs intracellularly before the binding of the UNC79-UNC80 heterodimer, which activates the channel and promotes its localization to the plasma membrane (Kang2022Structure).
