# HS3ST1

## Overview
HS3ST1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1, which is a sulfotransferase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. This enzyme plays a critical role in the 3-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate, a modification essential for the formation of antithrombin-binding sites, thereby influencing anticoagulant activity and hemostasis (Thacker2014Heparan). The enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to glucosamine residues, impacting various biological processes such as blood coagulation and cell signaling (Thacker2014Heparan). Beyond its role in coagulation, HS3ST1 is implicated in modulating anti-inflammatory properties and maintaining vascular homeostasis (Smits2017HS3ST1). Genetic variability in HS3ST1 has been linked to increased risks of Alzheimer's disease and coronary artery diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Ouidja2022Variability).

## Function
The human gene HS3ST1 encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1, which is crucial for the 3-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate. This modification is essential for the formation of antithrombin-binding sites, which are necessary for the anticoagulant activity of heparin and play a central role in hemostasis by inhibiting proteases such as thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa (Thacker2014Heparan). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate, influencing various biological processes, including blood coagulation and cell signaling (Thacker2014Heparan).

In addition to its role in coagulation, HS3ST1 is involved in modulating the anti-inflammatory properties of antithrombin. The specific form of heparan sulfate produced by HS3ST1, known as HS AT+, facilitates antithrombin's interaction with endothelial cells, reducing leukocyte adhesion and promoting vascular homeostasis (Smits2017HS3ST1). This anti-inflammatory activity is crucial for maintaining a balanced inflammatory response and protecting against chronic vascular inflammation and related diseases (Smits2017HS3ST1). Despite its significant roles, HS3ST1 knockout mice do not exhibit a prothrombotic phenotype, suggesting that 3-O-sulfation may not be essential for maintaining hemostatic balance in vivo (Thacker2014Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
The HS3ST1 gene, which encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1, has been associated with various clinical conditions through its genetic variability. Although no pathogenic mutations have been directly reported for HS3ST1, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and coronary artery diseases (Ouidja2022Variability). The gene is expressed in the vascular system and brain, suggesting its involvement in conditions affecting these tissues (Ouidja2022Variability).

In addition to its role in disease susceptibility, the HS3ST1 null mouse model exhibits a strong proinflammatory phenotype when exposed to pathological stimuli, indicating a potential role in inflammatory responses (Ouidja2022Variability). This suggests that alterations in HS3ST1 expression or function could contribute to inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, while HS3ST1 is not essential for normal development and homeostasis, SNPs in this gene have been associated with altered responses to pathological conditions, impaired angiogenesis, inflammation, and immunological responses (Ouidja2022Variability). These findings highlight the gene's potential impact on various health conditions through its influence on heparan sulfate biosynthesis and related cellular processes.

## Interactions
HS3ST1 is involved in the modification of heparan sulfate (HS) through 3-O-sulfation, which significantly influences its interactions with various proteins. One of the key interactions facilitated by HS3ST1-modified heparan sulfate is with antithrombin (AT), a protein that shows a strong preference for binding to HS3ST1-modified heparan sulfate, enhancing its protease inhibitory activity (Thacker2016Expanding). This interaction is specific to the 3-O-sulfated form of heparan sulfate, as AT does not bind to unmodified heparan sulfate (Thacker2016Expanding).

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is another protein that interacts preferentially with 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate. The binding of NRP1 to HS3ST1-modified heparan sulfate is crucial for its oligomerization and activity, particularly in processes like growth cone collapse and endothelial sprouting (Thacker2016Expanding). The presence of HS3ST1 enhances the binding affinity of NRP1 to heparan sulfate, indicating a role in modulating NRP1 activity (Thacker2016Expanding).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, 3-O-sulfation by HS3ST1 enhances the interaction and cellular uptake of tau protein, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting tau propagation (Zhao20193‐O‐Sulfation).
