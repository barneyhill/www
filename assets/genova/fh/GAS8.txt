# GAS8

## Overview
The GAS8 gene encodes the growth arrest specific 8 protein, a critical component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) involved in the function and structural integrity of motile cilia. This protein is characterized by its microtubule binding domains and coiled-coil domains, which are essential for its role in regulating ciliary dynamics and ensuring proper ciliary motility (Zhao2009Interaction; Jeanson2016Mutations). GAS8 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, such as the respiratory tract and reproductive organs, where it contributes to the coordinated beating of cilia necessary for processes like mucus clearance in the airways (Jeanson2016Mutations). Mutations in the GAS8 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to respiratory and fertility issues (Jeanson2016Mutations). Additionally, GAS8 has been implicated in interactions with viral proteins and cytoskeletal components, highlighting its broader role in cellular processes (Zhao2009Interaction).

## Structure
The GAS8 protein is a subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliary function. The protein is composed of several domains, including a microtubule binding regulatory domain (IMAD), a microtubule binding domain (GMAD), and three coiled-coil domains. The GMAD directly binds to microtubules, while the IMAD attenuates this interaction, indicating a regulatory function in microtubule dynamics (Zhao2009Interaction; Jeanson2016Mutations).

Mutations in the GAS8 gene, such as c.547C>T (p.Arg183*) and c.1000C>T (p.Arg334*), result in nonsense mutations that likely lead to a truncated protein lacking the GMAD and the third coiled-coil domains, which are essential for its function (Jeanson2016Mutations). These mutations are expected to be highly deleterious, potentially triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and resulting in the absence of protein production (Jeanson2016Mutations).

The GAS8 protein is the vertebrate ortholog of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii DRC subunit DRC4, suggesting evolutionary conservation of its structure and function (Jeanson2016Mutations). The protein's structure is characterized by its microtubule binding domains and coiled-coil domains, which are integral to its role in the regulatory complex (Jeanson2016Mutations).

## Function
The GAS8 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which is essential for the structural integrity and function of motile cilia in human cells (Jeanson2016Mutations). In healthy cells, GAS8 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia or flagella, such as the trachea, lung, and testis, and plays a crucial role in the structural organization and function of cilia (Jeanson2016Mutations). The protein contains several domains, including a microtubule binding regulatory domain (IMAD), a microtubule binding domain (GMAD), and three coiled-coil domains. The GMAD directly binds to microtubules, while the IMAD modulates this interaction, which is essential for the proper assembly and function of cilia (Jeanson2016Mutations).

GAS8 is localized within the cilia, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy, and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia (Jeanson2016Mutations). The protein is involved in regulating the activity of dynein arms, contributing to the coordinated beating of cilia, which is important for effective airway mucus clearance (Jeanson2016Mutations). The absence of GAS8 leads to axonemal disorganization, highlighting its role in maintaining normal ciliary function (Jeanson2016Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GAS8 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the motile cilia, leading to chronic respiratory infections, sinusitis, and fertility issues. Individuals with GAS8 mutations often exhibit axonemal disorganization in cilia, resulting in uncoordinated ciliary beating patterns with normal frequency but reduced amplitude, which impairs mucus clearance in the airways (Jeanson2016Mutations). These mutations can also lead to conditions such as bronchitis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and asthenospermia (Jeanson2016Mutations).

A specific case study identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in GAS8 associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in a patient with PCD, highlighting the gene's role in respiratory and sinus conditions (Artesani2024A). The study emphasizes the need for advanced diagnostic techniques, such as high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, to detect subtle ciliary abnormalities caused by GAS8 mutations (Artesani2024A).

In addition to PCD, alterations in GAS8 expression or function have been implicated in cancer predisposition. A genomic study identified GAS8 as a potential candidate gene associated with an increased risk of developing cancer in a patient with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (Basso2015Genomic).

## Interactions
The GAS8 protein is known to interact with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the influenza A virus NS1 protein, as demonstrated through various experimental techniques, including GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These studies confirmed that GAS8 physically interacts with NS1 both in vitro and in vivo, with the N-terminal 260 amino acids of GAS8 being sufficient for this interaction (Zhao2009Interaction).

GAS8 is also associated with the cytoskeleton, interacting with actin, myosin, and drebrin. It co-localizes with actin at the plasma membrane, and NS1 and β-actin proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, indicating a complex interaction network involving GAS8 (Zhao2009Interaction).

In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), GAS8 is a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), crucial for ciliary motility. Mutations in GAS8 affect the localization of DRC3 within cilia, suggesting that GAS8 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the N-DRC and proper ciliary function (Jeanson2016Mutations).
