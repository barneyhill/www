# C4B

## Overview
The C4B gene encodes the complement component 4B protein, which is a key player in the classical pathway of the complement system, an integral part of the immune response. This protein, categorized as part of the complement system, is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex, which is essential for lysing foreign antigens and facilitating immune clearance. The complement C4B protein, also known as the Chido blood group, is more efficient than its isotype C4A in certain immune functions, such as forming C3 convertase, which is crucial for opsonization and pathogen clearance (Blanchong2001Genetic; Schifferli1989Two). Beyond its role in immunity, C4B is implicated in neurological processes, including synaptic pruning, and has been associated with various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular disorders (Zhou2021Human; Szilágyi2008Diseases).

## Function
The C4B gene encodes the complement component 4B, a crucial protein in the classical pathway of the complement system, which plays a significant role in the immune response. C4B is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex, essential for lysing foreign antigens. It achieves this by forming covalent ester bonds with substrates containing hydroxyl groups, such as carbohydrates, which enhances its ability to propagate complement activation pathways (Zhou2021Human; Blanchong2001Genetic).

C4B is more efficient than its isotype C4A in hemolytic assays, indicating its significant role in forming C3 convertase, which is vital for opsonization and the rapid deposition of C3b fragments. This activity is crucial for the opsonization and clearance of pathogens (Schifferli1989Two). The protein is primarily active in blood plasma and on cell surfaces, contributing to inflammation and the clearance of immune complexes (Zhou2021Human).

C4B also plays a protective role in synaptic pruning in the brain, contrasting with C4A, which is considered a risk factor for dysfunctional synaptic pruning. This suggests that C4B may influence neurological processes and immune tolerance (Zhou2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the C4B gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. A low copy number of the C4B gene has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, particularly in smokers. This association is thought to be due to deficiencies in the classical and lectin complement pathways, leading to defective immune complex handling, or possibly linked to polymorphisms in the neighboring CYP21A2 gene, affecting stress response and cortisol mobilization (Szilágyi2008Diseases).

C4B gene mutations are also implicated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Specific mutations, like the R729Q variation and a C-nucleotide deletion at codon-755, have been identified in patients with autoimmune conditions, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Zhou2021Human). Total C4B deficiency, often due to gene deletions or conversions, can lead to severe infections, as the absence of C4B impairs the immune system's ability to clear immune complexes and respond to infections (Jaatinen2003Total).

Additionally, C4B deficiencies have been associated with neurological disorders, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, where specific mutations like W660x have been identified (Zhou2021Human).
