# CRIPTO3

## Overview
CRIPTO3 is a gene that encodes the protein cripto, EGF-CFC family member 3, which is part of the epidermal growth factor-Cripto/FRL-1/Cryptic (EGF-CFC) family. This family of proteins is known for its involvement in cell signaling pathways that regulate embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The CRIPTO3 gene was initially thought to be a pseudogene; however, it has been identified as actively expressed in various cancer types, suggesting a functional role in oncogenesis. The cripto protein encoded by CRIPTO3 acts as a coreceptor in the Nodal-dependent signaling pathway, interacting with other proteins such as ALK4 to facilitate the phosphorylation of Smad2, a transcription factor that activates downstream genes. This interaction is crucial for cellular processes and has been linked to cancer progression, making CRIPTO3 a potential target for cancer research and therapy (Sun2008CRIPTO3).

## Clinical Significance
CRIPTO3, a member of the EGF-CFC family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. Initially considered a pseudogene, CRIPTO3 is now recognized for its expression in several cancer tissues, including colon, breast, and lung cancers, where it may be the predominant form of CRIPTO expression (Sun2008CRIPTO3). The CRIPTO3 protein is functional in the Nodal-dependent signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with oncogenesis (Sun2008CRIPTO3).

CRIPTO3's expression is more prevalent in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in cancer development (Sun2008CRIPTO3). The presence of CRIPTO3 mRNA in primary cancer tissues and its detection on cell membranes further support its involvement in cancer biology (Sun2008CRIPTO3). Alterations in CRIPTO3 expression or function could serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target, as inhibition of Cripto proteins has been shown to reduce cancer cell growth in vitro (Sun2008CRIPTO3).

The exact mechanisms by which CRIPTO3 contributes to cancer remain to be fully elucidated, but its role in the Nodal signaling pathway and its expression pattern in cancerous tissues highlight its clinical significance (Sun2008CRIPTO3).

## Interactions
CRIPTO3, a member of the EGF-CFC family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence signaling pathways crucial for cellular processes. It was initially considered a pseudogene but is now recognized for its expression in cancer and its role in oncogenesis. CRIPTO3 shares functional similarities with Cripto-1, particularly in the Nodal-dependent signaling pathway, where it interacts with membrane-bound ALK4 and Nodal. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor Smad2, which subsequently activates downstream target genes (Sun2008CRIPTO3).

CRIPTO3's involvement in these pathways suggests it may form complexes with other proteins, such as ALK4, to modulate signaling. The protein's ability to activate the Nodal-dependent pathway indicates its role as a coreceptor, facilitating the binding and signaling of TGF-β family members. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where CRIPTO3 mRNA is the predominant CRIPTO message in many cancer samples, suggesting a novel mechanism of oncogenesis through the activation of a retrogene (Sun2008CRIPTO3). These interactions highlight CRIPTO3's potential impact on cellular proliferation and differentiation, particularly in cancerous tissues.
