# FNDC1

## Overview
The FNDC1 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of multiple fibronectin type III domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in the extracellular matrix, facilitating interactions with integrins that are essential for cell adhesion, migration, and signaling processes (van2016Genomewide). FNDC1 is involved in various cellular functions, including the remodeling of the fibronectin matrix and participation in G-protein signaling pathways, which influence immune responses and inflammation (van2016Genomewide). The protein is expressed in diverse tissues, such as mesenchymal stem cells and adipose tissue, underscoring its broad functional significance (van2016Genomewide). Additionally, FNDC1 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and coronary heart disease, highlighting its clinical relevance (Jiang2020RETRACTED:; He2022Rs420137).

## Structure
The FNDC1 protein, also known as KIAA1866 or MEL4B3, is composed of 1894 amino acids in humans and has a molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa (Daudon2022Irisin). The protein structure includes a signal peptide followed by five fibronectin type III domains, which are involved in cell adhesion and receptor binding (Daudon2022Irisin). FNDC1 can exist as either a secreted or intracellular protein, depending on the isoform (Daudon2022Irisin). 

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation with a GlcNAc residue at amino acids 149 and 1661 (Daudon2022Irisin). While the context does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, the presence of fibronectin type III domains suggests a role in maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function. The context does not mention specific folds or splice variant isoforms for FNDC1, nor does it provide detailed information on other post-translational modifications beyond N-glycosylation (Cordeiro2021Proteomic; Daudon2022Irisin).

## Function
The FNDC1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the extracellular matrix, containing fibronectin type III domains. These domains are crucial for interactions with integrins, which facilitate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (van2016Genomewide). FNDC1 is involved in the remodeling of the fibronectin matrix, which can influence cytokine expression through the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, impacting processes such as inflammation (van2016Genomewide). 

FNDC1 also plays a role in G-protein signaling by interacting with the Gbg subunit, which affects various cellular functions, including the regulation of cell permeability and response to hypoxic stress (van2016Genomewide). This interaction is significant in the context of immune responses, as it can activate pathways like PI3Kgamma, which is involved in inflammation regulation through neutrophil recruitment, and RhoGef, which is important for lymphocyte chemotaxis and actin polymerization (van2016Genomewide). 

FNDC1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including mesenchymal stem cells, synovial membrane, fetal cartilage, thyroid gland, and adipose tissue, indicating its broad role in cellular and tissue functions (van2016Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The FNDC1 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In gastric cancer (GC), FNDC1 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and higher expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and peritoneal metastasis. FNDC1 promotes the invasiveness of GC through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and its knockdown has been shown to inhibit GC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Jiang2020RETRACTED:).

FNDC1 is also associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FNDC1 gene, such as rs420137, rs386360, and rs7763726, have been linked to an increased risk of CHD. These genetic variations suggest that FNDC1 polymorphisms contribute to the genetic predisposition to CHD (He2022Rs420137).

In the context of acute otitis media (AOM), FNDC1 has been identified as a contributing factor through a genome-wide association study. The SNP rs2932989 is associated with FNDC1 expression and AOM susceptibility, indicating a role in the pathogenesis of this condition through altered immune or inflammatory responses (van2016Genomewide).

## Interactions
FNDC1 (fibronectin type III domain containing 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer. In prostate cancer cells, FNDC1 interacts with fibronectin (FN1), androgen receptor (AR), and c-MYC, forming a complex that is crucial for maintaining cellular functions associated with cancer progression. This interaction is particularly evident in prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP and C4-2B, where FNDC1 directly interacts with FN1, while FN1, AR, and c-MYC have direct interactions among themselves. The presence of FNDC1 in this complex is disrupted when FN1 is silenced, highlighting FN1's role in maintaining the integrity of the complex (Ghosh2023Intracellular).

FNDC1's interaction with these proteins is not significantly affected by the overexpression of miR-1207-3p, although miR-1207-3p does target FNDC1 directly, reducing its expression. Despite this, the mechanism of interaction between FNDC1, FN1, AR, and c-MYC is not fully characterized, with FN1 suggested to interact with AR through the N-terminal domain and with c-MYC potentially through its N-terminal regions (Ghosh2023Intracellular). These interactions suggest a complex role for FNDC1 in cancer cell signaling and progression.
