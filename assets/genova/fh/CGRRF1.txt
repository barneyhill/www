# CGRRF1

## Overview
CGRRF1, or cell growth regulator with ring finger domain 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell growth and protein degradation. The protein encoded by CGRRF1 is characterized by a transmembrane domain and a RING-finger domain, classifying it as a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, where it targets misfolded proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. CGRRF1 is particularly significant in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the Wnt secretory factor Evi, influencing key cellular signaling pathways and homeostasis. The gene's expression is regulated by p53 and is responsive to endoplasmic reticulum stress, highlighting its involvement in cellular stress response mechanisms (Kaneko2016Genomewide; Glaeser2018ERAD‐dependent; Lee2019CGRRF1).

## Function
CGRRF1 is a growth suppressor gene that encodes a protein with a transmembrane domain and a RING-finger domain, functioning as a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (Lee2019CGRRF1). In healthy cells, CGRRF1 is implicated in the regulation of protein degradation, particularly targeting misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Lee2019CGRRF1). The protein is involved in the ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting its degradation and thereby regulating EGFR signaling pathways, which are crucial for cellular signaling and homeostasis (Lee2019CGRRF1). CGRRF1's activity in ubiquitinating EGFR is essential for maintaining normal levels of EGFR, influencing cell growth and signaling pathways (Lee2019CGRRF1).

CGRRF1 is also involved in the regulation of the Wnt secretory factor Evi, affecting its poly-ubiquitination and degradation, which is part of an ERAD-dependent pathway that controls protein secretion (Glaeser2018ERAD‐dependent). The expression of CGRRF1 is regulated by p53 and is upregulated in response to ER stress inducers, indicating its role in stress response mechanisms (Kaneko2016Genomewide; Lee2019CGRRF1).

## Clinical Significance
CGRRF1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a growth suppressor gene. In breast cancer, CGRRF1 expression is often downregulated, particularly in HER2-positive and basal-like subtypes, which are associated with poor survival outcomes (Lee2019CGRRF1). This downregulation is linked to promoter hypermethylation, an epigenetic modification that reduces CGRRF1 transcript levels, contributing to cancer progression (Lee2019CGRRF1). Low CGRRF1 expression correlates with increased AKT phosphorylation and EGFR signaling, promoting tumor growth and poor patient survival, especially in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers (Lee2019CGRRF1).

CGRRF1's role extends beyond breast cancer, as its decreased expression is also observed in kidney carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with shorter patient survival (Lee2019CGRRF1). The gene's downregulation is noted in other tumors, including testicular germ cell, endometrial, and colorectal cancers, suggesting a broader role in cancer development (Lee2019CGRRF1). Therapeutic strategies targeting CGRRF1 expression, such as using demethylation agents like 5-azacitidine and histone deacetylase inhibitors like panobinostat, have shown potential in restoring its expression in breast cancer cells (Lee2019CGRRF1).

## Interactions
CGRRF1, a growth suppressor protein, is known to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in breast cancer cells. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting K48-linked ubiquitination of EGFR, which leads to its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating EGFR stability and inhibiting tumor growth. The interaction between CGRRF1 and EGFR is ligand-independent, meaning it occurs regardless of EGF stimulation, and has been confirmed through various methods such as GFP-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Lee2019CGRRF1).

CGRRF1 also interacts with proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calnexin, indicating its localization to the ER. It is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, targeting proteins like Evi (Wls/CPR177) for degradation (Lee2019CGRRF1).

In addition, CGRRF1 has been shown to interact with nuclear envelope proteins emerin and LBR, suggesting its potential involvement in proteasomal degradation at the inner nuclear membrane (Cheng2022Shared). These interactions highlight CGRRF1's role in regulating protein stability and cellular signaling pathways.
