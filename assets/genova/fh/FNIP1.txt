# FNIP1

## Overview
Folliculin interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis and metabolism. The FNIP1 protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and responding to metabolic stress. As a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, FNIP1 interacts with folliculin (FLCN) and other proteins, influencing processes such as lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by AMPK, which affects its interactions and activity within the cell (Malik2023Induction; Baba2006Folliculin). FNIP1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in various physiological processes, including muscle fiber type specification and immune system function, with implications for conditions such as Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and FNIP1 deficiency-related immunodeficiencies (Reyes2014Fnip1; Saettini2021Absent).

## Structure
FNIP1 is a protein encoded by the KIAA1961 gene, with a primary structure consisting of 1,166 amino acids (Baba2006Folliculin). The protein does not have known functional domains identified through BLAST analysis, but it contains five blocks of conserved sequences, indicating evolutionary conservation across several species (Baba2006Folliculin). FNIP1 interacts with folliculin (FLCN) and is involved in AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways, suggesting its role in cellular energy sensing and metabolism (Baba2006Folliculin).

FNIP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by AMPK at several sites, such as Ser 230, Ser 232, Ser 261, Ser 593, and Ser 220. These phosphorylation events are crucial for its function in regulating transcription factors like TFEB and TFE3 (Malik2023Induction). The phosphorylation of FNIP1 by AMPK affects its interaction with other proteins and its role in signaling pathways (Malik2023Induction).

FNIP1 forms homo- and heterodimers with FNIP2, with FNIP1 homodimers showing a stronger affinity for Hsp90 and FLCN (Woodford2016The). This quaternary structure aspect highlights its role as a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle (Woodford2016The).

## Function
FNIP1 (folliculin interacting protein 1) is a crucial component in the regulation of cellular energy homeostasis and metabolism. It interacts with folliculin and is involved in the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways, which are essential for cell growth, proliferation, and survival (Malik2023Induction). FNIP1 plays a significant role in skeletal muscle by regulating mitochondrial function and muscle fiber type specification. It influences the skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative program through AMPK signaling, acting as a brake to inhibit mitochondrial and type I fiber programs (Xiao2021AMPKdependent). 

In healthy human cells, FNIP1 is phosphorylated by AMPK, which is necessary for the regulation of lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. This phosphorylation affects the localization and activity of transcription factors TFEB and TFE3, which are involved in lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis (Malik2023Induction). FNIP1's phosphorylation by AMPK also promotes the dissociation of RagC and mTOR from the lysosome, facilitating the activation of TFEB and TFE3 under low-energy conditions (Malik2023Induction). FNIP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain cellular energy balance and respond to metabolic stress (Malik2023Induction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FNIP1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the immune system and muscle function. FNIP1 deficiency is identified as a novel inborn error of immunity, leading to conditions such as agammaglobulinemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and variable neutropenia. Agammaglobulinemia results from early termination of B-cell development, causing absent circulating B-cells and very low or absent serum immunoglobulin levels. Patients with FNIP1 deficiency may present with recurrent infections and HCM, with some also experiencing intermittent or severe chronic neutropenia (Saettini2021Absent).

In skeletal muscle, FNIP1 plays a role in fiber type specification and mitochondrial biogenesis. Disruption of FNIP1 leads to a shift from glycolytic to oxidative muscle fibers, which are more resistant to fatigue. This shift is associated with hyperactivation of AMPK and increased levels of PGC1α, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits for conditions like muscular dystrophy and obesity-associated diseases (Reyes2014Fnip1).

FNIP1 is also implicated in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, a disorder characterized by skin lesions, pulmonary cysts, and kidney malignancies. The FNIP1 pathway, when disrupted, leads to a block in B-cell development, highlighting its role in immune cell differentiation and survival (Baba2012The).

## Interactions
FNIP1 (folliculin interacting protein 1) is known for its interactions with several key proteins involved in cellular energy regulation and signaling pathways. FNIP1 interacts with folliculin (FLCN), a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the BHD gene. This interaction is significant as it is involved in the regulation of the mTOR and AMPK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell growth and energy balance (Baba2006Folliculin).

FNIP1 also interacts with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central player in energy sensing and metabolic regulation. This interaction involves all subunits of AMPK and is distinct from its binding with FLCN. FNIP1 is phosphorylated by AMPK, which affects its expression levels and its role in cellular energy regulation (Baba2006Folliculin).

In addition to its interactions with FLCN and AMPK, FNIP1 acts as a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 chaperone system. It interacts with Hsp90, Hsp70, and other co-chaperones such as p23 and Cdc37, facilitating the binding of FLCN to Hsp90. FNIP1's interaction with Hsp90 is regulated by post-translational modifications, specifically phosphorylation by casein-kinase 2 (CK2), which promotes its binding to Hsp90 and inhibits Hsp90 ATPase activity (Woodford2016The; Backe2022Emerging).
