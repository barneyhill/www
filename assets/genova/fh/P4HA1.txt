# P4HA1

## Overview
P4HA1 is a gene that encodes the prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1, a critical component of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme complex. This enzyme is categorized as a hydroxylase and plays a pivotal role in collagen synthesis by hydroxylating proline residues in procollagen, which is essential for the stability and proper folding of collagen into its triple-helical structure. The P4HA1 gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the vagina, skeletal muscle, and breast, and is also present in immune cells with low specificity. The protein operates within the endoplasmic reticulum, forming a tetrameric complex with two alpha and two beta subunits, the latter encoded by the P4HB gene. P4HA1 is involved in several biological processes, including extracellular matrix integrity and protein secretion, and has been implicated in cancer progression through its interactions with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and other molecular pathways (Eriksson2020Prolyl; Li2022The; Shi2021Collagen).

## Structure
The P4HA1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an enzyme essential for collagen synthesis. The primary structure of P4HA1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide, allowing the protein to perform its enzymatic functions effectively.

In terms of quaternary structure, prolyl 4-hydroxylase is a tetramer composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits, forming the active enzyme complex. This configuration is crucial for the enzyme's role in hydroxylating proline residues in procollagen, facilitating the formation of stable collagen triple helices (Eriksson2020Prolyl; Chen2018MicroRNA1243p).

Post-translational modifications of P4HA1 include hydroxylation and glycosylation, which are important for its enzymatic activity and stability. The gene also produces different splice variant isoforms, such as variant 1 encoding isoform 1 and variants 2 and 3 encoding isoform 2, which are expressed at varying levels in different cell types, including melanoma cells and fibroblasts (Eriksson2020Prolyl).

## Function
Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1) is a crucial component of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme, which plays a significant role in collagen synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen polypeptide chains, a modification essential for the stability and proper folding of collagen into its triple-helical structure. This process is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues (Li2022The; Shi2021Collagen).

P4HA1 is expressed in various normal tissues, with the highest levels found in the vagina, skeletal muscle, and breast. It is also ubiquitously expressed in immune cells, although with low specificity (Li2022The). The enzyme operates in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms a tetrameric complex composed of two alpha and two beta subunits, with the beta subunit encoded by the P4HB gene (Li2022The; Shi2021Collagen).

In healthy cells, P4HA1's enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining extracellular matrix integrity and regulating protein secretion, which are essential for normal cell adhesion and tissue structure (Eriksson2020Prolyl).

## Clinical Significance
P4HA1, the gene encoding prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Overexpression of P4HA1 is frequently observed in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. Inhibition of P4HA1 in CRC models has been shown to reduce tumor growth and malignancy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020P4HA1; Agarwal2020Targeting).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), P4HA1 is associated with chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. It stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), enhancing cancer cell survival under hypoxic conditions and promoting tumor progression (Xiong2018Collagen).

P4HA1 is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma, where it supports cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. Targeting P4HA1 with inhibitors has shown promise in reducing these malignant characteristics (Robinson2021Collagen).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), P4HA1 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and cancer progression, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2022The).

Overall, P4HA1's altered expression and interactions in various cancers highlight its clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
P4HA1 (prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in collagen synthesis and cancer progression. P4HA1 forms an active enzyme complex with the beta subunit P4HB, which is essential for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, a critical step in collagen synthesis (Li2020Identification).

In glioma, P4HA1 physically interacts with COL6A1, a collagen protein, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction suggests that COL6A1 is a downstream effector of P4HA1, playing a role in extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis (Han2022P4HA1).

P4HA1 also interacts with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. It stabilizes HIF-1α by reducing its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, thereby enhancing the hypoxic response in cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for the progression of various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Xiong2018Collagen; Cao2019P4HA1HIF1α).

Additionally, P4HA1 is targeted by miR-124-3p in vascular smooth muscle cells, which inhibits collagen synthesis by binding to the 3' UTR of P4HA1 mRNA, indicating a regulatory interaction at the post-transcriptional level (Chen2018MicroRNA1243p).
