# UBL5

## Overview
UBL5 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-like protein 5 (UBL5), which is a member of the ubiquitin-like protein family. Unlike typical ubiquitin proteins, UBL5 does not participate in covalent conjugation but instead functions through non-covalent interactions, facilitated by its unique structural features, including a β-grasp fold and a conserved di-tyrosine motif (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:; McNally2003Structural). UBL5 is involved in several critical cellular processes, such as pre-mRNA splicing and the DNA damage response, and plays a role in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). It interacts with various proteins, including components of the spliceosome and the cyclin-like kinase CLK4, highlighting its regulatory functions in cellular processes (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:; McNally2003Structural). UBL5's expression in major tissues, particularly in endocrine glands, suggests its involvement in metabolic regulation, and its genetic variations have been linked to metabolic syndrome and neuropsychiatric disorders (Bozaoglu2006Association; Bernstein2008Beaconlikeubiquitin5like).

## Structure
UBL5 is a ubiquitin-like protein consisting of 73 amino acids and shares structural similarities with ubiquitin, despite having only about 22% sequence identity (Švéda2013Human). The protein adopts a β-grasp fold, characterized by a five-strand antiparallel β-sheet surrounding an α-helix (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). This structure is typical of ubiquitin-like proteins and is crucial for its function in cellular processes.

Unlike typical ubiquitin proteins, UBL5 lacks the C-terminal di-glycine motif necessary for covalent conjugation. Instead, it features a conserved di-tyrosine motif followed by a variable residue, which suggests a distinct mechanism of action (McNally2003Structural; Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). This structural difference indicates that UBL5 may not require the typical enzymatic cascade for its function, relying instead on non-covalent interactions (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:).

UBL5 is known to interact with specific proteins such as CLK4, a cyclin-like kinase, through its C-terminal region (McNally2003Structural). The protein is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing, interacting with components of the spliceosome, such as Snu66 and Prp38, through a conserved interaction domain (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). These interactions highlight UBL5's role in regulating cellular processes through its unique structural features.

## Function
UBL5, also known as Hub1, is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing, a vital step in RNA processing that ensures accurate gene expression. UBL5 interacts with the spliceosome, particularly binding to components such as the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP and the DEAD-box RNA helicase Prp5, which are essential for spliceosome assembly and activation (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). UBL5 is also involved in the regulation of alternative splicing through interactions with SR-protein kinases, such as the CDC-like kinase (CLK) family, which phosphorylate SR proteins necessary for spliceosome assembly (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:).

In addition to its role in splicing, UBL5 is implicated in the Fanconi anemia pathway, a DNA damage response mechanism that repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks. It binds to FANCI, stabilizing it and protecting it from degradation, thereby maintaining the functional integrity of the pathway (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). UBL5 is also involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, a stress response system that maintains mitochondrial protein homeostasis (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:). UBL5 is expressed in all major tissues, with high expression in endocrine glands, suggesting a potential role in regulating metabolic processes (Chanarat2021UBL5Hub1:).

## Clinical Significance
The UBL5 gene has been implicated in several health conditions due to its role in metabolic processes and its expression in the hypothalamus. Variations in the UBL5 gene have been associated with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. In particular, genetic variants of UBL5 have been linked to obesity-related traits such as waist-to-hip ratio, insulin levels, and cholesterol levels in various populations, including Mexican American, Asian Indian, and Micronesian cohorts (Bozaoglu2006Association).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, UBL5 expression is altered in schizophrenia. Studies have shown increased UBL5 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of individuals with schizophrenia, particularly those treated with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol. This suggests a potential role for UBL5 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, possibly related to stress regulation and osmoregulation (Bernstein2008Beaconlikeubiquitin5like).

Despite these associations, some studies have not found a direct link between UBL5 variants and obesity, indicating that the gene's role in these conditions may be complex and influenced by other genetic and environmental factors (Sentinelli2008Identification).

## Interactions
UBL5, a ubiquitin-like protein, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In humans, UBL5 interacts with coilin, a key structural component of Cajal bodies (CBs), which are nuclear domains involved in the assembly and modification of spliceosomal components. This interaction is independent of coilin's phosphorylation state, suggesting a stable association between UBL5 and coilin (Švéda2013Human).

UBL5 also forms distinct nuclear foci that colocalize with Cajal bodies, indicating its potential role in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription regulation. The interaction with coilin suggests that UBL5 may be targeted to Cajal bodies through this association (Švéda2013Human).

In addition to its role in the nucleus, UBL5 has been shown to interact with the cyclin-like kinase CLK4, a member of the LAMMER family of protein kinases. This interaction is specific to the full-length CLK4 construct and is likely mediated by the C terminus of CLK4, where the kinase domain is located (McNally2003Structural). These interactions highlight UBL5's involvement in modulating protein function and its potential regulatory roles in cellular processes.
