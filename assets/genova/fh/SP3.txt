# SP3

## Overview
SP3 is a gene that encodes the Sp3 transcription factor, a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors. The Sp3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, which allows it to bind to GC-rich sequences in DNA, thereby regulating gene expression. Functionally, Sp3 acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, influencing a wide range of cellular processes including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is ubiquitously expressed and plays critical roles in various physiological contexts, such as keratinocyte differentiation, collagen gene expression, and hematopoietic differentiation. The activity of Sp3 is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which can alter its transcriptional activity without affecting its DNA-binding capability. Dysregulation of SP3 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, cardiac malformations, and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Dennig1996An; EssafiBenkhadir2009Dual; Philipsen1999A; Sapetschnig2002Transcription).

## Structure
The SP3 transcription factor is a member of the Sp/KLF family, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SP3 includes two glutamine-rich activation domains and a zinc finger DNA-binding domain located at the C-terminus, which is crucial for recognizing GC-rich sequences in promoters (Dennig1996An; Philipsen1999A). The secondary structure involves alpha helices and beta sheets, stabilized by the zinc finger motifs, which are essential for DNA binding (Al‐Sarraj2004Specificity).

SP3 exists in multiple isoforms, including a full-length 115 kDa form and two smaller ~70 kDa forms. The full-length isoform contains both glutamine-rich activation domains, while the smaller isoforms only have the second activation domain, making them weaker activators (Philipsen1999A). The tertiary structure is influenced by the zinc fingers, which facilitate the protein's ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins.

Post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation play a significant role in regulating SP3's activity. A specific lysine residue within the inhibitory domain is a target for SUMO modification, which silences SP3's transcriptional activity without affecting its DNA-binding ability (Sapetschnig2002Transcription). This modification highlights the intricate regulation of SP3's function in gene expression.

## Function
The SP3 transcription factor is a member of the Sp/KLF family and plays a dual role as both an activator and repressor of gene transcription in healthy human cells. It binds to GC-rich motifs in DNA, influencing various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. SP3 is ubiquitously expressed and functions primarily in the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of several genes critical for cellular homeostasis and development.

SP3 is involved in the regulation of the p21 promoter during keratinocyte differentiation. It specifically enhances the induction of the p21 promoter, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and differentiation in keratinocytes (Prowse1997Involvement). In the context of collagen gene expression, SP3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the human α2(I) collagen gene. It binds to specific response elements within the promoter region, working cooperatively with Sp1 to ensure high levels of collagen expression, which is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Ihn1997Sp3).

SP3 also plays a role in hematopoietic differentiation, where it can partially compensate for the loss of Sp1 at certain DNA binding sites. However, its function is not entirely redundant, as SP3-deficient embryonic stem cells exhibit defects in hematopoietic differentiation (Gilmour2019Robust).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SP3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In cancer, SP3 plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. Overexpression of SP3 is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, particularly in head and neck carcinomas. It modulates both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, influencing tumor progression and cell survival (EssafiBenkhadir2009Dual). 

In cardiac development, SP3 is crucial, as its knockout in mice leads to severe cardiac malformations, including defects in myocardial development and epicardial cell transformation. These malformations are a primary cause of perinatal mortality in SP3-deficient mice, highlighting the gene's essential role in heart development (van2007Transcription).

SP3 is also implicated in oxidative stress responses in neurons. It is upregulated in conditions of oxidative stress, such as in models of Huntington's disease, suggesting a protective role against neuronal death (Ryu2003Sp1). These findings indicate that SP3's dysregulation can contribute to various pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiac defects, and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
The Sp3 transcription factor is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its role in gene regulation. Sp3 can bind to GC-rich DNA motifs, often competing with Sp1 for these binding sites, which can result in either activation or repression of transcription depending on the context (Birnbaum1995Sp1). Sp3 has been shown to interact with the TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor dTAFII110, which is part of the TFIID complex, playing a crucial role in transcriptional activation (Dennig1996An).

Sp3 also interacts with PIAS1, a protein inhibitor of activated STAT1, through a SUMOylation-dependent mechanism. This interaction is facilitated by PIAS1 acting as an E3 ligase, enhancing the SUMOylation of Sp3, which may affect its transcriptional activity (Sapetschnig2002Transcription). Under hypoxic conditions, Sp3 acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to GC elements in the promoters of genes like β-enolase, where its depletion leads to gene activation (Discher1998Hypoxia). These interactions highlight Sp3's complex role in transcriptional regulation, where it can function as both an activator and a repressor depending on the interacting partners and cellular context.
