# AIM2

## Overview
Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a cytosolic DNA sensor and plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response. The AIM2 protein is characterized by its bipartite structure, comprising an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear (HIN) domain. These domains facilitate the protein's ability to detect double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from pathogens or damaged cells, leading to the assembly of the AIM2 inflammasome complex. This complex is crucial for the activation of caspase-1, which processes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, thereby promoting an inflammatory response (Man2015AIM2; Kumari2020AIM2). AIM2 is expressed in various tissues and is regulated by mechanisms that prevent inappropriate activation, ensuring a balanced immune response (Man2015AIM2; Lugrin2017The). The gene's expression and function are implicated in several diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its dual role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Lugrin2017The; Sharma2019Role).

## Structure
The AIM2 protein is characterized by its bipartite structure, consisting of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear (HIN) domain. The PYD is part of the death domain superfamily and exhibits a canonical six-helix bundle structure, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) (Lu2014Crystal; Jin2013Structure). The PYD domain is known for its distinct electrostatic charge distribution, with acidic residues concentrated in the α1-α2 helices and basic residues in the α5-α6 helices (Jin2013Structure).

The HIN domain is responsible for binding double-stranded DNA and consists of two tandem oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) folds. These OB folds are small structural motifs that facilitate nucleic acid binding through electrostatic interactions (Wang2020Immunobiology). The interaction between the HIN domain and dsDNA is crucial for AIM2's function as a cytosolic DNA sensor, leading to the formation of the AIM2 inflammasome complex (Wang2020Immunobiology).

AIM2's PYD can self-associate to form filaments, which serve as templates for ASC polymerization, a key step in inflammasome assembly (Sharma2021Structure). The structural plasticity of AIM2 PYD and its interactions with ASC are important for the versatility of inflammasome assembly (Lu2015Plasticity).

## Function
AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that plays a critical role in the innate immune response by detecting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from pathogens or damaged cells. Upon recognition of dsDNA, AIM2 initiates the assembly of the inflammasome complex, which includes the adaptor protein ASC and the effector protein caspase-1. This complex formation leads to the activation of caspase-1, which subsequently cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 into their active forms, facilitating their secretion and promoting an inflammatory response (Man2015AIM2; Kumari2020AIM2).

AIM2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, small intestine, and peripheral blood. Its expression can be rapidly induced by type I interferons, which are crucial for host defense against pathogens (Lugrin2017The). AIM2's ability to detect both pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) makes it a key player in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity (Lugrin2017The).

In healthy cells, AIM2 is maintained in an autoinhibitory state to prevent inappropriate activation, with regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation and autophagy-mediated degradation ensuring controlled inflammasome activation (Man2015AIM2).

## Clinical Significance
The AIM2 gene is implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions, although no gain-of-function mutations have been identified within the gene itself. In cancer, AIM2 expression is often downregulated, as observed in colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC, AIM2 downregulation is linked to tumor progression, and its reconstitution can inhibit tumor growth and invasiveness (Lugrin2017The). Conversely, AIM2 expression is increased in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), correlating with tumor grade, suggesting a complex role in cancer as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Lugrin2017The; Qin2022Pancancer).

AIM2 is also involved in inflammatory diseases. Its activation is linked to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, where it contributes to IL-1β production in keratinocytes, indicating a pathogenic role in skin diseases (Wang2022Roles; Sharma2019Role). In cardiovascular diseases, AIM2 is implicated in atherosclerosis, where its activation leads to the release of atherogenic cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, contributing to disease progression (Sharma2019Role). AIM2's role in chronic kidney disease and potentially in diabetes is also noted, with its activation promoting inflammation through cytokine release (Sharma2019Role).

## Interactions
AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) is a cytosolic sensor that interacts with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and various proteins to form the AIM2 inflammasome, a critical component of the innate immune response. AIM2 contains a pyrin domain (PYD) and a HIN domain, which facilitate its interactions. The PYD of AIM2 engages in homotypic interactions with the PYD of the adaptor protein ASC, leading to the recruitment and activation of caspase-1, which processes pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 (Jin2013Structure; Lugrin2017The).

AIM2 binds dsDNA through its HIN domain in a sequence-independent manner, primarily via electrostatic interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA. This binding is essential for the activation of the inflammasome (Wang2017AIM2; Sharma2021Structure). AIM2 can also self-associate through its PYD to form filaments, which serve as a structural template for ASC polymerization (Sharma2021Structure).

AIM2's activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins. The mouse protein p202 can inhibit AIM2 by sequestering dsDNA or through direct interaction, preventing ASC oligomerization and inflammasome assembly (Roberts2009HIN200; Sharma2021Structure). AIM2 also interacts with IFI16 and TRIM11, which modulate its activity through competitive binding and degradation, respectively (Sharma2021Structure).
