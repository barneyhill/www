# NUDT18

## Overview
The NUDT18 gene encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 18, also known as MTH3, which is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family. This family of enzymes is characterized by their ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, X, thereby playing a critical role in cellular metabolism and nucleotide pool maintenance. Nudix hydrolase 18 is particularly involved in the detoxification of oxidized nucleotides, such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine derivatives, which are prone to cause mutagenic events if incorporated into nucleic acids (Takagi2012Human). Additionally, the enzyme participates in the metabolism of isoprene pyrophosphates and active metabolites of antiviral drugs, suggesting its broader role in lipid homeostasis and drug metabolism (Scaletti2023Kinetic; Jemth2021NUDT18).

## Function
The NUDT18 gene encodes the MTH3 protein, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleotide pool integrity by hydrolyzing oxidized forms of guanosine and deoxyguanosine diphosphates. This activity is essential for preventing the incorporation of oxidized nucleotides, such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-Gua), into DNA and RNA, which can lead to base mispairing and genetic mutations (Takagi2012Human). MTH3 specifically targets 8-oxo-dGDP and 8-oxo-GDP, converting them to their monophosphate forms, thereby reducing the risk of mutagenesis and cellular dysfunction (Takagi2012Human).

NUDT18 is also involved in the hydrolysis of isoprene pyrophosphates, such as geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), which are intermediates in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. This activity suggests a role in modulating cholesterol levels and isoprenoid metabolism, impacting cellular functions related to lipid homeostasis and cell growth (Scaletti2023Kinetic). Additionally, NUDT18 hydrolyzes active metabolites of antiviral drugs, potentially influencing their efficacy by modulating the concentration of these drugs within cells (Jemth2021NUDT18).
