# PRAG1

## Overview
PRAG1, or PEAK1-related kinase-activating pseudokinase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein known as Pragmin, which is classified as a pseudokinase due to its lack of intrinsic catalytic activity. Despite this, Pragmin plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways by interacting with other proteins to modulate kinase activity and influence cell motility and morphology. The protein is characterized by a classical protein kinase fold with significant sequence divergence, including an 'inhibitory triad' that prevents ATP binding. Pragmin's ability to form heteromeric complexes and interact with proteins such as the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and Rnd2 GTPase highlights its involvement in regulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to kinase activation and GTPase signaling (Jacobsen2017The; Lecointre2017Dimerization). Through these interactions, PRAG1 influences processes such as cell shape, movement, and potentially tissue development and repair (Senda2016C‐terminal).

## Structure
The PRAG1 protein, also known as Pragmin or SgK223, is characterized as a pseudo-kinase, meaning it lacks the catalytic activity typical of conventional kinases. Its molecular structure includes a classical protein kinase fold, but it is distinguished by significant sequence divergence and the presence of an 'inhibitory triad' that prevents ATP binding, rendering it catalytically inactive (Lecointre2017Dimerization). The protein's N-terminal region consists of β-strands, while the C-terminal region is composed of α-helices (Lecointre2017Dimerization).

PRAG1 features a unique dimerization domain formed by N- and C-terminal extensions, which regulate its self-association and interaction with other proteins, such as the tyrosine kinase CSK (Lecointre2017Dimerization). This dimerization is crucial for its role in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, despite its lack of intrinsic kinase activity (Lecointre2017Dimerization). The protein also contains an EPIYA motif, which is a site for tyrosine phosphorylation by CSK, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances cell motility (Senda2016C‐terminal).

## Function
PRAG1, also known as PEAK1-related kinase-activating pseudokinase 1, plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those regulating kinase activity and GTPase signaling. Although it lacks catalytic activity, PRAG1 is involved in assembling heteromeric complexes with PEAK1 and sequestering the Src family inhibitory kinase Csk in the cytoplasm, which enhances Src activation (Jacobsen2017The). PRAG1 also promotes Rho GTPase activity, a process enhanced by the binding of the GTPase Rnd2 to the PRAG1 pseudokinase domain, indicating its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways crucial for various cellular functions (Jacobsen2017The).

In healthy human cells, PRAG1, through its encoded protein Pragmin, interacts with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) to regulate cell motility and morphology. This interaction involves specific tyrosine residues on Pragmin, particularly Y391, which are phosphorylated by Csk, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances Csk's kinase activity. This complex formation leads to significant changes in cell morphology, such as cell elongation, and increases cell motility (Senda2016C‐terminal). Pragmin's role in regulating cell shape and movement through its interaction with Csk suggests its potential influence on processes like tissue development and repair (Senda2016C‐terminal).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PRAG1, also known as PEAK1-related kinase-activating pseudokinase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) through a tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA motif, enhancing Csk's kinase activity. This interaction creates a positive feedback loop that promotes cell motility and morphological changes, such as cell elongation (Senda2016C‐terminal). PRAG1 is also known to form heteromeric complexes with PEAK1/SgK169 and sequesters Csk in the cytoplasm, which potentiates Src activation (Jacobsen2017The).

PRAG1 interacts with the Rnd2 GTPase, stimulating RhoA activity, which is crucial for regulating neurite outgrowth. This interaction is GTP-dependent and highlights PRAG1's role as an effector in the Rnd2 signaling pathway (Tanaka2006Pragmin). Additionally, PRAG1 dimerization is essential for its association with tyrosine kinases, such as CSK, and subsequent catalytic activation. This dimerization enhances CSK activity, although it is not necessary for CSK binding (Lecointre2017Dimerization). These interactions underscore PRAG1's role in modulating kinase activity and influencing cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics.
