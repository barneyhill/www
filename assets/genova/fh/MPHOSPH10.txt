# MPHOSPH10

## Overview
MPHOSPH10 is a gene that encodes the M-phase phosphoprotein 10, a crucial component involved in ribosome biogenesis. The protein is categorized as a phosphoprotein and plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is essential for pre-rRNA processing. MPHOSPH10 interacts with several proteins, including UTP18, UTP21, and NOL11, facilitating the proper assembly of the SSU processome and its association with U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (Venit2020Transcriptional). In addition to its fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis, MPHOSPH10 has been identified as a key node in the protein-protein interaction network related to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), highlighting its potential significance in cancer prognosis (Yuan2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MPHOSPH10 (M-phase phosphoprotein 10) is involved in ribosome biogenesis and is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome. It interacts with proteins such as UTP18, UTP21, and NOL11, which are essential for pre-rRNA processing. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the SSU processome, which is associated with the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (Venit2020Transcriptional).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), MPHOSPH10 has been identified as a key node in the protein-protein interaction network related to the prognostic signature of LUAD. It was found to have higher node degrees in subnet 4 of the PPI network, indicating its significant role in the network's structure and function (Yuan2023Identification). MPHOSPH10 is one of the 15 core proteins identified in the PPI network analysis, suggesting its importance in LUAD prognosis (Yuan2023Identification).

MPHOSPH10 is also involved in the cleavage of ribosomal RNA, as highlighted in studies examining the effects of cell-penetrating peptides on gene expression. This involvement underscores its role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular response to external stimuli (Venit2020Transcriptional).
