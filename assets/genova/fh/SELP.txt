# SELP

## Overview
The SELP gene encodes the protein selectin P, a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory response. Selectin P is a member of the C-type lectin family and is primarily expressed on activated endothelial cells and platelets. It facilitates the initial interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium, a critical step in leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation or injury. The protein is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and alpha granules in platelets, and is rapidly translocated to the cell surface upon activation. Selectin P interacts with its ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), on leukocytes, which is essential for leukocyte rolling and recruitment to inflamed tissues. Beyond its role in inflammation, selectin P is implicated in various pathological processes, including atherosclerosis and cancer metastasis, by mediating cellular adhesion and modulating immune responses (Yeini2021Pselectin; HerreraMaya2020The; Pethaperumal2022PSelectin).

## Structure
The SELP gene encodes P-selectin, a cell adhesion molecule involved in the inflammatory response. P-selectin is a carbohydrate-binding protein belonging to the C-type lectin family. Its structure includes an N-terminal lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and a series of complement control protein modules or short consensus repeats (SCR) domains. It also contains a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (Ushiyama1993Structural; Unknownauthors2007Adhesion).

The primary structure of P-selectin consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, with specific domains such as the lectin domain and EGF-like domain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by disulfide bonds, with the lectin domain requiring calcium for function (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion).

P-selectin undergoes post-translational modifications, including extensive N-glycosylation, which is crucial for its function (Ushiyama1993Structural). Splice variant isoforms, such as the alternatively spliced P-selectin (asPS), contribute to its functional diversity by lacking certain domains like the transmembrane domain (Ushiyama1993Structural).

## Function
P-selectin (SELP) is a cell adhesion molecule primarily expressed on activated endothelial cells and platelets. In healthy human cells, it plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response by mediating the initial interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium, facilitating leukocyte rolling, a key step in their migration to sites of inflammation or injury (HerreraMaya2020The). P-selectin is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and alpha granules in platelets, and is rapidly translocated to the cell surface upon activation (Sun2016Soluble).

P-selectin binds to its ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), on leukocytes, which is essential for the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes to areas of inflammation (HerreraMaya2020The). This interaction is also involved in the early formation of atherosclerotic plaque by promoting the adhesion and rolling of monocytes to the vascular wall (HerreraMaya2020The). In addition to its role in inflammation, P-selectin is involved in platelet-mediated protection against stress-induced gastrointestinal injuries, where it facilitates cellular interactions and the release of growth factors that aid in tissue repair and cell survival (Pethaperumal2022PSelectin). Soluble P-selectin also plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell mobilization by disrupting interactions between stem cells and stromal cells in the bone marrow, facilitating their movement into circulation (Wang2023Plateletderived).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SELP, or selectin P, is a cell adhesion molecule that primarily interacts with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes. This interaction is crucial for mediating the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium, a key step in the inflammatory response and immune cell recruitment. In the context of glioblastoma (GB), SELP-PSGL-1 interactions play a significant role in modulating the immune environment, influencing the immunophenotype of microglia and macrophages. SELP binding to PSGL-1 enhances the immunosuppressive activity of these cells, promoting tumor progression by reducing pro-inflammatory markers and increasing immunosuppressive markers (Yeini2021Pselectin).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), SELP interacts with CD24, a ligand overexpressed in these cancer cells. This interaction facilitates the adhesion of HGSOC cells to mesothelial cells, a critical step in cancer metastasis. The presence of alternatively-activated macrophages (AAMs) further enhances this adhesion by upregulating SELP expression on mesothelial cells, mediated by factors such as MIP-1b (Carroll2018AlternativelyActivated). These interactions highlight SELP's role in both promoting tumor progression and modulating immune responses in different cancer contexts.
