# GPR148

## Overview
GPR148 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 148, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which are integral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, although its precise physiological role remains largely undefined due to its classification as an orphan receptor, meaning its endogenous ligand has not been identified (Atanes2021Obesityinduced; Dharmadhikari2012Small). Despite this, GPR148 is thought to participate in neurological processes, potentially influencing brain function. The receptor's inefficient coupling to G proteins, possibly due to retention in the biosynthetic pathway, suggests a unique regulatory mechanism within cellular signaling (Lu2024Constitutive). Clinically, alterations in the GPR148 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders, highlighting its potential significance in human health (Gimelli2013Recurrent; Dharmadhikari2012Small).

## Function
The GPR148 gene encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) protein, which is primarily expressed in the brain and testes (Gimelli2013Recurrent; Dharmadhikari2012Small). GPCRs are integral membrane proteins characterized by seven transmembrane domains, an extracellular N terminus, and an intracellular C terminus. They play a crucial role in transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses through the activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, known as G-proteins (Dharmadhikari2012Small).

The specific function of GPR148 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as it is classified as an orphan receptor, meaning its endogenous ligand has not been identified (Atanes2021Obesityinduced). However, it is suggested that GPR148, like other GPCRs, may be involved in signal transduction processes in the brain, potentially influencing neurological functions (Dharmadhikari2012Small). Studies have indicated that GPR148 may not efficiently couple to G proteins due to inefficient trafficking to the plasma membrane, as evidenced by higher bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to the endoplasmic reticulum marker than to the plasma membrane marker (Lu2024Constitutive). This suggests that GPR148 may be retained in the biosynthetic pathway, affecting its functional role in signal transduction.

## Clinical Significance
The GPR148 gene, located in the 2q21.1 region, has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders. Studies have identified small rare recurrent deletions in this region, which include the GPR148 gene, in individuals with developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and other neurobehavioral abnormalities (Dharmadhikari2012Small). These deletions are often formed through non-allelic homologous recombination and are considered pathogenic for the mentioned conditions (Dharmadhikari2012Small).

In a specific case, a 4-year-old boy with a 469 kb deletion in the 2q21.1 region, which includes GPR148, exhibited symptoms such as psychomotor delay, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. This deletion was inherited from his father, who also had a history of delayed psychomotor development and bipolar disorder (Gimelli2013Recurrent). The study suggests that GPR148, along with other genes in the deleted region, may contribute to these neurological phenotypes, although specific diseases directly associated with GPR148 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Gimelli2013Recurrent).
