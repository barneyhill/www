# SPMIP8

## Overview
SPMIP8 is a gene that encodes the sperm microtubule inner protein 8, a crucial component involved in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. The protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a significant role in the organization and stabilization of microtubules within the sperm flagellum. This structural role is essential for proper sperm motility, which is critical for male fertility. Mutations or dysregulation of SPMIP8 have been implicated in various reproductive disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in the context of male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
