# RHBDF2

## Overview
RHBDF2 is a gene that encodes the protein rhomboid 5 homolog 2, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by a seven helical transmembrane structure and plays a crucial role in the trafficking and maturation of EGFR ligands, such as amphiregulin (AREG), which are essential for cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation (Hosur2018RHBDF2Regulated; Burzenski2021Inactive). Although RHBDF2 lacks catalytic activity, it is integral to the maturation and function of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-converting enzyme (TACE), influencing the shedding of EGFR ligands and TNFα (Burzenski2021Inactive; Adrain2012New). Mutations in RHBDF2 are linked to clinical conditions such as tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), underscoring its significance in both oncogenic and inflammatory pathways (Blaydon2012RHBDF2; Geesala2019Loss).

## Structure
The RHBDF2 protein is characterized by a seven helical transmembrane structure with an extended intracellular N terminus. It contains a highly conserved loop region known as the iRhom homology domain (IRHD), located between the first and second transmembrane domains (Tonin2012Chromosome). The protein's core structure includes six transmembrane helices, with an additional transmembrane segment, forming a dormant peptidase domain. This domain is crucial for the secretion of amphiregulin (AREG), which leads to a hyperactive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phenotype (Burzenski2021Inactive). 

The N-terminal domain of RHBDF2 is essential for TNFα secretion, interacting with 14-3-3 proteins and forming a complex with FRMD8 and ADAM17 (Burzenski2021Inactive). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at the N-terminus, which is necessary for TNFα release (Burzenski2021Inactive). 

Mutations in the transmembrane domains, such as the sinecure mutation in the first TMD, affect the protein's function by reducing mature ADAM17 levels and impeding its transport to the cell surface (Li2017Structural). The RHBDF2 protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its regulatory roles in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
The RHBDF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, RHBDF2 is involved in the trafficking and maturation of EGFR ligands, such as amphiregulin (AREG), which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Hosur2018RHBDF2Regulated; Blaydon2012RHBDF2). RHBDF2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the exit and maturation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-converting enzyme (TACE), allowing it to reach the cell surface and cleave its substrates, including TNF (Adrain2012New).

RHBDF2 also interacts with ADAM17, a metalloprotease involved in the shedding of EGFR ligands and TNFα, although its exact role in ADAM17 maturation and trafficking is debated (Burzenski2021Inactive). The protein's regulatory function is highlighted by its involvement in EGFR signaling, which is crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions across various tissues (Burzenski2021Inactive). Despite lacking catalytic activity, RHBDF2 retains regulatory roles, influencing processes such as EGFR transactivation pathways and inflammatory signaling (Adrain2012New; Christova2013Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RHBDF2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. This condition is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and a significantly increased risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The disease is caused by gain-of-function mutations in RHBDF2, which lead to constitutive activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. This hyperactivation is primarily due to enhanced secretion of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG), resulting in rapid wound healing and epithelial tumorigenesis (Hosur2018RHBDF2Regulated; Blaydon2012RHBDF2).

In addition to TOC, RHBDF2 has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in the context of colitis. Loss-of-function mutations in RHBDF2, especially when combined with IL10 deficiency, lead to early-onset spontaneous colitis in murine models. This condition is characterized by severe intestinal inflammation, dysbiotic gut microbiota, and heightened Th1 immune responses, suggesting that RHBDF2 plays a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Geesala2019Loss). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both epithelial cancers and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
RHBDF2, also known as rhomboid 5 homolog 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with ADAM17, a metalloproteinase responsible for the ectodomain shedding of various membrane-anchored ligands, including those involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The transmembrane domains (TMD) of RHBDF2 and ADAM17 are crucial for their interaction, which regulates ADAM17-dependent shedding events (Li2017Structural). Specific amino acid residues in the TMD of ADAM17 are necessary for RHBDF2-dependent proteolysis, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Li2017Structural).

RHBDF2 also plays a role in inflammatory signaling by facilitating the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The N-terminal domain of RHBDF2 is essential for this process, and its phosphorylation is necessary for TNFα secretion. RHBDF2 forms a complex with ADAM17 and FRMD8, which is crucial for TNFα release (Burzenski2021Inactive). Additionally, RHBDF2 interacts with iRhom2, a protein encoded by the same gene, which is involved in immune responses and the regulation of TNFα secretion (Geesala2019Novel). These interactions underscore RHBDF2's role in modulating both growth factor signaling and immune responses.
