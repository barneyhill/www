# NUP153

## Overview
NUP153 is a gene that encodes the nucleoporin 153 protein, a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is involved in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Nucleoporin 153 is categorized as a nucleoporin protein and is integral to the structural and functional dynamics of the NPC. It is characterized by a tripartite structure, including an N-terminal domain, a central zinc finger domain, and a C-terminal domain rich in FG repeats, which facilitate interactions with nuclear transport receptors (Fahrenkrog2002Domainspecific). The protein plays a pivotal role in the export of RNA and proteins from the nucleus, interacting with various nuclear transport factors and maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope (Bastos1996Targeting; AlHaboubi2011Distinct). NUP153's interactions and modifications are crucial for its function, and alterations in its expression have been linked to several diseases, including muscular dystrophies, colorectal cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (Colussi2024Nucleoporin; Wu2019NUP153; Nanni2016The).

## Structure
NUP153 is a nucleoporin protein that is a key component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The protein is characterized by a tripartite structure consisting of an N-terminal domain, a central zinc finger domain, and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain contains a nuclear localization signal and is located at the nuclear ring of the NPC (Fahrenkrog2002Domainspecific). The central zinc finger domain, which interacts with RanGDP and binds DNA, is situated at the distal ring of the NPC (Schrader2008The; Fahrenkrog2002Domainspecific). The C-terminal domain is rich in FG repeats, which are common in nucleoporins and facilitate binding to nuclear transport receptors. This domain is highly mobile, extending from the nuclear ring to the distal ring and even to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC (Fahrenkrog2002Domainspecific).

NUP153 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its function and interactions (Schrader2008The). The protein does not form oligomers and exhibits an elongated conformation, behaving like a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 1 MDa (Fahrenkrog2002Domainspecific). The zinc finger domain, specifically the ZnF2 motif, is crucial for its interaction with Ran, forming a bipartite interface primarily involving hydrophobic interactions (Schrader2008The).

## Function
NUP153 is a nucleoporin protein that plays a critical role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, particularly in the export of RNA and proteins from the nucleus. It is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and is primarily located at the nuclear basket, where it facilitates the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Bastos1996Targeting; Ullman1999The). NUP153 is involved in the export of various RNA types, including U1 snRNA, 5S rRNA, spliced mRNA, and intronless mRNA, but not tRNA. It also plays a role in the export of NES proteins and NES-mediated RNA (Ullman1999The).

The protein interacts with export receptors such as exportin 1, and its RNA-binding properties are crucial for its role in RNA export (Ullman1999The). NUP153 also interacts with nuclear transport factors like importin beta and Ran-GTP, suggesting a role in nuclear import processes (Shah1998Major; Hase2003Direct). Additionally, NUP153 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope through its interactions with nuclear lamins (AlHaboubi2011Distinct). These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the NPC and the overall cellular transport mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the NUP153 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of muscular dystrophies, NUP153 is overexpressed in dystrophic cardiomyocytes, such as those affected by Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. This overexpression is linked to altered localization and increased acetylation of NUP153, potentially affecting cardiac gene expression and contributing to cardiac remodeling and dysfunction (Nanni2016The). 

In colorectal cancer, NUP153 is expressed at higher levels in normal colon tissues compared to cancerous tissues. Elevated NUP153 expression is associated with better prognosis, as it suppresses cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Wu2019NUP153).

NUP153 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Reduced levels of NUP153 in neural stem cells from Alzheimer's models are associated with impaired neurogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overexpression of NUP153 in these models can ameliorate neurogenesis defects and improve cognitive performance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Colussi2024Nucleoporin).

Mutations affecting NUP153's interactions with nuclear lamins have been linked to laminopathies, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and familial partial lipodystrophy. These mutations can disrupt NUP153's localization and binding, contributing to disease pathology (AlHaboubi2011Distinct).

## Interactions
NUP153 is a nucleoporin that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in nuclear pore complex (NPC) functions. It interacts with the SUMO proteases SENP1 and SENP2 at two distinct sites: the C-terminal domain, which is critical for both SENP1 and SENP2 interactions, and a newly identified site in the N-terminal domain. These interactions are involved in the regulation of sumoylation processes, particularly under stress conditions like heat shock (Chow2012Two).

NUP153 also binds to nuclear lamins, specifically A- and B-type lamins, through its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. This interaction is significant for maintaining nuclear structure and is implicated in lamin-associated diseases (AlHaboubi2011Distinct).

Additionally, NUP153 interacts with the Tpr protein, anchoring it to the NPC. This interaction is essential for the localization of Tpr and involves specific segments of NUP153 (Hase2003Direct).

NUP153 also associates with RNA, particularly poly(G) homoribopolymers, suggesting a role in RNA export processes. It interacts with various export receptors, including exportin 1, facilitating the export of several RNA classes (Ullman1999The).
