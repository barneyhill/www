# PDZRN3

## Overview
PDZRN3 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ domain containing ring finger 3, which is a multifunctional scaffold protein characterized by the presence of a RING-finger motif and multiple PDZ domains. The RING-finger motif is typically associated with ubiquitin ligase activity, suggesting a role in protein ubiquitination processes, while the PDZ domains facilitate protein-protein interactions (Sewduth2017PDZRN3; Andreazzoli2012Kidins220ARMS). PDZ domain containing ring finger 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and the regulation of endothelial cell junction integrity and vascular permeability (Sewduth2017PDZRN3). It interacts with several proteins, such as Kidins220/ARMS in neural tissues and polarity complexes in endothelial cells, influencing processes like neurogenesis and vascular morphogenesis (Sewduth2017PDZRN3; Andreazzoli2012Kidins220ARMS). The protein's ability to modulate pathways such as Wnt/planar cell polarity and its involvement in diseases like endometrial carcinoma and heart failure highlight its clinical significance (Li2022Lower; Pernot2022Decrease).

## Structure
PDZRN3 is a scaffold protein characterized by the presence of a RING-finger motif and multiple PDZ domains. The RING-finger motif is typically associated with ubiquitin ligase activity, suggesting a role in protein ubiquitination processes (Sewduth2017PDZRN3; Andreazzoli2012Kidins220ARMS). The PDZ domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, binding to specific motifs at the carboxyl termini of target proteins (Marunaka2017The). PDZRN3 contains a RING finger domain at the amino terminus and two to four PDZ domains at the carboxyl terminus, which are structural motifs that facilitate these interactions (Marunaka2017The).

The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion, and is implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell junction integrity and vascular permeability (Sewduth2017PDZRN3). PDZRN3 interacts with polarity complexes, such as those containing PAR3, PKCζ, and MUPP1, and targets MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation, affecting the localization of PKCζ and PAR3 at intercellular junctions (Sewduth2017PDZRN3). The protein's interaction with Kidins220/ARMS through its first PDZ domain is significant in neural tissues, particularly during neurogenesis (Andreazzoli2012Kidins220ARMS). The molecular structure of PDZRN3, including its domains and motifs, supports its role in these diverse cellular functions.

## Function
PDZRN3 is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of endothelial cell function and osteoblast differentiation. In endothelial cells, PDZRN3 plays a crucial role in maintaining cell junction integrity and vascular permeability. It interacts with a polarity complex that includes atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) and partitioning defective 3 (PAR3), which is essential for the stability of intercellular junctions. Overexpression of PDZRN3 disrupts junction organization, increasing vascular permeability, while its depletion enhances junction stability (Sewduth2017PDZRN3).

PDZRN3 is also involved in the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, which is critical for endothelial cell migration and vascular morphogenesis. It facilitates the ubiquitinylation of Dishevelled 3 (Dvl3), a process necessary for the internalization and activation of the Frizzled/Dvl3 complex, directing signaling components towards the PCP pathway and away from the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Sewduth2014The).

In osteoblast differentiation, PDZRN3 acts as a negative regulator by inhibiting Wnt-β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for this process. Its depletion enhances Wnt signaling, leading to increased alkaline phosphatase activity and Runx2 expression, markers of osteoblast differentiation (Honda2010PDZRN3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDZRN3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably endometrial carcinoma (EC) and heart failure. In endometrial carcinoma, lower expression of PDZRN3 is associated with increased metastasis and proliferation of cancer cells. This is primarily due to the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which PDZRN3 normally helps to regulate. The study suggests that PDZRN3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing EC due to its role in tumor progression (Li2022Lower).

In the context of heart disease, PDZRN3 expression is crucial for heart maturation. A decrease in PDZRN3 is necessary for proper heart development and protects against heart failure. Overexpression of PDZRN3 in cardiomyocytes during early life can lead to severe eccentric hypertrophy and heart failure, while its deletion in mouse models shows protective effects against heart function degradation under stress. PDZRN3 influences the expression of proteins involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling, which are important for cardiomyocyte organization and polarization (Pernot2022Decrease).

PDZRN3 also plays a role in vascular permeability and stability. Overexpression in endothelial cells can lead to increased vascular permeability and embryonic lethality due to hemorrhages, while its depletion can reduce permeability during ischemic stroke, suggesting its involvement in maintaining endothelial barrier function (Sewduth2017PDZRN3).

## Interactions
PDZRN3, also known as LNX3, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Dishevelled 3 (Dvl3) through its PDZ-binding domain, which is crucial for the ubiquitinylation of Dvl3. This interaction is essential for the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, facilitating the endocytosis of the Frizzled/Dvl3 complex, a process activated by Wnt5a signaling (Sewduth2014The).

In renal tubule epithelial cells, PDZRN3 interacts with Claudin-16 (CLDN16) through its carboxyl cytoplasmic region. This interaction is important for the localization and function of CLDN16, which plays a role in Mg2+ reabsorption (Marunaka2017The).

PDZRN3 also interacts with the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1) via its PDZ motif. Although PDZRN3 does not alter SMCT1's transport activity, it competes with PDZK1 for binding to SMCT1, potentially modulating its function (Otsuka2019Sodiumcoupled).

In endothelial cells, PDZRN3 is part of a polarity complex that includes PKCζ and PAR3. It targets MUPP1 for polyubiquitination, leading to the dissociation of tight junction complexes and increased vascular permeability (Sewduth2017PDZRN3).
