# AP1S1

## Overview
The AP1S1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma 1 (σ1A), a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1). This protein complex is integral to intracellular protein trafficking, particularly in the sorting of transmembrane proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, as well as in polarized sorting within epithelial cells and neurons. The AP-1 complex, which is clathrin-associated, recognizes specific sorting signals, facilitating the proper localization of proteins to cellular membranes (Martinelli2014AP1S1; Rackova2024Revising). Mutations in the AP1S1 gene are linked to MEDNIK syndrome, a disorder characterized by a range of symptoms due to impaired protein trafficking and copper metabolism (Martinelli2014AP1S1; Rackova2024Revising). The σ1A subunit's role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and copper homeostasis underscores its importance in cellular function and human health (Martinelli2014AP1S1; Klee2020AP1S1).

## Function
The AP1S1 gene encodes the σ1A subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is crucial for intracellular protein trafficking. This complex is involved in the sorting of transmembrane proteins between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, as well as in polarized sorting to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells and the somatodendritic domain of neurons (Rackova2024Revising). The AP-1 complex is a clathrin-associated complex that recognizes specific sorting signals, such as tyrosine-based YXXØ motifs and dileucine-based [DE]XXXL[LI] motifs, facilitating the proper localization of proteins to cellular membranes (Martinelli2014AP1S1; Rackova2024Revising).

In healthy human cells, AP1S1 plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers by ensuring the correct localization of tight-junction proteins like ZO-1 and claudin 3, which are essential for maintaining transepithelial electrical resistance and controlling permeability (Klee2020AP1S1). The AP1S1 gene is also involved in the proper functioning of copper transporters, such as ATP7A and ATP7B, which are crucial for copper homeostasis and the metallation of cuproenzymes (Martinelli2014AP1S1). The AP-1 complex's role in these processes is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the proper functioning of copper-dependent enzymes (Rackova2024Revising).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP1S1 gene are associated with MEDNIK syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma. This syndrome results from mutations that lead to dysfunctional intracellular protein trafficking due to impaired AP-1 complex function (Martinelli2014AP1S1; Rackova2024Revising). The AP1S1 gene mutations include nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, which cause truncated σ1A proteins and AP-1 dysfunction (Rackova2024Revising).

Recent studies have identified missense variants, such as c.269 T > C and c.346G > A, which are linked to severe enteropathy and congenital diarrhea, suggesting a non-syndromic form of the disease. However, the c.269 T > C variant can also cause full MEDNIK syndrome, indicating a broader spectrum of clinical manifestations (Klee2020AP1S1; Rackova2024Revising). These mutations disrupt the assembly and function of the AP-1 complex, affecting protein trafficking and leading to various clinical symptoms (Rackova2024Revising).

MEDNIK syndrome is also associated with defective copper metabolism, as the AP1S1 gene plays a role in the trafficking of copper ATPases, leading to symptoms similar to Menkes and Wilson's diseases (Martinelli2014AP1S1; Martinelli2013MEDNIK).

## Interactions
The AP1S1 gene encodes the σ1A subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is crucial for intracellular protein trafficking. The σ1A subunit interacts with the γ subunit to form a hemicomplex that recognizes dileucine-based sorting motifs, such as [DE]XXXL[LI], in the cytosolic tails of transmembrane proteins. This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of the AP-1 complex, facilitating the sorting of proteins between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes (Janvier2003Recognition; Rackova2024Revising).

A missense variant in the AP1S1 gene, c.269 T > C, resulting in the L90P substitution, disrupts the interaction between σ1A and the γ1 subunit, impairing the assembly of the AP-1 complex. This variant reduces the assembly of σ1A with the γ1 subunit to 0-13% compared to the wild-type, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Rackova2024Revising). The L90P variant also affects the recognition of dileucine-based sorting motifs, which are crucial for the interaction of the AP-1 complex with the cytosolic tails of lysosomal and melanosomal membrane proteins (Rackova2024Revising). These disruptions highlight the critical role of σ1A in protein sorting and cellular localization processes.
