# RAD9A

## Overview
RAD9A is a gene that encodes the RAD9 checkpoint clamp component A, a protein integral to the DNA damage response in human cells. This protein is a part of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex, which functions as a DNA damage sensor and is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by facilitating DNA repair and activating checkpoint signaling pathways. RAD9A is characterized by its high DNA binding affinity, particularly through its N-terminal domain, and is rich in basic residues that are essential for its interaction with the DNA phosphate backbone (Hwang2022DNA). The protein's structure includes two globular domains and an extended C-terminal tail, which, although not required for DNA binding, plays a role in nuclear localization and interactions with other proteins involved in DNA repair (Hwang2022DNA; Takeishi2015Intramolecular). RAD9A's involvement in the DNA damage response underscores its significance in cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context (Weis2011Reduced; Lieberman2011The).

## Structure
The RAD9A protein is a component of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex, which plays a critical role in the DNA damage response. The protein consists of 391 amino acids, with a notable extended C-terminal tail comprising residues 267-391. This C-terminal tail is not required for DNA binding and may negatively affect the DNA binding of the 9-1-1 core ring (Hwang2022DNA). The core of RAD9A is divided into two globular domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-133) and the C-terminal domain (residues 134-266), each containing two α-helices. The N-terminal domain exhibits a higher DNA binding affinity compared to the C-terminal domain (Hwang2022DNA).

The RAD9A protein is rich in basic residues such as lysine and arginine, which are crucial for its interaction with the DNA phosphate backbone. Specific residues, including K11, K15, R22, K78, K220, and R223, are important for DNA binding, and mutations in these residues reduce DNA binding affinity (Hwang2022DNA). The protein also contains a small loop (residues 160-163) that is critical for DNA binding, despite not containing basic residues (Hwang2022DNA).

RAD9A forms a heterotrimeric complex with RAD1 and HUS1, indicating its quaternary structure. This complex is structurally similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and interacts with the DNA phosphate backbone, facilitating proper loading at DNA damage sites (Hwang2022DNA). The C-terminal tail of RAD9A contains a nuclear localization signal and is involved in interactions with other factors like replication protein A and TopBP1 (Takeishi2015Intramolecular).

## Function
RAD9A is a critical component of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex, which functions as a DNA damage sensor and plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response (DDR) in human cells. This complex is essential for maintaining genomic stability by facilitating DNA repair and activating checkpoint signaling pathways that coordinate cell cycle progression with DNA repair processes (Wu2005Interaction; Hwang2022DNA). RAD9A, in particular, exhibits the highest DNA binding affinity among the 9-1-1 subunits, with its N-terminal domain being especially crucial for this interaction (Hwang2022DNA).

In healthy human cells, RAD9A is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in processes such as DNA replication and repair. It interacts with replication protein A (RPA) to facilitate the recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex to sites of DNA damage, thereby playing a significant role in the cellular response to genotoxic stress (Wu2005Interaction). RAD9A's ability to bind DNA independently suggests it may also regulate gene expression, contributing to its role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing genomic instability (Hwang2022DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RAD9A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer development. RAD9A is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, and its dysfunction can lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. Overexpression of RAD9A has been observed in various tumors, including breast, lung, thyroid, and prostate cancers, suggesting its potential role as an oncogene in these contexts (Weis2011Reduced; Lieberman2011The). In prostate cancer, RAD9A acts as an oncogene, with high levels correlating with increased tumor size and cancer stage (Lieberman2011The).

Conversely, reduced expression of RAD9A is linked to increased sensitivity to DNA damage and genomic instability, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor. This dual role suggests that RAD9A's function in cancer may depend on the cellular context and tissue environment (Weis2011Reduced). In mouse models, Rad9A deficiency leads to embryonic lethality and increased susceptibility to genotoxin-induced tumors, highlighting its importance in normal development and tumor suppression (Hopkins2004Deletion; Weis2011Reduced).

Additionally, specific mutations in RAD9A, such as those affecting its DNA binding ability, can impair DNA damage response signaling, further contributing to genomic instability and potentially impacting cancer susceptibility (Hwang2022DNA).

## Interactions
RAD9A, a component of the 9-1-1 complex, plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control. It interacts with other proteins such as RAD1 and HUS1 to form the 9-1-1 complex, which is structurally similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and functions as a damage sensor (Sohn2009Crystal). RAD9A has a high DNA binding affinity, particularly through its N-terminal globular domain, and specific basic residues are critical for its interaction with DNA. These interactions are essential for the 9-1-1 complex's loading onto DNA and its role in DNA repair and checkpoint activation (Hwang2022DNA).

RAD9A also interacts with replication protein A (RPA), specifically with the RPA70 and RPA32 subunits. This interaction is enhanced by DNA damage and is crucial for the recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex to DNA damage sites, facilitating checkpoint signaling (Wu2005Interaction). Additionally, RAD9A interacts with mismatch repair proteins such as hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6, indicating its involvement in the mismatch repair pathway and response to DNA damage (Bai2010Interaction). These interactions highlight RAD9A's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability.
