# KRTAP13-4

## Overview
KRTAP13-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 13-4, a member of the KAP13 family. This family of proteins is characterized by a high serine content and a significant presence of cysteine, glycine, and tyrosine, which contribute to their structural and functional properties (Rogers2006Human). The keratin-associated protein 13-4 plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of hair and nails by interacting with keratin proteins. This interaction is facilitated by the protein's tertiary structure, which is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature among keratin-associated proteins due to their cysteine-rich composition (Rogers2006Human). The structural features of KRTAP13-4, including its potential post-translational modifications, are essential for its function in the integumentary system.

## Structure
The KRTAP13-4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the KAP13 family, which consists of four gene members: KRTAP13-1 to KRTAP13-4. The proteins in this family range from 17.8 to 18.2 kDa in size and are characterized by a high serine content (20.6-23.4 mol %) compared to cysteine (12.0-12.8 mol %), with significant amounts of glycine and tyrosine (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP13-4 includes sequences rich in these amino acids, contributing to its functional properties.

The secondary structure of KRTAP13-4 likely includes both pentameric and decameric single cysteine repeat structures, which are common in the KAP13 family. These repeat structures are more pronounced in the single known mouse protein, suggesting a similar pattern in humans (Rogers2006Human).

The tertiary structure of KRTAP13-4 is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature in keratin-associated proteins due to their high cysteine content. These bonds contribute to the protein's stability and its ability to interact with keratin proteins, forming the quaternary structure essential for hair and nail formation (Rogers2006Human). Specific post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also occur, although detailed information on these modifications for KRTAP13-4 is not provided in the available context.
