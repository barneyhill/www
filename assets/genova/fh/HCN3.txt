# HCN3

## Overview
HCN3 is a gene that encodes the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 3, a member of the HCN channel family. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the electrical activity of cardiac and neuronal cells by generating the I_h current, a mixed Na^+/K^+ current activated by hyperpolarization. The HCN3 protein is characterized by its slow activation kinetics and weak sensitivity to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) compared to other HCN isoforms, contributing to its unique functional properties (WahlSchott2008HCN). Structurally, HCN3 is part of the voltage-gated pore loop channel superfamily, featuring a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) that modulates its activity in response to cAMP (He2014Neurophysiology). HCN3 channels are involved in regulating the action potential waveform in cardiac tissues and modulating neuronal excitability, with implications for conditions such as epilepsy and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) (Fenske2011HCN3; Kessi2022The).

## Structure
The HCN3 protein is part of the voltage-gated pore loop channel superfamily and is composed of four pore-forming subunits, each with six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) (He2014Neurophysiology). The S4 segment acts as a voltage sensor due to its positively charged residues, while the region between S5 and S6 forms the ion selectivity filter, characterized by the GYG motif (WahlSchott2008HCN). The C-terminal domain includes a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) and a C-linker, which together form the 'cAMP-sensing domain' (CSD) (He2014Neurophysiology). This domain is crucial for cAMP-induced shifts in voltage-dependent activation (WahlSchott2008HCN).

HCN3 channels typically form homomeric tetramers, but they can also assemble into heteromeric tetramers with other HCN subunits, contributing to functional diversity (He2014Neurophysiology). The protein's structure allows for mixed Na+ and K+ permeability and is modulated by cAMP, although the effect of cAMP on HCN3 varies between species (Jackson2007Evolution). The structural features of HCN3, including the CNBD and C-linker, are shared with other HCN channels, contributing to their role in cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity (Baruscotti2010HCNrelated).

## Function
The HCN3 gene encodes a subunit of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, which are involved in generating the I_h current, a mixed Na^+/K^+ current activated by hyperpolarization. HCN3 channels are characterized by their slow activation kinetics and weak sensitivity to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) compared to other HCN isoforms (WahlSchott2008HCN). In the heart, HCN3 contributes to the ventricular action potential waveform by providing a depolarizing background current that regulates the ventricular resting potential and counteracts hyperpolarizing potassium currents during late repolarization (Fenske2011HCN3). This activity affects the action potential duration, particularly shortening it in epicardial myocytes (Fenske2011HCN3). HCN3 channels are constitutively open during the ventricular action potential, generating a depolarizing current that prolongs the action potential (Fenske2011HCN3).

In sensory neurons, HCN3 is expressed in all classes and contributes to the I_h current, which is important for neuronal excitability. The deletion of HCN3 increases the firing rate of medium-sized sensory neurons but does not significantly affect small neurons, indicating its role in modulating excitability (Lainez2019HCN3). Despite its involvement in neuronal excitability, HCN3 does not play a major role in pain processing (Lainez2019HCN3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HCN3 gene have been associated with epilepsy and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Specifically, non-synonymous variants such as p.K69R and p.P630L have been identified in humans, although their functional properties and clinical phenotypes are not well understood (Kessi2022The). HCN3 channelopathies are implicated in epilepsy, with pathogenic variants linked to diverse phenotypes, including unclassified epileptic syndromes (Kessi2022The). 

There is currently no animal model specifically for HCN3-related epilepsy, but studies on HCN3-deficient mice have shown compromised processing of contextual information, suggesting a potential role in neurological disorders (Kessi2022The). The drug ivabradine, which blocks HCN3 currents, has demonstrated anticonvulsant effects in animal models, indicating its potential as a treatment for certain types of seizures (Kessi2022The).

The regulation of neuronal excitability via HCN channels, including HCN3, depends on their neuroanatomical locations and distribution patterns. This suggests that HCN isoform-selective blockage might have different effects on seizure susceptibility due to their distinct biophysical features and anatomical expression (Kessi2022The).

## Interactions
HCN3, a member of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family, interacts with several proteins that influence its function and cellular localization. One significant interaction is with the auxiliary subunit TRIP8b, which binds to the C-terminal tail of HCN3. This interaction decreases the surface expression of HCN3 channels and increases their intracellular accumulation, suggesting a regulatory role in controlling channel density in the plasma membrane (Santoro2004Regulation). TRIP8b interacts with HCN3 at two distinct sites: the SNL sequence in the distal C-terminus, which affects channel trafficking, and the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD), which inhibits cAMP-dependent potentiation (Peters2022Regulation). TRIP8b preferentially binds to the cAMP-free CNBD, stabilizing the cAMP-unbound state and reducing the binding affinity for cAMP, thereby affecting the channel's response to cAMP (Peters2022Regulation).

HCN3 is also part of heteromeric complexes with other HCN subunits, although it does not form heteromers with HCN2 (Lewis2010The). These interactions contribute to the functional diversity of HCN channels in various tissues (He2014Neurophysiology).
