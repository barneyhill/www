# PLRG1

## Overview
PLRG1, or pleiotropic regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. The protein, also known as pleiotropic regulator 1, is characterized by its WD40 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for its function within the spliceosome and the NineTeen Complex (NTC) (Wang2021Crystal; Kleinridders2009PLRG1). Beyond its role in splicing, PLRG1 is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, particularly influencing the S phase and apoptosis suppression (Kleinridders2009PLRG1). It interacts with various proteins, including CDC5L and Prp19, to maintain genomic stability and is implicated in the DNA damage response (de2018Prp19Pso4). Alterations in PLRG1 expression or function are linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Stamper2008Neuronal; Choi2023Elevated).

## Structure
The PLRG1 protein is characterized by its WD40 domain, which forms a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure. This tertiary structure is crucial for its role in the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes (Wang2021Crystal). The WD40 repeats are motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's structural integrity and function within the spliceosome (Kleinridders2009PLRG1).

In the context of the NineTeen Complex (NTC), PLRG1 integrates into the core structure through its N-terminal domain, which is essential for its interaction with other spliceosomal components such as Prp19, CDC5L, and SPF27. These interactions are mediated by the U-box domains of Prp19, which are crucial for the assembly and activation of the NTC (de2018Prp19Pso4).

PLRG1 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it plays a role in the ubiquitination processes mediated by the Prp19 complex. This function is linked to its ability to facilitate the recruitment of the ATR-ATRIP kinase complex to sites of DNA damage (de2018Prp19Pso4). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functional dynamics within the cell (Kleinridders2009PLRG1).

## Function
The PLRG1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the spliceosome, a complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair. This protein forms a complex with Pso4/SNEV/Prp19 and CDC5L, which is essential for these processes (Kleinridders2009PLRG1). PLRG1 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the progression through the S phase, and in the suppression of apoptosis. In PLRG1-deficient cells, there is an increase in apoptosis and a failure to progress through the S phase, accompanied by enhanced p53 phosphorylation and stabilization, indicating an activated DNA damage response (Kleinridders2009PLRG1).

PLRG1 is also involved in maintaining genome stability, as its elevated levels are critical for the proliferation of tumor cells (Choi2023Elevated). In healthy cells, PLRG1 is crucial for normal cell cycle progression and preventing apoptosis, potentially through its interaction with p53 and response to DNA damage or replication stress (Kleinridders2009PLRG1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it serves as a scaffold to retain CDC5L, facilitating the assembly of spliceosomal components and ensuring proper cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Kleinridders2009PLRG1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PLRG1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. PLRG1 deficiency in mice leads to early embryonic lethality, indicating its critical role in development. Inactivation of PLRG1 in heart cells and neurons results in increased apoptosis, which is p53 dependent, and is associated with severe physiological consequences such as dilated cardiomyopathy and increased neuronal apoptosis (Kleinridders2009PLRG1). In zebrafish, PLRG1 mutations cause developmental defects, which can be partially rescued by inhibiting p53, suggesting a role in regulating p53-mediated pathways (Sun2019Systematic).

PLRG1 is also involved in DNA repair processes. Its interaction with the Werner helicase and the Prp19 complex suggests a role in maintaining genomic stability. Deficiencies in PLRG1 can lead to increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress and heightened p53 expression, which may contribute to neurodegeneration (Sorrells2012Ccdc94; de2018Prp19Pso4).

In cancer, PLRG1 expression is upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer, and its interaction with USP42 affects alternative splicing events that promote tumorigenesis. Increased PLRG1 expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes in lung cancer patients (Liu2021USP42). Additionally, PLRG1 downregulation is observed in Parkinson's Disease with Dementia, suggesting its involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Stamper2008Neuronal).

## Interactions
PLRG1 (pleiotropic regulator 1) is a key component of the spliceosome, interacting with several proteins to facilitate pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair. It forms a complex with CDC5L and Prp19, which is essential for pre-mRNA processing. The interaction between PLRG1 and CDC5L is crucial, as inhibiting this complex formation can block splicing (Kleinridders2009PLRG1). PLRG1 also interacts with the WRN protein, linking it to DNA metabolism and repair (Kleinridders2009PLRG1).

In PLRG1-deficient cells, CDC5L relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting that PLRG1 is necessary for retaining CDC5L in the nucleus and facilitating the assembly of the nuclear Prp19/CDC5L/PLRG1 complex (Kleinridders2009PLRG1). Despite this relocalization, there is no general impairment in pre-mRNA splicing, indicating that PLRG1's role may extend beyond splicing (Kleinridders2009PLRG1).

PLRG1 also interacts with hnRNP-M, influencing alternative splice site choice. This interaction is disrupted by heat shock, which inhibits transcription and splicing. The interaction is dependent on nascent pre-mRNA production, and a specific binding region in hnRNP-M is crucial for its interaction with CDC5L and PLRG1 (Llères2010Direct).
