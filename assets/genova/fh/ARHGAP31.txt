# ARHGAP31

## Overview
ARHGAP31 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase-activating protein 31, a member of the Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Rho family of GTPases, particularly Cdc42 and Rac1, which are integral to various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell morphology, and migration (Southgate2011GainofFunction; Santaniello2024Characterization). The ARHGAP31 protein is characterized by its RhoGAP domain, which facilitates the inactivation of GTPases through the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, and is further modulated by phosphorylation events (Southgate2011GainofFunction). Mutations in ARHGAP31 have been linked to Adams-Oliver syndrome, a genetic disorder marked by scalp and limb defects, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in developmental processes (Meester2018Elucidating; Southgate2011GainofFunction).

## Structure
The ARHGAP31 protein is a member of the Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) family, which plays a crucial role in regulating the Rho family of GTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1. These GTPases are essential for various cellular processes such as cell growth, protein trafficking, and actin cytoskeleton maintenance (Southgate2011GainofFunction; Santaniello2024Characterization). The ARHGAP31 protein contains a RhoGAP domain responsible for its GTPase-activating function, as well as proline-rich domains. It is also phosphorylated by GSK-3, which may influence its activity and interactions (Southgate2011GainofFunction).

The protein's structure includes a C-terminal domain that is essential for its auto-inhibition mechanism. Pathogenic variants in exon 12 of ARHGAP31 can introduce a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that loses significant portions of the C-terminal domain. This truncation affects the protein's ability to regulate Cdc42 and Rac1, leading to altered cell diffusion and migration (Santaniello2024Characterization). The ARHGAP31 protein predominantly localizes to the Golgi apparatus, where it regulates Cdc42 activity (Southgate2011GainofFunction). The protein's tertiary structure has been studied using AlphaFold, with significant structural deviations observed in certain variants compared to the wild type (Santaniello2024Characterization).

## Function
The ARHGAP31 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, which are part of the Rho family. These GTPases are involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cell morphology, and migration (Southgate2011GainofFunction). ARHGAP31 functions by facilitating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby inactivating Cdc42 and Rac1. This regulation is essential for maintaining proper cytoskeletal organization and cell motility, as well as controlling cell proliferation and migration (Southgate2011GainofFunction).

In healthy cells, ARHGAP31 is active at the Golgi apparatus and is involved in processes such as actin polymerization, cell spreading, and the formation of polarized lamellipodia, which are critical for directed cell migration (Southgate2011GainofFunction). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions between its C-terminal and N-terminal domains, which help maintain the RhoGAP domain in an inactive state until needed (Southgate2011GainofFunction). ARHGAP31 also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3b) activity, affecting the stability of β-catenin, a key player in cell differentiation and skin morphogenesis (Southgate2011GainofFunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene are associated with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by scalp defects and limb abnormalities. Specifically, pathogenic mutations in ARHGAP31 are often located within the terminal exon 12, leading to premature termination of the protein. These mutations result in a constitutively active protein that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism (Meester2018Elucidating; Santaniello2024Characterization). 

The gain-of-function mutations in ARHGAP31 are linked to syndromic cutis aplasia and limb anomalies, including aplasia cutis congenita and terminal transverse limb defects (Southgate2011GainofFunction). These mutations lead to truncated proteins that lack the C-terminal domain, exposing the RhoGAP catalytic site and causing constitutive activation of signaling pathways, which disrupts normal cellular processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration (Southgate2011GainofFunction).

In addition to AOS, ARHGAP31 mutations have been implicated in vascular development issues, as the gene plays a critical role in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Altered function of ARHGAP31 can lead to vascular defects, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in AOS (Caron2016CdGAPARHGAP31).

## Interactions
ARHGAP31, also known as CdGAP, interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity and subcellular localization. It is a negative regulator of the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, and its activity is modulated through interactions with the 14-3-3β adaptor protein. This interaction occurs at phosphorylated serine residues in the C-terminal region of CdGAP, specifically at Ser1093 and Ser1163, which are phosphorylated by RSK. The binding of 14-3-3β sequesters CdGAP in the cytoplasm, inhibiting its GAP activity towards Rac1 and preventing its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Ben2018CdGAPARHGAP31).

CdGAP also interacts with the SH3D domain of the endocytic scaffolding protein intersectin, which inhibits its activity (Ben2018CdGAPARHGAP31). In the context of breast cancer, the interaction with 14-3-3β affects CdGAP's ability to repress the E-cadherin promoter and induce cell migration, potentially influencing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Ben2018CdGAPARHGAP31).

Mutations in CdGAP associated with Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS) result in the loss of these phospho-residues, affecting its regulation by 14-3-3β and leading to increased GAP activity towards Cdc42 (Ben2018CdGAPARHGAP31). These interactions highlight the role of CdGAP in cellular morphology and migration.
