The protein interacts with and regulates various proteins including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and G-protein coupled receptors such as the beta2-adrenergic receptor and the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor.

The protein localizes to actin-rich structures including membrane ruffles, microvilli, and filopodia.
