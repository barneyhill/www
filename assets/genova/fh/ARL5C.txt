# ARL5C

## Overview
ARL5C is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 5C, which is a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to chromatin organization and nuclear protein dynamics. As a GTPase, ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 5C plays a critical role in molecular signaling pathways by binding and hydrolyzing GTP. The protein's interactions with heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1α) and importin-α highlight its involvement in nuclear localization and chromatin-associated functions. These interactions are crucial for understanding the protein's role in cellular processes and its potential implications in clinical contexts (Lin2002A).

## Structure


## Interactions
ARL5C, a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. ARL5C interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1α), a nonhistone chromosomal protein associated with heterochromatin and telomeres. This interaction is dependent on the nucleotide bound to ARL5C and requires a MIR-like motif. The interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening, in vitro protein-interaction assays, and coimmunoprecipitation in COS cells (Lin2002A). The interaction with HP1α is GTP-dependent and involves specific regions of HP1α, namely residues 1-58 and 158-175 (Lin2002A). 

ARL5C also interacts with importin-α, a process that is not GTP-dependent but requires the C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) of ARL5C (Lin2002A). The interaction with importin-α is crucial for ARL5C's nuclear localization. Additionally, ARL5C has been shown to interact with all three HP1 paralogues, although the binding affinity varies (Lin2002A). These interactions suggest that ARL5C may play a role in regulating nuclear protein dynamics and chromatin organization.
