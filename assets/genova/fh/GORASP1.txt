# GORASP1

## Overview
GORASP1 is a gene that encodes the protein golgi reassembly stacking protein 1, commonly referred to as GRASP65. This protein is a peripheral membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural organization and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in protein processing and trafficking within cells. GRASP65 is characterized by its ability to form homodimers and oligomerize, facilitating the stacking of Golgi cisternae and maintaining the integrity of the Golgi structure. It is involved in various cellular processes, including mitosis, apoptosis, and unconventional protein secretion, through its interactions with other proteins and its regulation by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The protein's function is essential for proper vesicle trafficking and Golgi function, impacting cellular homeostasis and development. Alterations in GORASP1 expression or function have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and may influence disease progression through effects on Golgi structure and function (Fontana2024Golgi; Vinke2011The; Donizy2019Selected).

## Structure
GORASP1, also known as GRASP65, is a protein involved in the structural organization of the Golgi apparatus. The protein is characterized by two main domains: the N-terminal GRASP domain and the C-terminal Serine and Proline-Rich (SPR) domain. The GRASP domain contains two PDZ subdomains, which are crucial for dimerization and protein-protein interactions, facilitating the tethering of adjacent Golgi membranes (Fontana2024Golgi; Vinke2011The). The SPR domain is highly flexible and disordered, playing a regulatory role during cellular processes such as mitosis and apoptosis (Fontana2024Golgi).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are significant for GORASP1's function. Phosphorylation at specific serine/threonine residues by kinases such as CDK1 and Plk1 leads to Golgi disassembly during mitosis, which is essential for cell cycle progression (Vinke2011The). The protein is anchored to the Golgi membrane through N-myristoylation, which is crucial for its localization and function (Fontana2024Golgi).

GORASP1's structural flexibility, attributed to its intrinsically disordered regions, allows it to interact with various partners and participate in diverse cellular processes, including unconventional protein secretion and Golgi ribbon formation (Fontana2024Golgi; Mendes2022Resurrecting).

## Function
GORASP1, also known as GRASP65, is a critical protein involved in the structural organization and function of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. It plays a significant role in the stacking of Golgi cisternae, which is essential for maintaining the Golgi's morphology and function. GORASP1 is primarily located on the cis-Golgi cisternae, where it forms homodimers through its N-terminal PDZ domains. These dimers oligomerize in trans, tethering the cisternae into a stack, which is crucial for Golgi stack formation and maintenance (Donizy2019Selected).

GORASP1 is also involved in linking Golgi cisternae laterally, stabilizing the rims, and preventing vesiculation. This lateral connectivity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and ensuring proper vesicle trafficking and Golgi function (Grond2020GORASPs). The protein's role extends to unconventional secretion processes, where it helps stabilize and control membrane flux and vesicle biogenesis (Grond2020GORASPs).

In the context of cell biology, GORASP1 is modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during cell division, affecting Golgi disassembly and reassembly. This regulation is crucial for the Golgi's role in protein trafficking, processing, and secretion, impacting cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Donizy2019Selected).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GORASP1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), variants in GORASP1, such as rs28362644, are associated with reduced amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in specific brain regions, suggesting a potential protective role against Aβ accumulation, a hallmark of AD pathology (Seo2020Genetic). 

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), GORASP1 is downregulated in motor neurons with CHMP2B mutations. This downregulation is linked to Golgi apparatus fragmentation, which may contribute to impaired protein trafficking and cellular dysfunction in ALS (Cox2010Mutations). The fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus is a common feature in ALS and is associated with disruptions in vesicular transport and protein delivery within cells (Cox2010Mutations).

The role of GORASP1 in maintaining Golgi structure is crucial, as its dysfunction can lead to broader implications in cellular processes, potentially affecting disease progression. While the clinical significance of GORASP1 mutations in cancer is not directly addressed, Golgi disorganization, which GORASP1 helps prevent, is linked to cancer metastasis and therapy resistance (Donizy2019Selected).

## Interactions
GORASP1, also known as GRASP65, is a peripheral Golgi membrane protein that interacts with several other proteins to maintain Golgi structure and function. It is recruited to the Golgi by golgin proteins GM130 and Golgin45, which are essential for its localization and function in Golgi stack formation (Donizy2019Selected; Mendes2022Resurrecting). GRASP65 forms homodimers via its N-terminal PDZ domains, which oligomerize in trans to tether the cisternae into a stack, a process facilitated by its interaction with Golgin45 (Donizy2019Selected).

GRASP65 also interacts with the actin elongation factor Mena and the co-chaperone protein DjA1 at the Golgi. Mena enhances actin polymerization and GRASP65 oligomerization, while DjA1 promotes GRASP65 oligomerization through an unconventional pathway independent of its co-chaperone activity with Hsc70 (Ho2019Investigating; Donizy2019Selected). These interactions are crucial for the formation of the Golgi ribbon and the maintenance of Golgi integrity.

During cell division, GRASP65 is involved in the disassembly and reassembly of the Golgi apparatus, a process regulated by its phosphorylation status (Donizy2019Selected). Additionally, cleavage of GRASP65 by caspase-3 is required for Golgi fragmentation during apoptosis (Ho2019Investigating).
