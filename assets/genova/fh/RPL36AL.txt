# RPL36AL

## Overview
RPL36AL is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L36a-like, which is a component of the 60S subunit of ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in the translation process by aiding in the assembly and function of ribosomes within the cytoplasm. The RPL36AL gene is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various cellular functions through its involvement in protein synthesis. Alterations in the expression of RPL36AL have been associated with several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and certain cancers, indicating its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Volejnikova2020Czech; FernándezMartínez2020Robust).

## Function
RPL36AL encodes a ribosomal protein that is an integral component of the 60S subunit of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis in human cells. This protein plays a critical role in the translation process by facilitating the assembly and function of ribosomes, ensuring the accurate and efficient production of proteins. RPL36AL is active in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are located, and contributes to maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis by supporting the synthesis of proteins necessary for various cellular functions. The activity of RPL36AL in the cytoplasm underscores its importance in the overall process of translation, as it helps in the formation of functional ribosomes that translate mRNA into polypeptide chains. This process is vital for cell growth, division, and response to environmental signals, highlighting the essential nature of RPL36AL in healthy human cells. The proper functioning of RPL36AL is crucial for the stability and efficiency of protein synthesis, which in turn supports the physiological balance and health of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
The RPL36AL gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RPL36AL is underexpressed in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) compared to healthy controls. This underexpression is significant as RPL36AL is involved in metabolism and viral mRNA translation, and its altered expression may contribute to the metabolic and translational disruptions observed in Alzheimer's disease (FernándezMartínez2020Robust).

In Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital red cell aplasia, RPL36AL is mentioned in the context of large deletions or loss of heterozygosity regions. These genetic alterations are associated with severe DBA phenotypes, including growth and developmental delays, although the specific clinical significance of RPL36AL mutations in DBA is not detailed (Volejnikova2020Czech).

The gene is also noted for its role in cancer, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression is linked to cellular proliferation. This suggests that RPL36AL may contribute to tumorigenesis when dysregulated, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression (FernándezMartínez2020Robust).
