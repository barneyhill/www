# HIVEP3

## Overview
HIVEP3 is a gene that encodes the HIVEP zinc finger 3 protein, also known as KRC or Schnurri-3 (SHN3), which is a member of the ZAS family of transcriptional proteins. This protein is characterized by its large size and the presence of zinc finger domains, specifically C2H2-type zinc finger pairs, which are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Allen2002The). HIVEP zinc finger 3 functions as a transcription factor, modulating gene expression by interacting with specific DNA motifs, such as κB-like transcription enhancer motifs and recombination signal sequences (RSS) involved in V(D)J recombination (Allen2002The). It plays a critical role in immune cell development, particularly in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, and is involved in various cellular processes, including osteoblast differentiation and immune responses (Krovi2020Singlecell; Hu2020Association). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with conditions such as osteoporosis, certain cancers, and retinal degeneration (Robbins2018Decoding; Hu2020Association; Kaukonen2020A).

## Structure
The HIVEP3 protein, also known as KRC, is a member of the ZAS family of transcriptional proteins, characterized by their large size and the presence of zinc finger domains. These proteins contain two widely separated C2H2-type zinc finger pairs, which are crucial for DNA binding (Allen2002The). The zinc finger domains, specifically the ZAS-N and ZAS-C domains, are involved in binding to specific DNA sequences, such as the κB-like consensus sequence and the signal sequences of V(D)J recombination (RSS) (Allen2002The). The zinc fingers are composed of canonical Cys and His residues, forming C2H2 domains, with specific amino acid residues in the alpha helical regions influencing DNA binding properties (Allen2002The).

HIVEP3 can exist in smaller isoforms due to alternative RNA splicing, which may result in proteins with a single zinc finger pair or without any zinc finger pairs (Allen2002The). The protein's DNA-binding ability is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at tyrosine and serine residues, which can increase its affinity for DNA (Wu2001The). The phosphorylation site at residue 1709, near the zinc finger 4 domain, is significant for its DNA-binding function (Wu2001The).

## Function
HIVEP3, also known as KRC, is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression through its interaction with specific DNA motifs. It is part of the ZAS family of proteins, characterized by their ability to bind κB-like transcription enhancer motifs and recombination signal sequences (RSS) involved in V(D)J recombination, a critical process for generating diverse antigen receptor repertoires in the immune system (Allen2002The). HIVEP3 competes with NF-kB for binding to the κB motif, influencing chromatin accessibility and gene expression, particularly in the development of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells (Krovi2020Singlecell).

HIVEP3 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional regulation by binding to TG-rich DNA sequences, potentially affecting immune function and cell differentiation (Allen2002The). It acts as an adaptor protein, inhibiting NF-kB and JNK-mediated responses by binding to TRAF2, and serves as a co-activator of AP-1-dependent Il-2 gene transcription by interacting with c-Jun (Krovi2020Singlecell). These molecular activities highlight HIVEP3's crucial role in immune cell development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HIVEP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of bone health, a genome-wide association study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35282355 in the HIVEP3 gene and bone mineral content (BMC) in the femoral neck, suggesting a role in osteoporosis pathogenesis (Hu2020Association). This gene is involved in regulating bone formation, and alterations in its expression may affect bone geometry and osteogenesis (Hu2020Association).

In cancer research, gain-of-function mutations in HIVEP3 have been identified in group 3 medulloblastoma, contributing to an immunosuppressive phenotype and potentially increasing the tumor's aggressiveness and metastatic potential (Robbins2018Decoding). These mutations inhibit NFκB-mediated and JNK/SAPK-mediated responses, which are crucial for apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (Robbins2018Decoding).

In veterinary medicine, a regulatory variant in the HIVEP3 gene has been associated with type 1 progressive retinal atrophy in Miniature Schnauzers, indicating its role in retinal degeneration (Kaukonen2020A). This variant disrupts silencer activity, leading to increased gene expression in retinal tissues (Kaukonen2020A).

## Interactions
HIVEP3, also known as Schnurri-3 (SHN3), is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. In osteoblasts, HIVEP3 forms a trimer complex with Runx2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1. This complex inhibits Runx2 function by promoting its ubiquitination and protease-dependent degradation, which is crucial for regulating extracellular matrix mineralization and osteoblastogenesis (Hu2020Association). HIVEP3 also interacts with extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) in osteoblasts, inhibiting ERK activity and osteoblast differentiation. A mutation in the SHN3 gene can disrupt this interaction, leading to abnormal ERK activation (Hu2020Association).

In the immune system, HIVEP3 competes with NF-kB for binding to the kB motif, affecting chromatin accessibility and gene expression in innate-like T lymphocytes, particularly iNKT cells (Krovi2020Singlecell). HIVEP3 acts as an adaptor protein by binding to TRAF2, inhibiting NF-kB and JNK-mediated responses, and interacting with c-Jun to co-activate AP-1-dependent Il-2 gene transcription (Krovi2020Singlecell). These interactions highlight HIVEP3's role in transcriptional regulation and its impact on cellular processes.
