# AHCYL2

## Overview
AHCYL2 is a gene that encodes the protein adenosylhomocysteinase like 2, which plays a significant role in cellular processes such as ion transport and intracellular pH regulation. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, including domains such as the PEST domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins like NBCe1-B, a Na+-HCO3− cotransporter (Park2016Ahcyl2). AHCYL2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple variants with tissue-specific expression patterns (Kawaai2017Splicing). Functionally, AHCYL2 is involved in regulating ion transport, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion, with implications for endometrial vascular development and embryo implantation (Cho2024miR665Mediated). The protein's interactions and phosphorylation state influence its regulatory roles, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling pathways (Devogelaere2008The). Additionally, AHCYL2 has clinical significance, particularly in fertility-related conditions such as recurrent implantation failure, where its expression is modulated by miR-665 (Cho2024miR665Mediated).

## Structure
AHCYL2, also known as long-IRBIT, is a protein with a complex molecular structure that includes several important domains. The N-terminus of AHCYL2 contains a PEST domain, a coiled-coil (C-C) domain, a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding site, and a PDZ ligand. It also features a long IRBIT-specific N-terminal (LISN) domain (Park2016Ahcyl2). The PEST domain is crucial for its function, as it contains serine residues that can be phosphorylated, which is essential for its interaction with NBCe1-B, a protein involved in intracellular pH regulation (Park2016Ahcyl2).

AHCYL2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in several splice variants, including LongV1, LongV2, LongV3, and LongV4. These variants exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, with LongV3 primarily in the kidney and LongV4 in the lung, pancreas, small intestine, and stomach (Kawaai2017Splicing). The N-terminal region of these splice variants is highly disordered, similar to IRBIT, and belongs to intrinsically disordered protein regions (Kawaai2017Splicing).

The protein's phosphorylation state influences its localization and interaction with cytoplasmic or nuclear targets (Devogelaere2008The). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of AHCYL2 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
AHCYL2, also known as adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like protein 2, is involved in regulating ion transport and intracellular pH control. It interacts with the electrogenic Na+-HCO3− cotransporter NBCe1-B, modulating its sensitivity to intracellular magnesium (Mg2+) levels, particularly under bicarbonate-deficient conditions (Yamaguchi2014AHCYL2). AHCYL2 shares structural similarities with IRBIT, a known regulator of ion-transporting proteins, and contains a PEST domain crucial for its interaction with NBCe1-B. Phosphorylation of specific serine residues within this domain is essential for its regulatory function (Park2016Ahcyl2).

In addition to its role in ion transport, AHCYL2 is implicated in angiogenesis and cell adhesion, processes vital for endometrial vascular development and embryo implantation. Dysregulation of AHCYL2 can impact vascular development, potentially affecting endometrial receptivity (Cho2024miR665Mediated). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular methylation processes and influencing gene expression and cellular metabolism (Devogelaere2008The).

## Clinical Significance
AHCYL2 has been implicated in recurrent implantation failure (RIF), a condition affecting fertility. Alterations in the expression of AHCYL2, particularly its downregulation mediated by miR-665, have been associated with impaired angiogenesis and cell adhesion in the endometrium, which are crucial for successful embryo implantation (Cho2024miR665Mediated). The dysregulation of AHCYL2 due to miR-665 activity can compromise endometrial receptivity, negatively impacting vascular development and potentially leading to implantation failure (Cho2024miR665Mediated).

The study by Cho et al. suggests that DNA methylation patterns of AHCYL2 could serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers for RIF, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in fertility treatments (Cho2024miR665Mediated). The research emphasizes the need for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms involving AHCYL2 to develop targeted interventions aimed at improving endometrial receptivity and increasing the success rates of assisted reproductive techniques (Cho2024miR665Mediated).

While the primary focus has been on RIF, the role of AHCYL2 in other conditions, such as its association with tumor cell proliferation and poor prognosis in certain cancers, suggests broader implications for its altered expression in various diseases (Cho2024miR665Mediated).

## Interactions
AHCYL2, also known as adenosylhomocysteinase like 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function. AHCYL2 interacts with the electrogenic Na+-HCO3− cotransporter NBCe1-B, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. This interaction suggests that AHCYL2 may act as a regulator of NBCe1-B in mammalian cells (Yamaguchi2014AHCYL2). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that AHCYL2 can physically interact with NBCe1-B, indicating a direct binding relationship (Yamaguchi2014AHCYL2). 

AHCYL2 also interacts with IRBIT, forming a heteromultimer in bovine parotid acinar cells. However, AHCYL2 was not precipitated with an anti-IRBIT antibody, which might be due to insufficient precipitation of IRBIT proteins or the possibility that IRBIT forms homomultimers (Yamaguchi2014AHCYL2). The interaction with NBCe1-B is mediated by specific serine residues in the PEST domain of AHCYL2, which are crucial for its regulatory role (Park2016Ahcyl2). These interactions highlight the importance of AHCYL2 in regulating ion transport and cellular signaling pathways.
