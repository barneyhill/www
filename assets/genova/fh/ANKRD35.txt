# ANKRD35

## Overview
ANKRD35 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 35, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions, often forming a helix-loop-helix structure that contributes to the protein's stability and function. The ankyrin repeat domain 35 protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific biological roles and mechanisms remain under investigation. It is categorized as a scaffold protein due to its ability to facilitate interactions with other proteins, potentially influencing signaling pathways and cellular dynamics. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity and interactions (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
ANKRD35 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common domains involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary structure. The ankyrin repeats facilitate the formation of a stable scaffold that can mediate interactions with other proteins. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Information on the tertiary and quaternary structures of ANKRD35 is limited, as is data on specific splice variant isoforms.
