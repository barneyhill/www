# TDRD6

## Overview
TDRD6 is a gene that encodes the tudor domain-containing protein 6, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in germ cell development and RNA processing. The protein is characterized by multiple Tudor domains, which facilitate its role in binding methylated arginine or lysine residues, crucial for protein-protein interactions and the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes (Hosokawa2007Tudor-related; Akpınar2017TDRD6). TDRD6 is involved in the maturation of the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing, and plays a significant role in spermatogenesis by interacting with proteins such as PRMT5 and SmB (Akpınar2017TDRD6). The gene's mutations have been linked to male infertility conditions, such as oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, highlighting its clinical significance (Sha2018TDRD6). TDRD6's function and interactions underscore its importance in maintaining normal reproductive health and cellular function.

## Structure
The TDRD6 protein is characterized by the presence of multiple Tudor domains, which are crucial for its function in binding methylated arginine or lysine residues. These domains contribute to the protein's tertiary structure, forming a barrel-like configuration composed of anti-parallel beta-sheets that create a hydrophobic pocket (Gan2019Structure; Akpınar2017TDRD6). The TDRD6 protein in mice contains seven Tudor domains, which are essential for its localization and function in germ cell differentiation (Hosokawa2007Tudor-related).

The protein's interaction with other molecules is mediated by these Tudor domains, which recognize symmetrically dimethylated arginines, a common post-translational modification that influences protein interactions (Akpınar2017TDRD6). TDRD6 is involved in forming ribonucleoprotein complexes, indicating a quaternary structure where it associates with other proteins like MVH/DDX4, TDRD1, and TDRD7 (Hosokawa2007Tudor-related).

The TDRD6 gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may lead to structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not extensively covered in the context provided (Hosokawa2007Tudor-related). The protein's structure and interactions are vital for its role in RNA processing and germ cell development.

## Function
The TDRD6 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the early steps of spliceosome maturation, particularly in primary spermatocytes. TDRD6 is involved in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for the proper splicing of pre-mRNA. In TDRD6-deficient cells, there is an increase in U5 RNA levels within splicing snRNPs, suggesting that TDRD6 may act as an assembly factor for SmB, potentially competing with certain snRNAs like U5 for binding (Akpınar2017TDRD6). The protein interacts with PRMT5, a protein arginine methyltransferase, to facilitate the symmetrical dimethylation of SmB, a core component of spliceosomal snRNPs. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of U snRNPs and the formation of Cajal bodies, which are involved in nuclear snRNP maturation (Akpınar2017TDRD6).

TDRD6 is also a component of the chromatoid body, a structure involved in RNA regulation and protein trafficking in germ cells. It localizes to filamentous structures in the perinuclear space and interacts with symmetrically dimethylated SmB in the absence of RNA, indicating its role in the architecture of nuclear bodies containing many sDMA-proteins (Hosokawa2007Tudor-related; Akpınar2017TDRD6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TDRD6 gene have been associated with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT), a condition characterized by low sperm count, reduced sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. A study identified a homozygous variant c.1259A > G:p.Y420C in the TDRD6 gene in a patient from a consanguineous family, which co-segregated with the OAT phenotype, suggesting it as a pathogenic mutation. This mutation may contribute to male infertility and early embryonic developmental issues, as evidenced by failed intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in the patient's wife (Sha2018TDRD6).

In TDRD6 knockout mice, males are sterile due to the absence of sperm in the epididymes and a significant reduction in elongated spermatids. This is linked to disrupted chromatoid body architecture and altered miRNA expression, which are crucial for spermatid differentiation and miRNA processing (Vasileva2009Tdrd6). TDRD6 deficiency also leads to widespread splicing perturbations, affecting the maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs and resulting in significant splicing errors, which can impact male fertility (Akpınar2017TDRD6). These findings highlight the critical role of TDRD6 in maintaining normal spermatogenesis and its potential impact on male reproductive health.

## Interactions
TDRD6, a tudor domain-containing protein, is involved in several critical interactions within germ cells. It forms part of a ribonucleoprotein complex in male germ cells, co-localizing with TDRD1 and TDRD7, and is associated with MVH/DDX4, a component of the nuage structure important for germ cell development (Hosokawa2007Tudor-related). TDRD6 interacts with the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 and the spliceosomal core protein SmB in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the maturation of the spliceosome during spermatogenesis, as TDRD6 facilitates the symmetrical dimethylation of SmB by PRMT5, which is essential for proper spliceosome assembly (Akpınar2017TDRD6).

TDRD6 also interacts with PIWI proteins, such as MIWI and MILI, which are essential for piRNA biogenesis and the suppression of transposable elements during spermatogenesis (Gan2019Structure). These interactions contribute to the formation of piRNA-induced silencing complexes (piRISCs). The protein's interactions are not limited to protein-protein interactions; TDRD6 also associates with sDMA-modified proteins, highlighting its role in recognizing and binding methylated residues, which is crucial for its function in spliceosome maturation and germ cell development (Akpınar2017TDRD6).
