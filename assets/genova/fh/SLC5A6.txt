# SLC5A6

## Overview
The SLC5A6 gene encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the cellular uptake of essential water-soluble vitamins, including biotin, pantothenic acid, and α-lipoic acid. This transporter is primarily expressed in the intestines, kidneys, and brain, where it utilizes sodium gradients to facilitate the transport of these vitamins across cell membranes, thereby supporting various physiological functions (Wang1999Human; Said2011Intestinal). The SMVT protein is characterized by its 13 transmembrane α-helices, which are crucial for its function in transporting vitamins across cell membranes (Holling2022Novel). Mutations in the SLC5A6 gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including multivitamin-dependent neurometabolic disorders, highlighting the gene's importance in human health (Montomoli2023A).

## Structure
The SLC5A6 gene encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), which is a crucial protein for the Na+-dependent uptake of vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, and α-lipoic acid. The SMVT protein is predicted to have 13 transmembrane α-helices, with an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus, based on a 3D homology model derived from the sodium:galactose symporter of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Holling2022Novel). This structure facilitates its role in transporting vitamins across cell membranes. 

The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by hydrophobic transmembrane domains and hydrophilic extracellular and intracellular loops, which are essential for its function (Ghosal2011Structurefunction). Specific amino acid residues, such as His115 and His254, play a significant role in the transporter's function, particularly in biotin uptake, by affecting the expression of the transporter at the cell surface (Ghosal2011Structurefunction). 

Mutations in the SLC5A6 gene, such as p.(Tyr162Cys) and p.(Ser429Gly), can impact the structural arrangement and substrate binding of SMVT, affecting its catalytic activity (Holling2022Novel). These structural insights are crucial for understanding the transporter's function and its role in human health.

## Function
The SLC5A6 gene encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), which is essential for the uptake of water-soluble vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, and lipoate. This transporter operates primarily in the intestines, kidneys, and brain, utilizing sodium gradients to facilitate the transport of these vitamins across cell membranes (Uchida2015Major; Wang1999Human; Said2011Intestinal). 

In the intestines, SMVT is expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, playing a critical role in the absorption of biotin, which is vital for maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity. The absence of SMVT can lead to biotin deficiency and intestinal inflammation, similar to inflammatory bowel diseases (Sabui2016Role). In the brain, SMVT is localized at the blood-brain barrier, where it is responsible for the uptake of biotin and pantothenic acid, crucial for maintaining brain health and function (Uchida2015Major).

The transport process through SMVT is electrogenic, involving the movement of charged particles, and is driven by the sodium gradient and membrane potential. This process is essential for cellular metabolism, energy production, and the function of various enzymes (Wang1999Human; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC5A6 gene, which encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), are associated with a range of severe clinical conditions. These mutations can lead to systemic deficiencies in essential vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, and lipoate, resulting in a multivitamin-dependent neurometabolic disorder. Clinical manifestations include developmental delay, sensory polyneuropathy, optic atrophy, recurrent infections, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction (Montomoli2023A). 

Specific mutations, such as the p.(Leu566Valfs*33) variant, have been linked to severe neurometabolic disorders characterized by symptoms like optic atrophy, intellectual disability, and metabolic abnormalities (Montomoli2023A). Other mutations, such as R94X and R123L, have been identified in patients with cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and immunodeficiency, highlighting the critical role of SLC5A6 in brain, immune, bone, and intestinal functions (Subramanian2016Mutations).

The phenotypic spectrum of SLC5A6 mutations also includes motor neuropathies, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy, as seen in patients with biallelic variants (Holling2022Novel). Early diagnosis and targeted vitamin supplementation therapy can significantly improve clinical outcomes, underscoring the importance of recognizing and managing these genetic disorders (Byrne2019Identification).
