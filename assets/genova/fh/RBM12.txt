# RBM12

## Overview
RBM12 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 12, a protein characterized by its involvement in RNA metabolism and processing. The protein is classified as an RNA-binding protein, featuring multiple RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its role in mRNA splicing and stability. Structurally, RBM12 includes transmembrane domains and proline-rich regions, which suggest its participation in complex cellular processes, including potential interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, with additional targeting sequences indicating possible mitochondrial functions. RBM12 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, underscoring its broad functional significance. Clinically, alterations in the RBM12 gene have been linked to several diseases, including colorectal adenocarcinoma and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Rees2018Association; Sutherland2004RNA; GarcíaCárdenas2023Data; Stover2001cDNA).

## Structure
The RBM12 protein is encoded by the RBM12 gene and consists of 932 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 97 kDa (Sutherland2004RNA; Stover2001cDNA). The primary structure of RBM12 includes five RNA binding motifs (RBMs), with two located at the N- and C-termini and three central motifs flanked by transmembrane domains (Yang2008Promotersharing; Stover2001cDNA). The protein also contains two proline-rich regions, which are often associated with RNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Sutherland2004RNA; Yang2008Promotersharing).

RBM12 lacks a signal sequence for secretion but includes a nuclear targeting sequence at position 604 and a mitochondrial targeting sequence at position 5, suggesting potential intracellular localization and function (Stover2001cDNA). The protein is classified as unstable, with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 8.74 (Stover2001cDNA). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of RNA binding motifs and transmembrane domains suggests a complex structure that facilitates its role in RNA processing and potential involvement in membrane trafficking (Sutherland2004RNA). The protein's structure may also include calcium-dependent phospholipid binding properties (Sutherland2004RNA).

## Function
RBM12 (RNA binding motif protein 12) is involved in various molecular processes, primarily related to RNA metabolism. It contains multiple RNA binding motifs, which are crucial for its role in RNA processing, including mRNA splicing and stability (Sutherland2004RNA; Stover2001cDNA). The protein is characterized by the presence of five RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), proline-rich regions, and transmembrane domains, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular processes (Sutherland2004RNA; Yang2008Promotersharing).

RBM12 is active in the nucleus, where it may influence gene expression by interacting with RNA molecules, thus impacting cellular differentiation and proliferation (Stover2001cDNA). The presence of nuclear and mitochondrial targeting sequences indicates potential localization to these organelles, suggesting roles in nuclear and mitochondrial functions (Sutherland2004RNA; Stover2001cDNA).

The gene is ubiquitously expressed across various human cell lines, indicating a broad role in cellular functions (Yang2008Promotersharing). Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, RBM12's involvement in RNA processing and potential regulation of apoptosis highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sutherland2004RNA; Yang2008Promotersharing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBM12 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, RBM12 is associated with colorectal adenocarcinoma (COREAD), where it is identified as hypermutated in a significant number of tumors, suggesting a role in cancer progression (GarcíaCárdenas2023Data). It is also overexpressed in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (GarcíaCárdenas2023Data). Additionally, RBM12 is linked to endometrial cancer, with significant associations found through exome-wide rare variant analysis (Shivakumar2019ExomeWide).

In neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, RBM12 has been associated with schizophrenia, supported by strong statistical evidence of its involvement (Rees2018Association). A frameshift variant of RBM12 has been identified in a patient with epilepsy and mildly delayed development, suggesting a potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders, although this association is not yet confirmed (Kim2022Analysis).

RBM12 is also noted for its potential involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with rare deleterious variants identified in patients, indicating a possible role in disease progression (CooperKnock2017Targeted).

## Interactions
RBM12 is known to contain RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules, suggesting a role in RNA processing and regulation (Sutherland2004RNA). The protein is also noted for its potential involvement in apoptosis regulation, similar to other RBM proteins, although specific interactions have not been detailed (Yang2008Promotersharing). 

RBM12 shares promoter regions with the CPNE1 gene, indicating a potential functional interaction between the two gene products. This promoter-sharing suggests that RBM12 and CPNE1 might interact on the plasma membrane upon calcium activation, potentially influencing processes like membrane trafficking, growth control, or apoptosis (Yang2008Promotersharing). However, specific physical interactions between RBM12 and other proteins or nucleic acids have not been explicitly reported in the available literature.

In the context of cancer, RBM12 has been identified as an RNA-binding protein involved in the progression of colon and rectal carcinomas, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (GarcíaCárdenas2023Data). The protein's overexpression in colon cancer suggests it may play a role in cancer cell survival, but further research is needed to elucidate its specific interactions (GarcíaCárdenas2023Data).
