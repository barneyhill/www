# GSS

## Overview
The GSS gene encodes the enzyme glutathione synthetase, a critical component of the cellular antioxidant defense system. Glutathione synthetase is an enzyme that belongs to the ATP-grasp superfamily and is responsible for the ATP-dependent synthesis of glutathione (GSH) from gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. The protein is a homodimer with a complex structure that includes a unique circular permutation in its core structural units, facilitating its function in both the cytosol and mitochondria (Polekhina1999Molecular). Mutations in the GSS gene can lead to glutathione synthetase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder with significant clinical implications, including metabolic acidosis and hemolytic anemia (NJÅLSSON2004Human; Ristoff2007Inborn).

## Structure
The human glutathione synthetase (hGS) protein is a homodimer with each subunit having a molecular weight of 52 kDa. The primary structure of hGS shares 35-89% amino acid sequence identity with other eukaryotic glutathione synthetases (Polekhina1999Molecular). The secondary structure of hGS includes anti-parallel and parallel β-sheets, with associated helices and a lid domain that provides access to the ATP-binding site (Polekhina1999Molecular). The tertiary structure is compact, forming a flat, equilateral triangle with a central cavity where ligands such as ADP, magnesium ions, and glutathione are bound. This cavity is covered by loops, including the substrate-binding loop, the Gly-rich loop, and the Ala-rich loop (Polekhina1999Molecular).

The quaternary structure of hGS involves dimerization through a crystallographic 2-fold axis, with a hydrophobic core surrounded by polar contacts at the dimer interface. This interface includes an antiparallel β-sheet formed by strands from each monomer and interactions between helices (Polekhina1999Molecular). The enzyme is part of the ATP-grasp superfamily, characterized by an ATP-binding cleft formed by two antiparallel sheets and a phosphate-binding loop (Polekhina1999Molecular). A unique feature of hGS is a circular permutation in its core structural units, involving the ATP-grasp C-terminal domain being split between the N-terminus and C-terminus (Polekhina1999Molecular).

## Function
Glutathione synthetase (GSS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a vital antioxidant in human cells. GSS catalyzes the ATP-dependent coupling of gamma-glutamylcysteine with glycine to form GSH, which is essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative damage (Dalton2004Genetically). This enzyme is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular detoxification processes and the maintenance of redox balance (Dalton2004Genetically).

In healthy human cells, GSS is critical for the synthesis of GSH, which serves multiple functions, including detoxification, acting as a cofactor for enzymes like GSH peroxidase, and participating in nucleotide metabolism (Dalton2004Genetically). GSH is involved in protecting protein thiols from irreversible oxidation and modulating cell signaling through glutathionylation, which can protect proteins from oxidative damage and regulate cellular functions (Lu2013Glutathione).

Deficiency in GSS can lead to severe metabolic consequences, such as metabolic acidosis and hemolytic anemia, due to the accumulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine and the subsequent reduction in GSH levels (Dalton2004Genetically). This highlights the enzyme's importance in maintaining cellular health and preventing oxidative stress-related damage.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GSS gene, which encodes the enzyme glutathione synthetase, lead to glutathione synthetase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a range of clinical manifestations, including hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, and neurological dysfunction (NJÅLSSON2004Human; Ristoff2007Inborn). The severity of the disease can vary, with some patients experiencing mild symptoms such as isolated hemolytic anemia, while others suffer from severe metabolic acidosis and neurological impairments (NJÅLSSON2000Kinetic; Alqarajeh2020Genotype).

The clinical heterogeneity observed in glutathione synthetase deficiency is attributed to different mutations in the GSS gene, which affect the enzyme's kinetic properties and stability. For instance, mutations like L188P and D219A significantly reduce the enzyme's Vmax and ATP affinity, leading to impaired enzyme activity (NJÅLSSON2004Human). Other mutations, such as R283C and Y270C, also drastically decrease enzyme activity, potentially due to disulfide bond formation or unfavorable interactions with ATP (NJÅLSSON2004Human; Polekhina1999Molecular).

Early diagnosis and management, including the use of antioxidants like vitamins C and E, are crucial to prevent neurological symptoms and improve patient outcomes (Alqarajeh2020Genotype).
