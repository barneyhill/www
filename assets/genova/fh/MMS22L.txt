# MMS22L

## Overview
MMS22L is a gene that encodes the MMS22-like, DNA repair protein, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA repair processes, particularly homologous recombination. The protein is categorized as a DNA repair protein and is primarily active in the nucleus, where it associates with chromatin during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. MMS22L forms a complex with NFKBIL2, which is essential for the cellular response to replication stress and the repair of collapsed replication forks. This complex interacts with the FACT and MCM complexes, facilitating the recruitment of repair machinery to active replication forks. Additionally, MMS22L is involved in the ATR/ATRIP-CHK1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for responding to replication stress. The gene's expression and interactions have significant implications in cancer biology, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the cancer type, influencing prognosis and therapeutic strategies (O’Connell2010A; Guo2022Integrative; Piwko2010RNAibased; van2022MMS22LTONSL).

## Function
MMS22L is a crucial gene involved in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. The protein encoded by MMS22L forms a complex with NFKBIL2, which is essential for the cellular response to replication stress and DNA repair processes, particularly homologous recombination (HR) (O’Connell2010A; Piwko2010RNAibased). This complex interacts with the FACT and MCM complexes, which are involved in chromatin regulation and DNA replication, respectively, suggesting a role in facilitating the recruitment of repair machinery to active replication forks (O’Connell2010A).

MMS22L is involved in the ATR/ATRIP-CHK1 signaling pathway, which is activated in response to replication stress, and is crucial for the repair of collapsed replication forks (O’Connell2010A). The MMS22L-NFKBIL2 complex helps prevent the inappropriate formation of single-stranded DNA and subsequent DNA damage, thereby protecting cells from replication stress (Piwko2010RNAibased). It also plays a role in suppressing spontaneous DNA damage response activation and preventing cell cycle arrest (O’Connell2010A).

MMS22L is primarily active in the nucleus, where it associates with chromatin during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, indicating its involvement in maintaining genome stability during DNA replication (Piwko2010RNAibased).

## Clinical Significance
MMS22L is implicated in various cancers due to its role in DNA repair and genomic stability. Alterations in MMS22L expression are associated with different prognostic outcomes across cancer types. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high MMS22L expression correlates with advanced tumor grades and poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Guo2022Integrative). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MMS22L acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels linked to enhanced migration and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like 5-FU (Luo2021MMS22L). Conversely, in lung and esophageal cancers, MMS22L is overexpressed and functions as an oncogene, promoting cancer cell growth and survival (NGUYEN2012Identification).

MMS22L's interaction with NFKBIL2 is crucial for its stability and function in the nucleus, influencing the NFKB pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Disruption of this interaction can suppress cancer cell growth, highlighting a potential therapeutic strategy (NGUYEN2012Identification). The gene's involvement in homologous recombination repair also suggests that its mutations may increase tumor sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs, offering a potential avenue for overcoming chemoresistance (Guo2022Integrative).

## Interactions
MMS22L is involved in several critical protein interactions that contribute to its role in DNA repair and genomic stability. It forms a complex with NFKBIL2, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability and responding to replication stress. This complex interacts with the FACT (facilitator of chromatin transcription) complex, which includes SSRP1 and SUPT16H, and the MCM (minichromosome maintenance) complex, which functions as a replicative helicase. These interactions are crucial for the repair of collapsed replication forks and the promotion of homologous recombination (O’Connell2010A).

MMS22L also forms a heterodimer with TONSL, which localizes at replication forks and is involved in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC). This interaction is part of a pathway parallel to DSCC1-RFC, contributing to the recruitment of ESCO2 to the replisome, which is necessary for cohesin acetylation and SCC establishment (van2022MMS22LTONSL).

In cancer cells, MMS22L interacts with NFKBIL2 to influence the nuclear localization and stability of MMS22L, promoting cell survival and proliferation through the NFKB pathway. This interaction is implicated in the overexpression of MMS22L in lung and esophageal cancers (NGUYEN2012Identification).
