# NOL10

## Overview
NOL10, or nucleolar protein 10, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis within human cells. The NOL10 protein is a nucleolar component that is integral to the AATF-NGDN-NOL10 (ANN) complex, which is essential for the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This protein is categorized as a nucleolar protein due to its localization and function within the nucleolus, where it is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA, facilitating the proper cleavage necessary for ribosomal subunit production (Bammert2016Human). Beyond its role in ribosome synthesis, NOL10 is implicated in maintaining nucleolar integrity under stress conditions and has been associated with various cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung cancer, where its expression levels and interactions influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Wei2024Combined; Jin2023PQBP5NOL10).

## Function
NOL10, also known as nucleolar protein 10, plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit in human cells. It is a component of the AATF-NGDN-NOL10 (ANN) complex, which is essential for the nucleolar maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. This complex is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA, specifically in the 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS) and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) regions, facilitating the proper cleavage and processing necessary for the production of functional ribosomal subunits (Bammert2016Human).

NOL10 is enriched in the granular component of nucleoli and is a significant binding partner of AATF, forming a stable protein complex that localizes to the nucleoli. The stability and localization of NOL10, AATF, and NGDN are interdependent, indicating that NOL10 is a core component of the ANN complex, crucial for ribosome biogenesis (Bammert2016Human).

In addition to its role in ribosome synthesis, NOL10, identified as PQBP5 in some studies, maintains nucleolar integrity under physiological and osmotic stress conditions. It acts as a spatial anchor for the assembly of other nucleolar proteins, ensuring nucleolar stability and function (Jin2023PQBP5NOL10).

## Clinical Significance
NOL10 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, NOL10 is significantly upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages, lymph node metastasis, higher Gleason scores, increased biochemical recurrence rates, and reduced overall survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The risk allele A of SNP rs4519489 is linked to elevated NOL10 expression and aggressive prostate cancer characteristics. Functional studies indicate that NOL10 acts as an oncogene, promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of NOL10 reduces these oncogenic behaviors, while overexpression enhances them. NOL10 expression is also correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling, key pathways in prostate cancer progression (Wei2024Combined).

In breast cancer, circNOL10, a circular RNA derived from NOL10, is downregulated and associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. Lower circNOL10 expression correlates with shorter overall survival. It functions by sponging miR-767-5p, regulating the SOCS2/JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and suppressing cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT (Wang2021CircNOL10).

In lung cancer, circNOL10 is also downregulated and inhibits tumor malignancy by promoting apoptosis and regulating mitochondrial function through the SCML1-mediated transcriptional regulation of the humanin polypeptide family (Nan2018Circular).

## Interactions
NOL10 is involved in several interactions within the nucleolus, primarily as part of the ANN complex, which includes AATF and NGDN. This complex is essential for the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit, particularly in pre-rRNA processing. NOL10 contains a WD40 domain that facilitates its interaction with AATF and NGDN, forming a stable complex crucial for ribosome biogenesis (Bammert2016Human). The interactions within the ANN complex are strong, as evidenced by their resistance to RNase and high salt treatment, indicating a robust association (Bammert2016Human).

NOL10 also interacts with the NUP98-DDX10 fusion protein in the context of leukemia, where it plays a role in regulating the expression of ATF4, a transcription factor involved in the serine biosynthesis pathway. This interaction is crucial for the leukemogenic activity of NUP98-DDX10, as NOL10 stabilizes ATF4 mRNA, promoting leukemia cell growth (Kitabayashi2024NOL10).

Additionally, NOL10 is linked to prostate cancer progression through its interaction with the transcription factor USF1. The risk allele A of SNP rs4519489 enhances USF1 binding, leading to increased NOL10 expression, which regulates cell cycle pathways (Wei2024Combined).
