# RNF146

## Overview
RNF146 is a gene located on human chromosome 6q22.1-q22.33 that encodes the protein ring finger protein 146, also known as Iduna. This protein is categorized as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as DNA repair and Wnt signaling. The protein's structure includes a C3HC4 RING finger domain and a WWE domain, which are essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity and interaction with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), respectively (Zhou2011Ring; AlRahahleh2023Overexpression). RNF146 is involved in the regulation of protein stability through its interactions with tankyrase enzymes and Axin proteins, influencing pathways critical for cell proliferation and differentiation (Callow2011Ubiquitin; DaRosa2018Structural). Additionally, RNF146 has clinical significance in various diseases, including cancer and bone disorders, due to its regulatory functions in key signaling pathways (Li2023SUMOylation; Matsumoto2017RANKL).

## Structure
Ring finger protein 146 (RNF146) is a protein encoded by the RNF146 gene, located on human chromosome 6q22.1-q22.33. The protein consists of 359 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 39.8 kDa (Zhou2011Ring). The molecular structure of RNF146 includes an N-terminal C3HC4 RING finger domain, spanning amino acids 35 to 77, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Zhou2011Ring). This domain facilitates the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, enabling the ubiquitination process (Zhou2011Ring).

RNF146 also contains a WWE domain, located between amino acids 91 and 167, which is characterized by conserved tryptophan (W) and glutamate (E) residues. This domain is essential for binding poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and plays a significant role in modulating PAR dynamics at sites of DNA damage (AlRahahleh2023Overexpression). The WWE domain includes a PAR-binding motif from amino acids 144 to 167, which is critical for its function in DNA repair and Wnt signaling (Zhou2011Ring).

RNF146 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are vital for its role in protein degradation and cellular signaling pathways (Gerö2014Modulation). The protein's structure and domains enable it to interact with various substrates and participate in cellular processes, including DNA repair and the regulation of Wnt signaling (Zhou2011Ring).

## Function
RNF146, also known as Iduna, is a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in regulating Wnt signaling and DNA damage repair in healthy human cells. In the Wnt signaling pathway, RNF146 promotes the degradation of Axin, a key component of the β-catenin destruction complex, by ubiquitinating it. This action leads to the dissociation of the complex, resulting in increased levels of β-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes, which are crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Callow2011Ubiquitin; Zhou2011Ring).

RNF146 also interacts with tankyrase enzymes, facilitating their degradation and thus modulating the stability of proteins involved in Wnt signaling (Callow2011Ubiquitin). The protein's activity is enhanced by PAR polymers, which are essential for its E3 ligase function (Callow2011Ubiquitin).

In the context of DNA repair, RNF146 translocates to the nucleus following DNA damage, where it binds to PARsylated nuclear proteins, facilitating their ubiquitination and degradation. This process is vital for the assembly of repair complexes at DNA damage sites, promoting cell survival after damage such as γ-irradiation (Zhou2011Ring; Kang2011Iduna).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF146 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In bone-related disorders, RNF146 plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling. Loss of RNF146 function leads to increased osteoclast activity and osteopenia, a condition characterized by reduced bone mass, as seen in RNF146-null mice that phenocopy cherubism (Matsumoto2017RANKL). This gene is also essential for normal bone development, and its deficiency can result in a condition resembling cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), marked by defective bone formation and mineralization (Matsumoto2017Ubiquitin).

In cancer, RNF146 is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through its regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of RNF146 in NSCLC enhances tumor proliferation and invasion, correlating with poor prognosis (Gao2014Overexpression). In HCC, SUMOylation of RNF146 promotes tumor growth by activating β-catenin signaling, and high expression levels are associated with worse patient outcomes (Li2023SUMOylation).

RNF146 is also suggested to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration or acting as a protective response to neuronal injury (Zhou2011Ring).

## Interactions
RNF146, also known as Iduna, is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in several protein interactions, primarily influencing the Wnt signaling pathway. It interacts with tankyrase proteins (TNKS1 and TNKS2), facilitating their ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Axin proteins, which are negative regulators of Wnt signaling. RNF146 binds directly to tankyrase through noncanonical tankyrase-binding motifs (TBMs) in its C-terminal region, allowing for a multivalent binding mechanism (DaRosa2018Structural).

RNF146 also interacts with Axin proteins, promoting their degradation to enhance Wnt signaling. It forms a complex with tankyrase and Axin, mediating the ubiquitylation of all three proteins (Callow2011Ubiquitin). Additionally, RNF146 can bind to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and PARP2, although with lower affinity compared to tankyrase, suggesting a selective role in regulating PARP family members (Callow2011Ubiquitin).

The interaction between RNF146 and HUWE1, a HECT-type ubiquitin E3 ligase, suggests that HUWE1 may function as an E4 enzyme in ubiquitin chain elongation for RNF146 substrates (Callow2011Ubiquitin). These interactions highlight RNF146's role in modulating protein stability and signaling pathways through ubiquitylation.
