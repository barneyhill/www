# FER1L6

## Overview
FER1L6 is a gene that encodes the protein fer-1 like family member 6, which is part of the ferlin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in membrane dynamics, particularly in processes such as vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. FER1L6 is distinguished by its multiple C2 domains, which facilitate calcium ion binding and membrane interactions, and a FerA domain that is implicated in membrane association. The protein is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes, playing a crucial role in the recycling of cellular components between these compartments and the plasma membrane. FER1L6's function is essential for maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating vesicle fusion events, contributing to the dynamic processes of endocytic trafficking and recycling within cells (Redpath2016Ferlins).

## Structure
FER1L6 is a member of the ferlin family of proteins, characterized by multiple C2 domains and a transmembrane region. The protein contains five C2 domains, which are involved in calcium ion binding and membrane interactions (Dominguez2022Redefining; Posey2011Ferlin). These domains typically have a β-sandwich structure formed by eight β-strands (Dominguez2022Redefining). The C2B domain in FER1L6 lacks the typical calcium-binding motif but includes putative lipid-binding residues (Dominguez2022Redefining).

FER1L6 also contains a FerA domain, a four-helix bundle that is centrally located in the protein's sequence. This domain is primarily α-helical and is involved in membrane association, potentially playing a role similar to SNARE proteins in membrane fusion (Harsini2018FerA). The FerA domain in FER1L6 has a near-neutral charge, similar to myoferlin, suggesting structural similarities (Harsini2018FerA).

The protein is localized to a specific sub-compartment of the trans-Golgi network, indicating a role in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics (Peulen2019Ferlin; Redpath2016Ferlins). The presence of conserved structural features in the C2 domains and transmembrane regions suggests functional roles in calcium-dependent membrane interactions (Dominguez2022Redefining).

## Function
FER1L6 is a member of the ferlin family of proteins, which are involved in membrane dynamics, including vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. In healthy human cells, FER1L6 is primarily associated with the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes. It plays a significant role in the recycling of cellular components between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. FER1L6 is identified as a trans-Golgi/recycling ferlin, distinct from plasma membrane/endosomal ferlins like dysferlin and myoferlin. It is abundantly expressed at the plasma membrane and localizes to a brefeldin-A resistant region of the trans-Golgi/recycling endosomal compartment, which is partially co-labeled by TGOLN2 and Rab11a (Redpath2016Ferlins).

FER1L6 undergoes retrograde transit from the plasma membrane via Rab11a-positive endosomes to the trans-Golgi/recycling endosome, suggesting its involvement in endocytic trafficking and recycling processes within cells (Redpath2016Ferlins). Overexpression of FER1L6 induces expansion of the recycling compartment, indicating a role in its biogenesis (Redpath2016Ferlins). The protein's robust membrane localization and rapid cycling between cellular compartments suggest it may facilitate vesicle fusion events at specific subcellular locations, contributing to cellular integrity and function (Redpath2016Ferlins).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
FER1L6 is associated with the trans-Golgi/recycling endosomal compartment and shows a high degree of co-localization with Rab11a-positive endosomes, suggesting a potential interaction or association with Rab11a, a protein involved in endosomal recycling (Redpath2016Ferlins). This interaction is supported by studies where FER1L6, when co-transfected with Rab11a-EGFP in HEK293 cells, undergoes retrograde transit from the plasma membrane via Rab11a-positive endosomes to the trans-Golgi/recycling endosome (Redpath2016Ferlins). 

FER1L6 is also noted for its localization to a brefeldin-A resistant region of the trans-Golgi/recycling endosomal compartment, where it is partially co-labeled by TGOLN2 and Rab11a, and abundantly labeled by endocytosed transferrin (Redpath2016Ferlins). This suggests that FER1L6 may interact with proteins involved in the trans-Golgi and recycling endosomal pathways, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature (Redpath2016Ferlins). The study of FER1L6's interactions is ongoing, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and interactions within cellular processes.
