# TNFRSF13C

## Overview
The TNFRSF13C gene encodes the protein known as B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This protein functions as a type III transmembrane receptor, playing a pivotal role in the immune system by regulating B-cell development, survival, and maturation. BAFF-R is primarily expressed on the surface of B cells and is essential for the transition of B cells through various developmental stages. It mediates signaling pathways, particularly the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, which are crucial for B-cell survival and differentiation (Figgett2014Roles; Smulski2018BAFF). The interaction between BAFF-R and its ligand, BAFF, is vital for maintaining B-cell homeostasis and has implications in autoimmune diseases and other immune-related conditions (Wu2021Peripheral; OrtizAljaro2022Protein).

## Structure
The TNFRSF13C gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, known as BAFF-R. This protein is primarily a type III transmembrane protein, characterized by the absence of signal peptides (Wiens2011Origin). Structurally, it features an extracellular domain with one to four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are pseudo-repeats of approximately 40 amino acids. These domains contain six conserved cysteines that form three disulfide bonds, crucial for maintaining the receptor's structural integrity and function (Wiens2011Origin).

The TNFRSF13C protein typically forms homotrimers, which are essential for its role in signaling pathways. The extracellular domain's cysteine-rich motifs are significant for ligand binding and receptor activation. The protein also includes a single transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic tail, which are involved in signal transduction. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, influencing the protein's stability and function. The receptor's structure allows it to play a critical role in B cell development and survival, highlighting its importance in the immune system (Wiens2011Origin).

## Function
The TNFRSF13C gene encodes the B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFFR), which is crucial for B-cell development, survival, and maturation in healthy human cells. BAFFR is primarily expressed on the surface of B cells, where it mediates signaling pathways essential for B-cell survival and differentiation. It plays a significant role in the transition of B cells from the immature/transitional 1 stage to transitional 2/naïve and marginal zone B cells (Smulski2018BAFF).

BAFFR signaling is primarily mediated through the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, involving TRAF2, TRAF3, NIK, and IKK1, which leads to the activation of genes critical for B-cell survival (Figgett2014Roles). This receptor is distinct from other receptors like TACI and BCMA, which have additional functions, such as supporting plasma cell survival and immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (Smulski2018BAFF).

BAFFR is not expressed on developing B cells in the bone marrow, which explains why BAFF does not affect B-cell development there. Instead, BAFFR expression begins when immature B cells develop into transitional B cells and is upregulated following the expression of functional B-cell antigen receptors (BCR) (Smulski2018BAFF). BAFFR's role is crucial for maintaining mature B-cell populations and supporting immune responses (rickert2011signaling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNFRSF13C gene, which encodes the B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), have been associated with various immune system disorders. A specific variant, p.His159Tyr (H159Y), has been linked to severe COVID-19 outcomes. This variant is more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to those with non-severe or asymptomatic cases. It is known to increase NF-kB activation and B-cell production, suggesting a potential genetic risk factor for severe COVID-19 (Russo2021The). The variant is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with a CADD score of 27.6, indicating a potential functional impact (Russo2021The).

In the context of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), mutations in TNFRSF13C can lead to impaired antibody production and B cell maturation. These mutations are clinically significant as they contribute to the pathogenesis of CVID by causing deficient production of IgG and IgM antibodies and increasing pre-B cell transition cells (Bisgin2021The). The presence of rare and low-frequency variants in TNFRSF13C has been noted, with some classified as likely pathogenic, suggesting their involvement in CVID (Bisgin2021The).

## Interactions
TNFRSF13C, also known as BAFF-R, is a receptor that primarily interacts with the B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. This interaction is crucial for the survival, maturation, and proliferation of B cells. BAFF-R is the only receptor that exclusively binds to BAFF, distinguishing it from other receptors like TACI and BCMA, which can bind both BAFF and APRIL (OrtizAljaro2022Protein).

The binding of BAFF to TNFRSF13C activates signaling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that promotes B-cell proliferation and differentiation. This signaling is essential for maintaining B-cell homeostasis and function. The interaction between BAFF and TNFRSF13C is particularly significant in the context of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where dysregulation of this pathway can contribute to disease pathogenesis (OrtizAljaro2022Protein).

In addition to its role in B-cell biology, TNFRSF13C has been implicated in other conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, where its expression correlates with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and immune cell infiltration, suggesting a broader role in immune regulation (Wu2021Peripheral).
