# KCNAB1

## Overview
KCNAB1 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A regulatory beta subunit 1, commonly referred to as Kvβ1. This protein is a crucial component of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, which are integral to the regulation of electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells. Kvβ1 belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and is characterized by its conserved C-terminal β-barrel structural fold and nicotinamide cofactor, which are typical of catalytically active AKRs (Raph2019Biochemical). The Kvβ1 protein modulates the gating properties and kinetics of Kv channels by interacting with their alpha subunits, thereby influencing processes such as neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction. It is expressed in various brain regions and plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Kessi2020Intellectual). Additionally, KCNAB1 has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including epilepsy and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Busolin2011Association; Kessi2020Intellectual).

## Structure
The KCNAB1 gene encodes a regulatory beta subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, known as Kvβ1, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. Kvβ1 proteins possess a conserved C-terminal β-barrel structural fold with a tightly bound nicotinamide cofactor, characteristic of catalytically active AKRs (Raph2019Biochemical). The active site includes a well-conserved cofactor binding site and a distinct substrate binding pocket. The AKR6 family, to which Kvβ proteins belong, features a unique active site structure with an additional helix attached to a long loop between β9 and α7 near the cofactor binding pocket (Raph2019Biochemical).

At the quaternary level, Kvβ1 proteins form tetrameric complexes with Kv channels. The β1 and β2 regions, along with the α2-β5-α3 region, form the intersubunit interface region that participates in β tetramerization, while the α5-α6 region interacts with the T1 docking domains of the Kvα proteins. This interaction can influence the conformation of the voltage sensing apparatus and impact gating properties (Raph2019Biochemical). The human genome contains three genes encoding Kvβ proteins, and their transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate additional variants (Raph2019Biochemical).

## Function
KCNAB1 encodes a regulatory beta subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, which are essential for repolarizing the cell membrane following an action potential. These channels play a critical role in modulating electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells, influencing processes such as neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction. The KCNAB1 protein is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it affects excitability and signal propagation (Kessi2020Intellectual).

In the brain, KCNAB1 is expressed in various regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, dorsal striatum, and colliculus. It contributes to the regulation of action potentials by interacting with pore-forming alpha subunits and facilitating the closing of delayed rectifier potassium channels. This interaction is crucial for synaptic plasticity and certain types of learning and memory, as evidenced by studies on Kvbeta1.1-deficient mice, which show impaired learning and memory tasks (Kessi2020Intellectual).

KCNAB1 is also involved in the development and maintenance of specific neuronal circuits in the cortex, particularly in subplate neurons with unilateral long-range inter-areal projections. Its expression in these neurons suggests a role in the organization of cortical connectivity and association with specific neuronal subtypes (Tiong2019Kcnab1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNAB1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, including epilepsy and intellectual disability. A de novo mutation in KCNAB1 was identified in a patient with early onset epileptic encephalopathy and severe intellectual disability, although the exact mechanism by which this mutation leads to these conditions remains unclear (Kessi2020Intellectual). The gene is also considered a candidate susceptibility factor for lateral temporal epilepsy (LTE), a form of epilepsy characterized by focal seizures with auditory auras. Studies have found associations between certain intronic variants of KCNAB1 and an increased risk of LTE, suggesting that these genetic variations may influence susceptibility to this condition (Busolin2011Association).

In addition to epilepsy, variants in KCNAB1 have been implicated in the neurological aftermath of head injuries. A specific variant was found in a case of catastrophic cerebral edema following minor head trauma, indicating that alterations in KCNAB1 may contribute to increased vulnerability to such injuries (Ibrahim2020Exploring). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNAB1 in various neurological disorders and the need for further research to understand its role in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The KCNAB1 gene encodes the Kvβ1 subunit, which is a regulatory component of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. This subunit interacts with the alpha subunits of Kv channels, influencing their gating properties and kinetics. Kvβ1 is known to associate with Kv1 channels, particularly forming complexes with Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and other subunits in presynaptic A-type channels. The interaction with these channels is crucial for modulating their inactivation kinetics (Schulte2006The).

Kvβ1 also interacts with the leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (Lgi1) protein. Lgi1 inhibits the rapid inactivation of Kv1 channels mediated by Kvβ1, a function that is lost in certain mutations associated with epilepsy. This interaction is specific to the Kvβ1 subunit and does not affect other channel processes (Schulte2006The).

In the heart, Kvβ1.1, an isoform of Kvβ1, interacts with myosin heavy chain α (MHCα), as demonstrated by pull-down assays. This interaction suggests a role for Kvβ1.1 in cardiac physiology, particularly in modulating cardiac structure and function (Tur2016Deletion).
