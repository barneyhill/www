# OR2AP1

## Overview
The OR2AP1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily AP member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through the activation of intracellular G-proteins. The olfactory receptors, including OR2AP1, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
