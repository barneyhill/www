# CCDC34

## Overview
CCDC34 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 34 protein, which is characterized by its coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and intracellular signaling, and is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). The CCDC34 protein plays a significant role in cilia and flagella biology, which are crucial for cellular movement and signaling, particularly in the context of male reproductive physiology (Vandenbrouck2020The). Altered expression of the CCDC34 gene has been implicated in several cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2018High; Hu2018Overexpression).

## Function
CCDC34 is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and intracellular signaling. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and potentially influencing organismal development and disease processes (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

In healthy human cells, CCDC34 is implicated in cilia and flagella biology, which are essential for cellular movement and signaling. The protein's involvement in these structures suggests a role in processes such as ciliogenesis, which is crucial for the formation and function of cilia and flagella (Vandenbrouck2020The). This function is particularly significant in the context of male reproductive physiology, where ciliary and flagellar structures are vital for sperm motility and fertility.

The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus indicates its participation in maintaining cellular homeostasis, which is essential for normal cell function and organismal health. By regulating key cellular processes, CCDC34 may play a role in ensuring proper cell division and survival, thereby contributing to the overall stability and function of tissues in the human body (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC34 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In cervical cancer, CCDC34 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with a positive staining rate of 71.6% in cancerous tissues. This high expression is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, making it an independent prognostic factor for cervical cancer patients (Liu2018High).

In colorectal cancer, CCDC34 overexpression is linked to increased tumor growth, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced invasion capabilities. Silencing CCDC34 in colorectal cancer cells leads to decreased metabolic activity and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Geng2017Overexpression).

CCDC34 is also upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where it correlates with poor prognosis and increased angiogenesis. It is considered an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in these patients (Hu2018Overexpression).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high CCDC34 expression is associated with lower overall survival, serving as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (Qi2017Expression). These findings suggest that CCDC34 could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.
