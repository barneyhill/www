# TSPAN19

## Overview
TSPAN19 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 19, a member of the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by its four transmembrane domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in cellular processes, as they facilitate the organization of other proteins into a multimolecular membrane network known as the tetraspanin web (Jankovičová2020Tetraspanins). Tetraspanin 19 is involved in various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, motility, and signal transduction, although its specific roles remain underexplored (Huang2010The). The protein's structure includes a small extracellular loop and a large extracellular loop, the latter containing conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability and interaction capabilities (DeSalle2010Evolution). TSPAN19 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including certain cancers and viral infections, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research (Wang2022Potential; Maldonado2021Molecular).

## Structure
TSPAN19, a member of the tetraspanin family, is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes four transmembrane domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function and are a defining feature of the tetraspanin family (Huang2010The; Jankovičová2020Tetraspanins). The protein also features a small extracellular loop (SEL) and a large extracellular loop (LEL), the latter of which contains conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, providing structural stability and facilitating protein interactions (Jankovičová2020Tetraspanins; DeSalle2010Evolution).

The LEL is crucial for protein interactions and contains a constant region with three helices and a variable region with a CCG motif (Huang2010The). TSPAN19 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation in its extracellular domains and palmitoylation at intracellular cysteines, which are common among tetraspanins and influence their function and localization within the cell membrane (Jankovičová2020Tetraspanins; Charrin2009Lateral).

Tetraspanins, including TSPAN19, are known to organize other proteins into a multimolecular membrane network called the tetraspanin web, forming specific microdomains distinct from lipid rafts (Jankovičová2020Tetraspanins). Despite their biological importance, the specific functional roles of TSPAN19 remain underexplored (Huang2010The).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN19 has been implicated in various cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In PTC, TSPAN19 is identified as a differentially expressed gene (DEG) that may play a critical oncogenic role in tumor progression. It is involved in pathways such as 'integrins and other cell-surface receptors,' 'Fibrinolysis Pathway,' and 'Focal adhesion,' which are significant in tumor progression, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Wang2022Potential). In NPC, TSPAN19 is part of a prognosis model that predicts clinical outcomes. The model associates higher riskscores, which include TSPAN19, with more advanced cancer stages, although specific expression levels in different clinical stages are not detailed (Fang2022Identification).

TSPAN19 has also been studied in the context of viral infections. It clusters with viral genes from SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, indicating potential interactions that may influence viral infection and host interaction. However, the clinical significance of these interactions remains unclear (Maldonado2021Molecular). Despite these associations, specific mutations or expression alterations of TSPAN19 in these conditions have not been detailed in the available literature.
