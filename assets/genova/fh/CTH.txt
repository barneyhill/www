# CTH

## Overview
The CTH gene encodes the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the transsulfuration pathway. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the conversion of cystathionine into cysteine, α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia, thereby contributing to the regulation of homocysteine levels and providing cysteine, especially under conditions of high methionine intake (Fernandes2021Human; Kraus2009Cystathionine). CSE is categorized as a homotetrameric enzyme, with each subunit binding a PLP cofactor essential for its catalytic activity (Kraus2009Cystathionine). Beyond its metabolic functions, CSE is a key enzyme in the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, inflammation, and vasodilation (Ishii2010Cystathionine; Yang2008H). The gene and its encoded enzyme have been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as cystathioninuria, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting their significance in human health and disease (Román2019Epigenetic; Wang2003Genomic).

## Structure
The human cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) protein is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in the transsulfuration pathway. Structurally, CTH forms a homotetramer, with each subunit having a molecular mass of approximately 44.5 kDa (Zhu2008Kinetic). The tetrameric structure is composed of two dimers, labeled (A, B) and (C, D), which are related by a pseudo-twofold axis, creating a structure with virtual symmetry 222 (D2) (Kraus2009Cystathionine). Each subunit binds one PLP cofactor through a Schiff base linkage to the active site lysine, K212 (Zhu2008Kinetic).

The active sites are located at the interfaces between the subunits, with two active sites formed between the A and B subunits and two between the C and D subunits (Kraus2009Cystathionine). The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and aromatic stacking interactions, particularly involving Tyr114 and PLP (Kraus2009Cystathionine). The enzyme's active sites are described as deep cavities with a narrow inlet, and the enzymatic reaction involves breaking the Lys212-PLP bond (Kraus2009Cystathionine).

The protein structure includes disordered ends at the N and C terminals, which are exposed to solvent and lack stable interactions with the bulk protein (Kraus2009Cystathionine). The enzyme's activity is dependent on the PLP cofactor, and mutations affecting PLP binding can significantly impact the enzyme's function (Zhu2008Kinetic).

## Function
The human gene CTH encodes the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), which plays a critical role in the transsulfuration pathway. This enzyme is responsible for converting cystathionine into cysteine, α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia, thereby contributing to homocysteine homeostasis and providing a source of cysteine, particularly under conditions of high methionine intake (Fernandes2021Human; Kraus2009Cystathionine). CSE is a homotetrameric enzyme with an N-terminal catalytic domain that binds the cofactor pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Kraus2009Cystathionine).

CSE is the most efficient enzyme for generating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at physiological levels of (homo)cysteine. H2S acts as a gasotransmitter, regulating several physiological processes such as neurotransmission, inflammation, immunomodulation, blood flow, apoptosis, and energy metabolism (Fernandes2021Human). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and influences processes like vasodilation, neuromodulation, and antioxidant defense (Ishii2010Cystathionine; Yang2008H). CSE activity can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as S-nitrosation, which inhibits its function and highlights a crosstalk mechanism between gasotransmitters like nitric oxide and H2S (Fernandes2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTH gene, which encodes the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase, have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Cystathioninuria, characterized by elevated levels of cystathionine in plasma and urine, is linked to various mutations in the CTH gene. These mutations can lead to decreased enzyme activity, although cystathioninuria is often considered a benign biochemical anomaly (Wang2003Genomic; Kraus2009Cystathionine).

Alterations in CTH expression can also impact cardiovascular health. The CTH 1364 G>T polymorphism has been studied for its potential association with coronary artery disease (CAD), although results have been inconclusive. Some studies suggest that this polymorphism may influence homocysteine metabolism, a risk factor for atherosclerosis, and hydrogen sulfide production, which is crucial for endothelial function (Giannakopoulou2019Association).

In the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the CTH c.1364 G>T variant has been associated with an increased risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), particularly in female patients. This condition is a severe complication linked to the conditioning regimen used in transplantation (HuezoDiaz2016Association).

Additionally, the CTH gene has been implicated in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, where a common mutation can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for cognitive decline (Román2019Epigenetic).

## Interactions
Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) is involved in several interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. In prostate cancer, CTH interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway. It promotes the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit through hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-mediated sulfhydration on cysteine-38, which enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b and promotes cell invasion (Wang2019Dysregulation). This interaction is crucial for the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer, as it affects the expression of genes involved in inflammation and cell invasion (Wang2019Dysregulation).

CTH is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level by miR-133a, which targets the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the CTH mRNA. This interaction was validated through a luciferase reporter assay, demonstrating that miR-133a decreases luciferase activity in cells with the wild-type CTH 3' UTR, indicating a specific binding and regulatory mechanism (Nandi2017H2S).

Additionally, CTH activity is modulated by S-nitrosation, a post-translational modification involving the addition of a nitric oxide group to cysteine residues. This modification affects the enzyme's stability and activity, suggesting a crosstalk mechanism between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide signaling pathways (Fernandes2021Human).
