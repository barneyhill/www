# DOCK2

## Overview
DOCK2 is a gene that encodes the protein dedicator of cytokinesis 2, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) primarily involved in the regulation of RHO GTPases, such as RAC1. This protein plays a pivotal role in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility, particularly within the immune system. DOCK2 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, where it is essential for processes such as chemotaxis, immune synapse formation, and the regulation of immune cell trafficking and homing (Moens2019Human; Ji2022Insights). The protein's structure includes several key domains, such as the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and Dock homology regions (DHR1 and DHR2), which facilitate its interaction with other proteins and its localization to the cell membrane (Benson2021The; Chang2020Structure). Through these interactions, DOCK2 influences both adaptive and innate immune responses, making it integral to maintaining immune homeostasis and function (Scharler2022Extrahematopoietic).

## Structure
DOCK2 is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and is involved in the regulation of RHO GTPases, specifically RAC1, which are critical for cell motility and cytoskeletal organization (Benson2021The; Chang2020Structure). The protein is characterized by several key domains, including the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, Dock homology region-1 (DHR1), Dock homology region-2 (DHR2), ARM, and C2 domains (Chang2020Structure).

The DHR1 domain, located towards the N-terminus, interacts with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) for membrane localization (Benson2021The; Ji2022Insights). The DHR2 domain, located in the C-terminal region, is responsible for the GEF activity of DOCK2, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on RAC1 (Benson2021The; Chang2020Structure). This domain consists of three lobes (A, B, and C), with lobe B containing the GTPase binding site and catalytic center (Benson2021The).

DOCK2 forms a complex with ELMO1, which is necessary for its function. This complex can exist in a closed, auto-inhibited conformation or an open, active conformation, with conformational changes in ELMO1 regulating the transition between these states (Chang2020Structure). Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on DOCK2 and ELMO1 plays a crucial role in transitioning the complex to its active state (Chang2020Structure). The SH3 domain of DOCK2 interacts with the C-terminal PxxP motif of ELMO1, forming a stable interface crucial for GEF activity (Chang2020Structure).

## Function
The DOCK2 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is crucial for the activation of small GTPases, particularly Rac, which plays a significant role in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration. This protein is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, where it facilitates chemotaxis and immune cell function (Moens2019Human; Ji2022Insights). In T and B lymphocytes, DOCK2 is essential for the formation of immune synapses and the regulation of cell trafficking and homing, which are vital for maintaining immune homeostasis and adaptive immune responses (Scharler2022Extrahematopoietic; Ji2022Insights).

DOCK2 also plays a critical role in the innate immune response by regulating neutrophil functions such as migration, reactive oxygen species production, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Ji2022Insights). In macrophages, it influences the Rac-NF-kB pathway, promoting cytokine release and enhancing phagocytic and bactericidal activities (Ji2022Insights). Additionally, DOCK2 is involved in the regulation of stromal cell immunomodulatory functions, impacting T cell proliferation and immune responses (Scharler2022Extrahematopoietic). Overall, DOCK2 is integral to the proper functioning of both adaptive and innate immunity in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DOCK2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DOCK2 mutations are linked to a lower survival rate and poorer prognosis. These mutations influence immune-related processes and pathways, which are crucial in tumor development, and are associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment (Huang2022Association).

In the context of COVID-19, a specific risk allele on DOCK2 has been identified, particularly affecting younger patients and those of East Asian descent. This variant is associated with decreased DOCK2 expression, which is linked to severe COVID-19 cases. DOCK2 downregulation affects chemokine signaling, type I interferon production, and lymphocyte migration, contributing to severe disease pathology (Namkoong2022DOCK2).

DOCK2 deficiency, caused by a novel homozygous splice-site mutation, leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by early-onset severe viral infections and functional defects in T-, B-, and NK cells. This deficiency results in impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and migration, affecting the body's defense against infections (Moens2019Human).

A specific DOCK2 mutation (p.Asn445Ser) impacts NK cell function, reducing degranulation and cell lysis, which are crucial for controlling inflammation and immune response (Reiff2023DOCK2).

## Interactions
DOCK2 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that regulate its activity and function. It is a member of the CDM family of proteins and contains domains that facilitate these interactions. The N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of DOCK2 binds to Engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1), which inhibits DOCK2 ubiquitination and prevents its degradation, promoting Rac activation (Ji2022Insights). The DOCK2-ELMO1 complex can exist in both closed and open conformations. In the closed, auto-inhibited state, ELMO1's N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts with DOCK2's DHR2 domain, occluding the RAC1-binding site and suppressing DOCK2's guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (Chang2020Structure). 

The interaction between DOCK2 and ELMO1 is crucial for DOCK2's GEF activity, with ELMO1's PH domain stabilizing the DOCK2 DHR2-RAC1 interaction (Chang2020Structure). Phosphorylation of DOCK2 and ELMO1 can relieve the auto-inhibited state, promoting the active conformation and enhancing RAC1 activation (Chang2020Structure). DOCK2 also interacts with phosphatidic acid, stabilizing its recruitment to the cell membrane and mediating neutrophil chemotaxis (Chang2020Structure). These interactions highlight DOCK2's role in regulating immune cell functions and its involvement in various diseases (Ji2022Insights).
