# TMT1A

## Overview
The TMT1A gene, also known as METTL7A, encodes the thiol methyltransferase 1A protein, which is a member of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of thiol-containing compounds, playing a crucial role in the detoxification processes within the liver. The TMT1A protein is characterized by a conserved GxGxG domain and a seven-beta-strand (7BS) methyltransferase fold, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and substrate binding. It utilizes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor and is competitively inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). The protein is highly expressed in the liver and is associated with the microsomal fraction, where it selectively methylates exogenous thiol-containing compounds, contributing to the regulation of cellular thiol levels and maintaining cellular redox balance (González2023The; Russell2023METTL7A).

## Structure
The TMT1A protein, also known as METTL7A, is composed of 244 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 28 kDa (Russell2023METTL7A). It shares 75% sequence homology and 60% sequence identity with its isoform METTL7B, indicating a high degree of similarity in their primary structures (Russell2023METTL7A). The protein is characterized by a conserved GxGxG domain, which is a hallmark of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, and an aspartic acid at position 98, predicted to bind S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (González2023The).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, TMT1A is predicted to adopt a seven-beta-strand (7BS) methyltransferase fold, which is common among SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This structural motif is crucial for its enzymatic activity and substrate binding (González2023The). The protein's three-dimensional modeling shows good structural alignment of the conserved SAM-binding domain and residues across species, suggesting a conserved mechanism of action (González2023The).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, have been observed, with specific modifications at amino acids K34, K55, K105, and K219 in humans, which may influence the protein's function and stability (González2023The). The protein is expressed as a recombinant form with a 10X histidine-tag and a GST tag, resulting in a molecular weight of 57.6 kDa when expressed in E. coli (Russell2023METTL7A).

## Function
The TMT1A gene, also known as METTL7A, encodes a thiol methyltransferase enzyme that plays a significant role in the methylation of thiol-containing compounds in the liver. This enzyme is involved in the S-methylation of drugs and other exogenous thiol-containing substrates, which can alter their pharmacological activity and contribute to detoxification processes (Russell2023METTL7A). TMT1A uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with its activity being competitively inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (Russell2023METTL7A).

In healthy human cells, TMT1A is highly expressed in the liver and is associated with the microsomal fraction, similar to other drug-metabolizing enzymes (Russell2023METTL7A). It selectively methylates exogenous thiol-containing compounds and does not methylate endogenous thiols like cysteine and glutathione, suggesting a role in detoxification and regulation of cellular thiol levels (Russell2023METTL7A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and impacting cellular signaling and metabolism (González2023The). The conservation of TMT1A across species indicates its fundamental biological role (González2023The).
