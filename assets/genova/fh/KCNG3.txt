# KCNG3

## Overview
KCNG3 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily G member 3, which is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. This protein functions as a modifier subunit, playing a crucial role in regulating membrane potential and electrical signaling in cells. Unlike other potassium channel subunits, KCNG3 does not form functional channels independently but modulates the activity of other potassium channels through heterotetramerization, particularly with subunits like Kv2.1. This interaction influences neuronal excitability, muscle contraction, and vascular tone. KCNG3 is predominantly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in various physiological processes, including the modulation of vascular function and gastrointestinal pacemaker activity (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory; Fantozzi2006Bone).

## Structure
The KCNG3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the modifier subfamily G. The primary structure of the KCNG3 protein consists of 519 amino acids and shares more than 70% sequence identity with other subunits like Kv6.1 and Kv6.2 (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory). The secondary structure includes six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with a potassium selectivity motif 'GYG' located in the P-loop between the S5 and S6 segments, which is characteristic of potassium channels (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory).

The tertiary structure is implied by the presence of these transmembrane segments, suggesting a membrane-spanning configuration, although specific details are not provided. The quaternary structure involves the potential for heterotetramerization with other Kv subunits, such as Kv2.1, allowing KCNG3 to form part of a larger channel complex (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory). KCNG3 is considered a 'silent subunit' because it does not produce currents when expressed alone but can alter the function of Kv channels through heterotetramerization (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory). The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, with lower expression in other tissues (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory).

## Function
KCNG3 encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically functioning as a modifier subunit. These channels are crucial for regulating membrane potential and electrical signaling in cells. KCNG3 modulates the activity of other potassium channels, influencing processes like neuronal excitability and muscle contraction. It is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it contributes to the fine-tuning of electrical signals in various tissues.

In human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), KCNG3 expression is significantly increased following treatment with Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2). This upregulation is associated with changes in the electrophysiological properties of the functional tetrameric channels, suggesting a role in modulating vascular tone and pulmonary function (Fantozzi2006Bone).

In the gastrointestinal tract, KCNG3 is expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which are known as electrical pacemakers in gastrointestinal smooth muscles. Although the specific functional role of KCNG3 in ICC is not fully understood, its presence indicates a potential involvement in pacemaker activity and muscle function (Lee2017Transcriptome). Further electrophysiological studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of KCNG3 in these cells.

## Interactions
KCNG3, also known as Kv6.3, is a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that does not form functional channels on its own but interacts with other Kv subunits to form heterotetrameric channels. It has been shown to interact strongly with Kv2.1, Kv3.1, and Kv5.1 subunits, but not with itself or other subunits like Kv1.5, Kv4.3, Kv8.1, and Kv9.1 (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory). These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical association between these subunits (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory).

When coexpressed with Kv2.1, KCNG3 is trafficked to the plasma membrane, suggesting that Kv2.1 facilitates its proper localization and functional expression (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory). This interaction alters the functional properties of the resulting channels, such as shifting the activation threshold and affecting the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (Ottschytsch2002Obligatory). In vascular smooth muscle cells, the presence of KCNG3 modulates the kinetics of Kv2 currents, leading to slower activation and deactivation, a shift in voltage dependence, and a decrease in current amplitude (Moreno‐Domínguez2009De). These interactions highlight the role of KCNG3 in modulating the electrical activity of cells through its association with other Kv subunits.
