# SPCS2

## Overview
SPCS2 is a gene that encodes the signal peptidase complex subunit 2, a non-catalytic component of the eukaryotic signal peptidase complex (SPC) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is integral to the SPC, which is responsible for cleaving signal sequences from nascent polypeptides, a critical step in the maturation and trafficking of ER-targeted and secretory proteins. Although SPCS2 itself does not exhibit enzymatic activity, it is thought to play a role in substrate recognition and may function as an accessory subunit, potentially influencing the expression of specific proteins such as ULBP1. The protein interacts with the Sec61 translocon, suggesting its involvement in the co-translational processing of proteins. While SPCS2 is not essential for the basic activity of the SPC or cell viability, its precise functions in humans remain to be fully characterized (Zanotti2022The; Alzahrani2022SPCS1Dependent; Gowen2015A).

## Structure


## Function
The SPCS2 gene encodes a non-catalytic subunit of the eukaryotic signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This complex is responsible for cleaving signal sequences from ER-targeted and secretory proteins, a crucial step in protein maturation and trafficking (Zanotti2022The). In mammalian cells, the SPC is composed of five membrane proteins, including SPCS2, which interacts with the Sec61 translocon, suggesting a role in co-translational signal peptidase processing (Zanotti2022The; Alzahrani2022SPCS1Dependent).

Although SPCS2 does not possess catalytic activity, it is suggested to play a role in substrate recognition, potentially acting as an accessory subunit required for unknown functions (Zanotti2022The). In yeast, SPCS2 is not essential for the activity of the complex or for cell viability, but its specific functions in humans are not fully characterized (Zanotti2022The). Studies in mammalian cells indicate that SPCS2 may have a specific role in the expression of certain proteins, such as ULBP1, rather than a broad impact on all cell surface proteins (Gowen2015A).

## Clinical Significance
SPCS2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In parathyroid adenomas, SPCS2 is identified as a hub molecule in a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of these tumors (Chai2019Comparative). The gene's involvement in the signal peptidase complex is crucial for protein processing, and its dysregulation may contribute to tumorigenesis (Chai2019Comparative).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPCS2 is co-expressed with the long noncoding RNA LINC00668 and shows significant upregulation in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. However, its diagnostic significance in HCC is considered weak, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.614, and it does not have significant prognostic value (Wang2019Genome‑wide).

SPCS2 also plays a role in the regulation of ULBP1, an activating ligand for natural killer cells. Mutations in SPCS2 can lead to decreased expression of ULBP1, indicating its specific contribution to immune regulation (Gowen2015A). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of SPCS2 gene mutations remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
SPCS2 is a subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. It is known to interact with the Sec61 translocon in both yeast and mammals, suggesting a role in the translocation process of nascent polypeptides (Zanotti2022The). Although SPCS2 does not possess catalytic activity, it is considered an accessory subunit of the SPC, along with SPCS1. These accessory subunits are not essential for the signal peptidase activity or cell viability, indicating that their roles might be more regulatory or structural (Zanotti2022The).

The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human SPC has shown that SPCS2 forms part of two separate complexes with SEC11A and SEC11C, along with other accessory subunits. This structural arrangement is thought to accommodate signal sequences during the cleavage process (Zanotti2022The). While specific interactions of SPCS2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, its interaction with the Sec61 translocon and its presence in the SPC suggest it may play a role in facilitating the proper processing and translocation of proteins within the ER.
