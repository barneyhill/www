# BRAF

## Overview
The BRAF gene encodes the B-Raf proto-oncogene, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, specifically within the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade. This pathway is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival (Liau2020Dimerization; Cope2018Mechanism). The BRAF protein is characterized by its kinase domain, regulatory domain, and RAS-binding domain, which facilitate its function and regulation (Aramini2015The). BRAF is typically maintained in an inactive monomeric form, becoming active upon binding with GTP-bound RAS, which induces dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation (Cope2018Mechanism). Mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly the V600E mutation, are associated with various cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Davies2002Mutations; Yi2022Spectrum).

## Structure
The BRAF protein, encoded by the BRAF gene, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Its primary structure includes a kinase domain, a regulatory domain, and a RAS-binding domain (RBD) (Aramini2015The). The secondary structure of BRAF features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the RBD adopting a classic ubiquitin α/β roll structure, consisting of two α helices and a five-stranded mixed β sheet (Aramini2015The). 

The tertiary structure of BRAF involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase. The RBD is well-ordered, with some disorder in loop L4 and the termini (Aramini2015The). The BRAF kinase domain can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with dimerization being crucial for its activation. In the presence of sulfonamide inhibitors, BRAF can become monomeric, which affects its dimerization potential (Thevakumaran2014Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in BRAF's function. Phosphorylation at specific sites, like S365 and S729, is essential for the assembly and regulation of BRAF complexes (Park2019Architecture). BRAF also has splice variant isoforms, which can lead to different functional properties (Martinez2021Structural).

## Function
The BRAF gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, specifically the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade. This pathway is essential for regulating cellular growth, differentiation, and survival (Liau2020Dimerization; Cope2018Mechanism). In healthy human cells, BRAF is typically maintained in an inactive monomeric form in the cytosol through autoinhibitory interactions between its N-terminal regulatory domains and the C-terminal catalytic domain (Cope2018Mechanism). Activation of BRAF involves binding of active GTP-bound RAS, leading to dimerization and phosphorylation events that relieve these inhibitory interactions, allowing for full activation of the RAF kinase (Cope2018Mechanism).

BRAF plays a regulatory role by forming a high-affinity complex with MEK1, which is crucial for the proper activation of the MAPK pathway (Haling2014Structure). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with scaffold proteins, RAS, and other RAF family members like CRAF, forming dimers that influence its kinase activity (Cope2018Mechanism). BRAF specifically phosphorylates MEK1/2, which is crucial for downstream signaling (Cope2018Mechanism). The regulation of BRAF activity involves multiple layers, including the binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which can either negatively or positively regulate BRAF activity (Liau2020Dimerization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRAF gene are implicated in a variety of cancers and developmental disorders. The most common mutation, V600E, is found in approximately 66% of malignant melanomas and is a significant driver in other cancers such as thyroid carcinoma and colorectal cancer (Davies2002Mutations; Yi2022Spectrum). This mutation leads to elevated kinase activity, promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation (Davies2002Mutations). In thyroid cancer, BRAF mutations are prevalent in papillary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, often associated with more advanced tumor stages (Nikiforova2003BRAF).

BRAF mutations are also linked to developmental disorders like Noonan syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Costello syndrome (Hussain2015BRAF). In hairy cell leukemia, the BRAF V600E mutation is present in all patients with the classic form of the disease, suggesting potential treatment with BRAF inhibitors (Pakneshan2013Clinicopathological).

Alterations in BRAF expression levels and copy number variations are associated with different clinical outcomes. Increased BRAF expression is linked to poor survival in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, but with better prognosis in breast cancer and other types (Yi2022Spectrum).

## Interactions
BRAF, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with MEK1, forming a complex that is essential for signal transduction in the MAPK/ERK pathway. This interaction is crucial for BRAF's activation, as MEK1 acts as a scaffold, enhancing the phosphorylation of BRAF's activation loop, which is necessary for its maximal activity (Cope2018Mechanism).

BRAF also interacts with RAS proteins, which facilitate its transition from a monomer to a dimer. This dimerization is mediated by the RAS binding domain (RBD) of BRAF, which forms extensive contacts with the 14-3-3 protein, stabilizing the dimeric form necessary for RAF activation (Martinez2021Structural). The interaction between BRAF and RAS is dynamic, involving initial contact with exposed basic residues in the BRAF RBD, leading to conformational changes that promote dimer formation (Martinez2021Structural).

BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and PLX8394, can influence these interactions by promoting intermediate BRAF conformations and enhancing interactions with RAS, even in the absence of RAF dimerization. This can lead to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway, highlighting the complexity of BRAF's regulatory mechanisms (Röck2019BRAF).
