# EID2

## Overview
EID2 is a human gene that encodes the protein EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 2, which is a member of the EID family of p300-binding proteins. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and differentiation processes within human cells. As a nuclear protein, EID2 interacts with the transcriptional coactivator p300, known for its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, and functions as an inhibitor of this activity, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. EID2 is characterized by its conserved C-terminal region and an alanine-rich domain, distinguishing it from its paralog EID-1. It plays a critical role in inhibiting muscle-specific gene expression by suppressing MyoD-dependent transcription, which is essential for skeletal muscle differentiation. The protein's interactions with class I histone deacetylases and its involvement in various protein-protein interaction networks underscore its significance in cellular differentiation and proliferation (Guerineau2012Analysis; Ji2003EID2).

## Structure
The EID2 protein, encoded by the human gene EID2, is a member of the EID family of p300-binding proteins. It consists of 236 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa (Miyake2003A; Ji2003EID2). The protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal region, which is crucial for its physiological function and shows significant similarity to EID-1 (Ji2003EID2). Unlike EID-1, EID2 contains an alanine-rich domain instead of highly acidic regions and lacks the classic Rb-binding site (Miyake2003A; Ji2003EID2).

EID2 interacts with MAGEC2 through its Nse3/MAGE-binding domain, with specific residues such as R198, R202, F210, I212, and L214 playing essential roles in this interaction (Guerineau2012Analysis). The core region of EID2, particularly residues 205-217, fits into the hydrophobic pocket of MAGEC2, suggesting a helical structure that is conserved and facilitates binding (Guerineau2012Analysis). The N-terminal portion of EID2 is important for its interaction with class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), which is crucial for its function in transcriptional repression and nuclear localization (Miyake2003A).

## Function
EID2, or EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating transcription and differentiation processes in human cells. It is a member of the EID family of p300-binding proteins, which are known to interact with the transcriptional coactivator p300, a protein with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. EID2 inhibits the acetyltransferase activity of p300, thereby modulating chromatin structure and influencing gene expression (Ji2003EID2).

EID2 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels found in the placenta, liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Ji2003EID2). It functions as an inhibitor of muscle-specific gene expression by suppressing MyoD-dependent transcription, which is crucial for skeletal muscle differentiation. This inhibition is achieved through its interaction with p300, suggesting that EID2 negatively regulates differentiation through a p300-dependent mechanism (Ji2003EID2).

The protein's role in inhibiting transactivation by MyoD indicates its involvement in muscle differentiation or development, highlighting its importance in cellular differentiation and proliferation (Ji2003EID2).

## Interactions
EID2 (EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 2) is implicated in various protein-protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation and differentiation processes. Although direct evidence of EID2's interactions with specific proteins is limited, it is suggested to be part of interaction networks in tissues infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), as identified in studies examining microRNA expression profiles. EID2 is a target gene within these networks, indicating its potential involvement in infection-related pathways regulated by microRNAs (Bagnicka2021MicroRNA).

The conservation of the degron sequence in EID2, which is crucial for the binding and ubiquitylation of its paralog EID1 by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, suggests that EID2 may similarly interact with this complex. This interaction could involve FBXO21, a substrate recognition subunit of the SCF complex, although direct evidence of EID2's ubiquitylation or interaction with FBXO21 is not provided (Zhang2015Peptidic).

EID2 has also been identified as a stably expressed gene during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, indicating its potential role in maintaining consistent gene expression across various cellular states (Holmgren2015Identification). However, specific details about its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be elucidated.
