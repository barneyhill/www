# DEPDC5

## Overview
DEPDC5 is a gene that encodes the protein DEP domain containing 5, GATOR1 subcomplex subunit, which is a crucial component of the GATOR1 complex involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Rag GTPases, playing a significant role in cellular responses to nutrient availability by inhibiting mTORC1 activation under amino acid scarcity (Bar-Peled2013A; Hughes2017Knockout). The DEPDC5 protein contains several functional domains, including the DEP domain, which are essential for its interactions and regulatory functions within the GATOR1 complex (Liu2020DEPDC5). Mutations in the DEPDC5 gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, particularly familial focal epilepsies and focal cortical dysplasia, due to the resultant dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling (Baulac2015Familial; Ribierre2018Secondhit).

## Structure
The DEPDC5 protein is a component of the GATOR1 complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway. The protein contains several functional domains, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), the structural axis for binding arrangement (SABA) domain, the steric hindrance for enhancement of nucleotidase activity (SHEN) domain, the DEP domain, and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Liu2020DEPDC5). These domains are involved in various interactions and functions within the protein complex.

The tertiary structure of DEPDC5 involves specific folding patterns that facilitate its role in the GATOR1 complex. Protein modeling studies have shown that mutations in DEPDC5 can alter its structure, such as the p.Tyr836Cys mutation, which changes a short β sheet to a loop structure, potentially affecting protein stability (Liu2020DEPDC5). Another mutation, p.Pro1031His, forms a new bond, leading to decreased structural stability (Liu2020DEPDC5).

DEPDC5 may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its structure and function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, could also impact its function and interactions within the GATOR1 complex (Myers2017DEPDC5).

## Function
DEPDC5 is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex, which plays a significant role in regulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism, responding to amino acid availability. DEPDC5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Rag GTPases, specifically RagA and RagB, inhibiting mTORC1 activation when amino acids are scarce (Bar-Peled2013A; Hughes2017Knockout). By preventing mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomal membrane, DEPDC5 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and energy balance, particularly under nutrient stress conditions (Hughes2017Knockout).

In healthy human cells, DEPDC5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes such as autophagy and protein synthesis. Its regulatory function is crucial for proper cellular responses to nutrient availability, ensuring that mTORC1 activity is modulated appropriately (Bar-Peled2013A). Mutations in DEPDC5 can lead to hyperactivation of mTORC1, which is associated with various pathologies, including focal epilepsy and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and organismal health (Bar-Peled2013A; Hughes2017Knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DEPDC5 gene are significantly associated with various forms of epilepsy, particularly familial focal epilepsies. These include familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), and familial temporal lobe epilepsy (FTLE) (Baulac2015Familial; Zhang2021Phenotypic). DEPDC5 mutations are also linked to focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a condition characterized by malformations of cortical development that often lead to drug-resistant seizures (Myers2017DEPDC5; Ribierre2018Secondhit). The gene's role as a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway is crucial, as its inactivation leads to pathway hyperactivity, contributing to the development of epilepsy and cortical malformations (Ribierre2018Secondhit).

The "two-hit" hypothesis suggests that a combination of germline and somatic mutations in DEPDC5 can lead to FCD-associated epilepsy, highlighting the gene's involvement in both inherited and sporadic cases (Ribierre2018Secondhit). DEPDC5 mutations are also implicated in malformations of cortical development (MCD) and focal epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (FEFS+) (Liu2020DEPDC5). These mutations can result in a range of phenotypes, from mild to severe, depending on the specific genetic alterations and their impact on protein function (Liu2020DEPDC5).

## Interactions
DEPDC5 is a component of the GATOR1 complex, which includes NPRL2 and NPRL3. This complex acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Rag GTPases, specifically RagA and RagB, and plays a crucial role in inhibiting mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid availability (Bar-Peled2013A). DEPDC5 interacts with the Rag GTPases, particularly RagA and RagC, and this interaction is enhanced during amino acid starvation, suggesting a regulatory role in mTORC1 signaling (Bar-Peled2013A). 

The interaction between DEPDC5 and the Rag GTPases is essential for the regulation of mTORC1 activity and localization, affecting its translocation to the lysosomal surface (Bar-Peled2013A). DEPDC5 also interacts with NPRL2 and NPRL3 through its SABA domain, which is crucial for the intactness and function of the GATOR1 complex (Wei2020The). Mutations in DEPDC5 can disrupt these interactions, leading to over-activation of the mTOR pathway, which is associated with conditions such as focal cortical dysplasia and epilepsy (Ribierre2018Secondhit; Wei2020The).
