# PXDNL

## Overview
The PXDNL gene encodes the peroxidasin-like protein, which is a multifunctional enzyme involved in mRNA processing and regulation of translation in human cells. This protein is categorized as an mRNA endonuclease and is known for its role in mRNA decay, a critical process for gene expression regulation. The 57-kDa isoform of the protein, which lacks the C-terminal von Willebrand Factor type C domain, is the predominant form found in human cells. It contains several functional domains, including leucine-rich repeats, immunoglobulin-like repeats, and a heme peroxidase domain, which contribute to its complex structure and function (Gu2012Identification). PXDNL is also implicated in cardiac function, particularly in modulating ion channel activity, and has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias such as Early Repolarization Syndrome and Brugada Syndrome (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility). Additionally, variations in the PXDNL gene have been linked to laterality defects, highlighting its potential significance in developmental processes (Li2019Genetic).

## Structure
The PXDNL gene encodes a protein that is alternatively spliced to produce a 57-kDa isoform, which is the only form detected in most human cell lines. This isoform lacks the C-terminal von Willebrand Factor type C domain due to exon skipping (Gu2012Identification). The protein structure includes several domains: an N-terminal signal sequence, leucine-rich repeats, immunoglobulin-like repeats, an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase/hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyltransferase-like domain, a heme peroxidase domain, and a C-terminal von Willebrand Factor type C domain in the full-length form (Gu2012Identification).

The 57-kDa PXDNL protein aligns closely with the Xenopus PMR1, sharing critical residues necessary for its function as an mRNA endonuclease, including an SH3 binding site, active site histidines, and a tyrosine phosphorylation site (Gu2012Identification). The protein is known to bind to c-Src and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, which is crucial for its targeting to polysomes (Gu2012Identification). The presence of these domains and modifications suggests a complex tertiary structure that facilitates its role in mRNA decay and possibly other cellular processes. The protein's association with polysomes indicates a functional quaternary structure in the cellular context (Gu2012Identification).

## Function
The PXDNL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in mRNA processing and translation regulation in human cells. The 57-kDa form of PXDNL, identified as human PMR1, is involved in mRNA decay, a critical process for regulating gene expression. This protein binds to polysomes and is associated with mRNA translation or stability, suggesting its involvement in mRNA processing (Gu2012Identification). The decay function of PMR1 is dependent on its phosphorylation by the c-Src kinase, which facilitates its binding to specific regions of the protein, leading to the selective decay of substrate mRNA (Gu2012Identification).

In addition to its role in mRNA decay, PXDNL is expressed in the heart, particularly at the intercalated discs of ventricular cells, where it may colocalize with Na+ channels. This suggests a potential role in modulating cardiac electrical activity by influencing Na+ channel function, although its exact function in cardiac tissue remains unclear (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility). The protein's expression increases with age, indicating a possible involvement in cardiac conduction and arrhythmia development (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PXDNL gene have been associated with cardiac arrhythmias, particularly Early Repolarization Syndrome (ERS) and Brugada Syndrome (BrS). These mutations are linked to a reduction in sodium current (I Na) and an increase in transient outward current (I to), which may contribute to the arrhythmic phenotype observed in patients (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility). The presence of PXDNL variations was noted in 67 out of 403 patients screened, suggesting a potential link between these variations and cardiac arrhythmias (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility).

The PXDNL gene is also implicated in laterality defects, as studies have identified an excess burden of rare, predicted loss-of-function variations in this gene. This suggests its relevance to the broader laterality phenotype, although the specific clinical significance of these mutations is not fully detailed (Li2019Genetic).

In addition to its role in cardiac and laterality disorders, PXDNL mutations may affect cardiac electrophysiology by altering Na+ channel interactions, which could have clinical significance in arrhythmogenic conditions (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional role of PXDNL in these conditions.

## Interactions
The PXDNL protein interacts with several other proteins, notably involving its association with polysomes and the c-Src kinase. The 57-kDa form of PXDNL binds to polysomes, similar to the xPMR1 protein, and this interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. The c-Src kinase is responsible for this phosphorylation, and both active and inactive forms of c-Src can bind to the 57-kDa PXDNL. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of PXDNL occurs only in the presence of active c-Src, indicating a regulatory interaction that is crucial for its function (Gu2012Identification).

In the context of cardiac function, PXDNL has been implicated in interactions affecting ion channel activity. The R391Q mutation in PXDNL, when coexpressed with the sodium channel gene SCN5A, results in a reduced sodium current (I_Na). Conversely, when coexpressed with the potassium channel gene KCND3, it leads to an increased potassium current (I_to). These interactions suggest that PXDNL may play a role in modulating cardiac electrophysiology, potentially contributing to arrhythmic conditions (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility). The PXDNL protein is also expressed in the heart, particularly at intercalated discs, where it may colocalize with Na+ channels, further influencing cardiac ion channel dynamics (BarajasMartinez2020Susceptibility).
