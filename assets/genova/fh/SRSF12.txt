# SRSF12

## Overview
SRSF12 is a gene that encodes the serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 12, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression that determines the final mRNA transcript and, consequently, the protein product. SRSF12 functions by binding to exonic splicing enhancers and facilitating the assembly of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the precise excision of introns and ligation of exons. Beyond its role in splicing, SRSF12 is implicated in broader aspects of mRNA metabolism, including export and translation, highlighting its multifaceted role in gene expression regulation (Wagner2021Noncanonical; Zhang2024Function). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting specialized functions in these tissues. Dysregulation of SRSF12 has been linked to various cancers, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhong2023Splicing; Wang2023Systematic).

## Function
SRSF12, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. This protein is involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing by binding to exonic splicing enhancers, which facilitates the assembly of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the excision of introns and ligation of exons in pre-mRNA (Wagner2021Noncanonical; Zhang2024Function). SRSF12 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting a specialized role in these tissues compared to other SR proteins, which are more widely expressed (Zhang2024Function).

In addition to its splicing functions, SRSF12 is implicated in various aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA export and translation, indicating its broader role in gene expression regulation (Wagner2021Noncanonical). The phosphorylation state of SRSF12, regulated by specific kinases, is crucial for its activity, affecting its ability to bind RNA and participate in spliceosome assembly (Wagner2021Noncanonical). Misregulation of SRSF12 has been associated with diseases such as cancer, although its precise functions in healthy tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Wagner2021Noncanonical).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF12 gene have been associated with various cancers, impacting prognosis and disease progression. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of SRSF12 is linked to a better prognosis, suggesting a protective role in this context (Zhong2023Splicing). Conversely, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), SRSF12 is overexpressed compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression correlates with poorer prognosis, indicating that SRSF12 may serve as a prognostic biomarker in DLBCL (Wang2023Systematic). The expression of SRSF12 in DLBCL is also associated with tumor stemness, which is linked to chemotherapy resistance and aggressive cancer behavior (Wang2023Systematic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SRSF12 is one of the top five methylated splicing factors, suggesting its potential role in gene expression regulation through epigenetic mechanisms (Zhao2021Integrated). While specific mutations in SRSF12 have not been highlighted in the provided context, its expression and methylation status appear to play significant roles in the pathogenesis and progression of certain cancers. These findings underscore the importance of SRSF12 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SRSF12, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, is involved in pre-mRNA splicing through its interactions with various splicing factors and components of the spliceosome. It interacts with U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential components of the spliceosome machinery. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of alternative splicing, a process that allows a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms. SRSF12 may also bind to specific RNA sequences, influencing splicing decisions by promoting or inhibiting the inclusion of certain exons in the final mRNA transcript. These interactions highlight the role of SRSF12 in modulating gene expression and expanding the diversity of the proteome through alternative splicing mechanisms.
