# PIK3R4

## Overview
PIK3R4, also known as phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4, is a gene that encodes the VPS15 protein, a regulatory subunit of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. VPS15 is categorized as a kinase, although its kinase activity is potentially inactive, and it plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of the catalytic subunit VPS34 within the PI3K complex (Rostislavleva2015Structure). The protein is involved in several essential cellular processes, including autophagy, ciliogenesis, and intracellular trafficking. VPS15's structural features, such as its WD40 domains, facilitate interactions with other proteins, forming complexes that are vital for its function (Stoetzel2016A). Mutations in PIK3R4 have been linked to various diseases, including ciliopathies and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Shull2012Novel; Stoetzel2016A).

## Structure
The PIK3R4 gene encodes the VPS15 protein, which is a regulatory subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. VPS15 is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal protein kinase domain, a HEAT repeat, a coiled coil, and seven C-terminal WD40 domains (Stoetzel2016A). The kinase domain of VPS15, although potentially inactive, interacts with the kinase domain of VPS34, another component of the PI3K complex, and is crucial for the regulation of VPS34's activity (Rostislavleva2015Structure). The WD40 domains are important for protein-protein interactions, facilitating the formation of complexes with other proteins such as Beclin 1 and UVRAG (Stoetzel2016A).

VPS15 forms a Y-shaped structure with VPS34, where the VPS15/VPS34 heterodimer constitutes one arm of the complex. This structural arrangement is essential for the recruitment and activation of VPS34 on membranes (Rostislavleva2015Structure). The protein's structure also includes a helical solenoid that interacts with VPS34, contributing to the stabilization and membrane recruitment of the complex (Rostislavleva2015Structure). VPS15 is involved in intracellular trafficking and autophagy, with its function being influenced by its assembly into specific protein complexes (Ohashi2019VPS34).

## Function
PIK3R4, also known as phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in autophagy and ciliogenesis. In healthy human cells, PIK3R4 is a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which is essential for the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). This lipid molecule is vital for the nucleation of autophagosomes, structures that sequester and degrade cellular components, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yu2015Differential).

PIK3R4 is also involved in the regulation of primary cilium length and function. It interacts with the golgin GM130 and localizes to the Golgi apparatus, where it is part of a protein complex that facilitates the IFT20-dependent sorting and transport of membrane proteins from the cis-Golgi to the primary cilium. This process is critical for proper ciliary assembly and function, which are important for various signaling pathways and cellular responses (Stoetzel2016A).

Additionally, PIK3R4 interacts with LRBA, influencing autophagy-related processes such as autophagosome formation and lysosome organization, which are important for antigen presentation and T-cell responses (Sindram2022LRBA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIK3R4 gene, also known as VPS15, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly ciliopathies. A specific missense mutation, R998Q, in the VPS15 gene has been identified in a family with early-onset retinal degeneration, kidney failure, and mild skeletal and intellectual disabilities, which are symptoms of ciliopathy (Stoetzel2016A). This mutation affects the function of the VPS15 protein, leading to defects in primary cilia length and trafficking, which are crucial for cilia assembly and function (Stoetzel2016A). The mutation impairs the release of IFT20 from the cis-Golgi, a process essential for ciliary assembly, and is associated with ciliopathy symptoms such as retinitis pigmentosa and renal dysfunction (Stoetzel2016A).

In cancer, PIK3R4 mutations have been identified in metastatic melanoma, where they may contribute to resistance against BRAF V600 inhibitors and promote melanoma progression (Shull2012Novel). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), high expression levels of PIK3R4 are associated with poor prognosis, indicating its potential role in disease progression and as a target for therapeutic strategies (Kristensen2015High).

## Interactions
PIK3R4, also known as phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It is a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, where it interacts with the catalytic subunit VPS34 (PIK3C3) and other proteins like Beclin 1 and UVRAG, playing a significant role in autophagy and endocytic trafficking (Sindram2022LRBA).

PIK3R4 interacts with the LRBA protein through a WD40-WD40 domain interaction, which is essential for autophagosome formation. This interaction is specific, as LRBA does not physically interact with other core components of the PI3K-III complex like VPS34 or Beclin-1, but it does interact with UVRAG, suggesting that LRBA may influence UVRAG-containing PI3K-III complexes (Sindram2022LRBA).

In the context of ciliopathy, PIK3R4, also known as VPS15, interacts with the cis-Golgi protein GM130. This interaction is significant for the transport to the cilium and is required for Golgi morphology and ciliogenesis. The VPS15-GM130 complex facilitates the formation of IFT20-positive vesicles targeted from the cis-Golgi to the cilium, highlighting a role in ciliary transport (Stoetzel2016A).
