# IGFL4

## Overview
Insulin growth factor-like family member 4 (IGFL4) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family, which is known for its role in growth and development. The IGFL4 gene is responsible for producing the IGF-like family member 4 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. Although the specific functions of IGFL4 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in modulating growth factor signaling pathways. The protein encoded by IGFL4 is categorized as a growth factor due to its structural and functional similarities to other members of the IGF family. Research into IGFL4 is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential implications in developmental biology and disease pathogenesis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
