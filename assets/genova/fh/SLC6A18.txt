# SLC6A18

## Overview
The SLC6A18 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 6 member 18, also known as B0AT3, which is a member of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6) of transporters. This protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, forming a channel that facilitates the transport of substrates across cell membranes, specifically functioning as a sodium-dependent glycine/urea antiporter. SLC6A18 is primarily expressed in the proximal straight tubule of the kidney, where it plays a crucial role in the active secretion of urea and reabsorption of glycine. The protein's function is dependent on interactions with partner proteins such as collectrin and ACE2 for proper surface expression. Despite its significant role in renal physiology, SLC6A18 is considered non-functional in humans due to a common polymorphism that introduces a stop codon. Variations in the SLC6A18 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as iminoglycinuria, myocardial infarction, and mood disorders, highlighting its potential importance in both renal and neurological health (Matsumoto2011Association; Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria; Bankir2024The).

## Structure
The SLC6A18 protein, also known as B0AT3, is a member of the solute carrier family 6 and is characterized by a structure that includes 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), typical of SLC6 transporters (Pramod2013SLC6; Freissmuth2017SLC6). These domains form a channel that facilitates the transport of substrates across cell membranes. The protein's structure is organized into a 5 + 5 helical architecture, where TMs 1-5 and TMs 6-10 form two antiparallel pentahelical bundles, with TMs 11 and 12 playing peripheral roles potentially involved in regulation (Pramod2013SLC6).

SLC6A18 requires interaction with partner proteins such as collectrin or ACE2 for proper surface expression, indicating a quaternary structure component involving protein-protein interactions (Freissmuth2017SLC6; Bankir2024The). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its functional properties and stability (Bankir2024The).

Mutations in SLC6A18 can affect its folding and surface expression, highlighting the importance of its tertiary structure in maintaining functional integrity (Freissmuth2017SLC6). The protein's role as a Na-dependent glycine transporter suggests a specific substrate binding site that is crucial for its transport function (Bankir2024The).

## Function
The SLC6A18 gene encodes a protein that functions as a sodium-dependent glycine/urea antiporter, primarily expressed in the proximal straight tubule (PST) of the kidney. This transporter is involved in the active secretion of urea into the PST lumen while facilitating the reabsorption of glycine, which is exchanged with urea. The process is driven by the Na-K-ATPase pump on the basolateral side of the cell, with glycine being taken up from the blood and recycled back into the cell after being exchanged with urea (Bankir2024The). The SLC6A18 transporter requires partner proteins such as collectrin (Tmem27) or ACE2 for its surface expression in PST cells (Bankir2024The).

The transporter plays a significant role in maintaining urea balance and efficient excretion, which is crucial for preventing toxic effects like protein carbamylation. It is suggested that SLC6A18's function in urea secretion helps regulate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by influencing sodium concentration at the macula densa, potentially affecting kidney function and urine concentrating mechanisms (Bankir2024The). Despite its proposed roles, the exact function of SLC6A18 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, with some studies suggesting it may have a minor role in glycine transport (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC6A18 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. The gene is involved in the transport of neurotransmitters and amino acids, and its dysfunction can lead to disorders such as iminoglycinuria, characterized by increased urinary excretion of glycine and imino acids due to impaired reabsorption in the kidneys (Pramod2013SLC6). 

In the context of cardiovascular diseases, variations in the SLC6A18 gene have been linked to myocardial infarction (MI). The C allele of the rs7447815 SNP in SLC6A18 is more prevalent in MI patients, suggesting it as a potential genetic marker for increased MI risk. The T-C haplotype is also more frequent in MI patients, indicating susceptibility, while the T-G haplotype appears to confer resistance (Matsumoto2011Association). 

Additionally, the SLC6A18 gene's expression is implicated in neurological conditions. In mice, decreased expression of Slc6a18 in the hypothalamus is associated with aggressive and depressive behaviors, suggesting its role in neurotransmitter system alterations linked to mood disorders (Babenko2020Differentially). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a marker for altered neurotransmitter function in pathological states.

## Interactions
SLC6A18, also known as B0AT3, is a member of the solute carrier family 6 and is primarily expressed in the kidney. It is involved in the transport of neutral amino acids and requires interaction with ancillary proteins for its functional expression. One key interaction is with collectrin (TMEM27), which is necessary for the surface expression and catalytic function of SLC6A18. Collectrin stabilizes SLC6A18 and facilitates its transfer to the luminal brush border membrane of the proximal tubule in the kidney (Verrey2009Kidney; Fairweather2015Molecular).

In addition to collectrin, SLC6A18 may also interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), although this interaction is more prominently noted for its homolog, B0AT1 (SLC6A19) (Fairweather2015Molecular). The presence of collectrin is crucial for the transport activity of SLC6A18, as demonstrated by the lack of amino acid transport in the absence of this ancillary protein (Fairweather2015Molecular).

Despite these interactions, SLC6A18 is considered a non-functional gene in humans due to a frequent single-nucleotide polymorphism that introduces a stop codon, rendering it inactive (Rudnick2013The; Bröer2018Amino).
