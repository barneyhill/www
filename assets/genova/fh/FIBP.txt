# FIBP

## Overview
FIBP, or fibroblast growth factor 1 intracellular binding protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) activity. The FGF1 intracellular binding protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is associated with various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is known for its selective binding to mitogenic acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), which suggests a role in modulating the mitogenic action of FGF1. The protein is also involved in intracellular signaling and transport processes, with its expression observed across multiple human tissues, notably in the heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. FIBP's interactions with other proteins, such as CDK5 and GSK3β, further implicate it in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning; Huang2018FIBP).

## Function
FIBP (FGF1 intracellular binding protein) is involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) activity, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling pathways that influence cell growth, differentiation, and survival. FIBP specifically binds to mitogenic acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), but not to non-mitogenic mutants, indicating its selective interaction with active forms of FGF1 (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning). This binding suggests that FIBP may modulate the mitogenic action of aFGF, potentially influencing DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning).

FIBP is primarily localized in the nucleus, with smaller amounts found in the mitochondria and other cytoplasmic membranes, suggesting its involvement in nuclear processes and possibly in mitochondrial functions (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning). The protein's presence in the nucleus and its association with membranous structures imply a role in intracellular signaling and transport processes (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning).

The expression of FIBP is observed across various human tissues, with high levels in the heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, indicating its potential involvement in the physiological functions of these tissues (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning). Despite its widespread expression, the precise biological function of FIBP in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FIBP gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In CRC, FIBP is associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. High expression levels of FIBP are linked to increased tumor growth and proliferation, as well as resistance to chemotherapy drugs such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil. FIBP knockdown has been shown to inhibit CRC cell proliferation, enhance chemotherapy effectiveness, and reduce cancer stem cell markers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for chemoresistant CRC (Huang2018FIBP).

In AML, FIBP serves as a prognostic biomarker, with high expression correlating with poorer overall survival. It is associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, potentially playing a role in immune escape mechanisms. FIBP expression in AML is linked to processes such as leukocyte migration and endothelial cell proliferation, indicating its involvement in tumorigenesis and progression (Ma2023FIBP).

Overall, the dysregulation of FIBP expression is implicated in the progression and chemoresistance of certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
FIBP (FGF1 intracellular binding protein) is known to interact specifically with acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), as demonstrated by its selective binding in vitro. This interaction is specific, as FIBP binds to aFGF but not to a non-mitogenic mutant aFGF-K132E or other control proteins (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning). FIBP is also associated with microsomal membranes, where it binds aFGF, although it does not translocate into these membranes, indicating a peripheral association (KOLPAKOVA1998Cloning).

In addition to its interaction with aFGF, FIBP forms a stable protein complex with CDK5 and KIAA0528. This complex is present in various cell lines and is involved in cell growth and migration. The interaction domains have been mapped, showing that the N-terminal region of FIBP is responsible for its interaction with CDK5 and KIAA0528 (Xu2014Proteomic).

FIBP also interacts with GSK3β, inhibiting its phosphorylation at Tyr216, which in turn activates β-catenin/TCF signaling pathways. This interaction plays a role in promoting cell cycle progression and tumor growth, particularly in colorectal cancer (Huang2018FIBP). These interactions highlight FIBP's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential role in tumorigenesis.
