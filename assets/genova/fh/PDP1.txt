# PDP1

## Overview
The PDP1 gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1, a critical enzyme in cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme is a member of the PPM family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases and plays a pivotal role in regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is essential for converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, thereby linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. The PDP1 protein functions as a heterodimer, consisting of a catalytic subunit (PDP1c) and a regulatory subunit (PDP1r), with its activity modulated by divalent metal ions such as magnesium and calcium. These ions enhance PDP1's binding to the E2 component of PDC, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like skeletal muscle, brain, and heart (Turkan2004Formation; Patel2003The). Mutations in the PDP1 gene can lead to metabolic disorders, including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, highlighting its clinical significance (Bedoyan2019A).

## Structure
The pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (PDP1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The crystal structure of PDP1 reveals that it is composed of a catalytic subunit (PDP1c) and a regulatory subunit (PDP1r), forming a heterodimer (Guo2020Crystal). The catalytic subunit belongs to the PPM family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases and features a central β-sandwich structure flanked by loops and α-helices (Vassylyev2007Crystal). This β-sandwich is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets, with the catalytic site located between them, characterized by a binuclear cluster of magnesium ions (Vassylyev2007Crystal).

The PDP1c structure includes a unique long insertion forming a hydrophobic pocket, likely accommodating the lipoyl moiety of the E2 domain (Vassylyev2007Crystal). The protein exists in a dynamic monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, with functional complexes favoring the monomeric state (Vassylyev2007Crystal). The regulatory subunit, PDP1r, modulates the catalytic activity by affecting the coordination geometry of the metal ions, potentially through a magnesium-dependent mechanism (Vassylyev2007Crystal). PDP1's activity is enhanced by Ca2+-dependent binding to the L2 domain of E2, which is significant in calcium-responsive tissues (Turkan2004Formation).

## Function
PDP1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1) is a critical enzyme in cellular energy metabolism, primarily involved in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle and facilitating ATP production. PDP1 functions by dephosphorylating and reactivating the PDC, which is essential for maintaining energy production in cells (Patel2003The; KARPOVA2004Probing).

PDP1 is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (PDP1c) and a regulatory subunit (PDP1r). The catalytic activity of PDP1 is magnesium-dependent and is enhanced by calcium ions, which promote its binding to the E2 component of PDC. This binding is crucial for the enzyme's function in tissues such as skeletal muscle, brain, and heart, where energy demands are high (Turkan2004Formation; Bedoyan2019A).

In healthy human cells, PDP1 activity is regulated by divalent metal ions and hormonal signals, such as insulin, which increase its activity and thus the active portion of PDC. This regulation is vital for glucose homeostasis and adapting to metabolic changes, such as the transition from fed to fasting states (Patel2014The; Roche2001Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDP1 gene can lead to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency, a mitochondrial disorder characterized by lactic acidosis, neurological dysfunction, and developmental delays. A specific homozygous mutation, c.575dupT p.L192FfsX5, results in a premature stop codon and absence of PDP1 protein expression, causing severe congenital lactic acidosis and brain abnormalities (Bedoyan2019A). Other identified mutations include a 3-bp deletion causing the loss of leucine 213 and a G-T transversion resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid 93, both leading to reduced PDC activity (Vaneynde2022The).

In FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PDP1 is overexpressed, contributing to the metabolic shift towards oxidative phosphorylation and drug resistance. Knockdown of PDP1 in these cells results in decreased mitochondrial metabolism and growth disadvantage, highlighting its role as a metabolic gatekeeper (Alshamleh2023PDP1). This suggests that targeting PDP1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming drug resistance in this type of leukemia (Alshamleh2023PDP1).

In dogs, a null mutation in PDP1 is associated with exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis, particularly in Clumber and Sussex Spaniels, indicating a similar metabolic impact across species (Shelton2007What’s).
