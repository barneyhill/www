# MAST4

## Overview
The MAST4 gene encodes the protein microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family member 4, which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family, MAST4 plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to cell differentiation, ciliary dynamics, and neuroprotection. The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a serine/threonine kinase domain, a PDZ domain, and a domain of unknown function (DUF1908), which contribute to its enzymatic activity and protein-protein interactions (Sakaji2023MAST4; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST4 is implicated in the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as in the regulation of ciliary resorption and neuronal health (Gongol2017Cellular; Kim2022Mast4). Dysregulation of MAST4 has been associated with various pathological conditions, including osteoporosis and multiple myeloma, highlighting its significance in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Kim2022Mast4; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Structure
MAST4 is a large protein composed of approximately 2,434 amino acids and is part of the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family. It features several conserved domains, including a serine/threonine kinase domain, a PDZ domain, and a domain of unknown function (DUF1908) (Sakaji2023MAST4; Lee2020Mast4). The serine/threonine kinase domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, facilitating phosphorylation processes essential for cellular signaling (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). The PDZ domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, which are vital for the regulation of kinase activity and cellular localization (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

The DUF1908 domain, approximately 275 amino acids long, is a common feature among MAST kinases, though its specific function remains unclear. Structurally, it includes an unstructured N-terminal half and a structured C-terminal half with eight alpha-helices (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST4 also contains unique motifs such as the DFG, APE, and HRD motifs, which are essential for ATP binding and kinase activity (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating MAST4's activity, particularly in the context of ciliary resorption and spermatogenesis (Sakaji2023MAST4; Lee2020Mast4).

## Function
MAST4 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, which are crucial for bone and cartilage development. MAST4 modulates chondrogenesis by regulating the stability of Sox9, a transcription factor essential for chondrocyte differentiation. It phosphorylates Sox9 at serine 494, targeting it for degradation, thereby influencing MSC differentiation (Kim2022Mast4; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST4 also plays a role in osteogenesis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt3a stimulation increases MAST4 expression, which stabilizes β-catenin and enhances Runx2 expression, promoting osteogenic differentiation (Kim2022Mast4). Additionally, MAST4 is involved in ciliary resorption, a process essential for cell cycle progression. It phosphorylates Tctex-1 at Thr94, facilitating ciliary resorption and maintaining ciliary dynamics (Sakaji2023MAST4).

In the context of neuroprotection, MAST4 is implicated in the cellular response to 27-hydroxycholesterol, promoting neuronal health by phosphorylating FOXO1, which decreases transcriptional repression of RTKN2, contributing to an anti-apoptotic phenotype (Gongol2017Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MAST4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of bone and cartilage development, MAST4 plays a crucial role in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Depletion of MAST4 enhances chondrogenesis and leads to excessive cartilage synthesis, while also resulting in an osteoporotic phenotype characterized by reduced bone volume and mineral density (Kim2022Mast4). This suggests that MAST4 is essential for balanced bone and cartilage development, and its dysregulation may contribute to conditions such as osteoporosis and abnormal ossification (Kim2022Mast4).

In multiple myeloma, MAST4 is identified as an estrogen response gene that acts as a negative regulator of bone disease associated with the condition. Its expression levels negatively correlate with the severity of osteolytic lesions, indicating a protective role against bone degradation in this context (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). Additionally, MAST4 is involved in neuronal homeostasis and spermatogenesis. Knockdown of MAST4 in mice leads to a craniofacial phenotype and osteoporosis, as well as reduced sperm count and testis size, resembling Sertoli cell-only syndrome (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). These findings highlight the potential impact of MAST4 dysregulation on various physiological processes and disease states.

## Interactions
MAST4, a member of the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. In pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells, MAST4 interacts with AKT3 in the nucleus, leading to the inactivation of the transcription factor FOXO3. This interaction results in increased phosphorylation of FOXO3, contributing to chemoresistance by suppressing apoptosis-related gene expression (FujiwaraTani2024Nuclear).

MAST4 also interacts with Tctex-1, a dynein light-chain protein, playing a crucial role in ciliary resorption. The serine/threonine kinase domain of MAST4 binds to Tctex-1, facilitating its phosphorylation at Thr94, which is essential for ciliary dynamics. This interaction is critical for the activation of downstream pathways involved in ciliary resorption (Sakaji2023MAST4).

In the context of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal, MAST4 phosphorylates the ETS-related molecule (ERM) at serine 367, regulating the transcription of ERM target genes. This phosphorylation is part of the FGF2/ERM pathway, which is vital for maintaining the SSC niche (Lee2020Mast4).

MAST4 also modulates chondrogenesis by affecting the stability of the Sox9 protein. It influences the interaction between Sox9 and Smad3, enhancing Sox9-dependent transcriptional activation during chondrogenesis (Kim2022Mast4).
