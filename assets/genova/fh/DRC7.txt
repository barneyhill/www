# DRC7

## Overview
The DRC7 gene encodes the dynein regulatory complex subunit 7, a critical component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) involved in the regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility. The DRC7 protein, also known as FAP50, is characterized by its large size and the presence of conserved domains such as leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a transglutaminase-like (TGL) peptidase domain, which suggest roles in protein-protein interactions and enzymatic activity (Viswanadha2017Ciliary; Lin2011Building). As part of the N-DRC, DRC7 is essential for the proper assembly and function of motile cilia and flagella, particularly in the testis, where it is crucial for spermatogenesis and sperm flagellum formation (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). Mutations in the DRC7 gene are linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF), leading to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility and structural defects (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). The study of DRC7 provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary and flagellar function and their associated pathologies.

## Structure
The DRC7 protein, also known as FAP50, is the largest subunit of the dynein regulatory complex (DRC), with a molecular weight of 177 kDa. It contains several conserved domains, including leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences in the amino-terminal third of the polypeptide and a transglutaminase-like (TGL) peptidase domain in the carboxy-terminal third. These motifs suggest a complex structure with potential roles in protein-protein interactions and enzymatic activity (Viswanadha2017Ciliary).

DRC7 is rich in protein-protein interaction domains, such as coiled-coil, LRR, and Kelch domains, which are typically involved in mediating interactions with other proteins (Lin2011Building). The protein is part of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and interacts with other components like DRC10 and DRC3, as indicated by cross-linking data (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). DRC7 is located in the middle part of the linker region of the N-DRC, acting as a signal transfer bridge between proximal and distal lobes (Ghanaeian2023Integrated).

The presence of LRR and Kelch domains in DRC7 suggests its involvement in the regulation of flagellar motility and its localization to doublet microtubules (Lin2011Building). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DRC7 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The DRC7 gene encodes a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which is essential for the proper assembly and function of motile cilia and flagella. The N-DRC plays a critical role in maintaining the alignment of outer doublet microtubules within the axoneme, a central structure of cilia and flagella characterized by a '9+2' microtubule arrangement (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein; Bower2013The). DRC7 is involved in regulating dynein motor activity, which is crucial for converting dynein-generated sliding motion into ciliary and flagellar bending, thereby facilitating cellular motility and signaling (Ghanaeian2023Integrated).

In healthy cells, DRC7 is primarily expressed in the testis, where it is vital for spermatogenesis and the formation of the sperm flagellum. Its absence leads to disorganized axonemes and immotile spermatozoa, resulting in male infertility (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). DRC7 interacts with other N-DRC components, such as DRC3 and TCTE1, to ensure proper axoneme formation and function (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). The protein's role in stabilizing the N-DRC is crucial for axoneme elongation and the correct localization of proteins involved in flagellar motility (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the DRC7 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF), a condition characterized by defects in sperm flagellar structure and function, leading to male infertility. In mice, the absence of DRC7 results in impaired sperm motility and reduced fertility due to flagellar malformation, which mirrors the human MMAF phenotype (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). The DRC7 gene is crucial for the proper formation of the sperm flagellum, and its disruption leads to disorganized axoneme structures, short sperm tails, and abnormal head shapes (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein).

Despite the severe impact on spermatozoa, DRC7 mutations do not appear to affect the function of ependymal and tracheal cilia, suggesting a specific role in sperm flagellum formation distinct from other ciliary structures (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). The study of DRC7 in mice highlights its potential as a candidate gene for unexplained cases of MMAF in humans, as only a fraction of these cases have known genetic causes (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein).

## Interactions
DRC7, a component of the dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in ciliary and flagellar motility. It is located in the middle part of the linker region of the N-DRC, connecting the proximal and distal lobes. DRC7 interacts with the DRC9/10 coiled-coil and the α-helix bundle domain of DRC3 in the distal lobe, and with the DRC4A/4B coiled-coil in the proximal lobe, acting as a signal transfer bridge between these lobes (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). Despite its role in connecting these domains, the loss of DRC7 does not affect the overall assembly of the N-DRC, indicating that its absence does not disrupt the complex's structure (Ghanaeian2023Integrated).

In mice, DRC7 is essential for sperm flagellum formation and male fertility. It interacts with TCTE1 (DRC5) and FBXL13 (DRC6) in cultured cells, and its absence in knockout mice leads to disorganized axonemal structures and impaired flagellar formation (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). DRC7 also interacts with DRC3 and GAS8, with its absence resulting in decreased levels of these proteins, suggesting that DRC7 stabilizes the N-DRC structure (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein).
