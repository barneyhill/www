# ARPP19

## Overview
ARPP19, or cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 19, is a gene that encodes an intrinsically disordered protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. The protein, also referred to as ARPP19, functions primarily as an inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates protein phosphorylation essential for cell signaling and mitotic progression (Thapa2021The; GharbiAyachi2010The). ARPP19 achieves this regulatory role through phosphorylation by the Greatwall kinase, which enhances its inhibitory interaction with PP2A-B55, ensuring proper mitotic timing and progression (Haccard2011Greatwall; Hached2019ENSA). The protein's structure is characterized by its lack of a stable three-dimensional conformation, allowing it to interact dynamically with other proteins and undergo post-translational modifications that modulate its function (Thapa2021The; Padi2023CryoEM). ARPP19's dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Thapa2021The; Song2014Increased).

## Structure
ARPP19 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that lacks a stable three-dimensional structure, existing instead as an ensemble of transient conformations (Thapa2021The). The primary structure of ARPP19 includes regions that are enriched with hydrophilic and charged residues, typical of IDPs, which contribute to its conformational flexibility (Thapa2021The). The protein can adopt various conformations, with some being more compact than others, and it features transient secondary structure elements such as α-helices (Thapa2021The).

ARPP19 interacts with the PP2A:B55 complex using a tripartite mechanism involving three distinct sites. Specific residues, such as those in helices α2 and α3, play a crucial role in binding to the B55 platform and PP2Ac active site (Padi2023CryoEM). The protein's structure includes a helix-turn-helix 'V' conformation, which is important for its interaction with PP2A:B55 (Padi2023CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation at sites like Ser62 and Ser104, are critical for ARPP19's function as an inhibitor of PP2A, enhancing its inhibitory activity upon thiophosphorylation (Padi2023CryoEM). These modifications do not induce stable tertiary structures but can affect the protein's conformation and interactions (Thapa2021The).

## Function
ARPP19 (cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 19) is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. It functions primarily by inhibiting Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in regulating protein phosphorylation, which is essential for cell signaling and mitotic progression (Thapa2021The; GharbiAyachi2010The). ARPP19 is phosphorylated by the Greatwall kinase (GWL) at serine 62, which enhances its ability to bind and inhibit PP2A-B55, ensuring proper timing and progression of mitosis (Haccard2011Greatwall; Hached2019ENSA). This phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining the mitotic state and preventing premature dephosphorylation of mitotic substrates (Hached2019ENSA).

In healthy human cells, ARPP19 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cell division by regulating the dephosphorylation kinetics of key mitotic substrates, thereby ensuring proper chromosome condensation and segregation (Hached2019ENSA). The absence of ARPP19 leads to severe developmental abnormalities, particularly affecting gastrulation and mitosis progression, highlighting its essential role in embryogenesis (Hached2019ENSA). ARPP19's interaction with PP2A is also implicated in various signaling pathways, contributing to its role in maintaining normal physiological cellular functions (Thapa2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of ARPP19 (cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19) have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ARPP19 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to non-tumorous liver tissues, correlating positively with tumor size and suggesting a role in tumor growth and cell proliferation (Song2014Increased). The knockdown of ARPP19 in hepatocarcinoma cell lines results in reduced cell growth and increased G2/M phase arrest, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Song2014Increased).

In breast cancer, ARPP19 is targeted by microRNA-320a, which is downregulated in tamoxifen-resistant cells. This downregulation contributes to resistance by allowing increased ARPP19 expression, which enhances oncogenic pathways involving c-Myc and Cyclin D1 (Lü2015MicroRNA320a). Restoring miR-320a expression or targeting ARPP19 could potentially overcome tamoxifen resistance (Lü2015MicroRNA320a).

ARPP19 is also overexpressed in other aggressive cancers, such as glioma and acute myeloid leukemia, where it acts as a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key regulator of cell signaling and mitosis (Thapa2021The). This inhibition is linked to cancer progression, highlighting ARPP19 as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ARPP19 interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), primarily inhibiting its activity to regulate mitotic progression. This interaction is mediated through phosphorylation by Greatwall kinase (Gwl), which enhances ARPP19's ability to bind and inhibit PP2A, promoting mitotic entry (Diril2023Genetic; GharbiAyachi2010The). ARPP19 binds to the PP2A scaffolding A-subunit with low micromolar affinity, facilitated by a short linear motif formed by a transient α-helix and flanking amino acids. This interaction is dynamic, characterized by rapid association and dissociation, and maintains a high degree of disorder outside the binding motif (Thapa2021The).

Phosphorylation of ARPP19 at specific serine residues, such as S62, is crucial for its interaction with PP2A. Mutation of this site to alanine prevents ARPP19 from binding to PP2A, highlighting the importance of this phosphorylation for the interaction (GharbiAyachi2010The). ARPP19 also interacts with the regulatory B-subunits of PP2A, with phosphorylation increasing its affinity toward the B56 subunits (Thapa2021The). These interactions form 'fuzzy complexes,' where ARPP19 remains largely disordered and forms multivalent, rapidly exchanging interactions (Thapa2021The).
