# CXCL5

## Overview
CXCL5 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5, a member of the CXC chemokine family. This protein functions primarily as a chemoattractant, guiding neutrophils to sites of inflammation and infection, thereby playing a crucial role in immune response and tissue repair (Sepuru2014Solution; Walz1991Structure). CXCL5 interacts with the CXCR2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, to mediate neutrophil trafficking and activation (Sepuru2014Solution; Sepuru2016Molecular). Additionally, CXCL5 is involved in promoting angiogenesis, which is essential for tissue growth and repair (Fernandez2002Structure). The protein's structure includes a conserved ELR motif and it can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the latter having a higher affinity for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the extracellular matrix, which helps establish chemotactic gradients (Sepuru2014Solution; Sepuru2016Molecular). CXCL5 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Zhang2020CXCL5CXCR2; Dai2016CXCL5).

## Structure
The CXCL5 protein, a member of the CXC chemokine family, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure of CXCL5 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, including a highly conserved ELR motif in the N-terminal tail, which is crucial for its receptor activity (Sepuru2014Solution).

The secondary structure of CXCL5 includes a six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a pair of alpha-helices. The monomer structure features an extended N-terminal loop, followed by three beta-strands and a terminal alpha-helix (Sepuru2014Solution). The tertiary structure is stabilized by long-range hydrophobic contacts and disulfide bonds, with the N-terminal loop being flexible and packed against the third beta-strand and C-terminal helical residues (Sepuru2014Solution).

In terms of quaternary structure, CXCL5 exists as a dimer at higher concentrations and lower pH, with a monomer-dimer equilibrium constant averaging 0.3 mM (Sepuru2014Solution). The dimeric form is the high-affinity ligand for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding, with specific lysine residues mediating these interactions (Sepuru2016Molecular). The structure of CXCL5 is similar to other chemokines like CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL7, and CXCL8, with sequence identity ranging from 20 to 30% (Sepuru2014Solution).

## Function
CXCL5, also known as epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA-78), is a chemokine involved in various molecular processes crucial for immune response and tissue repair. It primarily functions as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, guiding them to sites of inflammation and infection, which is essential for effective immune surveillance and response (Sepuru2014Solution; Walz1991Structure). CXCL5 activates the CXCR2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, which plays a significant role in neutrophil trafficking and activation (Sepuru2014Solution; Sepuru2016Molecular).

In healthy human cells, CXCL5 is involved in promoting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is vital for tissue growth and repair (Fernandez2002Structure). It is expressed in specialized cells such as epithelial type II cells in the lung and white adipose tissue macrophages, where it mediates functions like microbial killing and tissue repair (Sepuru2014Solution). CXCL5 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the extracellular matrix, which helps establish chemotactic gradients necessary for cellular trafficking (Sepuru2016Molecular). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the balance between the free monomer and GAG-bound dimer forms of CXCL5, regulating its receptor activation and function (Sepuru2016Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it plays a significant role in tumor progression, metastasis, and prognosis. CXCL5 is overexpressed in numerous cancer types, including breast, bladder, non-small cell lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers, among others. Its high expression is associated with advanced clinical stages, poor prognosis, and increased metastatic potential (Zhang2020CXCL5CXCR2). In glioma, CXCL5 promotes cell proliferation and migration, contributing to higher tumor grades and shorter survival times (Dai2016CXCL5). 

In colorectal cancer, CXCL5 levels are significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in cancer pathogenesis (Dimberg2007Expression). In glioblastoma multiforme, CXCL5 is upregulated and associated with immune cell infiltration, impacting patient prognosis (Yu2024Prognostic). 

The CXCL5/CXCR2 axis is also involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Qiu2018The). In kidney and breast cancers, CXCL5 is linked to drug resistance, with its expression correlating with tumor aggressiveness and survival outcomes (Giuliano2019Resistance).

## Interactions
CXCL5 interacts primarily with the CXCR2 receptor, playing a significant role in neutrophil trafficking and immune response. The interaction involves the N-loop of CXCL5 binding to the N-terminal domain of CXCR2, while the N-terminal residues of CXCL5 interact with the extracellular loops and transmembrane helices of the receptor (Sepuru2014Solution). CXCL5 can exist as both monomers and dimers, with both forms capable of acting as CXCR2 agonists (Sepuru2014Solution).

CXCL5 also engages in interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. These interactions are crucial for establishing chemotactic gradients and are mediated by electrostatic interactions involving basic residues like His-23, Lys-25, Lys-49, and Lys-52 (Sepuru2019Structural). The binding of GAGs to CXCL5 can occlude receptor-binding sites, suggesting that GAG-bound CXCL5 is unlikely to activate the CXCR2 receptor (Sepuru2016Molecular). The dimeric form of CXCL5 shows a higher affinity for GAGs compared to the monomeric form, indicating that dimerization enhances its binding interactions with GAGs (Sepuru2019Structural).
