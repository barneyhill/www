# PRB3

## Overview
The PRB3 gene encodes the proline-rich protein BstNI subfamily 3, a glycosylated protein predominantly found in human saliva. This protein is characterized by its high proline content and is involved in various oral functions, including defense mechanisms and interactions with oral microorganisms. The protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, such as N- and O-glycosylation, which contribute to its structural complexity and functional diversity. PRB3 exists in multiple size variants, which differ in glycosylation sites and overall length, allowing it to perform distinct roles in the oral cavity. Notably, the Gl8 variant forms a disulfide-bonded heterodimer with salivary peroxidase, highlighting its unique structural properties (Kim1993The; Manconi2016N‐; Padiglia2018Extensive; Manconi2016The).

## Structure
The PRB3 gene encodes a glycosylated proline-rich protein that is a significant component of human saliva. The primary structure of PRB3 is characterized by a high content of proline, glycine, and glutamic acid/glutamine, which constitute 70-85% of the protein's composition (Kim1993The). The protein includes repetitive sequences encoded by the third exon, which consists entirely of 63-bp tandem repeats (Kim1993The).

PRB3 proteins undergo extensive post-translational modifications, including N- and O-glycosylation. The protein is known to have eight different neutral and sialylated glycans O-linked to threonine 50 and 33 different glycans N-linked to asparagine residues at specific positions (Manconi2016N‐). These glycosylation patterns contribute to the protein's structural complexity and functional diversity (Manconi2016N‐).

The PRB3 gene produces multiple size variants, such as Gl1, Gl2, and Gl3, which differ in the number of potential N-glycosylation sites and overall length (Manconi2016The). The Gl8 variant is distinct due to a single nucleotide insertion that results in a disulfide-bonded heterodimer formation with salivary peroxidase (Padiglia2018Extensive). These structural variations allow PRB3 proteins to play roles in oral defense and interaction with oral microorganisms (Manconi2016The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRB3 gene have been associated with clinical implications in prolactinomas, a type of pituitary tumor. Studies have shown that low levels of PRB3 mRNA are linked to resistance to dopamine-agonist treatments, such as bromocriptine, which are commonly used to manage prolactinomas. This resistance is significant because it can lead to tumor recurrence, posing challenges in the effective treatment of these tumors (Wang2013Low). Specifically, PRB3 mRNA levels were found to be about fourfold lower in bromocriptine-resistant prolactinomas compared to responsive ones, and fivefold lower than in normal pituitary glands (Wang2013Low).

The clinical significance of PRB3 in prolactinomas suggests its potential role as a biomarker for predicting treatment response and prognosis. Patients with lower PRB3 expression may have a higher likelihood of experiencing tumor recurrence, highlighting the importance of monitoring PRB3 levels in managing prolactinomas (De2019The). Despite these findings, no significant correlation was found between PRB3 mRNA levels and other clinical parameters such as age, gender, tumor size, or serum prolactin levels, indicating that PRB3's role is specific to treatment resistance and recurrence (Wang2013Low).
