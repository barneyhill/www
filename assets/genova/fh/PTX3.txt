# PTX3

## Overview
PTX3, or pentraxin 3, is a gene that encodes a long pentraxin protein involved in various biological processes, particularly within the innate immune system. The PTX3 protein is a pattern recognition receptor that plays a crucial role in identifying and facilitating the clearance of pathogens and damaged cells. Structurally, PTX3 is characterized by its multimeric form, consisting of a C-terminal pentraxin domain and a unique N-terminal region, distinguishing it from classical pentraxins like C-reactive protein (CRP) (Massimino2023Structural; Bottazzi1997Multimer). Functionally, PTX3 is involved in modulating the complement system, enhancing tissue repair, and influencing inflammatory responses. It interacts with various components of the immune system, including complement proteins and growth factors, impacting processes such as angiogenesis and tissue remodeling (Massimino2023Structural; Doni2019The). Clinically, PTX3 is significant as a biomarker in several diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis and severity (Garlanda2018PTX3; Zhou2022PanCancer).

## Structure
The PTX3 protein is a member of the long pentraxin family, characterized by its unique structural features. It consists of a C-terminal pentraxin domain and an N-terminal region, which is distinct from classical pentraxins like C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP) (Massimino2023Structural; Bottazzi1997Multimer). The primary structure includes a signal peptide and a pentraxin domain, with the protein being glycosylated, contributing to its molecular mass (Bottazzi1997Multimer).

The secondary structure of PTX3 predominantly consists of β-sheets, with a minor α-helical component (Bottazzi1997Multimer). The tertiary structure forms a cyclic multimer, and PTX3 can oligomerize into an octamer composed of eight identical protomers linked by disulfide bonds (Inforzato2010The). This octameric structure is elongated and asymmetric, with two distinct domains connected by a stalk (Inforzato2010The).

The N-terminal region is crucial for oligomerization, forming tetramers and dimers through disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's asymmetry (Inforzato2010The). PTX3's structure includes hinge regions and intrinsically disordered regions, providing flexibility and adaptability for diverse interactions (Massimino2023Structural). The protein's quaternary structure and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are essential for its biological functions (Bottazzi1997Multimer).

## Function
PTX3 (pentraxin 3) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in the innate immune system. It acts as a pattern recognition molecule, identifying microbial components and damaged tissues, and facilitating their clearance through phagocytosis (Doni2019The). PTX3 is involved in modulating the complement system, interacting with components such as C1q, Ficolin-2, and Factor H, which influences the classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways (Massimino2023Structural; Deban2010Pentraxins). This modulation helps maintain complement homeostasis and prevents excessive inflammation.

In tissue repair, PTX3 enhances fibrinolysis by interacting with plasminogen and fibrin, promoting plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation, which is crucial for wound healing and thrombus resolution (Doni2019The). PTX3 also plays a role in bone homeostasis, with its deficiency leading to impaired bone formation and repair (Doni2019The).

Structurally, PTX3 forms an octameric complex that allows it to bind various ligands, including fibroblast growth factors, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis and influencing cancer-related processes (Massimino2023Structural; Inforzato2010The). PTX3 is active in the extracellular matrix, where it interacts with hyaluronic acid and other components, impacting inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cellular processes (Massimino2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PTX3 expression and mutations have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, PTX3 expression is often dysregulated, with high levels associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including ovarian epithelial cancer, where it serves as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Chang2021Pentraxin; Bogdan2022Insights). PTX3 is also implicated in the progression of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where it acts as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-specific survival (Zhou2022PanCancer). 

In colorectal cancer, PTX3 gene silencing through STAT3-mediated hypermethylation suggests a role in carcinogenesis (Doni2019The). PTX3's involvement in immune response pathways, such as complement activation and PI3K-AKT signaling, highlights its role in tumor immune interactions (Zhou2022PanCancer). 

PTX3 also plays a role in cardiovascular diseases, with its levels rapidly increasing in response to inflammatory conditions like acute myocardial infarction and sepsis, serving as a potential biomarker for disease severity (Garlanda2018PTX3). Genetic polymorphisms in PTX3 have been linked to variations in disease susceptibility and PTX3 blood levels, impacting conditions such as tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis (Garlanda2018PTX3).

## Interactions
PTX3 (pentraxin 3) is a long pentraxin protein that participates in various interactions with components of the immune system, playing a crucial role in modulating immune responses. PTX3 interacts with C1q, a component of the classical complement pathway, which can lead to either activation or inhibition of the complement cascade depending on the context (Nauta2003Biochemical; Erreni2017The; Inforzato2013PTX3). This interaction is specific and requires the multimeric structure of PTX3, which forms decamers stabilized by disulfide bonds (Bottazzi1997Multimer).

PTX3 also interacts with components of the lectin pathway, such as ficolin-1, ficolin-2, and mannose-binding lectin, enhancing complement deposition on pathogens (Inforzato2013PTX3; Massimino2023Structural). It binds to negative regulators of complement activation like Factor H and C4b-binding protein, modulating the alternative pathway and reducing complement activation (Erreni2017The; Massimino2023Structural).

Beyond complement interactions, PTX3 binds to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), TNFα-induced protein 6 (TSG6), myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2), interα-inhibitor (IαI), and P-selectin, influencing various biological processes such as inflammation and tissue repair (Garlanda2018PTX3; Erreni2017The). PTX3's interaction with P-selectin reduces leukocyte recruitment and inflammation in models of acute lung injury (Inforzato2013PTX3).
