# FILIP1

## Overview
The FILIP1 gene encodes the filamin A interacting protein 1, a cytolinker protein that plays a significant role in cellular architecture and dynamics. This protein is involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton by interacting with filamin A (FLNa) and filamin C (FLNc), which are crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating movement. FILIP1 is characterized by several domains, including a cortactin-binding protein-2 domain and a structural maintenance of chromosome domain, which are essential for its function in cellular processes (Schnabel2023Homozygous). It is implicated in muscle differentiation and repair, as well as in neuronal development, by modulating the stability and degradation of filamin proteins (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting). Additionally, FILIP1 interacts with microtubule plus-end-binding proteins, suggesting its role in microtubule organization and stabilization (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting). The protein's function is further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and alternative splicing, which result in different isoforms with potentially distinct roles (Reimann2020Phosphoproteomics).

## Structure
The FILIP1 gene encodes the Filamin-A-interacting protein 1, which plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization by interacting with filamin A (FLNa) and filamin C (FLNc). The protein contains several important domains, including a cortactin-binding protein-2 domain (CortBP2) at its N-terminus and a central structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) domain. These domains are essential for its function in cellular processes, although their precise roles remain unclear (Schnabel2023Homozygous).

FILIP1 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of myofibrils and interacts with microtubule plus-end-binding proteins EB1 and EB3, suggesting its role as a cytolinker protein (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting). The protein also contains SxIP amino acid motifs that interact with end-binding proteins, which are part of the microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating FILIP1's interactions. Phosphorylation of FLNc affects its binding to FILIP1, with non-phosphorylated FLNc showing stronger binding, which influences its stability and degradation (Reimann2020Phosphoproteomics). The protein's expression and function are also influenced by alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, such as FILIP1-4, which lacks exon 6 (Reimann2020Phosphoproteomics).

## Function
The FILIP1 gene encodes the filamin-A-interacting protein 1, which plays a crucial role in both neurological and muscular functions. In muscle cells, FILIP1 is involved in early muscle differentiation and is expressed in regenerating muscle fibers. It interacts with filamin-C (FLNc) and microtubule plus-end-binding protein EB3, contributing to the assembly and stabilization of myofibrils. FILIP1 is initially associated with microtubules and colocalizes with EB3 before localizing to myofibrillar Z-discs during myofibril maturation. It is implicated in the repair of myofibrillar lesions induced by mechanical stress, suggesting a protective role against damage (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting).

FILIP1 also acts as an adapter protein linking the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules, potentially through interaction with microtubule plus-end tracking proteins EB1 and EB3. This interaction is important for microtubule organization in myocytes. During myogenic differentiation, FILIP1 expression increases alongside FLNc and EB3, and it is involved in microtubule stabilization through tubulin acetylation, which is crucial for mechanical signal transmission and muscle repair (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting).

In neuronal cells, FILIP1 is involved in the degradation of filamin A (FLNa), which is crucial for ceasing myoblast migration and facilitating terminal differentiation into myotubes, similar to its role in terminating the migration of neocortical cells (Grande2023FilaminAinteracting).

## Interactions
FILIP1 (filamin A interacting protein 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular dynamics. It interacts with filamin A (FLNa), a cytoskeletal protein, linking actin filaments and influencing cell shape and movement. This interaction is important for regulating actin dynamics and is mediated through the binding of FILIP1 to the actin-binding protein FLNa (Gad2012RhoD).

FILIP1 also interacts with filamin C (FLNc) in muscle cells, particularly during muscle differentiation and maintenance. The interaction is modulated by phosphorylation events; phosphorylated FLNc binds less efficiently to FILIP1, which affects FLNc's stability and dynamics (Reimann2020Phosphoproteomics).

In addition, FILIP1 binds to non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIb (NMHC IIb), a component of myosin 2b, influencing its distribution and potentially altering the distribution of NMDA receptors in neurons. This interaction affects spine morphology and synaptic plasticity (Yagi2014Filamin).

FILIP1 is also a binding partner of RhoD, a member of the RhoGTPases family, which stabilizes microtubules and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is GTP-dependent and plays a role in cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing processes like cell attachment and migration (Gad2012RhoD).
