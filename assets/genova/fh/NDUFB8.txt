# NDUFB8

## Overview
NDUFB8 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8, an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, playing a crucial role in the assembly and stability of complex I, although it does not directly participate in the catalytic activity. NDUFB8 is characterized by a single transmembrane helix and is involved in forming a supernumerary cage that supports the core membrane domain of complex I, thereby maintaining its structural integrity (Zhu2016Structure; Padavannil2022The). The protein's interactions with other subunits are essential for the proper function of oxidative phosphorylation, and mutations in the NDUFB8 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, resulting in conditions such as Leigh-like encephalomyopathy (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8).

## Structure
The NDUFB8 protein is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is characterized by a single transmembrane helix (TMH) with an N-terminal domain located in the mitochondrial matrix and a short C-terminal coil in the intermembrane space (IMS) (Padavannil2022The). The NDUFB8 subunit is part of a helix latticework on the IMS face, interacting with other subunits such as ND4, ND5, and ND6, which contributes to the stability of the enzyme complex (Zhu2016Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, NDUFB8 interacts with several other subunits within complex I. In the matrix, it interacts with subunits like NDUFB4, ND4, ND5, NDUFB9, and NDUFAB1-β, while in the IMS, its C-terminal coil interacts with ND5, NDUFB7, NDUFB10, and NDUFB2 (Padavannil2022The). These interactions are crucial for the assembly and stability of complex I, as mutations in NDUFB8 can lead to complex I deficiency and associated diseases (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8).

The protein's structure is further stabilized by its involvement in a supernumerary cage that supports the core membrane domain of complex I, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Zhu2016Structure).

## Function
NDUFB8 is a nuclear-encoded accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain. In healthy human cells, NDUFB8 plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of complex I, contributing to the proper function of oxidative phosphorylation (Padavannil2022The; PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8). It is not directly involved in the catalytic activity of complex I but acts as a membrane anchor, essential for the full assembly of the holoenzyme (Wang2019γTocotrienol).

NDUFB8 is located in the hydrophobic membrane arm of complex I and is involved in the formation of supercomplexes with complex III, enhancing the kinetic efficiency of electron transfer and reducing superoxide production (Francis2014Reduced). It interacts with several other subunits, including ND5, NDUFB2, NDUFB3, NDUFB7, NDUFB9, and NDUFAB1-β, and is part of the P D -b subassembly (Padavannil2022The).

Mutations or alterations in NDUFB8 can lead to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, resulting in conditions such as Leigh-like encephalomyopathy, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFB8 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a condition that can manifest as Leigh-like encephalomyopathy. This deficiency is a common biochemical defect in childhood mitochondrial diseases, leading to symptoms such as muscular hypotonia, cardiac hypertrophy, respiratory failure, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Affected individuals often exhibit elevated blood lactate levels and progressive neuroimaging changes in the basal ganglia and brain stem, which are typical of Leigh syndrome (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8).

The study identified several mutations in the NDUFB8 gene, including missense mutations c.184T>C (p.Tyr62His) and c.227C>A (p.Pro76Gln), as well as a loss-of-function mutation c.189delA (p.Glu63Aspfs*35). These mutations were linked to symmetrical basal ganglia and capsula interna lesions, with some cases showing progressive brain atrophy (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8). The c.432C>G mutation was found to create a new splice donor site, leading to exon 4 skipping in the NDUFB8 transcript, which disrupts normal mitochondrial function (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8).

Functional complementation studies demonstrated that introducing the wild-type NDUFB8 gene into fibroblasts from affected individuals restored normal mitochondrial function, confirming the pathogenic role of these mutations (PiekutowskaAbramczuk2018NDUFB8). These findings underscore the critical role of NDUFB8 in maintaining mitochondrial complex I stability and activity, with mutations leading to severe neurological phenotypes.

## Interactions
NDUFB8 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a critical role in the electron transport chain. It is a nuclear-encoded component that is essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I. Although NDUFB8 does not have a direct catalytic role, it is crucial for the structural integrity and stability of the complex. This subunit interacts with other components within complex I to facilitate electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, a process vital for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Francis2014Reduced).

NDUFB8 is also involved in interactions that affect mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics. It has been identified as a target for nitration by reactive nitrogen species, which can lead to a decrease in complex I activity and contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. This nitration process is linked to the formation of nitrotyrosine residues on NDUFB8, affecting its interaction with other subunits and leading to bioenergetic collapse and necrotic cell death pathways mediated by RIP1 and RIP3 kinases (Davis2010Nitration). These interactions highlight the importance of NDUFB8 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its potential role in disease mechanisms.
