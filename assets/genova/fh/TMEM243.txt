# TMEM243

## Overview
TMEM243 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 243, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of multidrug resistance (MDR) and cancer. TMEM243 is co-amplified with sorcin, a calcium-binding protein, suggesting a potential role in drug resistance mechanisms through shared pathways or regulatory interactions (Wang2021Soluble). In cancer research, TMEM243 has been associated with resistance to taxane drugs, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, in breast cancer cells, indicating its involvement in the development of drug resistance (Hansen2016The). Additionally, TMEM243 has been identified as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease due to its upregulation in patient blood samples (Jin2020Weighted). Despite its significant roles in these conditions, TMEM243 has limited diagnostic value in gastric cancer (Cui2021Identification). Further research is necessary to fully understand the protein's interactions and implications in various disease contexts.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM243 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In Parkinson's disease (PD), TMEM243 is notably upregulated in the blood samples of patients. This upregulation has been validated as a potential diagnostic biomarker for PD, with studies indicating its ability to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 56% (Jin2020Weighted).

In the context of cancer, TMEM243 has been associated with resistance to chemotherapy. Specifically, its overexpression is linked to resistance to paclitaxel in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting a role in tumor progression rather than initiation (Lee2018Genomic). Additionally, TMEM243 is upregulated in taxane-resistant prostate cancer cells, indicating a potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Cevatemre2024Exploiting).

Despite its involvement in these conditions, TMEM243 has not shown significant diagnostic value in gastric cancer. Studies have identified it as a candidate tumor-associated antigen, but its autoantibody levels did not significantly differ between gastric cancer patients and healthy controls, suggesting limited utility in this context (Cui2021Identification).

## Interactions
TMEM243, a transmembrane protein, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. In the context of multidrug resistance (MDR), TMEM243 is co-amplified with sorcin, a soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein, suggesting a potential interaction or co-regulation in these settings (Wang2021Soluble). This co-amplification indicates that TMEM243 may play a role in the cellular response to drug resistance, possibly through shared pathways or regulatory mechanisms with sorcin.

In the realm of cancer research, TMEM243 has been associated with resistance to taxane drugs, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, in breast cancer cells. Its overexpression has been linked to the development of resistance, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Hansen2016The). This suggests that TMEM243 might be part of a network of proteins that contribute to drug resistance mechanisms, potentially through interactions that affect cellular signaling or structural dynamics.

These interactions highlight the importance of TMEM243 in various disease contexts, particularly in relation to drug resistance, although further research is needed to elucidate the precise nature and implications of these interactions.
