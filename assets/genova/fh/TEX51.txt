# TEX51

## Overview
TEX51 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 51, which is predominantly expressed in the testis. The TEX51 protein is involved in reproductive processes and is categorized as a testis-specific protein. It plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development, and is essential for male fertility. The expression of TEX51 is tightly regulated and is primarily observed in the germ cells of the testis, indicating its specialized function in male reproductive biology. Mutations or dysregulation of TEX51 may have implications in male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
