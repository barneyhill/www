# RNF113B

## Overview
RNF113B is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 113B, a member of the RING finger protein family, which is characterized by a specialized zinc finger domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a pivotal role in human spermatogenesis, particularly during the transition from mitosis to meiosis, by acting as a spliceosomal component involved in RNA processing and splicing. The expression of RNF113B peaks at the diplotene stage of prophase I, underscoring its importance in regulating gene expression during male germ cell development. Disruption of RNF113B leads to significant deregulation of the testicular transcriptome and meiotic arrest, highlighting its critical function in maintaining the integrity of the male germ cell orthoBackbone network (Correia2024The; Correia2022The). The evolutionary conservation of RNF113B's function across species, such as Drosophila and mice, further emphasizes its essential role in spermatogenesis (Correia2024The).

## Function
RNF113B is a gene that plays a crucial role in human spermatogenesis, particularly in the development of male germ cells. It is a paralog of the Drosophila RING finger protein 113 and functions as a spliceosomal component. RNF113B is predominantly expressed during the mitosis-to-meiosis transcriptional burst, with its expression peaking at the diplotene stage of prophase I. This timing suggests its involvement in regulating gene expression during the transition from mitosis to meiosis in spermatogenesis (Correia2024The; Correia2022The).

The protein encoded by RNF113B is involved in maintaining the integrity of the male germ cell orthoBackbone, which is essential for normal spermatogenic processes. Disruption of RNF113B leads to significant deregulation of the testicular transcriptome, affecting a large portion of the spermatocyte orthoBackbone network. This disruption results in meiotic arrest, where spermatocytes are the most advanced cell stage observed, indicating its critical role in the progression of meiosis (Correia2024The; Correia2022The).

RNF113B's function is conserved across species, as evidenced by similar phenotypes observed in Drosophila and mice when orthologs of this gene are disrupted, highlighting its evolutionary importance in male germ cell development (Correia2024The).

## Interactions
RNF113B, a member of the RING finger protein family, is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is suggested that RNF113B may participate in the regulation of spermatogenesis through its involvement in the spliceosomal component, which is crucial for RNA processing and splicing (BrattigCorreia2024The). The gene's role in the spliceosome indicates potential interactions with RNA and other spliceosomal proteins, although specific protein partners are not detailed in the provided context.

The RNF113B gene has been associated with the orthoBackbone network, a genetic framework involved in spermatogenesis. Disruption of RNF113B leads to significant deregulation of the testicular transcriptome, suggesting that it may interact with a network of genes and proteins essential for male germ cell development (BrattigCorreia2024The; Correia2022The). This interaction network includes 61 conserved human genes, with 27 linked to male germ cell defects, highlighting RNF113B's role in maintaining the integrity of this genetic program (BrattigCorreia2024The).

While specific protein interactions are not explicitly detailed, RNF113B's involvement in these complex networks suggests it may engage in both stable and transient interactions critical for its function in spermatogenesis and potentially other cellular processes.
