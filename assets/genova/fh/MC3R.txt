# MC3R

## Overview
The MC3R gene encodes the melanocortin 3 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation. This receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly within the hypothalamus, where it is integral to the leptin-melanocortin signaling pathway, influencing appetite and energy expenditure (Yanik2023Specific; Ji2022Regulation). Structurally, MC3R is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and features unique disulfide bonds that stabilize its tertiary structure (Feng2023Structural; Yang2011Structural). Functionally, MC3R acts as an inhibitory autoreceptor on proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, modulating feeding behavior and metabolic processes, and is also involved in inflammatory responses (Ji2022Regulation). Genetic variations in MC3R have been linked to obesity and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in energy balance and metabolic health (Mencarelli2008Sporadic; Ehtesham2019Loss‐of‐function).

## Structure
The melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs. The primary structure of MC3R includes specific amino acid sequences that form these helices, which are crucial for its function in ligand binding and signal transduction (Yang2011Structural). 

In terms of secondary structure, MC3R features a short extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and a helical extracellular loop 3 (ECL3), which contribute to the formation of a wide and open orthosteric pocket for peptide binding. This structural arrangement allows bound peptides, such as γ-MSH, to adopt a 'U-shape' conformation within the receptor core (Feng2023Structural). 

The tertiary structure of MC3R is stabilized by specific disulfide bonds, including a unique bond between the N-terminus and ECL3, which is absent in other related receptors like MC5R (Feng2023Structural). 

MC3R does not typically form quaternary structures but may interact with other proteins. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, may influence its function, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of MC3R can exist, potentially altering its functional properties (Yang2011Structural).

## Function
The melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus. It plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and body weight by influencing appetite and energy expenditure. MC3R is involved in the leptin-melanocortin signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining energy balance. This pathway includes interactions with neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (Yanik2023Specific; Ji2022Regulation).

MC3R functions as an inhibitory autoreceptor on POMC neurons, modulating feeding behavior and metabolic processes. It is also involved in inflammatory responses, where its activation inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhances anti-inflammatory mediators (Ji2022Regulation). In addition to its central roles, MC3R is expressed in peripheral tissues, suggesting its involvement in cardiovascular regulation, immune response, and natriuresis (Ji2022Regulation).

Genetic studies have linked MC3R variants to obesity and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its significance in energy homeostasis. MC3R knockout mice exhibit a moderate obesity phenotype with increased fat mass and decreased lean mass, underscoring its role in energy balance (GhamariLangroudi2018Regulation; Ji2022Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MC3R gene have been associated with various conditions, primarily obesity and related metabolic disorders. Studies have identified several mutations, such as A293T, I335S, and X361S, which segregate with obesity in families. The I335S mutation, in particular, results in a loss of receptor function and is linked to early-onset obesity and resistance to weight loss (Mencarelli2008Sporadic). 

A meta-analysis found that rare loss-of-function mutations in MC3R confer a threefold increased risk of obesity, highlighting the gene's role in energy homeostasis (Ehtesham2019Loss‐of‐function). In children, the Thr6Lys (T6K) variant is associated with a 3.10-fold increased risk of overweight/obesity, suggesting a recessive inheritance model for these polymorphisms (Koya2018Association). 

MC3R mutations are also linked to other conditions such as decreased body height and delayed puberty. Variants like p.Arg220Ser are associated with partial loss-of-function, affecting cAMP activity and contributing to these phenotypes (Zheng2023Evaluation). The gene's involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis further implicates it in growth and puberty regulation (Zheng2023Evaluation).

## Interactions
The melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. MC3R can form dimers or oligomers with itself or other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can modulate secondary signaling pathways (Yanik2023Specific). Notably, MC3R interacts with the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a, and this interaction can enhance MC3R activity when stimulated by α-MSH. The dimerization of GHSR-1a and MC3R, along with the basal activation of GHSR-1a, plays a significant role in this enhancement (Yanik2023Specific).

MC3R also interacts with the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), mediated by RING finger protein 11 (RNF11). This interaction can restrict the activation of secondary messenger pathways, indicating a regulatory role in MC3R signaling (Yanik2023Specific). Additionally, MC3R is part of the leptin-melanocortin signaling pathway in the hypothalamus, involving interactions with neuro-hormones such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) (Yanik2023Specific). These interactions are crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and regulating appetite and hunger.
