# SMIM1

## Overview
The SMIM1 gene encodes the small integral membrane protein 1, which is a type II transmembrane protein associated with the Vel blood group antigen. This protein plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of red blood cells (RBCs) by contributing to the expression of the Vel antigen, which is significant for blood transfusion compatibility (Cvejic2013SMIM1). The SMIM1 protein is characterized by its ability to form homo-oligomers and its involvement in erythrocyte membrane stability, facilitated by interactions with the cytoskeleton (van2020SMIM1; Danger2015Characterization). Genetic variations in SMIM1, such as specific mutations and deletions, can lead to the Vel-negative phenotype, impacting transfusion outcomes and highlighting the gene's clinical significance (van2020SMIM1; Cvejic2013SMIM1). Additionally, SMIM1 has been implicated in metabolic traits, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood (Frontini2022Loss).

## Structure
The SMIM1 protein is a 78-amino-acid type II transmembrane protein associated with the Vel blood group antigen. It features a single transmembrane domain composed of 22 hydrophobic residues, spanning from Val53 to Val74, which is sufficient for its membrane integration (Frontini2022Loss; Cvejic2013SMIM1). The protein's structure includes an extracellular C-terminus and a cytoplasmic N-terminus, with the extracellular domain containing two cysteine residues that may facilitate interactions with other proteins (Storry2017The; Cvejic2013SMIM1).

The SMIM1 protein is capable of forming homo-oligomers through disulfide bonds, and it contains a GXXXG motif, which may promote transmembrane dimerization via helix-helix association, similar to glycophorin A (Danger2015Characterization). Despite its theoretical molecular weight of 8.749 kDa, the protein exhibits molecular weights of 9 and 18 kDa in monomeric forms, likely due to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although it is not glycosylated (Storry2017The; Danger2015Characterization). The presence of extracellular phosphoserines has been identified, but no specific biological activity has been associated with these modifications (Danger2015Characterization). The protein's role in red blood cell formation and hemoglobinization is suggested by gene coexpression analysis and studies in model organisms (Cvejic2013SMIM1).

## Function
The SMIM1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the cell membrane and is primarily active in red blood cells (RBCs). It plays a crucial role in the expression of the Vel blood group antigen, which is important for blood transfusion compatibility (Cvejic2013SMIM1). The SMIM1 protein contains a transmembrane domain, suggesting its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of the erythrocyte membrane (Cvejic2013SMIM1).

SMIM1 is highly expressed in erythroblasts, the precursor cells of RBCs, indicating its role in red blood cell formation and hemoglobinization (Cvejic2013SMIM1). The gene's expression is regulated by the SNP rs1175550, which affects the mean hemoglobin concentration in RBCs (Cvejic2013SMIM1). Variations in SMIM1, such as a 17-nucleotide deletion, can lead to the Vel-negative phenotype, characterized by the absence of the Vel antigen on RBCs (Cvejic2013SMIM1).

In addition to its role in RBCs, SMIM1 has been associated with metabolic traits in humans, including energy expenditure and weight regulation, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Frontini2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMIM1 gene, which encodes the Vel blood group antigen, have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of blood transfusions. The Vel-negative phenotype, caused by a homozygous 17-nucleotide deletion in SMIM1, results in the absence of the Vel antigen on red blood cells. This can lead to severe hemolytic transfusion reactions if Vel-negative individuals receive Vel-positive blood, as they may develop antibodies against the Vel antigen (Cvejic2013SMIM1).

Weakened Vel expression is associated with specific SMIM1 mutations, such as c.152T>A (p.Met51Lys) and c.152T>G (p.Met51Arg), which can disrupt the protein's normal function and incorporation into the cell membrane. These mutations can lead to a dominant negative effect, reducing Vel expression during erythroid differentiation and reticulocyte maturation (van2020SMIM1).

The presence of the major allele of rs1175550 in intron 2 of SMIM1, combined with certain SMIM1 alleles, can also result in weak Vel expression. This genetic variation affects SMIM1 transcript levels and is associated with changes in red blood cell traits, such as mean hemoglobin concentration (Cvejic2013SMIM1). Understanding these genetic factors is crucial for accurate blood group typing and preventing transfusion-related complications.

## Interactions
The SMIM1 protein, associated with the Vel blood group antigen, is involved in interactions that influence its expression and function on erythrocytes. SMIM1 is a transmembrane protein that can form homo-oligomers, potentially through disulfide bonds, as suggested by the presence of a GXXXG motif, which may facilitate transmembrane dimerization (Cvejic2013SMIM1; Danger2015Characterization). This dimerization is crucial for its incorporation into the red cell membrane and may be disrupted by certain missense mutations, such as p.Met51Lys and p.Met51Arg, which inhibit dimerization and affect Vel antigen expression (Cvejic2013SMIM1).

SMIM1's interactions with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, particularly spectrin, are important for its stability during erythroid differentiation. Mutations in SMIM1 can interfere with its membrane incorporation and the presentation of the Vel epitope, possibly by disrupting its association with the spectrin/cytoskeleton complex (van2020SMIM1). These interactions are essential for maintaining SMIM1 during critical stages of erythropoiesis, such as enucleation and reticulocyte maturation (van2020SMIM1). However, specific interactions of SMIM1 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies.
