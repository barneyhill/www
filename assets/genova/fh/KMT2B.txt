# KMT2B

## Overview
KMT2B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine methyltransferase 2B, a member of the lysine methyltransferase family. This protein plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation. KMT2B is a key component of the COMPASS complex and interacts with various proteins and DNA elements to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression. It is particularly important in neural development and function, influencing processes such as neuronal differentiation and memory formation. Mutations in the KMT2B gene are linked to several neurological disorders, including early-onset generalized dystonia and intellectual developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Kerimoglu2013HistoneMethyltransferase; Zech2016Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
The KMT2B protein, also known as MLL2, is a lysine methyltransferase with a complex molecular structure comprising 2715 amino acids. It features a catalytically active C-terminal SET domain, which is crucial for its methyltransferase activity, forming a pocket to bind the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine and the N-terminal tail of histone H3, facilitating the methylation reaction (Klonou2021Structure). The protein includes several distinct domains, such as an AT hook, a CXXC domain, and multiple plant homeotic domains (PHD) in the N-terminal region. The CXXC domain, containing two zinc ions and four cysteine residues, is essential for chromatin association by recognizing and binding to non-methylated CpG DNA (Klonou2021Structure).

KMT2B also contains multiple PHD fingers, with PHD3 specifically binding to H3K4me3 tails, supported by an adjacent bromodomain (BRD) (Klonou2021Structure). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by threonine aspartase 1 (Taspase 1), resulting in non-covalent dimerization of its N- and C-terminal fragments, a process essential for its methyltransferase activity (Rao2015Hijacked). The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions with the WRAD complex, which includes WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, enhancing its enzymatic activity and chromatin recruitment (Klonou2021Structure).

## Function
KMT2B encodes a lysine-specific histone methyltransferase that is crucial for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active gene expression. This methylation is a key chromatin-modifying event that plays a fundamental role in regulating gene expression, influencing processes such as embryogenesis, cell identity, and tissue homeostasis (Zech2016Haploinsufficiency). KMT2B is widely expressed in the brain, particularly in regions responsible for motor control, and is essential for proper neural function by modulating DNA accessibility and activating critical target genes during development (Zech2016Haploinsufficiency).

In the context of neuronal transdifferentiation, KMT2B is vital for the conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neurons, where it maintains the balance between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications. This balance is necessary for the activation and maintenance of gene expressions required for neuronal identity (Barbagiovanni2018KMT2B). The absence of KMT2B impairs the efficiency of transdifferentiation and neurite elongation, highlighting its role in neuron maturation (Barbagiovanni2018KMT2B).

KMT2B also plays a significant role in memory formation. In mice, the loss of KMT2B in the forebrain leads to learning impairments, particularly affecting hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, underscoring its importance in synaptic function and memory (Kerimoglu2013HistoneMethyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KMT2B gene are associated with early-onset generalized dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures and movements. This condition often begins in the lower limbs and progresses to affect other body parts, including the trunk, neck, and face (Zech2016Haploinsufficiency; Gorman2018Review). KMT2B-related dystonia, also known as DYT-KMT2B, is frequently caused by de novo mutations and is linked to epigenetic dysregulation due to haploinsufficiency of the gene (Zech2019Update). The disorder is often accompanied by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and other neurological symptoms (Zech2016Haploinsufficiency; Li2020Clinical).

KMT2B mutations are also associated with Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Autosomal Dominant 68 (MRD68), which can manifest as neurodevelopmental impairments without dystonia (Bouhamdani2024Diagnostic). The phenotypic spectrum of KMT2B-related disorders is broad, with some patients exhibiting non-motor symptoms such as short stature and dysmorphic facial features (Carecchio2019Frequency; Li2020Clinical). Deep brain stimulation has been shown to be an effective treatment for improving motor symptoms in patients with KMT2B mutations (Carecchio2019Frequency; Li2020Clinical).

## Interactions
KMT2B, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2B, is a key component of the COMPASS complex, which is involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active gene transcription. KMT2B interacts with non-methylated CpG-rich DNA through its CXXC zinc finger domain, promoting H3K4me3 and enhancing gene expression (Bochyńska2018Modes). It also forms part of a multiprotein complex with the WRAD subunits, including WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, which are essential for its catalytic activity and chromatin targeting (Bochyńska2018Modes).

KMT2B interacts with Menin, a tumor suppressor, which contributes to the regulation of bivalent genes by maintaining a balance between polycomb and KMT2A/B activity. This interaction is crucial for the silencing of bivalent genes, although KMT2B can also function independently of Menin (Sparbier2023Targeting). The interaction with Menin is significant in the context of cancer biology, where Menin inhibitors can disrupt this balance, leading to the activation of previously repressed genes (Sparbier2023Targeting).

KMT2B is also involved in interactions with transcription factors, such as the E2F family, which recruit KMT2B in a cell-cycle-specific manner, influencing gene expression regulation (Bochyńska2018Modes).
