# MBOAT4

## Overview
MBOAT4, or membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes the enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family. This enzyme is integral to the post-translational modification of ghrelin, a hormone that plays a pivotal role in regulating appetite and energy balance. GOAT is characterized as a transmembrane protein with multiple hydrophobic regions, including 11 transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function in the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme's primary function is the octanoylation of ghrelin, a modification essential for the hormone's biological activity and its interaction with the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a) (Pierce2023A; Masumoto2015Membrane). MBOAT4's activity is influenced by nutrient availability, linking it to energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Masumoto2015Membrane). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various clinical contexts, including obesity, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (Yoshino2018Ghrelin; RodríguezValentín2022Energy; Mariman2015Extreme).

## Structure
MBOAT4, also known as ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), is a membrane-bound enzyme characterized by its involvement in the octanoylation of ghrelin, a process crucial for the hormone's activity. The protein is part of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, which is known for having multiple transmembrane domains. Specifically, GOAT is described as having 12 hydrophobic regions, including 11 transmembrane domains and one re-entrant loop (Masumoto2015Membrane).

The molecular structure of GOAT includes key residues such as histidine and asparagine, which are essential for its enzymatic function. The invariant histidine is located on the luminal side, while the conserved asparagine is on the cytosolic side, indicating a specific orientation within the membrane (Masumoto2015Membrane). These residues are crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, interacting with the acyl-CoA substrates produced during fatty acid β-oxidation.

While specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of MBOAT4 are not provided, the general characteristics of the MBOAT family suggest a complex topology with a conserved core region that facilitates its acylation function (Pierce2023A). The enzyme's activity and structure are integral to its role in cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions.

## Function
MBOAT4, also known as ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the acylation of ghrelin, a hormone involved in regulating appetite and energy balance. This acylation process involves the addition of an octanoyl group to the third serine of ghrelin, a modification necessary for ghrelin's binding and signaling through its receptor, GHS-R1a (Pierce2023A; Masumoto2015Membrane). The activity of MBOAT4 is essential for the biological activity of ghrelin, influencing hunger and energy homeostasis in the body (Pierce2023A).

MBOAT4 is expressed in ghrelin-releasing tissues such as the stomach and intestine, where it is active in the endoplasmic reticulum (Masumoto2015Membrane). The enzyme's structure includes 12 hydrophobic regions with 11 transmembrane domains, and key residues like histidine and asparagine are involved in its function, with histidine likely playing a role in the active site (Masumoto2015Membrane). The enzyme's activity is regulated by nutrient availability, which in turn affects body adiposity (Masumoto2015Membrane). Through its role in ghrelin modification, MBOAT4 is implicated in maintaining energy homeostasis and potentially influencing metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
The MBOAT4 gene, encoding the enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in ghrelin acylation, which influences appetite and energy balance. Alterations in MBOAT4 expression have been associated with breast cancer risk, particularly in premenopausal women. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs13272159, modifies the association between IGF-1 serum concentration and breast cancer risk, with the AA genotype linked to increased risk in women with high IGF-1 levels (RodríguezValentín2022Energy).

In the context of obesity, variations in MBOAT4, such as a SNP resulting in a threonine to alanine substitution at position 46 (T46A), have been associated with extreme obesity, suggesting a role in appetite regulation and energy balance (Mariman2015Extreme). MBOAT4 expression alterations have also been linked to metabolic disorders, with hypomethylation in its regulatory region potentially contributing to obesity by affecting appetite regulation (CarrizosaMolina2023Methylation).

In Alzheimer's disease, MBOAT4 mRNA levels are significantly higher in affected individuals, although the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear (Yoshino2018Ghrelin). These associations highlight the potential clinical significance of MBOAT4 in various diseases.
