# NHS

## Overview
The NHS gene encodes the NHS actin remodeling regulator protein, which plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component for maintaining cell morphology and facilitating cellular processes such as motility and adhesion. The NHS protein is characterized by a WAVE Homology Domain (WHD), which is essential for its interaction with various proteins involved in actin regulation, including the Abi protein family, HSPC300, Nap1, and Sra1. These interactions are crucial for the formation of a heteropentameric complex that drives actin polymerization and remodeling (Brooks2010The). The NHS protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, where it localizes to the cell periphery and contributes to maintaining cell junction integrity (Sharma2006Nance–Horan). Mutations in the NHS gene are linked to Nance-Horan syndrome, an X-linked developmental disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, dental anomalies, and facial dysmorphism, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Coccia2009X-linked; Burdon2003Mutations).

## Structure
The NHS protein, encoded by the NHS gene, is involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell morphology. It contains a WAVE Homology Domain (WHD) that spans amino acids 1-262, which is crucial for its interaction with various proteins, including the Abi protein family, HSPC300, Nap1, and Sra1 (Brooks2010The). This domain is functionally similar to the WHD in WAVE proteins, which are involved in actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation (Brooks2010The). The NHS protein also contains proline-rich and basic regions, common in WASP family proteins (Brooks2010The).

The NHS gene produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, with NHS-A and NHS-1A being significant for the pathogenesis of Nance-Horan syndrome. These isoforms contain the WHD and are involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Brooks2010The). The NHS protein is proposed to function as a scaffold, coordinating multiple regulatory pathways important for actin stability and plasticity (Chograni2011The).

Mutations in the NHS gene can lead to truncated versions of the protein, affecting its function. These mutations often result in frameshifts and premature stop codons, highlighting the importance of the protein's molecular structure for its function (Burdon2003Mutations).

## Function
The NHS gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which is essential for maintaining cell morphology and coordinating cellular processes such as motility and adhesion. The NHS protein contains a WAVE homology domain (WHD) that interacts with proteins involved in actin regulation, including members of the Abi protein family, HSPC300, Nap1, and Sra1. These interactions facilitate the formation of a heteropentameric complex crucial for actin polymerization and remodeling (Brooks2010The).

In healthy human cells, NHS localizes to the leading edge of lamellipodia, where it regulates actin dynamics and cell spreading. It stabilizes the circumferential contractile actin ring, which is important for cell adhesion and shape, and forms a stable link between the cadherin/b-catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton (Brooks2010The). NHS is also involved in the regulation of lamellipod protrusions in motile cells, controlling cytoskeletal plasticity and maintaining cell morphology (Brooks2010The).

The NHS protein is expressed in epithelial tissues, where it localizes to the cell periphery, and is involved in maintaining cell junction integrity, which is crucial for tissue structure and function (Sharma2006Nance–Horan). Its dysfunction can lead to developmental issues, such as those observed in Nance-Horan syndrome (Brooks2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NHS gene, known as NHS actin remodeling regulator, are primarily associated with Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS), a rare X-linked developmental disorder. This syndrome is characterized by congenital cataracts, dental anomalies, facial dysmorphism, and sometimes intellectual disabilities (Coccia2009X-linked; Burdon2003Mutations). The NHS gene is located on chromosome Xp22.13 and encodes a protein involved in actin remodeling, which is crucial for maintaining cell morphology and intercellular contacts (Brooks2010The).

NHS is caused by various mutations in the NHS gene, including nonsense mutations, small deletions, and frameshift mutations, which often result in truncated proteins and loss of function (Sun2022A; Miller2021Allelic). These mutations disrupt normal protein function, leading to the pleiotropic effects observed in NHS, affecting multiple systems including the eyes, teeth, and cognitive function (Burdon2003Mutations).

In addition to NHS, mutations in the NHS gene can lead to isolated X-linked congenital cataracts, which may occur due to aberrant transcription or complex gene rearrangements (Coccia2009X-linked; Miller2021Allelic). The gene's dosage sensitivity is highlighted by cases where partial loss of expression results in cataracts without other NHS features (Miller2021Allelic).

## Interactions
The NHS gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, particularly through its interactions with various proteins. NHS contains a WAVE homology domain (WHD) that interacts with the Abi protein family (Abi1, Abi2, and Abi3), HSPC300, Nap1, and Sra1, which are components of the WAVE complex involved in actin assembly (Brooks2010The). These interactions are crucial for the formation of lamellipodia and actin polymerization, as NHS localizes to the leading edge of lamellipodia in motile cells (Brooks2010The).

NHS also interacts with the tight junction protein ZO-1, as demonstrated by co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests a role for NHS in maintaining cell-cell adhesion at tight junctions (Sharma2009NHS-A). The NHS-A isoform co-localizes with ZO-1 at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, indicating its involvement in tight junctions but not in adherens junctions (Sharma2006Nance–Horan).

The NHS protein's interactions with these complexes and proteins highlight its role in coordinating actin remodeling and maintaining cell morphology, which is essential for normal cellular processes and development (Brooks2010The).
