# TMEM253

## Overview
TMEM253 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 253, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not yet fully understood. The gene is located on chromosome 9q22, a region that has been associated with several thyroid-specific diseases, including thyroid cancer and hypothyroidism. Research has indicated that TMEM253 may play a role in the regulation of thyroid tissue, as well as in the pathogenesis of congenital hydrocephalus, although the mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Jo2016Distant; McKnight2021Genes). Further studies are required to clarify the biological functions and clinical implications of TMEM253 in human health.

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM253 gene has been implicated in various thyroid-specific diseases due to its association with the 9q22 locus, which is linked to conditions such as thyroid cancer, goiter, and hypothyroidism. This locus contains the FOXE1 gene, a thyroid-specific transcription factor, and has been shown to have a broad regulatory effect on thyroid tissue. In particular, trans-eQTLs at the 9q22 locus have been associated with the expression of TMEM253, suggesting its involvement in thyroid tumor tissue. The association of TMEM253 with thyroid cancer was confirmed in primary thyroid cancer RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), highlighting its potential role in the disease (Jo2016Distant).

In the context of congenital hydrocephalus (CH), TMEM253 was found to be upregulated in ZCCHC8 -/- mice, which exhibited abnormal neurogenesis and CH. However, the specific relationship between TMEM253 and cilia, which are often implicated in CH, remains unclear (McKnight2021Genes). Despite these findings, the direct clinical significance of TMEM253 mutations or expression alterations in other diseases or conditions has not been extensively documented, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its role in human health.
