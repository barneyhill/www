# GFOD2

## Overview
GFOD2 is a gene that encodes the protein Gfo/Idh/MocA-like oxidoreductase domain containing 2, which is part of the oxidoreductase family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in oxidation-reduction processes, which are critical for various metabolic pathways. The GFOD2 gene has been implicated in several biological processes and diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders, metabolic conditions, and cancer. Its role in these conditions is thought to be linked to its involvement in molecular pathways that are disrupted in these diseases (Zhu2020Correlation; Liu2020Identification; Li2021CrossDisorder).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GFOD2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In neuropsychiatric disorders, GFOD2 is identified as a candidate gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its involvement in disrupted molecular pathways related to these conditions (Li2021CrossDisorder). The gene is prioritized in studies of de novo mutations across multiple disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, and Schizophrenia, indicating its potential relevance in these disorders (Li2021CrossDisorder).

In the context of metabolic disorders, GFOD2 is a predicted target of microRNA29, which is significantly elevated in the serum of obese and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. This suggests that GFOD2 may play a role in glucose and lipid metabolism, with alterations potentially contributing to metabolic changes observed in T2DM (Zhu2020Correlation).

Additionally, GFOD2 has been mentioned in studies related to oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where it is part of a core module of genes that are down-regulated in tumor samples. This implies a potential role in cancer biology, although specific details about its function in ESCC are not provided (Liu2020Identification).
