# CLEC17A

## Overview
CLEC17A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 17A, which is a Type II transmembrane protein involved in immune system functions. The protein is characterized by its C-type lectin domain, which allows it to bind specifically to mannose and calcium ions, playing a crucial role in pathogen recognition and immune cell interactions. CLEC17A is predominantly expressed on dividing B cells within germinal centers, where it contributes to immune surveillance and modulation. The protein's structure includes several domains and motifs, such as SH2 and SH3 recognition domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and kinases, including MAPK and Syk family kinases. These interactions are essential for its role in cell signaling and immune response pathways. CLEC17A's involvement in immune processes also extends to its potential applications in immunotherapy and vaccination strategies (Koh2011Integrative).

## Structure


## Function
CLEC17A is a receptor expressed on dividing B cells within germinal centers and is classified as a Type II transmembrane protein. It is a C-type lectin with a high specificity for mannose and calcium ions, due to the presence of EPN and WND motifs in its structure (Koh2011Integrative). The extracellular region of CLEC17A contains two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, which may influence its transport and localization to the cell surface (Koh2011Integrative).

In the cytoplasmic region, CLEC17A features several domains and motifs, including SH2 and SH3 recognition domains within a proline-rich region. These domains are predicted to be phosphorylated by proline-directed kinases such as MAPK, suggesting that SH2-containing proteins like Grb2 and Src family proteins can dock to CLEC17A's cytoplasmic tail (Koh2011Integrative). The presence of hemi-ITAM motifs indicates potential recruitment and activation of Syk family kinases, which also contain SH2 domains (Koh2011Integrative). Casein kinase II (CKII) is another kinase predicted to phosphorylate CLEC17A, with potential phosphorylation sites at positions 16, 42, and 68 (Koh2011Integrative).

CLEC17A's role in immune response is significant, as it is involved in pathogen recognition and cell-cell interaction by binding specifically with glycans on target cells and glycosylated molecules (Koh2011Integrative). This function is crucial for immune surveillance and modulation, contributing to the development of immunity and potential applications in immuno- and vaccination-therapies (Koh2011Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC17A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with immune cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment. Mutations in CLEC17A, particularly amplifications, are linked to the activation of pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and RAS, as well as cell cycle inhibition, which are critical in cancer progression (Qi2020ImmuneStromal). The gene's expression is positively correlated with the infiltration of various immune cells, including B cells and CD4+ T cells, suggesting its role in modulating the immune landscape of tumors (Qi2020ImmuneStromal).

CLEC17A is also part of a seven-gene signature associated with overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2021Identification). This gene signature is used to predict responses to immunotherapy, highlighting the importance of CLEC17A in the immune response to cancer (Li2021Identification). While the specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from CLEC17A mutations or expression changes outside of lung cancer are not detailed, its involvement in immune-related pathways suggests a broader role in immune regulation (Li2021Identification).

## Interactions
CLEC17A is a C-type lectin that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its cytoplasmic tail. It contains several SH2 and SH3 recognition domains within a proline-rich region, which are predicted to be phosphorylated by proline-directed kinases such as MAPK. This suggests that SH2-containing proteins like the adaptor protein Grb2 and Src family proteins can dock to the cytoplasmic tail of CLEC17A (Koh2011Integrative). The presence of hemi-ITAM motifs (YxxL) indicates potential recruitment and activation of Syk family kinases, which also contain SH2 domains, supporting their interaction with CLEC17A (Koh2011Integrative).

CLEC17A is also predicted to be phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) at specific sites, with other potential kinases including protein kinase C (PKC) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), though the latter's specificity is less confirmed (Koh2011Integrative). The presence of a TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) binding motif suggests possible involvement in intracellular signaling similar to Dectin-1, which may recruit and activate the TRAF2-TRAF6 complex (Koh2011Integrative). These interactions highlight CLEC17A's role in cell signaling and immune response pathways.
