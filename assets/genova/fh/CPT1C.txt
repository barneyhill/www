# CPT1C

## Overview
CPT1C is a gene that encodes the protein carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C, a member of the carnitine acyltransferase family. This protein is primarily expressed in neurons and is distinct from other CPT1 isoforms due to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than mitochondria (Sierra2008CPT1c). Unlike its mitochondrial counterparts, CPT1C does not participate in fatty acid oxidation but is involved in neuronal lipid metabolism and regulation of ceramide levels, which are crucial for cognitive processes and synaptic plasticity (Carrasco2012Ceramide; Casals2016Carnitine). CPT1C also plays a role in energy management under metabolic stress, enhancing autophagy and promoting cell survival (RoaMansergas2018CPT1C). Its interactions with proteins such as AMPA receptors and protrudin further underscore its importance in neuronal function and synaptic regulation (PalomoGuerrero2019Sensing; GratacòsBatlle2018Mechanisms). Alterations in CPT1C expression have been linked to neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Fadó2023To; Casals2016Carnitine).

## Structure
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) is a member of the carnitine acyltransferase family, primarily expressed in neurons. Unlike other CPT1 isoforms, CPT1C is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than mitochondria, which is attributed to its N-terminal region that contains a microsomal targeting signal for ER localization (Sierra2008CPT1c). This localization is distinct from CPT1A and CPT1B, which are mitochondrial proteins (Sierra2008CPT1c).

CPT1C has a high sequence identity with CPT1A and CPT1B, but it does not participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Instead, it exhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity with palmitoyl-CoA as a substrate, although its catalytic efficiency is significantly lower (Sierra2008CPT1c). The protein's structure includes transmembrane domains, characteristic of its role in membrane localization (Casals2016Carnitine).

The regulation of CPT1C involves posttranscriptional mechanisms, including a long 5' untranslated region with an upstream open reading frame that acts as a translation repressor. This repression can be relieved by cellular stress stimuli, leading to increased protein levels (Casals2016Carnitine). Despite its structural similarity to other CPT1 enzymes, CPT1C's unique localization and regulatory mechanisms suggest a specialized role in neuronal lipid metabolism.

## Function
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) is primarily expressed in neurons and plays a significant role in neuronal metabolism and function. Unlike other CPT1 isoforms, CPT1C is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rather than mitochondria and does not participate in fatty acid oxidation. Instead, it is involved in the regulation of ceramide levels, which is crucial for dendritic spine maturation and cognitive processes. This regulation is essential for transforming dendritic filopodia into mature spines, impacting learning and memory formation (Sierra2008CPT1c; Carrasco2012Ceramide).

CPT1C also acts as a sensor of malonyl-CoA levels, influencing gene expression and protein interactions. It is involved in AMPAR trafficking, which affects synaptic activity and is crucial for maintaining synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Casals2016Carnitine; GratacòsBatlle2018Mechanisms). In human mesenchymal stem cells, CPT1C enhances autophagy under glucose deprivation, promoting cell survival by increasing lipid droplet formation and ATP production, providing an alternative energy source when glucose is scarce (RoaMansergas2018CPT1C). These functions highlight CPT1C's role in energy management and adaptation to metabolic stress.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CPT1C gene have been implicated in several neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. A point mutation in the N-terminal domain of CPT1C has been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia type 73 (SPG73), a disorder characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of the legs (Casals2016Carnitine). This mutation affects the interaction between the N-terminus and the catalytic C-terminal domain of CPT1C, impacting lipid droplet biogenesis and ER morphology (Casals2016Carnitine).

CPT1C is also linked to cognitive impairments. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of CPT1C leads to impaired cognition, spatial learning deficits, and motor issues, suggesting its role in dendritic spine maturation and synaptic transmission (Casals2016Carnitine; Virmani2015The). Altered ceramide metabolism in CPT1C-deficient neurons is crucial for these neurological functions (Casals2016Carnitine).

In cancer, CPT1C is overexpressed in several tumor types, including breast, lung, and brain cancers, where it supports cell survival under metabolic stress conditions like hypoxia and glucose deprivation (Fadó2023To; Casals2016Carnitine). High CPT1C expression is associated with poor survival in various cancers, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Fadó2023To).

## Interactions
CPT1C (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal function and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) regulation. It specifically interacts with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, enhancing their surface expression and trafficking, which is crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity. This interaction is subunit-specific, as CPT1C increases the surface expression of GluA1-containing AMPARs but not GluA2 homomeric AMPARs (GratacÃ²sBatlle2015AMPAR; GratacòsBatlle2018Mechanisms).

CPT1C also interacts with protrudin, a protein involved in neurite formation, promoting axon growth by enhancing the anterograde transport of late endosomes/lysosomes. This interaction is independent of malonyl-CoA levels, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism (PalomoGuerrero2019Sensing).

In addition to these interactions, CPT1C has been shown to bind to both GluA1 and GluA2 subunits in heterologous expression systems, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. This suggests a broader role in AMPAR regulation, although the interaction does not alter the palmitoylation state of GluA1, indicating that CPT1C may act through a different mechanism, possibly as a chaperone or by inducing conformational changes (GratacÃ²sBatlle2015AMPAR).
