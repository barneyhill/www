# LRP2

## Overview
The LRP2 gene encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2, commonly known as megalin, which is a large endocytic receptor involved in the internalization of a diverse array of ligands. Megalin is a single-spanning transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cellular signaling and nutrient reabsorption, particularly in epithelial cells of the kidney, brain, and thyroid (Marzolo2011New; Christensen2002Megalin). As a multifunctional receptor, megalin is essential for the reabsorption of proteins and other molecules in the proximal tubules of the kidney, and it is involved in various signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, which is crucial for craniofacial development and neuroectodermal processes (Spuch2012LRP1; Kozyraki2017Inherited). The receptor's function is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as cubilin, forming complexes that are vital for its endocytic activities (Christensen2002Megalin). Mutations in the LRP2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including Donnai-Barrow syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Rasmussen2023Epigenetic; Kozyraki2017Inherited).

## Structure
The LRP2 gene encodes the megalin protein, a large endocytic receptor with a molecular weight of approximately 600 kDa. Megalin is a single-spanning transmembrane glycoprotein, featuring a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Mii2007Genetic; Christensen2002Megalin). The extracellular domain contains four clusters of cysteine-rich complement-type/LDLR class A repeats, which are crucial for ligand binding. These clusters are interspersed with 17 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and eight cysteine-poor spacer regions containing YWTD motifs, which facilitate pH-dependent ligand release in endosomal compartments (Christensen2002Megalin).

The cytoplasmic tail of megalin includes two NPXY motifs and a PPPSP motif, which is constitutively phosphorylated by GSK3, playing a significant role in receptor trafficking and recycling (Marzolo2011New). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which influence its function and stability (Mii2007Genetic). Megalin interacts with other proteins, such as cubilin, forming a dual-receptor complex that is essential for its endocytic functions (Christensen2002Megalin). The structural modules of megalin are highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Christensen2002Megalin).

## Function
The LRP2 gene encodes megalin, a multifunctional endocytic receptor involved in the internalization of a wide range of ligands, including nutrients, hormones, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins. Megalin is primarily expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney, brain, and thyroid, where it plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of proteins and other molecules in the proximal tubules of the kidney (Marzolo2011New). It facilitates the uptake of ligands such as albumin, insulin, leptin, and angiotensin II, which are important for maintaining normal physiological functions (Marzolo2011New).

In the brain, megalin is involved in signal transduction by interacting with adaptor proteins and is implicated in SHH signaling, particularly in the forebrain, where it acts as an SHH-binding protein (Spuch2012LRP1). It also plays a role in the endocytosis of ApoE, APP, and Aβ peptide, forming complexes that regulate neurite branching and mediate Aβ neurotoxicity (Spuch2012LRP1).

Megalin's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which is crucial for its recycling from endosomes, and its expression is influenced by various signaling pathways, including those involving insulin and IGF-I (Marzolo2011New). The receptor is also involved in the uptake of essential nutrients like cholesterol, vitamin D, and vitamin A, which are vital for neuroectoderm development (Kozyraki2017Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRP2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. LRP2 dysfunction is linked to Donnai-Barrow syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delays, craniofacial abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss, and vision issues such as high myopia and retinal dystrophy. Patients with this syndrome often exhibit low molecular weight proteinuria, indicative of tubular dysfunction (Kozyraki2017Inherited).

In cancer, LRP2 expression is often altered. Its epigenetic silencing is associated with tumor dedifferentiation and poor prognosis in various cancers, including kidney and breast cancers. Low LRP2 expression correlates with downregulation of genes related to epithelial cell functions and differentiation, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Rasmussen2023Epigenetic).

LRP2 is also implicated in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), where rare damaging variants are more frequent in patients compared to controls. These variants lead to reduced LRP2 mRNA levels, suggesting a genetic loss-of-function contributing to the condition (Theis2019Patientspecific).

LRP2 dysfunction affects various physiological processes, including steroid hormone metabolism and renal reabsorption, leading to conditions like proteinuria and reproductive abnormalities (Kozyraki2017Inherited).

## Interactions
LRP2, also known as megalin, is an endocytic receptor that interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and nutrient reabsorption. It forms a co-receptor complex with Patched homolog-1 (PTCH1) to facilitate endocytosis and activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for craniofacial development and cell proliferation in the ventral forebrain (Kozyraki2017Inherited). LRP2 also interacts with Cubilin (CUBN) in the proximal convoluted tubule, mediating the endocytic uptake of plasma proteins such as albumin and transferrin, which is essential for preventing urinary loss and conserving metabolites (Kozyraki2017Inherited).

In the brain, LRP2 is involved in the endocytosis of ApoE, APP, and Aβ peptide, forming complexes with APP and Fe65, which regulate neurite branching and Aβ neurotoxicity (Spuch2012LRP1). It also interacts with adaptor proteins like Dab2, GIPC/synectin, and APPL1, which are important for endocytosis and signaling (Spuch2012LRP1). LRP2's cytoplasmic domain can interact with the APP cytoplasmic domain via FE65, influencing APP processing and Aβ generation (Spuch2012LRP1). These interactions highlight LRP2's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as Alzheimer's.
