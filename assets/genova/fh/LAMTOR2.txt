# LAMTOR2

## Overview
LAMTOR2, also known as p14, is a gene that encodes the protein late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 2. This protein is a crucial component of the Ragulator complex, which is involved in the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. The LAMTOR2 protein is primarily localized on late endosomes and lysosomes, where it plays a significant role in cellular growth, proliferation, and metabolism by facilitating the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 in response to nutrient availability (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2; Vogel2015Ultrastructural). As a part of the Ragulator complex, LAMTOR2 is also involved in endosomal signaling, impacting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and influencing cellular responses to growth factors (Vogel2015Ultrastructural). Mutations in the LAMTOR2 gene can lead to immunological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune system function and cellular homeostasis (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2; Vogel2015Ultrastructural).

## Structure
LAMTOR2, also known as p14, is a component of the Ragulator complex, which plays a crucial role in mTORC1 signaling. The primary structure of LAMTOR2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that contribute to its function within the complex. In terms of secondary structure, LAMTOR2 forms part of a semi-independent subcomplex with LAMTOR3, characterized by β-sheet formation and hydrophobic interactions (Mu2017Structural; Xu2023VSIG2). The tertiary structure of LAMTOR2 is not detailed in the available context, but its interaction with other subunits like LAMTOR1 is crucial for the stability of the Ragulator complex (Mu2017Structural).

In the quaternary structure, LAMTOR2 is part of a pentameric assembly with LAMTOR1, LAMTOR3, LAMTOR4, and LAMTOR5, where it forms a stable heterodimeric complex with LAMTOR3. This complex is essential for the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal membrane (Mu2017Structural; Xu2023VSIG2). LAMTOR2 is also involved in endosomal signaling, which is critical for ERK activation and cellular proliferation (De2013Polymorphisms). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the Ragulator complex.

## Function
LAMTOR2, also known as p14, is a critical component of the Ragulator complex, which is essential for the activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival by responding to nutrient availability. LAMTOR2 is localized on late endosomes and lysosomes, where it facilitates the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at these sites (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2; Vogel2015Ultrastructural).

In healthy cells, LAMTOR2 plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by regulating MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways. These pathways are vital for various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, migration, and spreading (Vogel2015Ultrastructural). LAMTOR2 is also involved in the architecture and function of the endo/lysosomal system, contributing to the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lysosomes and the proper trafficking and recycling of the transferrin receptor (Vogel2015Ultrastructural).

LAMTOR2 is essential for dendritic cell homeostasis through its role in mTOR signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation. It facilitates the recruitment of Rag proteins to the lysosome, where they interact with and activate mTORC1 in response to amino-acid stimuli, important for protein synthesis and autophagy repression (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the LAMTOR2 gene can lead to significant immunological disorders. A point mutation in LAMTOR2 has been linked to a primary immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by reduced protein levels, resulting in severe defects in both innate and adaptive immunity. Patients with this mutation experience neutropenia, T-cell function defects, B-cell maturation issues, and recurrent broncho-pulmonary infections (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2). In humans, a hypomorphic mutation in the LAMTOR2 gene is associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder, presenting with small stature, partial albinism, and primary immunodeficiency (Vogel2015Ultrastructural).

LAMTOR2 deficiency affects dendritic cell homeostasis, leading to myeloproliferative disorders due to dysregulated Flt3 receptor trafficking and signaling (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2). In macrophages, LAMTOR2 deficiency impairs lipid metabolism and foam cell differentiation, which are critical in atherosclerosis development (Lamberti2019LAMTORRagulator). Additionally, LAMTOR2 mutations can result in defects in B-cell development and function, contributing to conditions like congenital neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia (Łyszkiewicz2019LAMTOR2). These findings underscore the critical role of LAMTOR2 in maintaining immune system function and cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
LAMTOR2, also known as p14, is a critical component of the Ragulator complex, which includes LAMTOR1, LAMTOR3, LAMTOR4, and LAMTOR5. This complex is essential for the recruitment and activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway on the lysosomal membrane, facilitating cellular growth and metabolism (Sparber2014The; Vogel2015Ultrastructural). LAMTOR2 interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, influencing cellular responses to growth factors (Vogel2015Ultrastructural).

LAMTOR2 plays a significant role in the regulation of endosomal trafficking and receptor sorting. It is involved in the trafficking of the Flt3 receptor in dendritic cells, where its deletion leads to receptor accumulation on the cell surface and impaired endosomal trafficking (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2). This interaction is crucial for maintaining dendritic cell homeostasis and preventing excessive proliferation and inflammation (Scheffler2014LAMTOR2).

In the context of cancer, LAMTOR2 interacts with VSIG2, which acts as a scaffold enhancing the interaction between LAMTOR2 and mTOR, leading to mTOR phosphorylation and activation. This interaction is significant in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Xu2023VSIG2).
