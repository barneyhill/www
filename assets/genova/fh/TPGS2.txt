# TPGS2

## Overview
TPGS2, or tubulin polyglutamylase complex subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation. This protein is a component of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex, which plays a critical role in regulating microtubule function, essential for various cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and maintenance of cell shape (Zhang2024Computing). The TPGS2 protein is particularly active in the cytoplasm of cells with high microtubule activity, such as neurons and cilia, indicating its involvement in neuronal and ciliary functions (Bhattacharya2022Identification). Alterations in TPGS2 expression have been linked to clinical conditions, including retinal degeneration, male infertility, and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Wang2021Dysregulation; Khajavi2023The).

## Function
TPGS2 (tubulin polyglutamylase complex subunit 2) is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically through the addition of polyglutamate chains, a process known as polyglutamylation. This modification is crucial for regulating microtubule function, which is essential for various cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and maintenance of cell shape (Zhang2024Computing). TPGS2 is a component of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex, which includes other subunits like TPGS1, and plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements at the immune synapse, affecting T-cell activation and the inflammatory response (Khajavi2023The).

In healthy human cells, TPGS2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas with high microtubule activity, such as neurons and cilia. This localization suggests its involvement in neuronal function and potentially in ciliary processes, given the known roles of polyglutamylation in stabilizing microtubules (Bhattacharya2022Identification). The regulation of microtubule stability by TPGS2 is important for maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating dynamic cellular activities, which are critical for normal cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TPGS2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. TPGS2 is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, which is crucial for microtubule stability and function. Mutations in TPGS2 have been associated with retinal degeneration and male infertility, conditions that arise due to defects in ciliary function, which is dependent on proper microtubule dynamics.

In the context of cancer, particularly breast cancer (BC), alterations in the expression of a circular RNA derived from the TPGS2 gene, known as circ-TPGS2, have significant clinical implications. Circ-TPGS2 is highly expressed in metastatic BC tissues and cell lines, and its overexpression correlates with poor overall and recurrence-free survival in patients. This circular RNA promotes BC cell motility and metastasis by acting as a miRNA sponge for miR-7, leading to increased levels of TRAF6 and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway contributes to the dysregulation of the tumor microenvironment, facilitating cancer progression and metastasis (Wang2021Dysregulation). The stability and functional significance of circ-TPGS2 suggest it could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer (Wang2021Dysregulation).
