# STBD1

## Overview
STBD1, or starch-binding domain-containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in glycogen metabolism and autophagy. The protein, also referred to as STBD1, is characterized by a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM20) that facilitates its interaction with glycogen and other glycogen-associated proteins, playing a crucial role in glycogen transport and degradation. STBD1 is primarily expressed in glycogen-storage tissues such as the liver, muscle, and heart, where it participates in glycophagy, a selective autophagic process essential for maintaining energy homeostasis during metabolic stress (Zhu2014The; Ueno2017Autophagy). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal hydrophobic stretch that aids in its localization to cellular membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, and an Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) that is important for its role in autophagic pathways (Zhu2014The; Jiang2011Starchbinding). STBD1's interactions with proteins like glycogen synthase and GABARAPL1 underscore its significance in cellular processes related to energy metabolism and stress response (Zhu2014The; Jiang2011Starchbinding).

## Structure
The STBD1 protein, encoded by the human STBD1 gene, is characterized by its carbohydrate-binding module (CBM20), which is crucial for its stability and interactions with glycogen-associated proteins (Zhu2014The). The CBM20 domain facilitates the binding of STBD1 to glycogen and other proteins, playing a significant role in glycogen metabolism and autophagy (Zhu2014The). The protein also contains an N-terminal hydrophobic stretch that associates with cellular membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or lysosomal organelles (Zhu2014The).

The primary structure of STBD1 includes specific amino acid sequences that are essential for its function. Notably, the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) within STBD1, characterized by the sequence 200 HEEWEMV 206, is necessary for its interaction with the autophagy protein GABARAPL1 (Jiang2011Starchbinding). Mutations in this motif, particularly at residues W203 and V206, disrupt the interaction with GABARAPL1, indicating their critical role in protein-protein interactions (Jiang2011Starchbinding).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, are also significant for STBD1's function. The N-terminus of STBD1 is crucial for its ubiquitination, affecting its stability and degradation (Zhu2014The). The protein's localization to the ER/perinuclear region is mediated by its N-terminal hydrophobic stretch, which is necessary for its proper subcellular localization (Zhu2014The).

## Function
STBD1 (starch-binding domain-containing protein 1) plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism and autophagy in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in glycogen-storage tissues such as the liver, muscle, and heart. The protein contains a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM20) that allows it to bind glycogen, facilitating its transport and degradation. STBD1 is involved in glycophagy, a selective autophagic process where glycogen granules are enwrapped by autophagosomes for catabolism into glucose. This process is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly during metabolic stress (Zhu2014The; Ueno2017Autophagy).

STBD1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, interacting with several glycogen-associated proteins such as glycogen synthase, glycogen debranching enzyme, and Laforin. These interactions are mediated by the CBM20 domain and are enhanced under conditions of glucose deprivation, suggesting a role in sensing glycogen levels (Zhu2014The). The N-terminal hydrophobic stretch of STBD1 is crucial for its localization, and mutations in the CBM20 domain can lead to rapid degradation of the protein (Zhu2014The).

STBD1 also interacts with GABARAPL1, a member of the Atg8 family, through an Atg8 interacting motif (AIM), which is important for its role in autophagic pathways (Jiang2011Starchbinding). In the liver, STBD1 is a dominant factor in glycogen transport to lysosomes, with its N-terminal transmembrane region and C-terminal CBM20 domain being critical for this function (Sun2016Starch).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the STBD1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. STBD1 is identified as a potential tumor suppressor, with its higher expression levels generally associated with increased survival probabilities across various cancers. However, in specific cancer types like glioma, higher STBD1 expression correlates with lower survival, indicating a complex role in cancer biology (Han2021Modelbased). A notable mutation, W203C, disrupts STBD1's interaction with autophagy-related proteins such as GABARAPL1 and LC3, impairing its autophagic functions and promoting tumor growth (Zhang2021iCAL:; Han2021Modelbased). This mutation mimics the effects of STBD1 knockdown, suggesting that STBD1 inhibits tumor growth through its interaction with these proteins (Zhang2021iCAL:).

In colon cancer, STBD1 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, and its depletion leads to enhanced tumor growth in vivo (Han2021Modelbased). The loss of STBD1 function is associated with increased glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Han2021Modelbased). These findings highlight the potential of targeting metabolic pathways in cancers with low STBD1 expression as a therapeutic strategy (Han2021Modelbased).

## Interactions
STBD1 interacts with several proteins involved in glycogen metabolism and autophagy. It binds to glycogen-associated proteins such as glycogen synthase (GS), glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE), and Laforin, particularly during glycogenolysis induced by glucose deprivation (Zhu2014The). The carbohydrate-binding domain (CBM20) of STBD1 is crucial for these interactions, as mutations in this domain, such as W293, disrupt its ability to bind to these proteins (Zhu2014The).

STBD1 also interacts with the autophagy-related protein GABARAPL1, a member of the Atg8 family. This interaction is mediated by a specific Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) within STBD1, identified as the sequence 200 HEEWEMV 206. Mutations in this motif, such as W203A and V206A, disrupt the interaction with GABARAPL1 (Jiang2011Starchbinding). Despite this interaction, the binding to GABARAPL1 is not necessary for glycogen transport to lysosomes in the liver, as shown by studies using AIM mutants (Sun2016Starch).

STBD1 also plays a role in promoting glycogen clustering during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by recruiting glycogen synthase 1 (GS1) and glycogenin (GN) to the ER membrane, forming a macromolecular complex that supports glycogen synthesis and cell survival (Lytridou2020Stbd1).
