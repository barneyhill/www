# CDC45

## Overview
CDC45 is a gene that encodes the cell division cycle 45 protein, a pivotal component of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase complex, which is essential for DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The CDC45 protein is integral to the initiation and progression of DNA replication, functioning as a molecular wedge to facilitate the unwinding of DNA strands at the replication fork. Structurally, CDC45 shares similarities with the bacterial RecJ nuclease, although it lacks nuclease activity, and is characterized by distinct domains that enable interactions with other proteins in the CMG complex (Simon2016Structure; Szambowska2013DNA). These interactions are crucial for the activation of helicase activity and the stabilization of the replication fork, ensuring genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Petojevic2015Cdc45; Simon2016Structure). Mutations in the CDC45 gene have been linked to genetic disorders such as Meier-Gorlin syndrome and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2023Elevated; NielsenDandoroff2023The).

## Structure
The CDC45 protein is a crucial component of the CMG helicase complex involved in DNA replication. Its molecular structure has been elucidated through various techniques, revealing significant insights into its architecture. CDC45 shares structural similarities with the bacterial RecJ nuclease, featuring a conserved fold that includes an N-terminal DHH domain and a C-terminal DHHA1 domain, connected by a three-helix bundle (Pellegrini2017Structural; Simon2016Structure). The DHH domain is characterized by a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, while the DHHA1 domain consists of a four-stranded beta-sheet with surrounding helices (Simon2016Structure).

The protein's tertiary structure is compact and disk-like, with a notable helical insertion in the DHH domain that projects away from the core structure (Simon2016Structure). This insertion is maintained by hydrophobic interactions and is involved in interactions within the CMG complex (Simon2016Structure). CDC45's quaternary structure involves its integration into the CMG complex, where it interacts with the MCM2-7 complex and GINS, stabilizing the N-terminal ring of the MCM2-7 heterohexamer (Simon2016Structure).

CDC45 lacks nuclease activity due to mutations in its active-site motifs, which are conserved in the RecJ family (Simon2016Structure). The protein binds single-stranded DNA with weak affinity, suggesting a role in DNA replication as a molecular wedge (Szambowska2013DNA). There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The CDC45 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase complex, which is essential for DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. This complex is responsible for unwinding DNA strands, a crucial step in DNA replication. CDC45 interacts with the MCM2-7 complex and the GINS complex, facilitating the transition from an inactive double MCM hexamer to an active helicase, thereby promoting DNA strand separation and replication fork progression (Simon2016Structure).

CDC45 is recruited to the MCM2-7 heterohexamer, a key step in activating helicase activity, which is regulated by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities (Simon2016Structure). The protein plays a role in stabilizing the engagement of the leading strand during DNA replication, acting as a 'guardian' of the gate to prevent the leading strand from slipping out during replication, which is vital for maintaining fork integrity (Petojevic2015Cdc45).

Structurally, CDC45 has similarities to the bacterial RecJ nuclease but lacks nuclease activity. Its structure includes unique domains that mediate interactions with MCM and GINS proteins, crucial for the assembly and function of the CMG complex (Simon2016Structure). These interactions are essential for the initiation and progression of DNA replication, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Simon2016Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDC45 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGORS) and craniosynostosis. MGORS is characterized by a clinical triad of short stature, microtia, and patella hypo/aplasia, with craniosynostosis being a common but incompletely penetrant trait among affected individuals (Knapp2021A; NielsenDandoroff2023The). Variants in CDC45 can include truncating, nonsynonymous, and synonymous splice-altering types, which often result in reduced CDC45 levels and destabilization of the protein (NielsenDandoroff2023The).

CDC45 mutations have also been linked to a novel autosomal recessive condition in patients with a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion, presenting with atypical structural anomalies such as craniosynostosis, anal/intestinal anomalies, and limb differences (Unolt2020Pathogenic). These mutations can act through a hypomorphic loss of function mechanism, impacting DNA replication initiation (Schoch2024A).

In addition to genetic disorders, elevated expression of CDC45 has been implicated in various cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and higher clinical stages. CDC45's role in cancer is linked to its involvement in several signaling pathways crucial for tumor development (Zhang2023Elevated).

## Interactions
CDC45 is a key component of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase complex, which is essential for DNA replication. It interacts with the Mcm2-7 complex and the GINS complex to form this helicase, which unwinds DNA at the replication fork (Krastanova2012Structural; Moyer2006Isolation). CDC45 binds tightly to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), a crucial interaction for stalling the helicase during replication stress. This binding specifically disrupts its interaction with the Mcm2-7 complex, suggesting a mechanism for inhibiting helicase activity (Bruck2013Cdc45).

CDC45 also interacts with Mcm10, which enhances its DNA-binding activity. The internal domain (ID) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of Mcm10 significantly increase CDC45's affinity for DNA substrates, particularly those with bubble structures (Di2013The). Additionally, CDC45 interacts with PCNA via a PIP box, which is essential for DNA replication and cell survival in Leishmania donovani (Yadav2020DNA).

CDC45 forms a complex with TopBP1, with the interaction occurring at the N-terminal region of CDC45. This interaction is particularly abundant at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (Schmidt2007Characterization). These interactions highlight CDC45's central role in coordinating the activities of various proteins involved in DNA replication.
