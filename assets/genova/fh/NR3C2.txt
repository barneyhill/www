# NR3C2

## Overview
The NR3C2 gene encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. This receptor plays a pivotal role in maintaining electrolyte and fluid balance by regulating genes involved in sodium and potassium homeostasis. The MR is primarily activated by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone and is predominantly expressed in the distal nephron of the kidney, where it facilitates sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, crucial for blood pressure regulation (Bledsoe2005A; Farman2001Multiple). Additionally, MR is expressed in other tissues, including the colon, heart, and brain, influencing various physiological processes (Bledsoe2005A). Mutations in NR3C2 can lead to conditions such as pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, characterized by impaired sodium retention and electrolyte imbalance (Balsamo2007Functional). The receptor's complex interactions with glucocorticoid receptors further underscore its regulatory significance in gene expression (Pooley2020Beyond).

## Structure
The NR3C2 gene encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in regulating water and electrolyte balance. The human MR is composed of 984 amino acids and has a modular structure with three main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Zennaro2012Aldosterone). The NTD contains an activation function (AF-1) and interacts with transcriptional coregulators. The DBD features two zinc-finger structures essential for DNA binding and receptor dimerization. The LBD is responsible for ligand binding and interaction with heat shock proteins and transcriptional coactivators, containing a ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2) (Zennaro2012Aldosterone).

The LBD of MR exhibits a three-layered α-helical fold, similar to other nuclear receptor LBDs, with a binding pocket lined by 22 residues (Bledsoe2005A; Zennaro2012Aldosterone). Key residues such as Asn 770 and Thr 945 form a network of hydrogen bonds with ligands, crucial for receptor activation (Bledsoe2005A). The MR LBD also interacts with coactivators through LXXLL motifs, using a charge clamp mechanism involving glutamate and lysine residues (Li2005Structural).

Alternative splicing of NR3C2 generates multiple MR isoforms, including MRD5,6, which exhibits ligand-independent transcriptional activity (Zennaro2012Aldosterone). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination may also play roles in modulating MR function.

## Function
The NR3C2 gene encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a crucial component in regulating electrolyte and fluid balance in the body. This receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. It primarily binds to mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone, facilitating the regulation of genes involved in sodium and potassium homeostasis (Bledsoe2005A; Balsamo2007Functional).

In healthy human cells, MR is predominantly active in the distal nephron of the kidney, where it plays a vital role in sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, processes essential for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance (Farman2001Multiple). The receptor is also expressed in other tissues, including the colon, heart, and brain, where it influences various physiological functions (Bledsoe2005A).

The MR's ligand-binding domain is critical for its activation, involving specific interactions with steroid hormones. These interactions are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds, which are essential for the receptor's function (Bledsoe2005A). Mutations in the NR3C2 gene can disrupt these processes, leading to conditions such as pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, characterized by impaired sodium retention and electrolyte imbalance (Balsamo2007Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NR3C2 gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a condition characterized by resistance to aldosterone. This leads to symptoms such as salt wasting, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and dehydration, particularly in infancy (Balsamo2007Functional; Riepe2006Elucidating). PHA1 can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern, with the dominant form often showing milder symptoms that may improve with age (Balsamo2007Functional).

Various types of mutations in NR3C2, including nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, have been identified. These mutations can result in truncated MR proteins that lack transcriptional activity or have altered receptor conformation, affecting the receptor's ability to bind aldosterone and activate transcription (Kawashima2017A; Riepe2006Elucidating). Structural disruptions, such as chromosomal inversions affecting the NR3C2 gene, can also lead to PHA1 by impairing mineralocorticoid receptor function (O’Connell2011Structural).

Alterations in NR3C2 expression or function may also contribute to other conditions, such as hypertension and heart failure, due to its role in regulating electrolyte and fluid balance (Hanukoglu2020Reninaldosterone).

## Interactions
The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), encoded by the NR3C2 gene, engages in complex interactions with glucocorticoid receptors (GR) within the nucleoplasm and at DNA sites in living cells. These interactions are significant in corticosterone-treated cells, where MR and GR form complexes beyond the traditional heterodimer model, potentially involving higher-order structures such as tetramers (Pooley2020Beyond). The interactions between MR and GR are not solely dependent on the D-loop interface, suggesting alternative interaction sites, including the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and possibly the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and hinge regions (Pooley2020Beyond).

MR and GR interactions are influenced by ligand binding, with different ligands modulating the interaction strength. These interactions can lead to diverse transcriptional outcomes, as MR can either inhibit or synergize with GR-mediated responses depending on the context, such as the type of DNA binding site (Pooley2020Beyond). In trout, MR has been shown to modulate GR activity through mechanisms that do not involve changes in receptor localization or require MR transcriptional activity, indicating a complex regulatory role (Kiilerich2015Interaction). These findings highlight the structural flexibility and functional diversity of MR-GR interactions, which are crucial for understanding their roles in gene regulation.
