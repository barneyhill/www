# TAPBP

## Overview
TAPBP, or TAP binding protein, is a gene that encodes the protein tapasin, a crucial component of the immune system's antigen presentation machinery. Tapasin is a molecular chaperone that plays a pivotal role in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathway. It is a part of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), which includes other proteins such as the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), ERp57, and calreticulin. Tapasin facilitates the loading of high-affinity peptides onto MHC class I molecules, ensuring their stable expression on the cell surface and subsequent recognition by T cell receptors and natural killer cell receptors. This function is essential for effective immune surveillance and response, as it ensures that only properly loaded MHC class I molecules present antigens to CD8+ T cells and NK cells (ilca2020molecular; Margulies2020Structural).

## Function
TAPBP, also known as tapasin, is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. It is a component of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), which includes the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)1/TAP2 heterodimer, ERp57, and calreticulin. TAPBP facilitates the loading of high-affinity peptides onto MHC class I molecules, which is essential for their stable expression on the cell surface and recognition by T cell receptors (TCR) and natural killer (NK) receptors (ilca2020molecular; Margulies2020Structural).

TAPBP functions by bridging TAP and MHC class I molecules, ensuring proximity to peptide influx sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. This association stabilizes TAP, preventing its degradation, and allows TAPBP to perform 'peptide editing,' exchanging low-affinity peptides for high-affinity ones. This process ensures that only stably-bound antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules, which is crucial for effective CD8+ T cell and NK cell-mediated immune responses (ilca2020molecular).

In tapasin-deficient cells, MHC class I molecules exhibit reduced surface expression and altered peptide repertoires, impairing immune responses. TAPBP's role in peptide loading and editing is vital for the quality control and surface expression of peptide/MHC-I complexes (ilca2020molecular; Margulies2020Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TAPBP gene have significant clinical implications. In the context of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TAPBP gene, such as rs2071888 C > G (Thr260Arg), are associated with an increased risk of developing this condition in asthmatic individuals. This SNP is linked to a higher prevalence of AERD and a greater decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after aspirin challenge, indicating its role in aspirin intolerance (Cho2013Association).

In cancer, downregulation of TAPBP expression is observed in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The SNP rs3106189 in the 5' UTR of TAPBP is associated with improved survival rates in CRC patients, suggesting that TAPBP expression levels may influence cancer prognosis (Shao2013Targeted). Additionally, TAPBP downregulation is noted as a mechanism for immune escape in tumors, with its loss observed in a significant percentage of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and primary adenocarcinomas (Shao2013Targeted).

Furthermore, TAPBP deficiencies can lead to reduced MHC class I expression, affecting antigen presentation and immune recognition, which is relevant in transplantation and immune response modulation (Cui2016Generating).

## Interactions
TAPBP, also known as tapasin, is a critical component of the peptide-loading complex (PLC) involved in the assembly and stabilization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Tapasin forms a stable heterodimer with the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 through a mixed disulfide bond, which is essential for its function in the PLC (Dong2009Insights; Müller2022Structure). This interaction stabilizes the MHC class I molecule in a peptide-receptive conformation, facilitating the loading of high-affinity peptides (Dong2009Insights).

Tapasin also interacts with the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), positioning empty MHC class I molecules near the source of antigenic peptides (Dong2009Insights). The interaction between tapasin and ERp57 is noncovalent, stabilizing a transient mixed disulfide bond, which is crucial for the oxidative folding of the MHC class I heavy chain (Dong2009Insights).

Mutational analysis has identified a conserved surface on tapasin that is critical for its interaction with MHC class I molecules, affecting peptide loading and editing functions (Dong2009Insights). This conserved surface is essential for the recruitment and peptide loading of MHC class I molecules, highlighting tapasin's role in immune surveillance (Dong2009Insights).
