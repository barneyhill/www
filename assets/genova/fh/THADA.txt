# THADA

## Overview
THADA (thyroid adenoma associated) is a gene that encodes the THADA armadillo repeat containing protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of insulin secretion and calcium dynamics within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein is characterized by its armadillo repeat motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role in binding activities related to the death receptor pathway (Drieschner2007A). THADA is implicated in the modulation of ER calcium stores, influencing insulin release and β-cell survival, and is associated with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Zhang2023THADA). The gene's interactions with proteins involved in vesicle transport and calcium homeostasis underscore its significance in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation (Zhang2023THADA; Li2021THADA).

## Structure
The THADA protein is characterized by a sequence length ranging from 1931 to 1954 amino acids across different species, including humans (Drieschner2007A). It contains a conserved domain spanning approximately amino acids 1033-1415, which shows high sequence similarity and is potentially functionally important. This region includes similarities to the uncharacterized conserved domain COG5543 and is disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements in thyroid adenomas (Drieschner2007A). The THADA protein also exhibits similarities to the ARM repeat superfamily, which includes structures like Armadillo and HEAT repeats known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Drieschner2007A). These structural features suggest that THADA may be involved in protein binding activities, possibly related to the death receptor pathway (Drieschner2007A).

The genomic organization of the THADA gene is conserved among humans and other species, with 38 exons and similar exon/intron boundaries (Drieschner2007A). The protein is encoded by a single open reading frame in all analyzed species, with a molecular weight between 216,601 Da and 219,595 Da (Drieschner2007A). The THADA protein is hypothesized to be a ligand of the death receptor DR5, based on two-hybrid experiments (Drieschner2007A).

## Function
The THADA gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in pancreatic β-cell function, particularly in the regulation of insulin secretion and calcium dynamics within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In healthy human cells, THADA interacts with SERCA2, a calcium pump, and RyR2, a ryanodine receptor, to modulate ER calcium stores. This interaction leads to reduced ER calcium levels, which is crucial for insulin secretion (Zhang2023THADA). THADA's role in calcium homeostasis affects the intracellular calcium levels upon glucose stimulation, influencing insulin release (Zhang2023THADA).

THADA is also involved in the regulation of β-cell mass and survival. It has been shown to exacerbate ER stress-induced apoptosis through the DR5/FADD/caspase-8 pathway, impacting β-cell viability and mass (Zhang2023THADA). In conditions of glucolipotoxicity, THADA expression increases, leading to decreased ER calcium stores and impaired insulin secretion (Zhang2023THADA). The gene's activity is associated with the cytoplasm and the ER, where it influences critical processes related to energy metabolism and thermogenesis (SimonisBik2009Gene). These functions highlight THADA's importance in maintaining glucose homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.

## Clinical Significance
The THADA gene has been implicated in several diseases, primarily type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Variants of the THADA gene have been associated with T2DM through genome-wide association studies, showing excess maternal transmission to offspring with the disease. This suggests a disease-specific effect, as THADA is linked to lower pancreatic β-cell response, impairing insulin secretion and β-cell survival by decreasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and aggravating ER stress-induced apoptosis (Zhang2023THADA). Inhibition of THADA in mice has shown protective effects against T2DM by improving β-cell function and preserving β-cell mass, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2023THADA).

THADA variants have also been linked to PCOS, a condition often associated with insulin resistance, suggesting a shared pathophysiology with T2DM (Zhang2023THADA). The gene's expression is elevated in T2DM patients, correlating with impaired β-cell function and increased apoptosis, which exacerbates hyperglycemia and β-cell mass loss (Zhang2023THADA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of THADA in metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
The THADA protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with components of the COPII vesicle transport system, specifically Sec23A and Sec24A, which are crucial for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is essential for the trafficking and stabilization of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune evasion by cancer cells (Li2021THADA). THADA's role in maintaining PD-L1 expression is further supported by its interaction with Sec24A, facilitating PD-L1's export from the ER and its Golgi residency (Li2021THADA).

THADA also interacts with the sarco/ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), impacting calcium homeostasis within cells. This interaction is significant in the context of pancreatic β-cell function, where THADA's regulation of ER Ca2+ stores affects insulin secretion and β-cell survival (Zhang2023THADA). Additionally, THADA has been implicated in the regulation of PD-L1 protein degradation through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, involving the HRD1 complex, which includes E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and lectin-like proteins OS-9 and XTP3-B (Li2021THADA). These interactions highlight THADA's role in modulating protein stability and cellular signaling pathways.
