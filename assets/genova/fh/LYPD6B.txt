# LYPD6B

## Overview
LYPD6B is a gene that encodes the LY6/PLAUR domain containing 6B protein, a member of the Ly6/uPAR superfamily. This protein is characterized by a three-fingered LU domain and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. LYPD6B is primarily involved in modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly influencing the α3β4 subtype, while not significantly affecting the α7 subtype. This selective interaction suggests a specialized role in cholinergic signaling and neuromodulation, potentially impacting cognitive functions and memory. The protein's structural features, including its unique β-sheet and hydrophilic surface, contribute to its specific receptor interactions and functional roles. LYPD6B has also been implicated in various diseases, including colorectal cancer, where it acts as a negative regulator of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024Lypd6b; Miwa2019Lynx; Kulbatskii2021Human).

## Structure
The LYPD6B protein is a member of the Ly6/uPAR family and features a LU domain characterized by a three-fingered fold. This structure includes a disulfide-stabilized β-structural core and three protruding loops, which are common in proteins involved in cell signaling (Paramonov2020Structural; Zaigraev2022Orientational). The protein is stabilized by six disulfide bonds, with four invariant bonds in the 'head' and two additional disulfides in loops I and III (Paramonov2020Structural). 

Lypd6b has a unique structure compared to other three-finger proteins, featuring a single wide antiparallel β-sheet formed by five strands. The β1 strand involves residues from loop I, while the central β2, β3, and β5 strands include fragments from loops II and III. The α-helical elements α1 and α2 are observed in loop I and the 'head' of the proteins, respectively (Paramonov2020Structural). 

The protein's surface is hydrophilic with a uniform distribution of charged and polar groups, and it lacks a continuous hydrophobic 'belt' found in Lypd6, making it less negative at neutral pH (Paramonov2020Structural). Lypd6b is GPI-anchored to the cell membrane, interacting with the membrane through its polypeptide parts and glycans (Zaigraev2022Orientational).

## Function
LYPD6B is a member of the LY6/uPAR superfamily and is involved in modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in a subtype-specific manner. It is expressed in various tissues, including the cerebral cortex, where it is found in glutamatergic neurons of the deep layer of the mammalian visual cortex. LYPD6B selectively inhibits nAChR-mediated currents through α3β4 nAChRs, but does not significantly affect α7 subtype-mediated currents. This suggests that LYPD6B plays a specialized role in nAChR modulation, potentially occurring at the α-α interface of the receptor (Miwa2019Lynx).

The protein is also associated with neuromodulation and has been linked to cognitive functions and memory. It is part of the Ly6/uPAR family, which includes proteins that are often GPI-anchored and involved in cholinergic signaling. LYPD6B's interaction with nAChRs suggests it may influence synaptic transmission and plasticity, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear (Loughner2016Organization; Kulbatskii2021Human). Despite its involvement in these processes, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of LYPD6B in healthy human cells are not fully understood (Leth2019Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
LYPD6B has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through its role in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), LYPD6B is upregulated and acts as a negative regulator of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, promoting tumorigenesis. Its high expression correlates with larger tumor size and higher tumor grade, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. LYPD6B deficiency in mice leads to enhanced CD8+ T cell activation and reduced tumor growth, indicating that targeting LYPD6B could enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve CRC treatment outcomes (Zhang2024Lypd6b).

In early-onset breast cancer (EOBC), LYPD6B gene amplifications are associated with a lower mean age-at-diagnosis, while deletions are linked to a higher mean age-at-diagnosis, suggesting a bidirectional effect on cancer development (Gilbert2020Retrospective).

LYPD6B is also part of a nine-gene expression signature used to predict stage development in stomach adenocarcinoma, although it is not an independent prognostic factor. Its expression alterations may contribute to cancer progression (Liu2022A).

Additionally, LYPD6B is involved in regulating nicotinic cholinergic signaling in the nervous system, and changes in its expression or mutations could affect its physiological roles (Zaigraev2022Orientational).

## Interactions
LYPD6B, a member of the Ly6/uPAR protein family, is involved in various interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). It specifically interacts with the α3β4-nAChR subtype but does not interact with the α7-nAChR, unlike its close relative Lypd6, which can extract the α7-nAChR subunit from the brain (Paramonov2020Structural). The differences in interaction with nAChRs between LYPD6B and Lypd6 are attributed to variations in their loop sequences and spatial arrangements, which affect their surface properties and receptor binding capabilities (Kulbatskii2021Human).

LYPD6B is also suggested to participate in the protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathway, enhancing the pro-transcriptional activity of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Paramonov2020Structural). Additionally, LYPD6B's interaction with membrane lipids involves forming stable hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, which may influence its orientation and receptor-binding potential (Zaigraev2022Orientational). These interactions are crucial for understanding LYPD6B's functional role in the nervous system and its potential implications in diseases such as colorectal cancer, where it acts as a negative regulator of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity (Zhang2024Lypd6b).
