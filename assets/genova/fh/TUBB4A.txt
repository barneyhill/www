# TUBB4A

## Overview
The TUBB4A gene encodes the tubulin beta-4A class IVa protein, a critical component of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which plays a vital role in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport and cell division. As a member of the tubulin family, tubulin beta-4A forms heterodimers with alpha-tubulin, contributing to the dynamic assembly and stability of microtubules. This protein is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it is involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal and oligodendrocyte structures, impacting processes such as myelination and motor coordination (Curiel2017TUBB4A; Sase2020TUBB4A). Mutations in TUBB4A are linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopment and cellular integrity (Fellner2022Insilico).

## Structure
The TUBB4A gene encodes the tubulin beta-4A protein, a principal component of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular functions such as transport, motility, and mitosis (Fellner2022Insilico; Löwe2001Refined). The primary structure of TUBB4A consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which is typical for beta-tubulin proteins (Gao2022TUBB4A). 

The secondary structure of tubulin proteins, including TUBB4A, involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Löwe2001Refined). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with other proteins and form microtubules (Löwe2001Refined). 

In terms of quaternary structure, TUBB4A assembles into microtubules by forming heterodimers with alpha-tubulin, such as TUBA1A, which are crucial for microtubule assembly and dynamics (Liang2024LncRNA). The protein is involved in forming the microtubule lattice, which is stabilized by lateral contacts and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (Hoff2022The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions (Curiel2017TUBB4A). These structural features and modifications are critical for the protein's role in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

## Function
The TUBB4A gene encodes the tubulin beta 4A protein, a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function. In healthy human cells, TUBB4A is involved in the polymerization and stability of microtubules, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Curiel2017TUBB4A; Sase2020TUBB4A). 

TUBB4A is highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons and oligodendrocytes, where it plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of myelin and neuronal processes (Sase2020TUBB4A). The protein forms heterodimers with alpha-tubulin, which assemble into microtubules, supporting the structural integrity and function of neurons and oligodendrocytes (Liang2024LncRNA). 

In the cerebellum and white matter tracts of the brain, TUBB4A is crucial for proper motor skills and coordination, as evidenced by its role in maintaining normal cellular functions in these regions (Sase2020TUBB4A). The protein's activity in microtubule dynamics is vital for neuronal and oligodendrocyte development, affecting axonal transport and intracellular transport of key myelin proteins (Sase2020TUBB4A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBB4A gene are associated with a spectrum of neurological disorders, collectively known as TUBB4A-associated disorders. These conditions range from isolated late-onset torsion dystonia to severe early-onset diseases characterized by developmental delay, neurological deficits, and atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (Fellner2022Insilico). One of the notable disorders linked to TUBB4A mutations is Dystonia Type 4 (DYT4), also known as whispering dysphonia, which is characterized by laryngeal dystonia and can progress to generalized dystonia (Bally2021DYTTUBB4A). The p.Arg2Gly mutation is specifically associated with DYT4 and affects neuronal morphology without impacting oligodendrocytes or myelin gene expression (Curiel2017TUBB4A).

Another significant condition associated with TUBB4A mutations is Hypomyelination with Atrophy of the Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H-ABC). This disorder is characterized by hypomyelination, developmental delay, and progressive neurological symptoms. The p.Asp249Asn mutation is commonly linked to H-ABC, affecting both neurons and oligodendrocytes, leading to altered myelin gene expression and microtubule dynamics (Curiel2017TUBB4A; Joyal2018SevereTUBB4ARelated). These mutations result in diverse clinical phenotypes due to their selective impact on different cell types and microtubule dynamics (Curiel2017TUBB4A).

## Interactions
TUBB4A, a member of the tubulin family, participates in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) TubAR and the tubulin protein TUBA1A. This complex is essential for microtubule assembly and myelination in the cerebellum. TubAR facilitates the formation of TUBB4A-TUBA1A heterodimers, which are incorporated into microtubules, playing a crucial role in neuron and oligodendrocyte survival (Liang2024LncRNA).

In the context of prostate cancer, TUBB4A interacts with MYH9, a cytoplasmic myosin, to protect the nucleus during cell migration. This interaction is significant for maintaining cell shape and cytokinesis, particularly in 3D environments. TUBB4A's interaction with MYH9 also influences the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is important for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenic properties of prostate cancer cells. Knockout of TUBB4A leads to increased DNA damage and disruption of NF-κB signaling, highlighting its role in cellular integrity during migration (Gao2022TUBB4A).

These interactions underscore TUBB4A's involvement in both structural cellular processes and signaling pathways, contributing to its roles in microtubule dynamics and cancer progression.
