# CAV2

## Overview
CAV2 is a gene that encodes the protein caveolin-2, a member of the caveolin family, which is integral to the formation of caveolae—small invaginations in the plasma membrane. Caveolin-2 is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, lipid metabolism, and endocytosis. It is predominantly expressed in adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells, where it influences cellular functions such as lipid regulation and vascular function. Caveolin-2 requires co-expression with caveolin-1 for proper membrane targeting and stability, forming hetero-oligomeric complexes essential for its function. While not indispensable for caveolae formation, caveolin-2 contributes to the organization and regulation of signaling molecules within these structures. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and lung tissue abnormalities, highlighting its significance in cellular physiology and disease (Williams2004The; Cohen2004Role; Scherer1996Identification).

## Structure
Caveolin-2 (CAV2) is a protein that is part of the caveolin family, which plays a crucial role in the formation of caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane. The primary structure of CAV2 includes a 149 amino acid sequence with a predicted molecular mass of 16.8 kDa, although it migrates at approximately 20 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gels (Scherer1996Identification). CAV2 shares 38% identity and 58% similarity with caveolin-1, featuring a conserved region of eight identical amino acids (FEDVIAEP) in the N-terminal domains of both proteins (Scherer1996Identification).

The secondary structure of CAV2 includes a 33-amino acid membrane-spanning segment and a hydrophilic 43 to 44-amino acid C-terminal domain (Scherer1996Identification). The protein's N-terminal domain is 26 amino acids shorter than that of caveolin-1 (Scherer1996Identification). CAV2 is palmitoylated at three cysteine residues, which may influence its membrane association (Root2019Secondary).

In terms of quaternary structure, CAV2 can form a dimeric structure, unlike caveolin-1, which forms high molecular mass oligomers (Scherer1996Identification). CAV2 requires co-expression with caveolin-1 for proper caveolae formation and membrane targeting (Williams2004The). It colocalizes with caveolin-1 in low-density fractions, indicating their presence in similar cellular compartments (Scherer1996Identification).

## Function
Caveolin-2 (CAV2) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in the formation and function of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. CAV2 is co-expressed and colocalized with caveolin-1 (CAV1) in many tissues, and its proper membrane targeting depends on forming hetero-oligomers with CAV1. This interaction stabilizes CAV2 against proteasomal degradation and facilitates its transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (Williams2004Thecaveolinproteins; Cohen2004Role).

CAV2 is involved in signal transduction, lipid metabolism, and endocytosis. It is particularly active in adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells, where it influences cellular processes such as lipid regulation and vascular function (Sowa2012Caveolae; Scherer1996Identification). Although CAV2 is not essential for caveolae formation, it contributes to the organization and regulation of signaling molecules within these structures (Williams2004The; Cohen2004Role).

CAV2 also plays a role in lung tissue pathology, as evidenced by studies on caveolin-2 null mice, which exhibit significant lung abnormalities. This suggests that CAV2 has specific roles in maintaining lung tissue health (Cohen2004Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAV2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In HNSCC, high CAV2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased invasiveness and metastasis. CAV2 promotes these processes by regulating S100 proteins, particularly through the degradation of S100A14 via the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM29, which is linked to reduced invasiveness when CAV2 is silenced (Wang2022CAV2). 

In pancreatic cancer, CAV2 is significantly upregulated and correlates with worse survival outcomes. It enhances cancer cell migration and metastasis by activating the Wnt7A/β-catenin signaling pathway and influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Li2022CAV2). Genetic variants such as rs10249656 in the CAV2 gene have been linked to increased expression and poor prognosis in PDAC, affecting pathways critical for cancer progression (Zhu2021A).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), CAV2 expression is higher in patients, suggesting a potential role in disease pathology. Variants in CAV2 enhancers are associated with reduced gene expression and altered disease progression, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism in ALS (Adey2023Largescale).

## Interactions
Caveolin-2 (CAV2) is known to interact with several proteins, primarily forming complexes with other members of the caveolin family. CAV2 forms heterooligomeric complexes with caveolin-1 (CAV1), which is essential for its proper localization to caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane. In the absence of CAV1, CAV2 tends to form monomers and dimers that are targeted for degradation, indicating that CAV1 acts as a chaperone for CAV2, facilitating its stability and function (Capozza2005Musclespecific; de2017Caveolin1).

CAV2 also interacts with caveolin-3 (CAV3) in muscle cells, where it can coimmunoprecipitate with CAV3, suggesting a muscle-specific interaction. This interaction is not observed in non-muscle cells, highlighting the tissue-specific nature of CAV2's interactions (Capozza2005Musclespecific). In cardiomyocytes, CAV2 is found to associate with CAV3, potentially influencing cardiac muscle physiology (Rybin2003Caveolaeassociated).

Additionally, CAV2 can activate the GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting a role in signal transduction similar to CAV1, which interacts with multiple G proteins through specific residues (Scherer1996Identification). These interactions underscore CAV2's involvement in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and caveolae formation.
