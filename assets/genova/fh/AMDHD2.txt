# AMDHD2

## Overview
The AMDHD2 gene encodes the amidohydrolase domain containing 2 protein, a crucial enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This enzyme is categorized as a deacetylase and is responsible for the conversion of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) into glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P), a reaction vital for maintaining cellular UDP-GlcNAc homeostasis. The AMDHD2 protein functions as a dimer, with its structure comprising a deacetylase domain and a smaller domain of unknown function. The presence of a zinc ion in the active site is essential for its catalytic activity. AMDHD2 plays a significant role in regulating metabolic flux within the HBP, particularly in cells where GFPT2 replaces GFPT1 as the primary enzyme, and is especially important in embryonic stem cells (Kroef2021GFAT2; Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2).

## Structure
The AMDHD2 protein is a dimeric enzyme involved in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Its structure is organized into two domains: a deacetylase domain responsible for converting GlcNAc-6P into GlcN6P, and a smaller domain with an unknown function (Kroef2021GFAT2). The deacetylase domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, and the presence of a single zinc ion in the active site is essential for its catalytic function (Kroef2021GFAT2).

The protein functions as an obligate dimer, with residues from both monomers contributing to ligand binding in the active site, while catalytic residues originate from one monomer (Kroef2021GFAT2). This suggests that while monomeric AMDHD2 might be active, it likely has weaker substrate affinity or specificity. The oligomeric state of AMDHD2 is considered a potential target for modulating its catalytic properties (Kroef2021GFAT2).

The study of AMDHD2's structure was facilitated by co-crystallization with ZnCl2, which improved the thermal stability and deacetylase activity of the protein, indicating that zinc ions might serve as metal co-factors (Kroef2021GFAT2). The crystal structure was determined using X-ray diffraction, achieving a resolution limit of 1.84 Ã… (Kroef2021GFAT2).

## Function
The AMDHD2 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) by catalyzing the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) into glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). This reaction is essential for maintaining cellular UDP-GlcNAc homeostasis, a key metabolite involved in various glycosylation processes crucial for protein folding, cellular signaling, and structural integrity (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). AMDHD2 functions as a dimeric enzyme, with residues from both monomers contributing to ligand binding in the active site, while catalysis is performed by residues from one monomer (Kroef2021GFAT2).

In healthy human cells, AMDHD2 is involved in regulating the metabolic flux within the HBP, particularly in cells where GFPT2 replaces GFPT1 as the primary enzyme (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). The enzyme's activity is crucial for balancing the forward and reverse flux of the pathway, thereby controlling the levels of UDP-GlcNAc and ensuring proper cellular function (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). AMDHD2's role is particularly significant in embryonic stem cells, where its abundance is higher, and its knockout results in elevated UDP-GlcNAc levels, indicating its importance in cellular protection and development (Kroef2021GFAT2; Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2).
