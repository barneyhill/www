# ARL17B

## Overview
ARL17B is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 17B, which is part of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. The ARL17B gene is located on chromosome 17 and has been studied for its potential role in several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. The protein encoded by ARL17B is implicated in synaptic vesicle trafficking, which is crucial for neuronal communication and function (SotoBeasley2020Screening). Variations in the ARL17B gene have been associated with progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its significance in neurological health (Allen2016Gene). Additionally, ARL17B is involved in cancer predisposition through fusion events with other genes, suggesting a broader impact on human health (LópezNieva2019Detection).

## Clinical Significance
ARL17B has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and conditions due to its genetic variations and expression alterations. In the context of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), ARL17B is considered a candidate risk gene. Variants such as rs242557 and rs8070723 at the MAPT locus have been associated with changes in ARL17B expression and methylation, potentially influencing PSP risk and neuropathology (Allen2016Gene). The gene's expression levels are lower in carriers of the H2 haplotype, which is linked to fewer copies of a specific CNV, suggesting a role in PSP pathogenesis (Allen2016Gene).

ARL17B is also involved in cancer predisposition through the KANSL1-ARL17A/B fusion, which has been identified in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and other tumors. This fusion is present in both tumor and normal tissues, indicating a potential germ-line fusion gene involved in cancer predisposition (LópezNieva2019Detection).

In Parkinson's disease, ARL17B, along with other genes in the chr17q21 H1 haplotype, may influence susceptibility due to its involvement in synaptic vesicle trafficking and interactions in the nervous system (SotoBeasley2020Screening). These findings suggest that ARL17B plays a significant role in various pathological conditions through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
