# TSKU

## Overview
The TSKU gene encodes the protein tsukushi, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. Tsukushi is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it modulates growth factor activity and influences tissue development and repair. It is involved in critical signaling pathways such as Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and Wnt, which are essential for cell differentiation and development (Zhao2018microRNA2110; Li2021Tsukushi). Additionally, tsukushi functions as a hepatokine, impacting metabolic processes and is associated with obesity-related traits (Li2021Tsukushi). The gene's expression is also significant in the context of neuroblastoma, where it is targeted by microRNA-2110, acting as an onco-suppressor (Zhao2018microRNA2110). These diverse roles underscore the importance of TSKU in both normal physiological functions and disease states.

## Function
Tsukushi (TSKU) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. It is involved in modulating growth factor activity and interactions with the extracellular matrix, which are crucial for tissue development and repair. TSKU is active in the extracellular space, where it influences processes such as organogenesis and wound healing (Li2021Tsukushi).

In the context of metabolic health, TSKU has been identified as a hepatokine, a type of protein secreted by the liver that can influence metabolic processes. Studies have shown that serum levels of TSKU are associated with obesity and related metabolic traits. Specifically, lower levels of TSKU have been observed in obese individuals, and these levels are positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), visceral fat area, and glucose metabolism deterioration (Li2021Tsukushi).

The TSKU gene has also been implicated in neuroblastoma, where it is targeted by microRNA-2110, functioning as an onco-suppressor. This interaction suggests that TSKU plays a role in cell differentiation and survival, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts (Zhao2018microRNA2110).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TSKU gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In neuroblastoma, a type of aggressive childhood cancer, TSKU expression is inversely correlated with the levels of microRNA-2110 (miR-2110), which functions as an onco-suppressor by targeting TSKU. High TSKU expression is associated with poor patient survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. The suppression of TSKU by miR-2110 leads to increased neurite outgrowth and decreased cell proliferation, indicating that TSKU may contribute to tumor growth and progression in neuroblastoma (Zhao2018microRNA2110).

In the context of neural development, TSKU is crucial for maintaining RNA splicing and developmental signaling in neural stem/progenitor cells. TSKU deficiency can lead to conditions such as hydrocephalus, characterized by excessive fluid in the brain's ventricles. This is due to disrupted Wnt signaling, which is essential for proper lateral ventricle development. TSKU deficiency results in genome-wide missplicing and transcriptional dysregulation, affecting pathways like Wnt, Sonic Hedgehog, and mTOR, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival (Istiaq2022Tsukushi). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TSKU in both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
Tsukushi (TSKU) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that participates in various biological interactions. It is known to interact with several signaling molecules and pathways, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and development. TSKU has been shown to modulate the activity of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell differentiation and development (Zhao2018microRNA2110).

In the context of neuroblastoma, TSKU is directly targeted by microRNA-2110 (miR-2110), which acts as an onco-suppressor. This interaction involves miR-2110 binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of TSKU mRNA, leading to the repression of TSKU protein expression. This interaction has been validated through luciferase reporter assays, confirming the presence of three functional target sites for miR-2110 within the TSKU 3'UTR (Zhao2018microRNA2110).

TSKU also plays a role in wound healing by regulating cytokines and growth factors, particularly through its interaction with TGF-β1, which it inhibits to control macrophage function and myofibroblast differentiation (Niimori2014Tsukushi). These interactions highlight TSKU's involvement in complex signaling networks and its potential impact on various cellular functions.
