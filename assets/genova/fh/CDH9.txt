# CDH9

## Overview
CDH9 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 9, a type II classical cadherin, which is part of the cadherin superfamily known for their role in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. Cadherin 9 is characterized by its extracellular region composed of five cadherin domains, which facilitate homophilic interactions crucial for cell-cell adhesion, particularly in neural tissues (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The protein's structure is stabilized by calcium ions, which are essential for its function in maintaining proper cellular interactions. CDH9 is notably expressed in the retina and cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in neural development and organization. Its involvement in the laminar targeting of axons in the retina and its expression in Purkinje cells during cerebellar development suggest its importance in synaptic specificity and neural circuit formation. Alterations in CDH9 expression have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2019Segregated; Yusuf2022Retinal).

## Structure
CDH9, a type II classical cadherin, is part of the cadherin superfamily, which are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. The protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which consists of five cadherin (EC) domains. These domains are approximately 110 amino acids long and form a beta-sandwich fold composed of seven beta-strands arranged into two beta-sheets, similar to immunoglobulin-like domains (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). 

The primary structure of CDH9 includes conserved tryptophan residues in the EC1 domain, which are crucial for its function, although it lacks the HAV tripeptide motif found in type I cadherins (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these EC domains into a compact form, stabilized by calcium ions that bind at the interdomain linkers, imparting rigidity and facilitating homophilic interactions (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

CDH9 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function. The quaternary structure likely involves homophilic interactions with other cadherin molecules, contributing to its role in cell-cell adhesion (Sotomayor2014Sorting).

## Function
CDH9 (cadherin 9) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in maintaining proper cell-cell interactions, particularly in neural tissue. In the retina, CDH9 is expressed in the ON bipolar cell type BC5 and is essential for the laminar targeting of these cells' axons within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). This targeting is critical for forming synapses onto ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells (ooDSGCs) and starburst amacrine cells (SACs). The loss of CDH9 function results in disorganized lamination, while its ectopic expression can redirect stratification, indicating its role in the adhesion code that facilitates interaction between synaptic partners, contributing to proper neural wiring and organization in the retina (Yusuf2022Retinal).

In the cerebellum, CDH9 is expressed in segregated sub-populations of Purkinje cells during early postnatal development, with expression levels declining as development proceeds. This expression pattern suggests that CDH9 may be involved in early developmental processes of cerebellar circuits, potentially influencing synaptic specificity and the wiring of local circuitries in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related areas (Wang2019Segregated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDH9 gene have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) have identified CDH9 as a risk gene for ASD, with its expression observed in specific regions of the developing cerebellum that are relevant to ASD (Wang2019Segregated). The gene is expressed in segregated sub-populations of Purkinje cells during early postnatal development, suggesting a role in the regulation of ASD-relevant circuits in the cerebellum (Wang2019Segregated).

Despite these associations, studies have shown mixed results regarding the influence of CDH9 on autistic-like traits (ALTs). For instance, a study examining the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4307059, located between CDH9 and CDH10, did not find significant associations with ALTs in a large cohort, highlighting the complexity and heterogeneity of genetic contributions to ASD (Jonsson2014Association). This suggests that while CDH9 is implicated in ASD, its role may be influenced by other genetic and environmental factors, and common polymorphisms may not have a major impact on ALTs in the general population (Jonsson2014Association).
