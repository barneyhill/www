# HHLA2

## Overview
HHLA2, or HERV-H LTR-associating 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules. The protein, also referred to as B7-H7, is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which play a crucial role in modulating immune responses. HHLA2 is expressed in various tissues and is involved in both stimulatory and inhibitory immune signaling pathways, interacting with receptors such as TMIGD2 and KIR3DL3 on T cells and other immune cells. This dual functionality allows HHLA2 to maintain immune homeostasis and tolerance, making it a significant focus in the study of immune regulation and cancer immunotherapy (Schildberg2016Coinhibitory; Rieder2020B7H7; Mager1999Endogenous).

## Structure
HHLA2 is a member of the B7 family and is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. The protein is composed of 414 amino acids, with the first 22 amino acids forming a secretory signal peptide (Mager1999Endogenous). The extracellular region of HHLA2 contains three Ig-like domains. The first two domains show similarity to the CD80/CD86 family, while the third domain has characteristics of the variable subset of Ig domains (Mager1999Endogenous). The protein also has eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain, which is a common post-translational modification (Mager1999Endogenous).

HHLA2 is a type I transmembrane protein, indicating it spans the cell membrane with an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Janakiram2017The). The cytoplasmic region is 49 amino acids long and lacks recognizable motifs (Mager1999Endogenous). The protein's structure includes immunoglobulin V-set and C1-set domains, which are significant for its function in immune response modulation (Achinko2021Targeted). The presence of these domains suggests a complex structure with potential roles in immune interactions.

## Function
HHLA2, also known as B7-H7, is a member of the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules and plays a complex role in immune regulation. It is expressed in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, lung, and placenta, and is involved in modulating immune responses (Mager1999Endogenous; Luu2021B7H7). HHLA2 is primarily active on the cell surface and influences immune cell signaling pathways by interacting with receptors on T cells and other immune cells (Rieder2020B7H7).

In healthy human cells, HHLA2 can exhibit both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on T cells. It is inducible on T cells upon activation and is associated with an exhausted T cell phenotype, characterized by impaired cytokine secretion (Luu2021B7H7). HHLA2 interacts with the TMIGD2 receptor, which is expressed on naive T cells and NK cells, functioning as a costimulatory receptor for naive T cells (Schildberg2016Coinhibitory). However, HHLA2 also acts as a coinhibitory molecule, inhibiting T-cell activation and proliferation in the presence of TCR and CD28 signaling, similar to PD-L1 (Rieder2020B7H7). This dual functionality suggests that HHLA2 plays a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance.

## Clinical Significance
HHLA2, a member of the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HHLA2 is associated with immune evasion mechanisms, and its expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome immune suppression (Yan2019HHLA2). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), HHLA2 overexpression is linked to poor patient survival and is associated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage, indicating its role in tumor progression and as a prognostic marker (Chen2019Overexpression).

In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), HHLA2 is expressed in a significant proportion of tumors and is associated with EGFR mutations, contributing to tumor immune suppression by regulating T-cell function (Cheng2017HHLA2). HHLA2 is also upregulated in liver cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it correlates with poor prognosis and immune escape mechanisms (Kula2024The). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, high HHLA2 expression is linked to aggressive disease and poor prognosis (Janakiram2017The). These findings highlight HHLA2's potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy across various tumor types.

## Interactions
HHLA2, a member of the B7 family, interacts with several receptors, notably TMIGD2 and KIR3DL3, which have opposing effects on T cell activation. TMIGD2, also known as CD28H and IGPR1, acts as a co-stimulatory receptor. When HHLA2 binds to TMIGD2, it induces T cell growth and cytokine production through an AKT-dependent signaling cascade, which is crucial for modulating the immune response and weakening tumor cells (Kula2024The; Yan2019HHLA2). TMIGD2 is expressed in naive T cells and NK cells, but its expression decreases as T cells become activated (Kula2024The).

Conversely, HHLA2 also interacts with KIR3DL3, a co-inhibitory receptor, which significantly decreases T cell activation upon binding. KIR3DL3 is primarily expressed in CD8+ and NK cells and contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The interaction between HHLA2 and KIR3DL3 leads to the inhibition of T cells and mediates tumor resistance against NK cells. As T cells become activated, the expression of KIR3DL3 increases, enhancing the co-inhibitory effects of HHLA2 (Kula2024The). These interactions are specific to mammals and do not occur in other members of the B7 family (Kula2024The).
