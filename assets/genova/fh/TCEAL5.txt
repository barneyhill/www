# TCEAL5

## Overview
TCEAL5, or transcription elongation factor A-like 5, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The TCEAL5 protein is categorized as a transcription factor and is implicated in the modulation of gene expression through its interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the NuRD complex. This interaction plays a crucial role in the epigenetic silencing of mesenchymal genes, thereby influencing processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) (Zhou2024TCEAL5). TCEAL5 has been studied for its potential tumor suppressor functions, particularly in glioma, where it may inhibit cell migration and invasion (Zhou2024TCEAL5). Additionally, TCEAL5 is involved in various biological processes and conditions, including lung adenocarcinoma and hypothalamic neuronal development, and is noted for its unique behavior as an escape gene in X-chromosome inactivation (Lv2020Systematical; Ali2024Deletion; Keown2017Allelespecific).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TCEAL5 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), mutations in TCEAL5 have been identified, although their expressional alterations were not statistically significant in terms of prognosis (Lv2020Systematical). The gene's expression changes have been linked to broader patterns of gene expression that could influence cancer development, particularly through mechanisms such as inhibition of cell death and modulation of mRNA processing (Proquin2018Gene).

In the study of hypothalamic neuronal development, TCEAL5 was found to be dysregulated in neurons with RMST lncRNA deletion, which is relevant to Kallmann Syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting neuronal development (Ali2024Deletion). This dysregulation suggests a role for TCEAL5 in the development and function of GnRH neurons, which are crucial for reproductive and olfactory functions.

Additionally, TCEAL5 is noted as an escape gene in the context of X-chromosome inactivation, with unique methylation patterns that may influence its expression and regulatory mechanisms (Keown2017Allelespecific). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of TCEAL5 in various genetic and epigenetic contexts.

## Interactions
TCEAL5 interacts with the NuRD complex, a chromatin remodeling complex, to epigenetically silence mesenchymal genes in glioma. This interaction suggests a role for TCEAL5 in transcriptional repression, particularly in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by decreasing mesenchymal gene expression and promoting a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)-like process (Zhou2024TCEAL5). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that TCEAL5 binds directly to the promoters of mesenchymal genes such as N-cadherin and TWIST1, indicating a direct regulatory mechanism (Zhou2024TCEAL5).

Co-immunoprecipitation assays have shown that TCEAL5 interacts with components of the NuRD complex, suggesting a collaborative role in modulating gene expression (Zhou2024TCEAL5). This interaction highlights TCEAL5's potential function as a tumor suppressor in glioma, where its overexpression inhibits cell migration and invasion (Zhou2024TCEAL5). The study of TCEAL5's interactions provides insight into its role in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.
