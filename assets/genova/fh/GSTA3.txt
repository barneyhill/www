# GSTA3

## Overview
The GSTA3 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase alpha 3 (GST A3-3), a member of the alpha-class glutathione transferases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the isomerization of steroid double bonds, playing a crucial role in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones such as testosterone and progesterone. GST A3-3 is characterized by its dimeric structure, with each subunit containing distinct catalytic sites that facilitate its enzymatic activity. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in steroidogenic tissues, including the gonads, adrenal glands, and placenta, underscoring its importance in hormone production. Additionally, GST A3-3 is involved in detoxification processes, contributing to the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds (Frova2006Glutathione; Mannervik2021Glutathione; Oakley2011Glutathione).

## Structure
The human GSTA3 protein, a member of the alpha-class glutathione transferases, is characterized by its unique ability to catalyze the isomerization of steroid double bonds, specifically converting Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione to Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione (Oakley2011Glutathione). The protein is biologically active as a dimer, a common feature among glutathione transferases, with each subunit having independent catalytic sites (Frova2006Glutathione). The dimeric structure is crucial for its function, as it stabilizes the quaternary structure through hydrophobic interactions (Frova2006Glutathione).

Each subunit of GSTA3 consists of two domains: an N-terminal domain with a thioredoxin-like fold and a C-terminal domain composed of helices. The N-terminal domain is involved in glutathione binding, while the C-terminal domain forms the hydrophobic substrate binding site (Frova2006Glutathione). The active site is formed by the interaction of these two domains, with specific residues such as Tyr7 playing a crucial role in catalytic activity by stabilizing a reactive thiolate anion (Frova2006Glutathione). The protein's activity is significantly influenced by the residues G12 and A208, which are distinct from other alpha-class isozymes (Oakley2011Glutathione).

## Function
The human gene GSTA3 encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase alpha 3 (GST A3-3), which plays a significant role in steroid hormone biosynthesis. GST A3-3 is highly efficient in catalyzing the isomerization of Δ5-3-ketosteroids, such as 5-androsten-3,17-dione and 5-pregnane-3,20-dione, into their Δ4 counterparts, which are precursors to testosterone and progesterone (Board2013Glutathione; Johansson2002Activesite). This enzyme is expressed in steroidogenic tissues, including the gonads, adrenal glands, and placenta, indicating its involvement in steroid hormone production (Mannervik2021Glutathione; Tetlow2004Functional).

GST A3-3 functions as a steroid double-bond isomerase, working in conjunction with 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) to facilitate the conversion of Δ5-precursors to Δ4-products, a critical step in steroidogenesis (Matsumura2013Human; RaffalliMathieu2008Targeting). The enzyme's activity is significantly more efficient than that of endogenous 3β-HSD, highlighting its evolved role in hormone biosynthesis (Tetlow2004Functional). The enzyme's function is crucial for maintaining normal steroidogenic functions, as inhibition of GST A3-3 leads to reduced hormone production (Mannervik2021Glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
The GSTA3 gene, encoding the enzyme glutathione S-transferase alpha 3, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in detoxification and steroid hormone biosynthesis. A specific polymorphism, I71L, in the GSTA3 gene has been identified, particularly in African populations, which results in a leucine-containing isoform with reduced activity in glutathione-conjugating reactions. This reduced activity may contribute to diseases caused by oxidative stress in steroidogenic tissues, potentially affecting testosterone and progesterone synthesis (Tetlow2004Functional).

In the context of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), GSTA3 expression is significantly downregulated in the renal cortex of rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction. This suggests a role in alleviating RIF by downregulating fibronectin expression, with implications for oxidative stress regulation through the PI3K-Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway (Xiao2019GSTA3).

GSTA3 also plays a critical role in detoxifying aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent hepatocarcinogen. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of GSTA3 leads to increased sensitivity to AFB1, resulting in higher levels of DNA adducts and liver damage, indicating its importance in protecting against aflatoxin-induced genotoxicity (Ilic2010GlutathioneStransferase; Kensler2014Genetic).
