# ARMC8

## Overview
ARMC8 (armadillo repeat containing 8) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. The ARMC8 protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate interactions with other proteins. It exists in two isoforms, Armc8α and Armc8β, resulting from alternative splicing, with Armc8α being the longer isoform. The protein is a component of the C-terminal to LisH/CTLH complex, which possesses E3 ligase activity and is involved in regulating key biological pathways such as PI3 kinase, Wnt, TGF-β, and NF-κB. These pathways are crucial for controlling cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration. ARMC8's role in the proteasome-dependent degradation of αE-catenin highlights its significance in cancer biology, as it is implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Gul2019Armc8; Suzuki2008Proteasomedependent).

## Structure
The ARMC8 protein is characterized by armadillo repeats, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. The human ARMC8 gene encodes two isoforms, Armc8α and Armc8β, resulting from alternative splicing. Armc8α is the longer isoform, containing two armadillo domains. The first domain comprises four armadillo repeats, and the second domain comprises five armadillo repeats, connected by a large insert or loop region of about 150 amino acids (Gul2019Armc8). Armc8β lacks the second armadillo domain due to an early stop codon, resulting in a shorter protein of 385 amino acids (Gul2019Armc8).

The armadillo repeats typically consist of three alpha helices, forming a superhelical 3D structure (Gul2019Armc8). These repeats are crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as αE-catenin and plakophilins (Gul2019Armc8). The N-terminal region of both isoforms is important for integration into the LisH/CTLH complex, although ARMC8 does not possess the LisH/CTLH motifs (Gul2019Armc8). The protein is involved in the proteasome-dependent degradation of αE-catenin, which is significant in cancer biology (Suzuki2008Proteasomedependent).

## Function
ARMC8 (armadillo repeat containing 8) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. The ARMC8 protein is a key component of the C-terminal of the lissencephaly type-1-like homology motif (CTLH) complex, which possesses E-3 ligase activity. This complex is involved in regulating fundamental biological pathways, including PI3 kinase, Wnt, TGF-β, and NF-κB pathways, which are crucial for controlling cell proliferation, survival, programmed cell death, cell adhesion, and migration (Huang2021ARMC).

ARMC8 interacts with the N-terminal sequence of α-catenin, promoting its degradation to regulate cell adhesion. This interaction is significant for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis and metastasis (Suzuki2008Proteasomedependent). The protein is also involved in regulating pyrimidine metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, and integrin signaling, which are essential for cellular proliferation and differentiation (Huang2021ARMC).

In healthy cells, ARMC8's role in these pathways helps maintain cellular homeostasis and proper cell cycle progression. Its high conservation across vertebrates underscores its essential role in maintaining basic cellular functions vital for the proper functioning of vertebrate cells (Huang2021ARMC).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARMC8 gene are associated with various cancers, including colon, breast, lung, ovarian, osteosarcoma, and bladder cancers. In colon cancer, ARMC8 is overexpressed and linked to advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, correlating with poor prognosis. It enhances cancer cell invasion and migration by upregulating MMP7 and Snail while downregulating α-catenin and p120ctn (Jiang2015ARMc8). In osteosarcoma, ARMC8 overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its silencing inhibits these processes and reduces tumor growth (Jiang2016Armadillo).

ARMC8 also plays a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. In bladder cancer, silencing ARMC8 inhibits TGF-β1-induced EMT, reducing cell migration and invasion (Liang2017Silencing). In gastric cancer, miR-455-3p targets ARMC8, reducing its expression and inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with cancer progression (Zhan2023MiR4553p). These findings suggest that ARMC8 is a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis.

## Interactions
The ARMC8 protein, specifically its isoforms Armc8α and Armc8β, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cellular functions. Armc8α interacts with αE-catenin through a C-terminal domain, promoting its proteasome-dependent degradation, which is significant for cell adhesion regulation (Gul2019Armc8; Suzuki2008Proteasomedependent). This interaction does not occur with αN-catenin or αT-catenin (Gul2019Armc8). Armc8α also binds to plakophilins (Pkp1 to Pkp3) and p0071, which are associated with desmosomal cadherins, indicating a role in desmosomal cell-cell adhesion complexes (Gul2019Armc8).

ARMC8 interacts with the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) in vivo, with the proline-rich domain of HRS being critical for this interaction. This association suggests a role in endosomal processes and membrane trafficking (Tomaru2010Armadillo). ARMC8 is also a component of the CTLH complex, which has E3 ligase activity and is involved in regulating pathways such as PI3 kinase, Wnt, TGF-β, and NF-κB, essential for cell proliferation and migration (Huang2021ARMC). These interactions highlight ARMC8's involvement in cell adhesion, signaling, and protein degradation pathways.
