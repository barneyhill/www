# LOXL2

## Overview
The LOXL2 gene encodes the lysyl oxidase-like 2 protein, a member of the lysyl oxidase family, which is characterized as a copper-dependent amine oxidase. This protein is integral to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, primarily through its role in the crosslinking of collagen and elastin, which is essential for maintaining the tensile strength and stability of connective tissues (Kasashima2014Lysyl). Beyond its structural functions, lysyl oxidase-like 2 is involved in various cellular processes, including tissue remodeling, wound healing, and oncogenic signaling pathways, particularly those associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Moon2013MCF-7). The protein's interactions with transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins underscore its multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression (Iturbide2014A; Eraso2023New). Due to its involvement in cancer metastasis and poor prognosis in several cancers, LOXL2 is considered a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Moreno‐Bueno2011Lysyl; Wen2020LOXL2).

## Structure
The LOXL2 protein is part of the lysyl oxidase family and features a conserved C-terminal amine oxidase catalytic domain, which includes a copper-binding site and lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor residues (Ferreira2021LOXL2; Okada2018Extracellular). The protein also contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Ferreira2021LOXL2). The SRCR domains are highly conserved, with sequence and structure alignments showing their evolutionary relationships (Lin2021Redox).

The molecular structure of LOXL2 includes a hydrophobic patch in the active site, which stabilizes a short β-sheet in an unproductive conformation, preventing LTQ cofactor formation (Meier2022A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation at Asn-455 and Asn-644, which are essential for proper folding, stability, and secretion (Ferreira2021LOXL2; Okada2018Extracellular).

LOXL2 is known to have several isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and localization (Ferreira2021LOXL2). The protein's structure is further characterized by a square pyramidal Cu2+ coordination geometry involving specific histidine residues and water molecules (Meier2022A).

## Function
Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix by catalyzing the crosslinking of collagen and elastin. This activity is crucial for maintaining the tensile strength and stability of connective tissues (Kasashima2014Lysyl). LOXL2 is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that functions both extracellularly and intracellularly, influencing various cellular processes. In the extracellular space, LOXL2 contributes to tissue remodeling and wound healing by modifying the extracellular matrix (Kasashima2014Lysyl).

Intracellularly, LOXL2 is involved in oncogenic signaling pathways, particularly those leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process where epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics, enhancing their migratory and invasive capabilities (Moon2013MCF-7). LOXL2 stabilizes the Snail1 transcription factor, which represses epithelial markers like E-cadherin and upregulates mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin, promoting cell invasion (Moon2013MCF-7). This stabilization occurs through post-translational modifications, preventing Snail1's phosphorylation and degradation (Moon2013MCF-7).

LOXL2's activity is regulated by glycosylation, which is essential for its secretion and function in breast cancer cells (Moon2013MCF-7). The enzyme's role in cell biology extends to influencing cell polarity and differentiation, contributing to its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis (Moreno‐Bueno2011Lysyl).

## Clinical Significance
The LOXL2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers. Overexpression of LOXL2 is linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in cancers such as breast, lung, colon, gastric, cervical, liver, and esophageal cancers. High LOXL2 levels are associated with reduced survival time and poor prognosis, as it promotes tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis (Cano2023LOXL2; Wen2020LOXL2). In gastric cancer, LOXL2 overexpression is associated with tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and poorer overall survival, promoting metastasis via the Src/FAK pathway (Wang2022Systematic).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, LOXL2 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor disease-specific survival and progression-free survival. This overexpression is linked to higher tumor grade and advanced cancer stages (Lin2020Comprehensive). In cervical carcinoma, high LOXL2 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, contributing to cancer progression through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Cao2020LOXL2).

LOXL2 also plays a role in basal-like breast carcinomas, where it is associated with enhanced invasiveness and metastatic dissemination. Silencing LOXL2 in these cancer cells results in decreased metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Moreno‐Bueno2011Lysyl).

## Interactions
LOXL2 interacts with a variety of proteins and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression. It is known to interact with the transcription factor SNAIL1, enhancing SNAIL1's ability to repress the CDH1 promoter, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Iturbide2014A). LOXL2 also interacts with E47, another transcription factor, to repress E-cadherin, a key event in EMT that facilitates tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Canesin2014Lysyl).

LOXL2 is involved in the modulation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), interacting with several RBPs such as ELAVL1, IGF2BP1, FMR1, TAF15, SRSF1, and U2AF2. These interactions are mediated by the SRCR-1 domain of LOXL2 and are significant in the context of EMT and cancer traits like proliferation and invasion (Eraso2023New).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, LOXL2 interacts with components of repressive complexes, including members of the polycomb group of proteins (PRC2), CAF-1, and HDACs, suggesting its involvement in epigenetic modifications (Herranz2016Lysyl; Iturbide2014A). These interactions highlight LOXL2's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.
