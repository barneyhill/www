# UTS2

## Overview
Urotensin 2 (UTS2) is a gene that encodes the peptide hormone urotensin II, which is recognized for its potent vasoactive properties. Urotensin II is a cyclic peptide that functions primarily as a vasoconstrictor, exerting significant influence on cardiovascular physiology by modulating blood pressure and vascular tone. The peptide achieves its effects through binding to the urotensin II receptor (UTS2R), a G protein-coupled receptor, which activates various intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways are involved in calcium mobilization and phospholipase C activation, contributing to vascular smooth muscle contraction and other physiological processes (Proulx2008Biological; Ross2010Role). Urotensin II is also implicated in vasodilation, mediated by endothelial factors such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, and is active in multiple tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. The diverse roles of urotensin II in cell biology and organismal physiology underscore its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, making the UTS2 gene a subject of interest in cardiovascular and metabolic research (Sun2019Urotensin; Ross2010Role).

## Structure
Urotensin 2 (UTS2) is a peptide encoded by the UTS2 gene, known for its potent vasoconstrictor properties. The primary structure of UTS2 in humans consists of an 11-amino acid peptide with a cyclic hexapeptide motif, specifically c[Cys-Phe-Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys], which is conserved across species (Guerrini2004Structure–activity; Vaudry2014International). This cyclic region is crucial for the peptide's biological activity and is stabilized by a disulfide bond between the cysteine residues, contributing to its tertiary structure (Guerrini2004Structure–activity).

The secondary structure of UTS2 includes a type II' β-turn, which is unusual for L-amino acid peptides, and is essential for its interaction with the UT receptor (Carotenuto2004Unraveling). This β-turn structure facilitates close contact among the side chains of key residues, such as Trp 7, Lys 8, and Tyr 9, which are important for receptor activation (Carotenuto2004Unraveling).

UTS2 does not typically form quaternary structures. The gene encoding UTS2, known as uts2, can produce different isoforms through alternative initiation, although these isoforms lead to the same mature peptide (Vaudry2014International).

## Function
Urotensin 2 (UTS2) is a peptide encoded by the UTS2 gene, known for its potent vasoactive properties. It functions primarily by binding to the urotensin II receptor (UT), a G protein-coupled receptor, which is involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, UTS2 plays a significant role in cardiovascular function by regulating blood pressure and vascular tone. It acts as a vasoconstrictor, influencing vascular smooth muscle contraction through pathways involving calcium mobilization and phospholipase C activation (Proulx2008Biological; Ross2010Role).

UTS2 is also involved in vasodilation, mediated by the endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, which are crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis (Proulx2008Biological; Ross2010Role). The peptide is active in various tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and nervous system, where it influences cell proliferation, insulin resistance, and neuroendocrine activity (Sun2019Urotensin; Ross2010Role).

In the renal system, UTS2 contributes to maintaining vascular tone and tubular function, primarily through NO-mediated vasodilation (Ross2010Role). Its expression in the nervous system affects mood, sleep, and digestive behavior, highlighting its diverse roles in cell biology and organismal physiology (Ross2010Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the UTS2 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly those related to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The S89N polymorphism in the UTS2 gene is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, as it is associated with higher plasma insulin levels and insulin resistance (Suzuki2004Genetic; Wenyi2003Role). This polymorphism has also been implicated in diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes, where it may contribute to disease progression through mechanisms involving vascular endothelial growth factor and oxidative stress (Okumus2012Association).

In cardiovascular diseases, UTS2 gene polymorphisms, such as Ser89Asn and Thr21Met, have been associated with atrial fibrillation and cardiac fibrosis, potentially influencing susceptibility to these conditions through increased collagen synthesis mediated by transforming growth factor-β1 (Zhao2016Role). The UTS2 gene is also linked to systemic arterial hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, particularly in specific populations, such as Chinese females (PereiraCastro2019Novel).

Alterations in UTS2 expression levels are associated with various conditions, including heart failure and systemic sclerosis, where elevated UTS2 levels may exacerbate disease symptoms through its vasoconstrictor and profibrotic activities (Kamal2017Study). These findings suggest that UTS2 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Urotensin 2 (UTS2) is known for its interactions with the urotensin II receptor (UTS2R), a G-protein-coupled receptor. This interaction is crucial for its role as a potent vasoconstrictor, influencing cardiovascular functions. UTS2 binds with high affinity to UTS2R, leading to the activation of various intracellular signaling pathways, including those involving phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and Rho-kinase (Rossowski2002Human; Sauzeau2001Human). 

The binding of UTS2 to UTS2R triggers calcium mobilization, which is essential for the contractile response in vascular smooth muscle cells. This process involves the activation of phospholipase C, resulting in the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and subsequent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (DomínguezRodríguez2012UrotensinII). 

UTS2 also interacts with the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-kinase, mediating arterial smooth muscle contraction and proliferation (Sauzeau2001Human). These interactions highlight the role of UTS2 in modulating vascular tone and smooth muscle cell growth, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular diseases.
