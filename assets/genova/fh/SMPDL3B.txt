# SMPDL3B

## Overview
SMPDL3B is a gene that encodes the protein sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein involved in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, particularly in maintaining ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) levels, which are vital for cell growth, survival, and inflammation (Mallela2019Regulation). SMPDL3B is active in the lipid rafts of cell membranes, where it modulates insulin receptor signaling, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis (Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as ceramide kinase and caveolin-1, underscore its importance in various physiological processes, including oxidative stress modulation and membrane fluidity maintenance (Azzam2021Crosstalk; Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b). Alterations in SMPDL3B expression have been linked to several diseases, including diabetic kidney disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2020Human; Qu2021SMPDL3B; Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b).

## Function
The SMPDL3B gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, SMPDL3B is involved in the regulation of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) levels, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and inflammation. SMPDL3B interacts with ceramide kinase (CERK) and can bind to C1P, influencing its availability by interfering with CERK function (Mallela2019Regulation). This regulation is essential for maintaining sphingolipid metabolism in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney filtration barrier (Mallela2019Regulation).

SMPDL3B also plays a role in maintaining membrane fluidity and lipid composition, which are vital for cell survival and signaling. It is part of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, affecting the production of bioactive sphingolipids like ceramide-1-phosphate and sphingosine 1-phosphate (Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b). The protein is active in lipid rafts of cell membranes, where it modulates insulin receptor signaling by affecting the binding of insulin receptor isoforms to caveolin-1, a process crucial for podocyte function (Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b). SMPDL3B's role in these molecular processes highlights its importance in cellular signaling and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMPDL3B gene have been implicated in various diseases. In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), increased SMPDL3B expression in podocytes is associated with impaired insulin receptor signaling, contributing to disease progression. Podocyte-specific deletion of SMPDL3B in diabetic mice has shown protective effects against DKD, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b).

In cancer, SMPDL3B acts as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its upregulation promotes cancer cell survival and migration. The gene's expression is positively regulated by ACER2, and its knockdown results in reduced tumor growth (Liu2020Human). Similarly, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high SMPDL3B expression correlates with poor prognosis and contributes to leukemia stem cell self-renewal. Blocking its expression inhibits AML cell growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Qu2021SMPDL3B).

In gastric adenocarcinoma, SMPDL3B is significantly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression levels are higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Su2023SMPDL3B). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SMPDL3B in various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SMPDL3B interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It competes with insulin receptor isoforms IRA and IRB for binding to caveolin-1, a protein involved in insulin signaling. This interaction affects the formation of IRA/caveolin-1 and IRB/caveolin-1 complexes, altering insulin signaling pathways by impairing AKT phosphorylation and increasing p70S6K phosphorylation (Mitrofanova2019SMPDL3b). SMPDL3B also interacts with ceramide kinase (CERK), which is crucial for ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) synthesis. SMPDL3B can interfere with CERK's function by blocking its access to ceramide, thereby reducing C1P levels (Mallela2019Regulation). This interaction is confirmed through experiments using HEK293 cells and isolated glomeruli from mice (Mallela2019Regulation).

In the context of radiation-induced damage, SMPDL3B interacts with NADPH oxidases (NOX1 and NOX4), modulating oxidative stress and cellular damage. Overexpression of SMPDL3B reduces NOX activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, suggesting a protective mechanism against radiation damage (Azzam2021Crosstalk). These interactions highlight SMPDL3B's role in modulating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism, impacting cellular signaling and survival.
