# AMMECR1L

## Overview
The AMMECR1L gene encodes the AMMECR1-like protein, which is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the cell cycle. As a paralog of the AMMECR1 gene, AMMECR1L shares a high degree of similarity and is conserved across tetrapods, indicating its evolutionary importance (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). The protein is characterized by its intolerance to loss-of-function mutations, underscoring its critical role in maintaining cellular integrity (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). AMMECR1L is involved in transcriptional regulation during the G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle and may interact with AMMECR1, suggesting a collaborative function in nuclear processes (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). Its expression patterns and potential compensatory role in the absence of AMMECR1 highlight its significance in both normal physiology and disease contexts.

## Structure


## Function
The AMMECR1L gene encodes a protein that is involved in several cellular processes, primarily within the nucleus of the cell. It is a paralog of the AMMECR1 gene, sharing 68% similarity, and is present in tetrapods (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). AMMECR1L is described as "extremely intolerant" to loss-of-function variation, with a pLI score of 1.0, indicating its critical role in cellular function (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

In healthy human cells, AMMECR1L is thought to play a role in the regulation of transcription involved in the G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). The protein is localized in the nuclear fraction of cells, where it may form dimers with AMMECR1, indicating a potential interaction between these two proteins in nuclear processes (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

The elevated expression of AMMECR1L in certain tissues, compared to AMMECR1, suggests it might partially compensate for the loss of AMMECR1, especially in the context of genetic variations affecting AMMECR1 (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). This compensatory role highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
AMMECR1L has been implicated in various clinical conditions, although its precise role in disease mechanisms is still under investigation. Alterations in the expression of AMMECR1L have been associated with breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The gene is regulated by microRNAs such as miR-21 and miR-214, which are known to influence cancer prognosis. High expression of miR-214, which regulates AMMECR1L, is linked to worse overall survival in TNBC patients, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Dagnija2024MicroRNA; Thompson2017Meeting).

In the context of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), AMMECR1L has been identified as a downregulated gene during disease progression. This downregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of ALD, although the specific mechanisms remain to be elucidated (Sun2024Identifying).

Additionally, AMMECR1L is involved in allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) processes, which are significant in cancer and other diseases. Alterations in ASM, potentially involving AMMECR1L, can affect transcription factor binding and gene regulation, contributing to disease states (Do2020Allele-specific). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of AMMECR1L mutations and expression changes.
