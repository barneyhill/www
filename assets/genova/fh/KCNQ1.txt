# KCNQ1

## Overview
The KCNQ1 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1, a crucial transmembrane protein involved in various physiological processes, particularly in cardiac and epithelial tissues. This protein forms a part of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex, which is essential for maintaining the cardiac action potential and normal heart rhythm by facilitating the repolarization phase. In the heart, KCNQ1 interacts with KCNE1 to produce the I_Ks current, a key component in cardiac electrophysiology (Abbott2014Biology). Beyond cardiac function, KCNQ1 is also significant in epithelial ion transport, insulin secretion, and fluid balance regulation in various tissues, including the inner ear and pancreas (Abbott2014Biology). Mutations in KCNQ1 are linked to several clinical conditions, such as Long QT Syndrome and Short QT Syndrome, highlighting its critical role in human health (Hedley2009The; Moss2007Clinical).

## Structure
The KCNQ1 protein is a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a crucial role in cardiac function. It is composed of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and forms a tetrameric structure in its functional state (Jalily2017A). The primary structure includes a unique nine-amino-acid insertion in the S2-S3 'foot', which is specific to KCNQ1 and interacts with calmodulin (CaM) (Sun2017CryoEM). The secondary structure features several helices, including a straight S3 helix and an S4 helix containing basic amino acids that sense membrane depolarization (Sun2017CryoEM; Dixit2020The).

The tertiary structure of KCNQ1 involves a domain-swapped topology, with the S4-S5 linker partly forming an extended chain rather than a helix, which is significant for its function (Sun2017CryoEM). The quaternary structure is a domain-swapped homo-tetramer, with each protomer containing one KCNQ1 subunit and one CaM (Sun2017CryoEM).

KCNQ1 contains specific domains such as the voltage sensor domain and the pore domain, which includes the signature GYGD sequence crucial for potassium conductance (Dixit2020The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including interactions with PIP2, which are essential for channel activity (Sun2017CryoEM). Splice variants of KCNQ1 can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Jalily2017A).

## Function
The KCNQ1 gene encodes a potassium channel that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. In cardiac cells, KCNQ1 forms a channel complex with KCNE1, generating the slowly activating potassium current known as I_Ks, which is essential for the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. This process is vital for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and preventing arrhythmias, particularly during conditions of increased heart rate or sympathetic tone (Abbott2014Biology). 

In epithelial tissues, KCNQ1 is involved in ion transport and fluid secretion. In the inner ear, the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex facilitates potassium recycling in the endolymph, and mutations in KCNQ1 can lead to deafness due to impaired function (Abbott2014Biology). In the pancreas, KCNQ1 regulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells, influencing glucose metabolism and being linked to conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus (Abbott2014Biology). 

KCNQ1 is also expressed in the intestine, where it forms a complex with KCNE3, essential for cAMP-stimulated chloride secretion, contributing to the regulation of fluid balance and electrolyte homeostasis (Abbott2014Biology). In the mammary epithelium, KCNQ1 is implicated in cell volume regulation, likely through potassium secretion (Abbott2014Biology).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNQ1 gene are associated with several cardiac conditions, most notably Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Short QT Syndrome (SQT). LQTS, particularly type 1 (LQT1), is the most common form and is characterized by a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Over 250 mutations in KCNQ1 have been linked to LQT1, with various mutations causing defective trafficking and dominant-negative effects that impair the channel's function (Hedley2009The; Moss2007Clinical). Specific mutations, such as those in the cytoplasmic loops, are associated with a higher risk of cardiac events and may influence the effectiveness of β-blocker therapy (Barsheshet2012Mutations).

In contrast, Short QT Syndrome type 2 (SQT2) is associated with gain-of-function mutations in KCNQ1, leading to accelerated activation kinetics and enhanced repolarization, resulting in a shortened QT interval (Hedley2009The). Additionally, KCNQ1 mutations are implicated in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, which includes congenital deafness and cardiac arrhythmias (chen2003kcnq1). The gene's altered expression or interactions can also impact insulin secretion, contributing to diabetes.

## Interactions
KCNQ1 interacts with various proteins, most notably the KCNE family of subunits, which modulate its function in cardiac cells. The interaction between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 forms a channel complex responsible for the cardiac potassium I_Ks current, crucial for cardiac repolarization. This complex exhibits slow activation kinetics and high current density, essential for maintaining normal heart rhythm (BENDAHHOU2005In; Chen2020Physical). The C-terminal regions of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 are particularly important for these interactions, with specific residues such as KCNQ1-I368 and KCNE1-D76 showing energetic coupling during channel activation (Chen2020Physical).

KCNQ1 also interacts with other KCNE subunits, such as KCNE2 and KCNE3, which produce instantaneous voltage-independent currents when co-expressed with KCNQ1. KCNE4 and KCNE5, however, have inhibitory effects, producing small currents similar to the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex (BENDAHHOU2005In). The interactions with KCNE subunits are complex and can vary significantly depending on specific mutations and subunit combinations, affecting the channel's voltage gating properties and its role in cardiac physiology (Lvov2010Identification; Zheng2010Analysis). These interactions are critical for understanding the physiological relevance of KCNQ1 in the heart.
