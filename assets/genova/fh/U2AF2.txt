# U2AF2

## Overview
U2AF2 is a gene that encodes the U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF65), a critical protein involved in the pre-mRNA splicing process. U2AF65 is categorized as a splicing factor and plays a pivotal role in recognizing the polypyrimidine (Py) tract at the 3' splice site of pre-mRNA, which is essential for the accurate assembly of the spliceosome and subsequent splicing of pre-mRNA. The protein contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) that facilitate its binding to uridine-rich sequences, enabling the precise removal of introns and joining of exons. U2AF65 functions as part of a heterodimer with U2AF1, ensuring the fidelity of splice site selection. Mutations in the U2AF2 gene can disrupt RNA binding and splicing efficiency, linking it to various human diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders (Shao2014Mechanisms; Glasser2022PremRNA; Agrawal2016An).

## Structure
The U2AF2 protein is a critical component in pre-mRNA splicing, primarily recognizing polypyrimidine (Py) tract signals preceding 3' splice sites. It contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) that are essential for its function. These RRMs are responsible for binding to uridine-rich RNAs, with the protein adopting an open conformation when bound to RNA (Glasser2017CancerAssociated; Glasser2022PremRNA). The structure of U2AF2 has been elucidated using techniques such as NMR and X-ray crystallography, revealing that the RRMs recognize a continuous nine-uridine Py tract in a side-by-side configuration (Maji2020Representative).

In its quaternary structure, U2AF2 functions as a heterodimer with U2AF1, which stabilizes a closed conformation where the RNA binding surface of RRM1 is masked by RRM2 (Maji2020Representative). The protein undergoes conformational changes between closed and open states, influenced by RNA binding, which alters side chain conformers and displaces water molecules from the RRM surfaces (Glasser2017CancerAssociated).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate U2AF2's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The adaptability of U2AF2 to different nucleotide variants at the splice site is crucial for its role in spliceosome assembly and function (Glasser2022PremRNA).

## Function
The U2AF2 gene encodes the U2AF65 protein, a crucial pre-mRNA splicing factor in human cells. U2AF65 is essential for recognizing the polypyrimidine (Py) tract at the 3' splice site of pre-mRNA, a critical step in the splicing process. This protein contains tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) that bind to the Py tract, facilitating the assembly of the spliceosome, which is necessary for the accurate removal of introns and the joining of exons in pre-mRNA (Glasser2022PremRNA; Agrawal2016An).

U2AF65 forms a heterodimer with U2AF35, and together they define functional 3' splice sites. U2AF65 binds to the Py tract, while U2AF35 contacts the AG dinucleotide, ensuring the fidelity of splice site selection (Shao2014Mechanisms). The flexibility of RNA allows U2AF65 to accommodate different nucleotides at the central position of the Py tract, which is crucial for its function in recognizing splice site motifs and promoting splicing efficiency (Glasser2022PremRNA).

Mutations in U2AF2 can affect RNA binding affinity and splicing efficiency, linking defects in this gene to various human diseases, including certain cancers and developmental disorders (Glasser2022PremRNA; Agrawal2016An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the U2AF2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders. In cancer, specific mutations such as N196K and G301D have been associated with leukemia and solid tumors, respectively. The N196K mutation increases RNA binding affinity by stabilizing the open conformation of U2AF2, while the G301D mutation decreases RNA binding affinity due to unfavorable interactions with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. These alterations in RNA interactions and splicing can dysregulate gene expression, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Maji2020Representative).

U2AF2 mutations are also found in hematologic malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as in lung adenocarcinoma, liver, breast, and colon cancers. These mutations often occur in the RNA recognition motifs and the U2AF homology motif, affecting the protein's ability to recognize splice site signals (Glasser2017CancerAssociated).

In addition to cancer, U2AF2 mutations have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. A de novo variant in U2AF2 was identified in a patient with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, suggesting that U2AF2-related disorders may include systemic dysmorphisms and brain malformations (Hiraide2021Global).

## Interactions
U2AF2, also known as U2AF65, is a critical component of the splicing machinery, engaging in numerous interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterodimer with U2AF1, which is essential for recognizing the 3' splice site of pre-mRNA introns (Prigge2009Interactome). U2AF2 interacts with several splicing-related proteins, including SF1, SF3B1, and BAT1A, facilitating spliceosome assembly and function (Prigge2009Interactome). It also binds to RNA, specifically recognizing the polypyrimidine (Py) tract upstream of exons, which is crucial for spliceosome assembly (Kang2020An).

The protein contains RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a U2AF homology motif (UHM), which are involved in these interactions. The UHM binds to UHM ligand motifs (ULM) in other proteins, including its partner U2AF1 (Prigge2009Interactome). U2AF2's interactions extend beyond splicing, involving proteins like DDX39 and RBM39, suggesting roles in transcriptional regulation and mRNA transport (Prigge2009Interactome). Additionally, U2AF2's interaction with RNA is influenced by the flexibility of the RNA itself, allowing it to accommodate different nucleotide variants at the center of the Py tract (Glasser2022PremRNA). These interactions highlight U2AF2's adaptability and its critical role in ensuring splicing fidelity.
