# FOXA3

## Overview
FOXA3 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box A3 protein, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. FOXA3 is involved in various biological processes, particularly those related to metabolism and cellular differentiation. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the liver, pancreas, and intestine, where it influences metabolic pathways and glucose homeostasis. The protein's ability to interact with other transcription factors and its involvement in chromatin remodeling underscore its significance in gene regulation. Clinically, FOXA3 has been associated with metabolic disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (AdlerWailes2015Analysis; Thanan2020Opposing; Yu2023The).

## Structure
The FOXA3 protein is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, characterized by a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that adopts a winged-helix fold. This fold consists of three α-helices (H1, H2, and H3) forming a core structure packed against an antiparallel three-stranded β-sheet (S1, S2, and S3), with two flanking wing-like loops (wing 1 and wing 2) (Dai2021Toward). The FOX-DBD is approximately 100 amino acids in length, with highly conserved residues in the N-terminal portion. The wing2 region is particularly variable and can adopt different conformations, such as loops or α-helices, which may contribute to DNA binding specificity and functional diversity (Dai2021Toward).

FOXA3 shares structural similarities with the globular domain of histone H1, suggesting a potential mechanism for its role in chromatin opening by displacing histone H1 (Dai2021Toward). The protein forms a monomer with the DNA core motif TAAGTCA, as characterized by an X-ray structure with a resolution of 2.50 Å (Dai2021Toward). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence FOXA3's DNA-binding potential by blocking DNA binding or affecting subcellular localization (Dai2021Toward).

## Function
FOXA3, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors, plays a significant role in various molecular processes related to metabolism and cellular differentiation. It is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and fat tissue expansion, particularly in response to high-fat diets and during aging. FOXA3 functions through its DNA-binding motif, which allows it to bind to upstream regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes, thereby influencing gene expression (AdlerWailes2015Analysis).

In the context of lipid metabolism, FOXA3 is induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and is transcriptionally activated by XBP1 in the unfolded protein response pathway. This activation leads to the upregulation of lipid synthesis gene programs, contributing to hepatic steatosis (Yu2023The). FOXA3 also acts as a positive regulator of plasma ApoA-I and HDL-C levels, influencing cholesterol transport (Yu2023The).

FOXA3 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, pancreatic islets, and intestine, where it is involved in metabolic regulation. It has been shown to bind to the proglucagon gene promoter, although it is not essential for proglucagon gene expression in islet or intestinal cells (LIU2002Foxa3). The protein's activity in these tissues suggests its involvement in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
FOXA3 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in gene regulation related to metabolism and cancer progression. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), FOXA3 is highly expressed and associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting an oncogenic role. High FOXA3 expression correlates with positive metastasis status and age in CCA patients, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Thanan2020Opposing). In contrast, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FOXA3, when transfected with HNF4A and HNF1A, appears to suppress cell proliferation, suggesting a potential tumor suppressive role in this context (Thanan2020Opposing).

FOXA3 is also involved in metabolic disorders. It plays a role in adipocyte differentiation and is linked to increased adipogenic capacity, which may contribute to obesity and related metabolic conditions (AdlerWailes2015Analysis; Yu2023The). FOXA3 expression is elevated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is associated with hepatic steatosis through its regulation of lipid synthesis genes (Yu2023The). Additionally, FOXA3 polymorphisms have been associated with metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and cholesterol levels, although no direct link to subclinical atherosclerosis was found (VargasAlarcón2022FOXA3).

## Interactions
FOXA3, a member of the forkhead box family of transcription factors, is known to interact with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. FOXA3 can bind to DNA, specifically recognizing the CAATT motif, and forms a complex with DNA using its W1 and W2 loops to interact with the minor groove (Gao2020Functionally). In the context of the rat proglucagon gene promoter, FOXA3 binds to the G2 element, forming a DNA-protein complex that enhances promoter activity, although it is not essential for proglucagon gene expression (LIU2002Foxa3).

FOXA3 also interacts with other FOXA proteins. It can form hetero-polymers with FOXA2, although no direct interaction between FOXA1 and FOXA3 has been observed. This lack of direct interaction might be due to technical limitations, as FOXA1 and FOXA3 can still co-bind to DNA in close proximity, as shown by ChIP-reChIP experiments (Gao2020Functionally; Motallebipour2009Differential). These interactions suggest that FOXA3, along with other FOXA proteins, plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, influencing various physiological and pathological processes (Gao2020Functionally).
