# TRMT10B

## Overview
TRMT10B is a gene that encodes the protein tRNA methyltransferase 10B, a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This enzyme is specifically involved in the methylation of tRNA molecules, playing a crucial role in the N1-methylation of adenosine at position 9 (m1A9) of tRNA Asp-GTC. This modification is essential for the stability and proper functioning of tRNA, which is vital for accurate protein synthesis (Howell2019Distinct; Vilardo2020Functional). Unlike its paralog TRMT10A, TRMT10B exhibits strict substrate specificity, targeting only tRNA Asp-GTC, and does not compensate for TRMT10A's functions (Howell2019Distinct). The enzyme operates independently without requiring additional partner proteins, highlighting its unique role in tRNA modification (Vilardo2020Functional). TRMT10B's activity has been linked to potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker by influencing the tumor immune microenvironment (Li2022M1A).

## Function
TRMT10B is a human tRNA methyltransferase that plays a specific role in the methylation of tRNA molecules, particularly in the cytoplasm. It is responsible for the N1-methylation of adenosine at position 9 (m1A9) of tRNA Asp-GTC, making it the first adenosine-specific member of the TRM10 family in eukaryotes (Howell2019Distinct; Vilardo2020Functional). This modification is crucial for the proper function and stability of tRNA, which in turn affects protein synthesis. Unlike TRMT10A, which has broader substrate specificity, TRMT10B exhibits strict selectivity, only modifying tRNA Asp-GTC and not other tRNAs with adenosine at position 9 (Howell2019Distinct; Vilardo2020Functional).

The enzyme's activity is not redundant with TRMT10A, as TRMT10B does not compensate for the loss of TRMT10A function, which is linked to neurological and metabolic defects (Howell2019Distinct). Despite its lower catalytic efficiency compared to TRMT10A, TRMT10B's unique role in modifying tRNA Asp suggests a specific biological function in humans, potentially providing an evolutionary advantage by preventing deleterious modifications on other tRNAs (Howell2019Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
The TRMT10B gene has been implicated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), where it serves as a potential prognostic biomarker. Its expression is associated with a better prognosis in PAAD patients. TRMT10B influences the tumor microenvironment by modulating immune responses, including the down-regulation of immunostimulators and MHC molecules, and the up-regulation of immunoinhibitors. This modulation may enhance the infiltration of tumor-associated immune cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, potentially improving patient outcomes (Li2022M1A).

Despite its role in PAAD, there is limited information on the relationship between TRMT10B and other tumors, indicating a novel area for further research (Li2022M1A). Current studies have not directly linked TRMT10B mutations or expression alterations to specific diseases outside of cancer. However, its role in RNA methylation suggests that aberrations could potentially impact cellular processes and contribute to disease pathogenesis. The specificity of TRMT10B for tRNA Asp and its distinct substrate selectivity underscore its unique biological role, which may have implications for understanding diseases related to tRNA modification (Howell2019Distinct). Further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical significance of TRMT10B.

## Interactions
TRMT10B is a human tRNA methyltransferase that exhibits specific interactions with tRNA molecules, particularly in the methylation of adenosine at position 9 in tRNA Asp-GTC. This specificity distinguishes it from other members of the TRM10 family, which typically target guanosine (Howell2019Distinct; Vilardo2020Functional). Unlike some other methyltransferases, TRMT10B does not require additional partner proteins for its enzymatic activity, indicating that it functions independently in its role of tRNA modification (Vilardo2020Functional).

The interaction of TRMT10B with tRNA is characterized by its extreme substrate selectivity, as it is responsible for the m1A9 modification in tRNA Asp-GTC, a function not shared by its paralog TRMT10A or the yeast orthologue ScTrm10 (Howell2019Distinct). Despite its specific activity, the potential for TRMT10B to interact with other proteins or nucleic acids in a regulatory capacity has not been fully explored, and further research is needed to elucidate any additional interactions that may influence its function (Howell2019Distinct; Vilardo2020Functional). The role of TRMT10B in the broader context of RNA stability and processing, particularly in the tumor immune microenvironment, suggests that it may have additional, yet unidentified, interactions in cellular processes (Li2022M1A).
