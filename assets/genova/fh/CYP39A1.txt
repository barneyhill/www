# CYP39A1

## Overview
CYP39A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 39 subfamily A member 1, also known as oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. This enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates, including drugs and cholesterol derivatives. Specifically, CYP39A1 plays a critical role in the metabolism of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC), a cholesterol metabolite predominantly found in the brain, by catalyzing its conversion into a 7α-hydroxylated product. This process is essential for the excretion of cholesterol from the brain and contributes to overall cholesterol homeostasis. The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the bile acid synthesis pathway. Unlike other enzymes in its family, CYP39A1 is not regulated by dietary cholesterol or bile acids, and its expression exhibits sexual dimorphism, with higher levels in females (Grabovec2019Ligandbinding; LiHawkins2000Expression).

## Function
The human gene CYP39A1 encodes an enzyme known as oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is primarily involved in the metabolism of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC), a major cholesterol metabolite in the brain. This enzyme is part of the cytochrome P450 family and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells, where it plays a crucial role in the bile acid synthesis pathway, contributing to cholesterol homeostasis (Grabovec2019Ligandbinding; LiHawkins2000Expression). CYP39A1 specifically catalyzes the conversion of 24OHC into a 7α-hydroxylated product, which is an important step in the excretion of cholesterol derived from the brain (LiHawkins2000Expression).

The enzyme's activity is selective for 24OHC, distinguishing it from other 7α-hydroxylases like CYP7B1, which have broader substrate ranges (LiHawkins2000Expression). CYP39A1 is not regulated by dietary cholesterol or bile acids, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism (Grabovec2019Ligandbinding). Its expression is sexually dimorphic, with higher levels observed in female livers compared to males (LiHawkins2000Expression). This enzyme is also involved in maintaining cholesterol balance in the body and has been associated with neurological conditions due to its role in cholesterol metabolism (Grabovec2019Ligandbinding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CYP39A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), CYP39A1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism, and its expression is linked to the regulation of taurine, a compound with neuroprotective properties. The gene's expression may influence the accumulation of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which is associated with amyloid-β peptide buildup, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Increasing CYP39A1 expression could potentially suppress this aggregation, suggesting its role as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative conditions (PetkovaKirova2023SNPs; Vishweswaraiah2022Methylated).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP39A1 have been associated with a higher risk of PD, particularly in individuals with a genetic predisposition. These SNPs are linked to levodopa-induced dyskinesia, a common side effect in PD treatment, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in managing PD symptoms (PetkovaKirova2023SNPs; Hartz2023A).

In cancer, CYP39A1 expression levels have been associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma and may be a susceptibility gene in cervical cancer. Certain polymorphisms in CYP39A1 are linked to increased levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol and reduced enzyme activity, which may influence chemotherapy outcomes (Grabovec2019Ligandbinding).
