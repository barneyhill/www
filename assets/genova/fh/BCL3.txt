# BCL3

## Overview
BCL3 is a gene that encodes the BCL3 transcription coactivator, a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of NF-κB-mediated gene transcription. Unlike other IκB proteins, BCL3 does not sequester NF-κB complexes in the cytoplasm but modulates their activity within the nucleus. The BCL3 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate interactions with NF-κB subunits, particularly p50 and p52 homodimers, allowing it to function as both a transcriptional coactivator and repressor. This dual functionality enables BCL3 to play a significant role in various cellular processes, including immune function, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Clinically, BCL3 is implicated as an oncogene in several cancers, including hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, where it influences tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance (Wu2018BCL3; Palmer2008Bcl3; Seaton2024Multifaceted).

## Structure
The BCL3 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It consists of 446 amino acid residues and features a proline-rich N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain enriched with proline and serine residues (Ohno2005Reappraisal; Zhang1994BCL3). The central portion of BCL3 contains seven ankyrin repeat elements, each comprising 33 to 37 amino acids, which are common motifs for protein-protein interactions (Palmer2008Bcl3; Ohno2005Reappraisal). These ankyrin repeats form a uniform backbone conformation, as confirmed by crystal structure analysis (Ohno2005Reappraisal).

The protein also includes two clusters of basic amino acids near the N-terminus, which resemble nuclear localization signals and are crucial for its nuclear localization (Zhang1994BCL3). BCL3's structure allows it to interact with NF-κB subunits, particularly p50 and p52 homodimers, and function as a transcriptional coactivator or repressor depending on the context (Palmer2008Bcl3; Liu2022Bcl3:).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in BCL3's function. Specific serine residues, including S33, S114, S366, and S446, are phosphorylated, affecting the protein's activity and stability (Pan2024Phosphorylationinduced). These modifications can alter BCL3's structural properties, influencing its ability to form complexes with DNA and NF-κB dimers (Pan2024Phosphorylationinduced).

## Function
The BCL3 gene encodes the Bcl-3 protein, a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in modulating NF-κB-mediated gene transcription. Unlike other IκB proteins, Bcl-3 does not sequester NF-κB complexes in the cytoplasm but instead regulates nuclear NF-κB activities. It interacts with NF-κB subunits, particularly p50 and p52 homodimers, and can function as both a coactivator and a suppressor of NF-κB-dependent transcription. Bcl-3 facilitates NF-κB transactivation by removing inhibitory p50 homodimers from NF-κB sites, allowing active NF-κB dimers to bind. Conversely, it can also increase p50 homodimer binding to NF-κB sites without causing coactivation, thereby repressing NF-κB target gene transcription (Palmer2008Bcl3).

Bcl-3 is involved in various cellular processes, including erythroid cell proliferation, erythropoiesis, cartilage remodeling, and immune function. It plays a crucial role in protecting T cells from activation-induced cell death by inhibiting the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, thus promoting T cell survival (Palmer2008Bcl3; Bauer2006The). Bcl-3's interactions with coactivators and corepressors suggest its involvement in chromatin modification and transcription regulation, highlighting its dual function as both an adaptor in coactivator complexes and a repressor in corepressor complexes (Palmer2008Bcl3).

## Clinical Significance
The BCL3 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as an oncogene. It is primarily associated with hematologic malignancies, such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where it is involved in the t(14;19) chromosomal translocation, leading to overexpression and a worse prognosis (Ong1998Lymphadenopathy; CarboMeix2023<i>BCL3<i>). BCL3 is also linked to other lymphoid neoplasms, including diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and marginal zone lymphomas (Seaton2024Multifaceted).

In solid tumors, BCL3 is upregulated in at least 16 different tissue origins, including breast, colorectal, and glioblastoma, where it serves as a prognostic indicator of survival outcomes (Seaton2024Multifaceted). In breast cancer, BCL3-null tumors show reduced metastasis, highlighting its role in tumor invasion (Seaton2024Multifaceted). In colorectal cancer, BCL3 enhances β-catenin signaling, promoting cancer stem cell self-renewal and resistance to DNA-damaging agents (Seaton2024Multifaceted; Parker2022BCL3).

BCL3 also contributes to therapy resistance in various cancers, including glioblastoma, where it promotes resistance to alkylating chemotherapy through NF-κB signaling (Wu2018BCL3). Its involvement in immune evasion and drug resistance further complicates treatment strategies (Seaton2024Multifaceted).

## Interactions
BCL3 is a nuclear protein that interacts with NF-κB transcription factors, particularly p50 and p52 homodimers. It can modulate their DNA binding activity through various mechanisms. BCL3 can either inhibit or enhance the binding of these homodimers to DNA, depending on its concentration and phosphorylation state. At intermediate BCL3 to p52 ratios, BCL3 forms a B-binding complex with p52 homodimers, while at high ratios, it forms an inhibitory complex (Bundy1997Diverse). BCL3's interaction with NF-κB factors does not depend on the nuclear localization signal, unlike other IκB proteins, and it can bring a form of p50 with an inactivated NLS into the nucleus (Zhang1994BCL3).

BCL3 can also form higher-order complexes with p52, such as a (BCL3)2-(p52)2 complex, which is unique among IκB proteins. This complex formation is influenced by BCL3 phosphorylation, which can decrease the stability of the complex and reduce BCL3's ability to inhibit p52 DNA binding (Bundy1997Diverse). BCL3 interacts with p50B homodimers to form a complex that can transactivate through κB motifs, acting as a transcriptional activator (Bours1993The). These interactions highlight BCL3's role in regulating NF-κB-dependent gene expression.
