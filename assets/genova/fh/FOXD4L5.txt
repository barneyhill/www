# FOXD4L5

## Overview
FOXD4L5 is a gene that encodes the protein forkhead box D4 like 5, which is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. The FOXD4L5 protein is implicated in the modulation of gene networks that are essential for cellular differentiation and development. Although the specific functions of FOXD4L5 are not fully elucidated, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests a potential role in developmental pathways and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
