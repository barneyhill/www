# TTYH1

## Overview
The TTYH1 gene encodes the tweety family member 1 protein, which is a transmembrane protein characterized by its five transmembrane helices and a large extracellular domain. This protein is part of the tweety family and is primarily expressed in neural tissues, where it plays a crucial role in neural development and cellular processes such as neurite growth, cell adhesion, and migration. TTYH1 is involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway and is implicated in the formation of tetrameric complexes at the cell membrane, which are essential for its function as a volume-sensitive chloride channel. Clinically, TTYH1 is significant due to its association with neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, and its role in various cancers, including gliomas and breast cancer, where it influences tumor invasiveness and progression (Melvin2022TTYH; Nalamalapu2021The; Matthews2006Expression).

## Structure
The TTYH1 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes five transmembrane helices and a large α-helical extracellular domain. This structure is common to all members of the TTYH family and is crucial for their function (Melvin2022TTYH). The extracellular domain is organized into a four-helix bundle, contributing to a Y-shaped dimeric structure, which is stabilized by disulfide bridges, such as C303-C370 in mTTYH1 (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM; Melvin2022TTYH).

In its quaternary structure, TTYH1 forms tetrameric complexes at the cell membrane, which are stabilized by interactions between the extracellular domains. These tetrameric assemblies can dissociate into dimers upon detergent solubilization, indicating a detergent-resistant dimeric interface (Melvin2022TTYH). The tetrameric organization is described as a 'dimer of dimers' (Melvin2022TTYH).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are evident in the cryo-EM density maps, suggesting a role in the protein's function and stability (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM). The protein's structure and dynamics have been further studied using hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, which highlight the role of the extracellular domain in tetramerization (Melvin2022TTYH).

## Function
The TTYH1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system. TTYH1 is prominently expressed in neural tissues, including the brain stem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex, and is involved in maintaining neural stem cell properties. It enhances the expression of Notch pathway targets by degrading RER1, which increases the maturation of γ-secretase complexes and the production of the Notch IntraCellular Domain (NICD) (Nalamalapu2021The). TTYH1 is also implicated in neurite growth, as its knockdown in hippocampal neurons leads to increased MAP2 aggregation (Nalamalapu2021The).

In addition to its role in neural development, TTYH1 is involved in filopodia formation and cell adhesion, as it colocalizes with integrins in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of TTYH1 enhances filopodia formation and neuritogenesis, indicating its importance in neural development (Nalamalapu2021The). TTYH1 is also associated with cell migration and adhesion, as it localizes to the Golgi apparatus and peripheral membrane, concentrating at the tips of filopodia (Matthews2006Expression). The protein's potential role as a volume-sensitive chloride channel suggests its involvement in ion transport and cellular homeostasis (Matthews2006Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The TTYH1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various neurological disorders and cancers. In neurological disorders, TTYH1 is overexpressed in neurons during epileptogenesis and shows increased immunoreactivity in reactive astrocytes following status epilepticus, indicating a role in epilepsy (Wiernasz2014Ttyh1; Nalamalapu2021The). In Alzheimer's disease, TTYH1 expression is downregulated in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex but upregulated in the superior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, suggesting region-specific roles (Nalamalapu2021The). In Parkinson's disease, TTYH1 is downregulated in the locus coeruleus, which may affect calcium homeostasis (Nalamalapu2021The).

TTYH1 is also implicated in various cancers, particularly gliomas, where it contributes to tumor invasiveness and microtube formation. Knockdown of TTYH1 in glioblastoma cell lines reduces invasiveness and tumor size, improving survival in mice (Jung2017TweetyHomolog; Nalamalapu2021The). In breast cancer, TTYH1 downregulation correlates with better life expectancy in triple-negative breast cancer patients, suggesting it may hinder cancer progression (Nalamalapu2021The). TTYH1 is also involved in other cancers, such as lung cancer and tongue squamous cell carcinoma, where it is upregulated, and in esophageal and pancreatic cancers, where it is downregulated (Nalamalapu2021The).

## Interactions
TTYH1, a member of the tweety family of proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In HEK293 cells, TTYH1 colocalizes with integrin, specifically the α5 subunit of the α5β1-integrin complex, suggesting a potential interaction that may play a role in cell adhesion and migration (Jung2017TweetyHomolog; Matthews2006Expression). This interaction is particularly evident at the tips of filopodia, where TTYH1 is concentrated and deposited on the substrate as cells migrate (Matthews2006Expression).

TTYH1 is also implicated in the formation of tetrameric complexes at the cell membrane, with its extracellular domains playing a crucial role in stabilizing these structures through disulfide bridges (Melvin2022TTYH). These tetrameric assemblies are sensitive to detergent conditions, which can alter their quaternary organization (Melvin2022TTYH).

Unlike its paralogs TTYH2 and TTYH3, TTYH1 does not interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, as it lacks the necessary PY motif for this interaction (He2008The). This suggests that TTYH1 is regulated differently from other tweety family members.
