# URAD

## Overview
The URAD gene encodes the enzyme ureidoimidazoline (2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-) decarboxylase, which plays a crucial role in the metabolic pathway of purine catabolism. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the decarboxylation of ureidoimidazoline, a key intermediate in the breakdown of purines, which are essential components of nucleic acids. The URAD gene is highly conserved across various species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular metabolism. Mutations or dysregulation of the URAD gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
