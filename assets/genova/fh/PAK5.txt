# PAK5

## Overview
PAK5, or p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 5, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the group II PAK family, which also includes PAK4 and PAK6. The protein product of PAK5 is involved in a variety of cellular processes, particularly in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuronal development and survival. PAK5 is characterized by its conserved C-terminal Ste20-like kinase domain and an N-terminal CRIB domain, which facilitates interactions with small GTPases such as Cdc42. This kinase is known for its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics, promoting microtubule stability and influencing cell motility. Additionally, PAK5 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and is associated with various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis through its interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Cotteret2006Nucleocytoplasmic; Pandey2002Cloning; Huang2020PAK5).

## Structure
PAK5 is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the group II PAKs, which also includes PAK4 and PAK6. The protein is composed of 719 amino acids and features a highly conserved C-terminal Ste20-like kinase domain, which includes 11 kinase subdomains (Wen2014An; Pandey2002Cloning). This domain shares significant sequence identity with other group II PAKs, with over 80% identity in the kinase domain (Wen2014An).

The N-terminal region of PAK5 contains a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which facilitates interaction with small GTPases like Cdc42, although PAK5 may not bind with Rac (Tabanifar2016PAK5; Wen2014An). The CRIB motif is conserved and essential for binding to Cdc42 in the presence of GTP (Pandey2002Cloning). PAK5 also contains an autoinhibitory domain (AID) at the N-terminus, which regulates its activation by interacting with the C-terminal catalytic domain (Tabanifar2016PAK5).

PAK5 exhibits a unique structural feature in its central region, which promotes self-association and oligomerization, contributing to its high basal activity. This central domain, spanning residues 109-420, is crucial for the formation of multimeric structures and is not present in PAK4 (Tabanifar2016PAK5). The protein's ability to form puncta in cells is linked to this self-association property (Tabanifar2016PAK5).

## Function
PAK5 (p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 5) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the brain. It is involved in regulating cell survival signaling pathways by localizing primarily to mitochondria, where it exerts antiapoptotic effects. PAK5 achieves this by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell survival, especially in neuronal cells (Cotteret2006Nucleocytoplasmic).

PAK5 also influences cytoskeletal dynamics by stabilizing microtubules and promoting the dissolution of actin stress fibers, leading to the formation of filopodia. This is achieved through its interaction with MARK2, a kinase that destabilizes microtubules. PAK5 inhibits MARK2, thus maintaining microtubule stability and contributing to cellular structure and dynamics (Matenia2005PAK5).

In the context of neuronal development, PAK5 is highly expressed in the brain and promotes neurite outgrowth by interacting with the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. This interaction facilitates the formation of filopodia and neurite-like processes, which are essential for neuronal morphology and development (Dan2002PAK5).

## Clinical Significance
PAK5 (p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 5) is implicated in the progression of various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In lung cancer, PAK5 mutations occur in 5% to 10% of patients, suggesting a role in cancer development and progression (Li2020Human). In colorectal cancer, PAK5 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its interaction with Cdc42 and Integrins is crucial for these processes, making it a potential therapeutic target (Huang2020PAK5). 

In breast cancer, PAK5 is part of a signaling axis involving DNPEP and USP4, where its overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes. This axis influences cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting PAK5's role in cancer progression (Geng2019A). PAK5 also phosphorylates E47 on Ser39, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in colon cancer by inhibiting E-cadherin transcription (Zhu2015PAK5mediated). 

These findings underscore PAK5's clinical significance as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target across different cancer types, due to its involvement in tumor progression and metastasis (Wen2014An; Li2020Human).

## Interactions
PAK5 (p21-activated kinase 5) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in various cellular processes. PAK5 interacts with LMO2 and GATA1, forming a complex that regulates gene expression in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). LMO2 acts as a bridge, facilitating the interaction between PAK5 and GATA1, allowing PAK5 to phosphorylate GATA1 at the Ser161 site (Pan2022PAK5). 

In cervical cancer cells, PAK5 interacts with SATB1, a transcription factor, by phosphorylating it at serine 47. This phosphorylation enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of the cancer cells by affecting the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (Huo2018PAK5).

PAK5 also interacts with the NF-κB-p65 subunit in breast cancer cells, promoting its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. This interaction leads to the activation of Cyclin D1 transcription, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Zhang2017PAK5mediated).

Additionally, PAK5 interacts with small GTPases such as CDC42, which is essential for its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. This interaction is GTP-dependent and involves the CRIB motif of PAK5 (Pandey2002Cloning).
