# LAG3

## Overview
LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene 3) is a gene that encodes the LAG3 protein, a type I transmembrane protein that functions as an immune checkpoint receptor. The LAG3 protein is primarily expressed on activated T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), where it plays a critical role in modulating immune responses by binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. This interaction transmits inhibitory signals that downregulate T cell proliferation and activation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Chocarro2021Understanding; Ruffo2019Lymphocyteactivation). Structurally, the LAG3 protein is characterized by four immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains in its extracellular region, which are essential for its function (Huard1997Characterization). The protein's cytoplasmic region contains a conserved KIEELE sequence crucial for its inhibitory activity (Maeda2019Atypical). LAG3's role in immune regulation makes it a significant focus of research in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections, where it is considered a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Anderson2016Lag3; Chocarro2021Understanding).

## Structure
The LAG3 protein is a type I transmembrane protein encoded by the LAG3 gene, consisting of 498 amino acids in its precursor form and 470 amino acids in its mature form (Triebel1990LAG3). Its primary structure includes a hydrophobic leader peptide, an extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region (Triebel1990LAG3). The extracellular region contains four immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains, labeled D1 through D4, which are crucial for its function (Huard1997Characterization).

The secondary structure of LAG3 features Ig-like domains, with the D1 domain having an IgV fold and the D2 domain aligning with an IgC fold (Huard1997Characterization). A notable structural feature is the extra loop in the D1 domain, which is encoded by exon 3 and is important for interactions with MHC class II molecules (Huard1997Characterization).

LAG3's tertiary structure involves the folding of these Ig-like domains, contributing to its ability to bind MHC class II molecules. The protein can oligomerize on the cell surface, which may be necessary for stable MHC class II binding (Huard1997Characterization). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are suggested by the presence of N-glycans (Baixeras1992Characterization). The protein's cytoplasmic region includes a conserved KIEELE sequence necessary for its inhibitory function (Maeda2019Atypical).

## Function
LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene 3) encodes a protein that functions as an immune checkpoint receptor, playing a crucial role in regulating T cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis. In healthy human cells, LAG3 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as on natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Chocarro2021Understanding; Ruffo2019Lymphocyteactivation). It binds to MHC class II molecules with high affinity, transmitting inhibitory signals that downregulate T cell proliferation and activation (Workman2002Cutting; Ruffo2019Lymphocyteactivation).

LAG3's inhibitory function is mediated through its association with the TCR:CD3 complex, where it negatively regulates TCR signal transduction, leading to reduced cytokine secretion and cell proliferation (Chocarro2021Understanding). The cytoplasmic tail of LAG3 contains conserved motifs, including the KIEELE motif, which is essential for its negative regulatory function (Workman2002Cutting; Ruffo2019Lymphocyteactivation).

By limiting T cell activation, LAG3 helps prevent autoimmunity and maintains immune tolerance. It is also involved in the suppression of immune responses by Tregs, contributing to immune homeostasis and preventing overactive immune responses (Chocarro2021Understanding; Huang2004Role).

## Clinical Significance
LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, LAG3 expression is linked to tumor progression and immune evasion. High LAG3 expression is associated with worse overall survival in several solid tumors, although it can correlate with better outcomes in specific cancers like colorectal and breast cancer (Li2023Prognostic). LAG3 is often co-expressed with PD-1 on exhausted T cells, and their co-blockade can enhance antitumor responses (Chocarro2021Understanding). In melanoma, LAG3 promoter methylation affects its expression and is associated with survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Fröhlich2020Molecular).

LAG3 is also implicated in autoimmune diseases and chronic infections. Its deficiency can lead to accelerated type 1 diabetes in certain genetic backgrounds, indicating its role in maintaining immune tolerance (Anderson2016Lag3). In multiple sclerosis, specific LAG3 SNPs are linked to increased disease risk, potentially due to disrupted immune homeostasis (Chocarro2021Understanding). These findings highlight LAG3's clinical significance as a biomarker and therapeutic target across various conditions.

## Interactions
LAG3 (lymphocyte activating 3) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins that influence immune responses. It forms complexes with the FGL1 ligand on the cell surface, where FGL1 binds to opposing sides of the LAG3 dimer, leading to the formation of higher-order LAG3-FGL1 oligomers. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by reduced clustering when a blocking antibody is used (Ming2022LAG3). LAG3 also associates with the TCR-CD3 complex in T cells, inhibiting T cell signaling by driving co-receptor-Lck dissociation. This interaction affects early T cell activation events and is visualized through various microscopy techniques (Guy2022LAG3).

LAG3 binds specifically to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, a process that may require oligomerization for stable binding (Huard1997Characterization). The protein also interacts with a novel protein termed LAP, which binds to the C-terminal region of LAG3, potentially participating in the down-regulation of the CD3/TCR activation pathway (Iouzalen2001LAP). These interactions highlight LAG3's role in modulating immune responses through various protein complexes and signaling pathways.
