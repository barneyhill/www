# SLC3A2

## Overview
SLC3A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 3 member 2, commonly referred to as CD98 or 4F2hc. This protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in amino acid transport and cellular signaling. As a regulatory subunit of heteromeric amino acid transporters, CD98hc forms disulfide-linked heterodimers with light chain amino acid transporters, facilitating the import of essential amino acids crucial for cellular metabolism and signaling pathways, such as mTOR (Zhang2022SLC3A2). Beyond its transport functions, CD98hc is involved in mechanosensing and mechanosignaling through interactions with integrins, impacting tissue mechanical homeostasis and extracellular matrix organization (Boulter2018Cell). The protein's role extends to influencing glucose metabolism and nucleotide availability, which are vital for cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis (CanoCrespo2019CD98hc). Due to its involvement in various cellular processes, SLC3A2 is of significant interest in cancer research, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types (El2018The; Xu2024Elevated).

## Structure
The SLC3A2 protein, also known as CD98 or 4F2hc, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in amino acid transport and cellular signaling. Its primary structure includes a heavy chain with multiple transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function as an adaptor to the SLC7A exchangers (Zhang2022SLC3A2). The secondary structure of SLC3A2 features alpha helices, contributing to its stability and interaction with other proteins (Console2022Nglycosylation).

The tertiary structure of SLC3A2 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, which is involved in interactions with galectins and other glycoprotein adaptors, such as CD44 and BSG. These interactions are crucial for clustering receptors and transporters, influencing cell signaling and motility (Zhang2022SLC3A2). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with light chain amino acid transporters, such as LAT1 (SLC7A5) and LAT2 (SLC7A8), facilitating the import of essential amino acids (Console2022Nglycosylation).

Post-translational modifications, particularly N-glycosylation, are critical for the trafficking, stability, and function of SLC3A2. The protein has several N-glycosylation sites, including N365, N381, N424, and N506, which are important for its localization to the plasma membrane and interaction with other proteins (Zhang2022SLC3A2; Console2022Nglycosylation). These modifications also influence the protein's role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and surface retention (Zhang2022SLC3A2).

## Function
The SLC3A2 gene encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein known as CD98hc, which is integral to amino acid transport and cellular metabolism in healthy human cells. It functions as a regulatory subunit of heteromeric amino acid transporters, forming disulfide-linked heterodimers with large amino acid transporters (SLC7A-), facilitating the import of essential amino acids and cystine. This process is crucial for mTOR signaling and glutathione synthesis, impacting cellular growth and oxidative stress responses (Zhang2022SLC3A2).

CD98hc also plays a significant role in mechanosensing and mechanosignaling through its interaction with integrins, influencing tissue mechanical homeostasis and extracellular matrix organization. It regulates sphingolipid biosynthesis, which is essential for membrane structure and function, and affects integrin-mediated mechanosensing by influencing RhoA activation (Boulter2018Cell).

In addition, SLC3A2 is involved in maintaining nucleotide availability and supporting cell cycle progression. It sustains glucose uptake and glycolysis, influencing the pentose phosphate pathway and maintaining the nucleotide pool necessary for DNA synthesis and repair, thus preventing replicative stress (CanoCrespo2019CD98hc).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC3A2 gene, also known as CD98, have been implicated in various cancers, where it is often associated with poor prognosis. In breast cancer, high SLC3A2 expression is linked to aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative and HER2-positive tumors, and is correlated with poor patient outcomes and higher tumor grades (El2018The). In gliomas, elevated SLC3A2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor malignancy, influencing immune cell infiltration and therapy response (Xu2024Elevated). 

SLC3A2 is also involved in laryngeal carcinoma, where its high expression is linked to poor survival outcomes. It plays a role in ferroptosis regulation via the mTOR signaling pathway, impacting tumor growth and cell proliferation (Wu2022SLC3A2). In various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, SLC3A2 overexpression supports tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing amino acid transport and integrin signaling (Xia2023CD98).

The gene's expression is also linked to immune evasion mechanisms, such as PDL1 overexpression, contributing to T cell dysfunction and poor survival outcomes in certain cancers (He2022Characterizing). These findings suggest that SLC3A2 is a significant player in cancer biology, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and survival through various mechanisms.

## Interactions
SLC3A2, also known as CD98hc, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms a heterodimeric complex with light chain proteins such as SLC7A5 (LAT1), facilitating the transport of large neutral amino acids across cell membranes (Saito2022Polarity; Console2022Nglycosylation). This interaction is essential for leucine transport and cell proliferation, particularly in ER-positive breast cancer cells (Saito2022Polarity).

SLC3A2 also interacts with integrins, specifically the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β subunits, which is critical for adhesion-induced intracellular signaling. This interaction influences cell proliferation, migration, and survival, playing a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis in renal cancer cells (Poettler2013CD98hc). The cytoplasmic domain of SLC3A2 is crucial for these interactions, facilitating FAK phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK (Poettler2013CD98hc).

In the central nervous system, SLC3A2 interacts with SREB receptors, forming part of the system L amino acid transporter. This interaction is linked to amino acid neurotransmitter control and cellular oxidative stress regulation (Kaafarani2023Proximity). These interactions highlight SLC3A2's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
