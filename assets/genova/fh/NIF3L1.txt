# NIF3L1

## Overview
NIF3L1, or NGG1 interacting factor 3 like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in neural differentiation. The NIF3L1 protein is characterized as a transcriptional corepressor, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during the early stages of neuronal differentiation. It achieves this by interacting with other proteins, such as Trip15/CSN2, which facilitates its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it can exert its silencing function (Akiyama2003The). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Tascou2003Identification). NIF3L1 is implicated in various biological pathways and diseases, including neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and several pathological conditions such as cancers and neurological disorders (Reed2021Comparative; Akiyama2003The). Its interactions and regulatory functions make it a significant focus of research in understanding neural development and associated diseases.

## Structure
The NIF3L1 protein is highly conserved across species, with significant homology in its N-terminal region of 191 amino acids and C-terminal region of 83 amino acids. The middle part of the protein, consisting of 83 amino acids, is conserved in both mouse and human proteins (Tascou2003Identification). NIF3L1 contains two putative leucine zipper motifs, located at amino acid residues 210-224 and 264-278, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Akiyama2003The). These motifs are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as Trip15/CSN2, which is essential for its role as a transcriptional corepressor in neural differentiation (Akiyama2003The).

NIF3L1 interacts with itself and with NIF3L1 BP1, a novel protein containing a putative leucine zipper domain. This interaction is facilitated by a C-terminal region of 100 amino acids in NIF3L1 BP1 (Tascou2003Identification). The protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus during neural differentiation, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Tascou2003Identification). The study of NIF3L1's interactions and localization provides insights into its cellular function, although detailed structural information such as tertiary or quaternary structures is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The NIF3L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in neural differentiation, particularly through its interaction with the transcriptional corepressor Trip15/CSN2. This interaction is crucial for the early stages of neuronal differentiation, as NIF3L1 is involved in the down-regulation of the Oct-3/4 gene, a transcription factor that maintains the undifferentiated state of certain cells (Akiyama2003The). NIF3L1 also influences the expression of the neurogenic Mash-1 gene, promoting the commitment of multipotent cells to the neural lineage (Akiyama2003The).

NIF3L1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus, a process facilitated by its binding to Trip15/CSN2, which possesses a nuclear localization signal (Akiyama2003The). This translocation is essential for its function as a transcriptional silencer, where it may recruit histone deacetylases to target promoters during neural differentiation (Akiyama2003The). The enforced expression of NIF3L1 enhances neural differentiation in retinoic acid-primed P19 cells, leading to the formation of neurons and glial cells (Akiyama2003The). These findings suggest that NIF3L1 is involved in both neurogenesis and gliogenesis, potentially by increasing the fraction of cells committed to neural differentiation (Akiyama2003The).

## Clinical Significance
The NIF3L1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. It is associated with various pathologies, including cancers, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, osteoporosis, inflammation, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Williams-Beuren Syndrome, and other neurological diseases (Reed2021Comparative). NIF3L1 has also been linked to macular degeneration, where a specific SNP, rs10931931, is causally associated with a decreased risk of the condition (Kuliesius2024Efficient).

In the context of congenital heart disease, NIF3L1 interacts with ciliopathy-associated genes, suggesting a potential role in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) (Karunakaran2022Novel). Additionally, NIF3L1 is involved in liver carcinoma through its interaction with CXCL12, a gene associated with the disease (Karunakaran2022Novel).

NIF3L1's role in neural differentiation is significant, as it interacts with the transcriptional corepressor Trip15/CSN2, influencing the expression of genes like Oct-3/4 and Mash-1, which are crucial for neural development (Akiyama2003The). These interactions highlight its importance in neurodevelopmental processes and potential implications in related disorders.

## Interactions
NIF3L1 (NGG1 interacting factor 3 like 1) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neural differentiation. One of its primary interactions is with the transcriptional corepressor Trip15/CSN2, a component of the COP9 signalosome. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional repression activity of NIF3L1, as it facilitates the translocation of NIF3L1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it can exert its silencing function. The interaction between NIF3L1 and Trip15/CSN2 has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening, pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation (Akiyama2003The).

NIF3L1 also interacts with a novel protein, NIF3L1 BP1, which contains a leucine zipper domain. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and is facilitated by the C-terminal region of NIF3L1 BP1. The interaction was confirmed using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems (Tascou2003Identification). These interactions suggest that NIF3L1 may be involved in a novel nuclear/cytoplasmic interaction pathway relevant to neuronal differentiation (Tascou2003Identification).
