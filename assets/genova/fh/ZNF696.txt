# ZNF696

## Overview
ZNF696 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 696, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins typically function as transcription factors, influencing gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. ZNF696 is implicated in various biological processes, including epigenetic regulation and gene expression modulation, through its involvement in DNA methylation and protein-DNA interactions. The protein encoded by ZNF696 has been associated with clinical conditions such as non-small cell lung cancer and neonatal hypoglycemia, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis and prognosis (Kasuga2021Epigenetic; Kaya2022Integrated).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF696 has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its altered expression and potential epigenetic modifications. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF696 is part of a 12-gene signature identified for its diagnostic and prognostic potential. This gene signature, including ZNF696, is significantly expressed in the blood of NSCLC patients at early stages and is associated with poor disease outcomes. The expression of ZNF696 in this context is linked to cancer-related pathways and may play a role in the transformation and progression of NSCLC (Kaya2022Integrated).

In neonates, epigenetic changes in ZNF696 have been associated with neonatal hypoglycemia, particularly in those born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DNA methylation at specific CpG sites near an alternative transcription start site of ZNF696 correlates with neonatal plasma glucose levels shortly after birth. These methylation changes suggest a potential role for ZNF696 in neonatal glucose metabolism, possibly influenced by the in utero environment and maternal hyperglycemia (Kasuga2021Epigenetic). The clinical significance of these findings in terms of broader health outcomes or disease risk remains to be fully elucidated (Kasuga2021Epigenetic).

## Interactions
ZNF696 is involved in various interactions that influence its function in gene regulation. The gene is associated with DNA methylation at specific CpG sites near its alternative transcription start site (TSS). Methylation levels at these sites are linked to neonatal plasma glucose levels, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation (Kasuga2021Epigenetic). The study identified that transcription factors ELF1 and RUNX3 bind to the alternative TSS of ZNF696, indicating specific protein-DNA interactions (Kasuga2021Epigenetic).

In the context of fertility, ZNF696 was found to be overexpressed in low fertile bulls, although its specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context remain unclear (Muhammad2014Identification). The gene is also located near the long non-coding RNA MINCR, which is up-regulated by the transcription factor MYC. This proximity suggests potential co-regulation, although direct interactions between ZNF696 and MINCR have not been fully elucidated (Iaccarino2017lncRNAs).

ZNF696 has been identified as a locus with interindividual DNA methylation differences, indicating its involvement in systemic epigenetic regulation across various tissues (Waterland2010Season). However, specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed.
