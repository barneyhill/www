# ZNF367

## Overview
ZNF367 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 367, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are integral to its DNA-binding capabilities. This protein is part of the Krüppel-like family, known for its role in regulating gene expression through interaction with DNA and chromatin remodeling proteins (Wu2020Zinc). ZNF367 is involved in critical cellular processes, including neurogenesis and cell cycle progression, by maintaining chromosome stability and regulating the spindle checkpoint during cell division (Naef2018The; Naef2018Thea). The protein's interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SWI/SNF complex, underscore its significance in both cancer progression and neural development (Wu2020Zinc). ZNF367's expression patterns and interactions suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers, including breast and endocrine cancers, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (Wu2020Zinc; Jain2014ZNF367).

## Structure
ZNF367, or zinc finger protein 367, is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that facilitate its role as a transcription factor. The protein contains two contiguous Cys2His2-type zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Wu2020Zinc). These zinc finger motifs are part of the Krüppel-like family, which is known for its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression (Wu2020Zinc).

The primary structure of ZNF367 includes sequences that form these zinc finger domains, which coordinate zinc ions to maintain structural stability. The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available context, but the zinc finger motifs suggest a typical fold that allows for DNA interaction. The protein's interaction with chromatin remodeling proteins, such as BRG1, indicates a role in modifying chromatin structure to regulate gene expression (Wu2020Zinc).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence ZNF367's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The existence of multiple splice variant isoforms is suggested, which could affect the protein's structural and functional properties, but specific isoforms are not described.

## Function
ZNF367, a zinc finger protein, functions as a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression, particularly during neurogenesis and cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, ZNF367 is a central node in gene co-regulation networks that control cell cycle progression and DNA replication. It is expressed in neural tissues and plays a crucial role in primary neurogenesis by regulating neuroblast mitosis and the spindle checkpoint (Naef2018The; Naef2018Thea). ZNF367 is involved in maintaining chromosome stability and regulating the spindle checkpoint during cell division, acting as a transcriptional repressor to facilitate cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation (Naef2018The).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences the transcription of target genes, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. ZNF367 is part of a conserved gene module enriched in genes regulating the cell cycle and mitotic spindle checkpoint, indicating its role in cell cycle control, particularly during mitosis (Naef2018Thea). The expression of ZNF367 declines with age, suggesting its potential importance in maintaining and repairing neuronal function during aging (Naef2018The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF367 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer and endocrine cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma and papillary thyroid cancer. In breast cancer, ZNF367 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis due to its role in promoting metastasis. It enhances the survival of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by inhibiting anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, and activates YAP1 signaling, which is crucial for metastasis (Wu2020Zinc). The overexpression of ZNF367 in breast cancer is linked to TP53 mutations, suggesting a potential mechanism for its upregulation (Wu2020Zinc).

In endocrine cancers, ZNF367 is also overexpressed and has been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and adhesion. Its expression is inversely correlated with miR-195, a microRNA that targets ZNF367, suggesting a regulatory axis that influences cancer progression (Jain2014ZNF367). The knockdown of ZNF367 in these cancers leads to increased cellular activities, indicating its role as a counter-regulatory factor in cancer progression (Jain2014ZNF367).

Targeting the ZNF367/YAP1 axis in breast cancer and the miR-195-ZNF367 axis in endocrine cancers presents potential therapeutic strategies for managing these malignancies (Wu2020Zinc; Jain2014ZNF367).

## Interactions
ZNF367, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several interactions that influence its role in cancer progression and neurogenesis. In breast cancer, ZNF367 interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically with the core protein BRG1. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of CIT and TP53BP2, which are negative regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway. The interaction between ZNF367 and BRG1 facilitates the inhibition of the Hippo pathway, leading to the activation of YAP1 signaling, which promotes metastasis by enhancing anoikis resistance and increasing circulating tumor cells (Wu2020Zinc).

In the context of neurogenesis, ZNF367 is suggested to interact with genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as fancd2, ska3, and smc2. These interactions are implicated in chromosome stability and the spindle checkpoint, indicating ZNF367's role in controlling the transition from proliferative neural precursor cells to post-mitotic neurons (Naef2018The). These interactions highlight ZNF367's involvement in both cancer progression and neural development, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.
