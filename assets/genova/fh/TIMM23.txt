# TIMM23

## Overview
The TIMM23 gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 23 (TIM23) complex, which is integral to mitochondrial function. This protein complex is responsible for the translocation and insertion of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis and cellular health. As a transmembrane protein, TIMM23 forms part of the channel through which proteins are imported into the mitochondria, working in concert with other components of the TIM23 complex and the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM) complex. The proper functioning of TIMM23 is essential for mitochondrial energy production and overall cellular metabolism, and its dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, including renal failure and neurodegenerative disorders (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).

## Function
The TIMM23 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM) complex, which is essential for the import and insertion of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. This complex plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein homeostasis by ensuring the correct localization and integration of proteins within the mitochondria, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial and cellular health (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).

The TIMM23 complex works in conjunction with the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM) complex, serving as the primary gateway for proteins entering the mitochondria. Proteins with a presequence are transferred from the TOMM complex to the TIMM23 complex, facilitating their translocation into the appropriate mitochondrial compartment (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). The TIMM23 complex is involved in directing proteins into either the inner mitochondrial membrane or the matrix, depending on their signal, and is crucial for the insertion of inner membrane proteins and the translocation of proteins into the matrix (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).

The TIMM23 complex also interacts with other proteins, such as PAM16 and mtHSP70, which are necessary for the translocation of preproteins into the matrix, driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). This complex is integral to mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting overall cellular metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TIMM23 gene have been implicated in several health conditions. In the context of renal failure, studies have shown that mice with combined deficiencies in the Parg and Parp-1 genes, along with a hypomorphic state of TIMM23, develop severe renal failure. These mice exhibit symptoms such as glomerular sclerosis and tubular dilatation, suggesting that reduced TIMM23 expression contributes to renal dysfunction (Chen2019Development).

In the realm of mitochondrial dysfunction, TIMM23 is part of the mitochondrial translocase complex, which is crucial for protein import into mitochondria. Dysregulation of TIMM23 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a contributing factor in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic conditions (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).

In sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, the expression of TIMM23 and other TIM23 complex member genes initially increases but decreases significantly over time, indicating a role in mitochondrial injury during sepsis. This suggests that TIMM23 and its associated pathways could be potential targets for therapeutic interventions in sepsis-related complications (Weng2024Exploring).

## Interactions
TIMM23 is a key component of the TIM23 complex, which is essential for the translocation of proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It forms a translocation channel with TIMM17, facilitating the import of preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix or inner membrane (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). TIMM23 interacts with TIMM50 and TIMM21, which are part of the same complex, and these interactions are crucial for the complex's function in protein import (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). TIMM50 is the first component to interact with precursor proteins, playing a pivotal role in protein sorting and maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential (Paz2024Biochemical).

The TIM23 complex also interacts with the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM) complex, specifically through the intermembrane space domains of its subunits, to facilitate the import of proteins from the cytosol (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). TIMM23 is involved in forming supercomplexes with TOMM40 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the context of Alzheimer's disease, which may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). These interactions highlight the critical role of TIMM23 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in disease pathology.
