# CD37

## Overview
CD37 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by four transmembrane domains and a significant extracellular loop. The CD37 protein is predominantly expressed on B lymphocytes and plays a critical role in immune cell regulation, including signal transduction, cell motility, and proliferation. It forms complexes with other proteins, such as integrins and immune receptors, to organize membrane domains and facilitate signaling processes (Bobrowicz2020CD37; Classon1990The). CD37 is essential for B-cell survival and long-lived immunity, and its deficiency can lead to immune dysregulation and increased susceptibility to B-cell malignancies (Robak2014AntiCD37). The protein's interactions with other tetraspanins and signaling molecules underscore its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (XuMonette2016Assessment; de2016Tetraspanin).

## Structure
CD37 is a glycoprotein that belongs to the tetraspanin family, characterized by its structure of four transmembrane domains and a major extracellular loop. The protein is composed of 244 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 27,376 daltons (Classon1990The). The transmembrane regions of CD37 show high sequence similarity with other tetraspanins, featuring six conserved cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bridges, contributing to the stability of the protein's structure (Hořejši1991Novel).

The primary structure of CD37 includes a sequence that resembles a conventional leader sequence, although it is suggested that CD37 lacks a cleaved leader sequence, similar to its rat homologue, MRC OX-44 (Classon1990The). The extracellular loop is typically N-glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification in tetraspanins, potentially influencing the protein's function and interactions (Hořejši1991Novel).

CD37 is expressed predominantly on B lymphocytes and at lower levels on other immune cells, such as T cells, thymocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages (Classon1990The). The protein's quaternary structure may involve forming complexes with other proteins, which is typical for tetraspanins, affecting cell signaling and adhesion (Hořejši1991Novel).

## Function
CD37 is a tetraspanin protein prominently expressed on the surface of B cells, where it plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell functions. It is involved in modulating signal transduction, cell motility, proliferation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (Bobrowicz2020CD37). CD37 forms complexes with other proteins, including integrins and immune receptors, which help organize membrane domains and facilitate signal transduction. It specifically regulates β2 integrin-mediated adhesion and migration in neutrophils and interacts with MHC II on dendritic cells, influencing MHC clustering and antigen presentation (Bobrowicz2020CD37).

In B cells, CD37 is essential for survival and long-lived protective immunity. Its deficiency results in reduced numbers of IgG-secreting plasma cells in lymphoid organs, indicating its role in B-cell survival and immunity (Robak2014AntiCD37). CD37 also affects T cell function, as its deficiency leads to hyperproliferation of T cells upon TCR stimulation, due to increased tyrosine kinase activity essential for TCR signal transduction (Bobrowicz2020CD37). Additionally, CD37 is involved in the spatial organization of the B-cell plasma membrane by forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, which are crucial for pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling via the PI3K/AKT pathway (Oostindie2020DuoHexaBodyCD37®).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CD37 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of B-cell malignancies. CD37 is a tetraspanin protein that plays a crucial role in immune regulation and tumor suppression. Its deficiency or loss is associated with the development of B-cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and germinal center-derived B-cell lymphoma. In CD37-deficient mice, there is a higher incidence of B-cell lymphoma, which is linked to the activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway (de2016Tetraspanin).

In human DLBCL, the loss of CD37 expression correlates with worse progression-free and overall survival, and is associated with adverse prognostic factors like TP53 mutations and NF-κB activation (XuMonette2016Assessment). CD37 mutations are particularly prevalent in DLBCL cases associated with immune-privileged sites, such as the testis or central nervous system, where they lead to impaired CD37 protein expression (Elfrink2019High).

The absence of CD37 disrupts its interaction with suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), leading to constitutive activation of the IL-6 pathway, which contributes to tumorigenesis (de2016Tetraspanin). These findings suggest that CD37 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss or mutation can significantly impact the prognosis and treatment outcomes in B-cell malignancies.

## Interactions
CD37, a tetraspanin protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, forming complexes that influence immune cell functions. It interacts with other tetraspanins such as CD53, CD81, and CD82, as well as class II glycoproteins on the surface of B cells (Bobrowicz2020CD37; Zhao2007Targeting). CD37 also forms complexes with integrins, growth factor receptors, and immune receptors, facilitating processes like cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation (Bobrowicz2020CD37).

A significant interaction of CD37 is with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which plays a crucial role in inhibiting the IL-6 signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for the regulation of IL-6 signaling, as CD37 facilitates the binding of SOCS3 to the IL-6 receptor complex, stabilizing it in the plasma membrane (de2016Tetraspanin). The absence of CD37 leads to enhanced IL-6 signaling, contributing to the development of B cell lymphomas (de2016Tetraspanin).

CD37 also interacts with proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as LYN, SHP1, SYK, and PI3Kγ, upon ligation with SMIP-016, a CD37-specific small modular immunopharmaceutical. This interaction can lead to either pro-apoptotic or pro-survival effects, depending on the signaling pathway activated (Bobrowicz2020CD37).
