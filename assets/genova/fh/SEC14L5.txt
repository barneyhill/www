# SEC14L5

## Overview
SEC14L5 is a gene that encodes the SEC14-like lipid binding 5 protein, which is part of the SEC14 family of lipid-binding proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind and transport lipids, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways. The SEC14-like lipid binding 5 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and phospholipid transfer, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. As a lipid-binding protein, it is implicated in the regulation of lipid-related pathways and may have potential implications in understanding lipid-associated disorders. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of SEC14L5 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aimed at elucidating its role in health and disease.
