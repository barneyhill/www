# ITGB7

## Overview
The ITGB7 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 7, a crucial component of the integrin family, which are transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The integrin β7 protein, formed by pairing with alpha subunits such as alpha4 or alphaE, plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in the trafficking and homing of lymphocytes to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the intestinal mucosa. This function is vital for maintaining gut homeostasis and facilitating immune responses. The integrin β7 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, skin cutaneous melanoma, and multiple myeloma, where its expression and function can influence disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Babbar2019The; Sun2020β7; Sun2018Transmission).

## Structure
The integrin subunit beta 7 (ITGB7) is a component of the integrin family, which are transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. ITGB7 pairs with alpha subunits, such as alpha4 or alphaE, to form heterodimers, which are crucial for its function in the immune system and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) development (Hadley2014Integrin; Sun2018Transmission).

The primary structure of ITGB7 consists of a sequence of amino acids, including a signal peptide predicted to be 19 amino acids long, which is essential for the insertion of the N-terminal ends into the cell membrane (Holmes2011Comparative). The secondary structure includes a transmembrane domain (TMD) that plays a critical role in integrin activation. Mutations in the TMD, such as the introduction of proline residues, can disrupt the helical structure, affecting the transmission of talin-induced topological changes necessary for activation (Sun2018Transmission).

ITGB7 contains specific domains, including an extracellular integrin beta region, a cysteine-rich tandem repeat region, an integrin beta tail domain, a transmembrane helical region, and a cytoplasmic region (Holmes2011Comparative). Common post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may affect the protein's stability and function, although specific details are not provided in the context. The existence of splice variant isoforms is suggested but not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
The ITGB7 gene encodes the integrin β7 protein, which is a critical component of the integrin family involved in cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin β7 pairs with either the α4 or αE (CD103) subunits to form heterodimers, α4β7 and αEβ7, respectively. These integrins play a crucial role in the trafficking and homing of lymphocytes to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the intestinal mucosa (Babbar2019The; Sun2020β7).

The α4β7 integrin specifically mediates the migration of immune cells into the GALT by interacting with the endothelial ligand mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) (Babbar2019The). This interaction is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis and facilitating immune responses by ensuring the proper localization of immune cells within the intestinal environment (Sun2020β7). The αEβ7 integrin, on the other hand, is involved in the retention of lymphocytes in the gut epithelium through binding to E-Cadherin, contributing to both immunogenic and tolerogenic responses in the gut (Babbar2019The).

In healthy human cells, integrin β7 is vital for the proper functioning of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the gut, which are essential for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing excessive inflammation (Sun2020β7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGB7 gene, which encodes the integrin β7 subunit, have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a specific mutation known as β7-F185A impairs the activation of integrin α4β7, reducing lymphocyte homing to the gut. This mutation prevents adaptive immune-mediated colitis without increasing susceptibility to innate colitis, suggesting that targeting α4β7 activation could be a more effective therapeutic strategy for IBD (Zhang2020A).

In skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), ITGB7 expression is significantly increased in metastatic tissues compared to primary tissues, correlating with disease progression and overall survival. This suggests ITGB7's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in SKCM (Nurzat2021Identification).

In multiple myeloma (MM), ITGB7 is upregulated in high-risk subgroups, influenced by epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. This upregulation is associated with disease progression and may have implications for targeted therapies (Roy2023Expression).

In colorectal cancer, ITGB7 expression is linked to antitumor immunity, with high expression associated with increased immune cell infiltration and fewer somatic copy-number alterations, suggesting a role in maintaining immune surveillance (Zhang2021Integrin).

## Interactions
ITGB7, an integrin subunit, participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in forming heterodimers with integrin alpha subunits. In RPMI 8866 cells, ITGB7 forms heterodimers with ITGA4 and ITGA9, facilitating cell adhesion to the ADAM2 protein. This interaction is crucial for the adhesion process, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in cell adhesion to ADAM2 following ITGB7 knockdown (Desiderio2010ADAM2).

ITGB7 also interacts with intracellular proteins through its cytoplasmic tail, which contains NPXY and NXXY motifs. These motifs are recognition sequences for proteins with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, such as tensin, Dok-1, and talin. The phosphorylation state of these motifs can influence the binding affinities of these proteins, affecting integrin activation and signaling (Holmes2011Comparative).

In the context of pancreatic cancer, ITGB7 is involved in integrin-dependent signaling pathways, interacting with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinase. These interactions are part of the ROS-related NRF2/ITGB7/FAK axis, which is implicated in cancer cell migration and invasion (Sun2020Oncogenic).
