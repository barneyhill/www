# ZFP37

## Overview
ZFP37 is a gene that encodes the ZFP37 zinc finger protein, a member of the C2H2 type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its 12 zinc finger domains and a KRAB domain, which are crucial for its role as a transcriptional regulator. The zinc finger domains facilitate DNA binding, while the KRAB domain is involved in transcriptional repression and protein-protein interactions. ZFP37 is predominantly expressed in neurons and testis, suggesting a specialized role in these tissues. The protein's structure, including a histone H1-like linker domain, underscores its function in gene regulation, with implications for understanding transcriptional control mechanisms in specific cellular contexts (Mazarakis1996Zfp37Is; Payen1998The).

## Structure
The ZFP37 protein is a member of the C2H2 type zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of 12 zinc finger domains located at the C-terminus. These zinc fingers are connected by a conserved linker of seven amino acids, a feature first described in the Drosophila transcription factor Kruppel (Mazarakis1996Zfp37Is). The protein also contains a KRAB domain at the N-terminus, which is divided into a highly conserved A region and a degenerate B region. The KRAB domain is associated with transcriptional repression and protein-protein interactions (Mazarakis1996Zfp37Is; Vanden1998Identification).

ZFP37 includes a histone H1-like linker domain between the KRAB and zinc finger regions, which binds double-stranded DNA. This domain is conserved between mouse and human ZFP37 and is responsible for its DNA binding properties (Payen1998The). The protein has multiple isoforms, with the major ones having a molecular mass of 67 kDa, containing a truncated KRAB-A and a complete KRAB-B region. A minor isoform is 62 kDa and lacks the truncated KRAB-A region (Payen1998The). The protein's structure allows it to function as a transcriptional regulator, predominantly in neurons and testis (Mazarakis1996Zfp37Is).
