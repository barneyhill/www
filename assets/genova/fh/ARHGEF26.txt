# ARHGEF26

## Overview
ARHGEF26 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 26, which is a critical regulator of the Rho family of GTPases. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the activation of Rho GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 26 is primarily involved in cellular processes such as angiogenesis, where it plays a pivotal role in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling by mediating the internalization and trafficking of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells (Zhu2021Endothelial). Additionally, ARHGEF26 is implicated in cellular responses to bacterial infections, particularly in facilitating the uptake of Salmonella through interactions with proteins involved in membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis (Bourgeois2021ARHGEF26). The gene's involvement in both cardiovascular and infectious disease pathways underscores its biological and clinical significance.

## Function
The ARHGEF26 gene encodes a protein known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 26, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by regulating the Rho family of GTPases. This protein facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, thereby activating them. In endothelial cells, ARHGEF26 is essential for promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, a key pathway in angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. It achieves this by facilitating the macropinocytosis of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a process dependent on RhoG expression, which is crucial for VEGF-induced angiogenesis (Zhu2021Endothelial).

ARHGEF26 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the internalization and trafficking of VEGFR2, which is necessary for delivering signaling complexes to downstream targets such as MAPK1/3 and Akt, critical for angiogenic responses (Zhu2021Endothelial). The gene's role in angiogenesis is further supported by its involvement in endothelial cell functions such as wound healing and capillary tube formation, as demonstrated by impaired angiogenic capacity upon ARHGEF26 knockdown (Zhu2021Endothelial). These processes are vital for maintaining vascular health and contribute to the organismal outcomes related to cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGEF26 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A notable variant, rs12493885 (p.Val29Leu), is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). This gain-of-function variant enhances protein stability and angiogenic activity, potentially contributing to CAD through altered VEGF signaling pathways (Zhu2021Endothelial). The ARHGEF26 gene is also linked to non-lipid vascular phenotypes, such as ischemic heart disease and unstable angina, suggesting its role in vascular morphogenesis and perfusion (Zhu2021Endothelial).

In the context of infectious diseases, ARHGEF26 influences susceptibility to Salmonella infections. Genetic variations, particularly the rs993387 SNP, are associated with increased susceptibility to Salmonella Typhi and Typhimurium invasion. This gene plays a role in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that facilitate bacterial uptake, affecting host-pathogen interactions (Bourgeois2021ARHGEF26). Additionally, ARHGEF26 is involved in inflammation during Salmonella infections, as its knockdown reduces IL-8 cytokine production, indicating its role in inflammatory responses (Bourgeois2021ARHGEF26). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both cardiovascular and infectious diseases, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ARHGEF26, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 26, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. The protein interacts with MAPK1/3, Metastasis Associated (MTA) isoforms, and RB Binding Protein (RBBP) isoforms, with these interactions being significantly stronger in the presence of the gain-of-function variant Val29Leu. These proteins are implicated in angiogenic processes, including VEGF signaling, Notch signaling, and endothelial cell survival and proliferation (Zhu2021Endothelial).

ARHGEF26 also plays a role in the internalization of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells, a process crucial for VEGF signaling and angiogenesis. This internalization is dependent on the interaction between ARHGEF26 and RhoG, highlighting the importance of these interactions in macropinocytosis (Zhu2021Endothelial).

In the context of Salmonella infection, ARHGEF26 interacts with proteins such as DLG1 and SCRIB, which are necessary for enhancing cell susceptibility to bacterial invasion. These interactions are crucial for membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis, processes that facilitate Salmonella uptake (Bourgeois2021ARHGEF26). The protein's interactions with these partners suggest its involvement in both pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory pathways.
