# EPHA6

## Overview
EPHA6 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A6, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is the largest subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EPH receptor A6 is a transmembrane protein involved in the Eph/ephrin signaling system, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and neural development (Kim2017EPHA6; Buchert1999The). This receptor is particularly significant in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility and blood pressure modulation, with implications for cardiovascular health (Kim2017EPHA6). Additionally, EPHA6 has been associated with developmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Murcia2020Breakpoint; Pergaris2022EPHA2). The protein's interactions, mediated through its SAM domain, are essential for its function and downstream signaling, with mutations potentially disrupting these interactions (Wang2018Specific).

## Function
EPHA6, a member of the Eph receptor family, is involved in several critical molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is part of the Eph/ephrin signaling system, which plays a significant role in blood vessel remodeling and stabilization by regulating endothelial cells. This system is crucial for angiogenesis and vascular permeability, often interacting with vascular endothelial growth factor (Kim2017EPHA6). EPHA6 is implicated in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contractility, which affects blood pressure modulation. Although the exact function of EPHA6 in VSMC contractility is not fully understood, it is suggested that EPHA6 may influence these processes through its effects on triglyceride levels and VSMC contraction (Kim2017EPHA6).

EPHA6 is also associated with blood pressure regulation and hypertension, particularly through its rs4857055 C > T polymorphism. Individuals with the TT genotype of this polymorphism exhibit higher systolic blood pressure compared to those with the CC genotype (Kim2017EPHA6). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism, as indicated by its association with triglyceride levels and LDL particle size, suggests a broader role in cardiovascular health (Kim2017EPHA6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EPHA6 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. Disruptions in EPHA6 are associated with developmental disorders, particularly in cases involving chromosomal rearrangements. In one study, a balanced chromosomal translocation disrupting EPHA6 was linked to developmental delay and anophthalmia in a patient, suggesting a role in retinal degeneration and neural development disorders (Murcia2020Breakpoint). The gene's involvement in retinal axon guidance and neural development supports its potential link to these phenotypes.

EPHA6 has also been studied in the context of hypertension. A specific polymorphism, rs4857055 C > T, was found to be associated with increased blood pressure and altered lipid profiles in a Korean population, indicating a possible role in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular risk (Kim2017EPHA6).

In cancer research, EPHA6 expression has been investigated in uveal melanomas. Although its exact role in oncogenesis is not fully understood, EPHA6 expression was associated with older age and the absence of retinal detachment in these tumors, suggesting a potential involvement in tumor progression (Pergaris2022EPHA2). Further research is needed to clarify its role in cancer and other diseases.

## Interactions
EPHA6, a member of the Eph receptor family, engages in specific interactions with other proteins through its SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) domain. The SAM domain of EPHA6 has been shown to specifically bind to the SAM domains of SHIP2 and Odin. This interaction is characterized by a unique End-Helix/Mid-Loop binding mode, where positively charged residues from the N-terminal end of the a5 helix of EPHA6 interact with negatively charged residues from the loop connecting a2-a4 in Odin, forming a tail-to-head SAM domain heterodimer (Wang2018Specific).

EPHA6 also interacts with the junction-associated protein AF-6 at specialized sites of cell-cell contact in the brain. The PDZ domain of AF-6 specifically recognizes the COOH-terminal ends of EPHA6 and other Eph receptors, facilitating their clustering at cell junctions. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells (Buchert1999The).

Mutations in the SAM domain of EPHA6 can disrupt these interactions, potentially affecting its binding capabilities and downstream signaling. For example, the R1014Q mutation in EPHA6 abolishes its binding to SHIP2, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining these interactions (Wang2018Specific).
