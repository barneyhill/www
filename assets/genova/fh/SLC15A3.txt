# SLC15A3

## Overview
SLC15A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 15 member 3, which is a transmembrane transporter primarily involved in the transport of histidine and certain dipeptides across lysosomal and endosomal membranes. This protein plays a significant role in cellular nutrient absorption and the regulation of immune responses, particularly in macrophages. It is predominantly expressed in the lung, spleen, and thymus, and its expression is modulated by Toll-like receptors, which are key components of the innate immune system. The upregulation of SLC15A3 through pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, and IRF3 underscores its involvement in inflammatory responses. The protein's function in immune regulation and its potential as a biomarker in diseases like acute myeloid leukemia highlight its clinical significance (Yu2020Weighted; Song2018Regulation).

## Function
SLC15A3, a member of the solute carrier family 15, functions as a peptide/histidine transporter primarily active in lysosomes and endosomes. It is responsible for transporting histidine, certain dipeptides, and peptidomimetics from the lysosome to the cytosol, playing a crucial role in cellular nutrient absorption and immune response regulation (Song2018Regulation). SLC15A3 is mainly expressed in the lung, spleen, and thymus, and its expression is upregulated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 in macrophages. This upregulation occurs through the activation of NF-κB, MAPK, and IRF3 signaling pathways, indicating its involvement in TLR-mediated inflammatory responses (Song2018Regulation).

In macrophages, SLC15A3 influences the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, upon TLR4 activation, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses (Song2018Regulation). The protein is targeted to endosomal and lysosomal membranes, mediated by a di-leucine-based motif, and is associated with the AP-3 adaptor protein complex, which may be important for maintaining the morphology and function of these organelles (Song2018Regulation). While its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression in the lymphatic system and involvement in transporting histidine and peptides suggest a potential role in normal cellular processes related to immune function and protein metabolism (Song2018Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
SLC15A3 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune response regulation and inflammation. Alterations in the expression of SLC15A3 have been associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is highly expressed in high-risk patients. This suggests that SLC15A3 expression levels could serve as a prognostic biomarker for AML, highlighting its potential clinical significance in the progression of this cancer (Yu2020Weighted). 

In the context of inflammatory diseases, SLC15A3 is involved in toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages. Its expression is upregulated by TLR ligands, and it plays a role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. This indicates that SLC15A3 could be a therapeutic target in conditions characterized by altered inflammatory cytokine production, such as bacterial peritonitis (Song2018Regulation).

Additionally, SLC15A3 has been identified as a hub gene in the immune response to West Nile Virus (WNV) infection, suggesting its involvement in viral resistance and control of infection (Tayubi2015Identification). These findings underscore the gene's potential impact on disease processes and therapeutic responses.
