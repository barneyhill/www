# NSG2

## Overview
NSG2, or neuronal vesicle trafficking associated 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in neurons. The NSG2 protein is primarily associated with the trafficking and surface expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), particularly the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits, at excitatory synapses. It is highly expressed during early neuronal development and is localized to postsynaptic densities and dendritic endosomes, where it modulates synaptic strength and plasticity. NSG2 is not a resident protein in endosomal trafficking but rather itinerant, moving towards degradation pathways, which is crucial for maintaining synaptic organization and function (Chander2019NeuronSpecific; Yap2017The). The protein's interactions with AMPARs are essential for its role in synaptic function, influencing both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (Chander2019NeuronSpecific; Zimmerman2024Knockout).

## Function
NSG2 (neuronal vesicle trafficking associated 2) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of excitatory neurotransmission in neurons. It is highly expressed during early neuronal development and is involved in the trafficking and surface expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), particularly the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits, at excitatory synapses (Chander2019NeuronSpecific). NSG2 is localized to postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and dendritic endosomes, where it interacts with AMPARs to modulate synaptic strength and plasticity (Chander2019NeuronSpecific).

The protein is involved in the regulation of AMPAR trafficking, influencing both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Overexpression of NSG2 increases mEPSC amplitude and GluA2 surface expression, while knockout of NSG2 reduces mEPSC frequency, indicating its role in AMPAR localization and synaptic function (Chander2019NeuronSpecific; Zimmerman2024Knockout). NSG2 is also implicated in endosomal trafficking, where it is not a resident protein but rather itinerant, moving towards degradation pathways (Yap2017The). This trafficking is crucial for maintaining synaptic organization and function, contributing to processes such as synaptogenesis and cognitive flexibility (Zimmerman2024Knockout).

## Interactions
NSG2 is known to interact with AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits GluA1 and GluA2, playing a significant role in modulating excitatory neurotransmission. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that NSG2 physically associates with these AMPAR subunits both in vitro and in vivo. In HEK293T cells, NSG2 was co-expressed with YFP-GluA1 or GFP-GluA2, and the use of an anti-mCherry antibody to pull down NSG2-mC also brought down the AMPAR subunits, confirming specific interactions. Control experiments with IgG antibodies showed no such interactions, underscoring the specificity of these associations (Chander2019NeuronSpecific).

In vivo experiments using whole-brain lysates from P0 mice further confirmed that immunoprecipitation of GluA1 or GluA2 also pulled down endogenous NSG2, indicating the interaction occurs in a physiological context (Chander2019NeuronSpecific). NSG2's interaction with AMPARs is crucial for its role in synaptic function, as it affects AMPAR currents by increasing the amplitude of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (Chander2019NeuronSpecific). These interactions suggest that NSG2 is involved in the trafficking and surface expression of AMPARs, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity (Chander2019NeuronSpecific).
