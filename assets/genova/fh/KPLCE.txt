# KPLCE

## Overview
The KPLCE gene encodes the KPRP N-terminal and LCE C-terminal like protein, which is a member of a family of proteins involved in cellular processes such as signal transduction and structural integrity. This protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, which include an N-terminal region similar to keratinocyte proline-rich protein (KPRP) and a C-terminal region resembling late cornified envelope (LCE) proteins. These domains suggest a role in skin barrier function and cellular differentiation. The KPRP N-terminal and LCE C-terminal like protein is implicated in various signaling pathways, potentially influencing cellular responses to environmental stimuli and contributing to the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
