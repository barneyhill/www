# ZC3H6

## Overview
ZC3H6 is a human gene that encodes the protein zinc finger CCCH-type containing 6, which is characterized by the presence of a CCCH-type zinc finger domain. This domain is typically associated with RNA binding and regulation, categorizing the protein as part of a family involved in RNA metabolism. The protein plays a crucial role in RNA processing pathways, interacting with other proteins to influence RNA fate and function. ZC3H6 is implicated in post-transcriptional gene regulation, potentially affecting cellular processes such as growth and differentiation. The gene is located on chromosome 2q13 and has been associated with clinical conditions, including 2q13 microdeletion syndrome, which underscores its significance in developmental and cellular homeostasis (Foucher2022Structural; Liang2008GenomeWide; Piro20212q13).

## Structure


## Function
ZC3H6 is a human gene encoding a protein that contains a CCCH-type zinc finger domain, which is typically involved in RNA binding and regulation. The protein is part of a subfamily that includes ZC3H4 and ZC3H8, suggesting they may have similar functions related to RNA metabolism and immune response regulation (Liang2008GenomeWide). ZC3H6 is involved in RNA processing pathways, interacting with proteins such as ARS2, which is important for RNA fate determination (Foucher2022Structural). The CCCH zinc finger proteins, including ZC3H6, are primarily involved in RNA metabolism and processing, as they mainly bind to RNA (Liang2008GenomeWide).

ZC3H6 is likely active in the nucleus or cytoplasm, where it interacts with RNA molecules to modulate their function. The protein's involvement in RNA processing suggests a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, influencing cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation. Although the specific role of ZC3H6 in these processes is not detailed, its association with RNA processing and regulation indicates its potential importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Foucher2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The ZC3H6 gene, located on chromosome 2q13, is implicated in a range of clinical conditions due to its involvement in the 2q13 microdeletion syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and congenital heart defects. The deletion of the region encompassing ZC3H6, along with other genes, contributes to the variable expressivity of the syndrome, which may include neurodevelopmental delays and congenital anomalies (Piro20212q13).

The clinical significance of ZC3H6 mutations or deletions is not fully understood, but it is suggested that defects in ZC3H6, in conjunction with other genes like ZC3H8, may predispose individuals to infections, such as otitis, in patients with 2q13 deletions (Piro20212q13). The variability in clinical presentation among individuals with 2q13 deletions may be due to differences in genetic background or additional genomic imbalances, supporting a 'two-hit' model where the deletion acts as a risk factor requiring additional factors to manifest the phenotype (Hladilkova2015A). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific role of ZC3H6 in these conditions.
