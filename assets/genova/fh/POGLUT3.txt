# POGLUT3

## Overview
POGLUT3, or protein O-glucosyltransferase 3, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically through the addition of O-glucose to serine residues within epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and plays a pivotal role in the proper folding and function of proteins, including those in the Notch receptor family and fibrillin proteins, which are crucial for cellular signaling and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix. The activity of POGLUT3 is essential for the regulation of Notch signaling, impacting cell-fate decisions and maintaining the stability of the extracellular matrix. The enzyme operates within the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring quality control of protein folding (Williamson2021POGLUT2; Mehboob2021Structure; Takeuchi2018Two).

## Function
POGLUT3 (protein O-glucosyltransferase 3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins by adding O-glucose to serine residues within epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. This modification is essential for the proper folding and function of these proteins, which include members of the Notch receptor family and fibrillin proteins (Williamson2021POGLUT2; Mehboob2021Structure).

In the context of Notch signaling, POGLUT3 modifies specific sites on the NOTCH1 receptor, such as serine 435 on the 11th EGF repeat, which is crucial for ligand interactions and receptor activation. This modification affects the cell-surface presentation and activation of NOTCH1 by its ligands, playing a significant role in regulating cell-fate decisions (Takeuchi2018Two).

POGLUT3 is also involved in the O-glucosylation of fibrillin-1 (FBN1), fibrillin-2 (FBN2), and latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1), which is important for their secretion and structural integrity. This process is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of the extracellular matrix (Williamson2021POGLUT2). POGLUT3 operates in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it ensures that only properly folded EGF repeats are modified, contributing to protein quality control (Mehboob2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the POGLUT3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Aberrant O-glucosylation by POGLUT3 is associated with various human diseases, although the precise mechanisms remain largely unknown. Impaired expression of POGLUT3 has been linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, Dowling-Degos disease 4, acute myeloid leukemia, and dysfunctions in hepatocytes and pancreatic cells (Mehboob2021Structure).

In the context of cancer, higher levels of POGLUT3 are associated with a lower risk of kidney cancer, as demonstrated by a study that identified therapeutic targets for cancer among circulating proteins. This association was replicated in a combined kidney cancer GWAS from UK Biobank and Finngen cohorts, suggesting a protective role of POGLUT3 in kidney cancer (SmithByrne2024Identifying).

Additionally, a de novo loss-of-function variant in the POGLUT3 gene has been identified in subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting an indirect association with the disorder. However, the study acknowledges limitations such as a small sample size and incomplete sensitivity, indicating the need for further research to establish direct links and understand the underlying mechanisms (Bar2024Reanalysis).

## Interactions
POGLUT3, a protein O-glucosyltransferase, is involved in the modification of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, particularly in the context of the Notch signaling pathway. It interacts with specific EGF repeats on proteins such as NOTCH1 and NOTCH3, adding O-glucose to serine residues, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the Notch signaling pathway (Wang2022Significant; Takeuchi2018Two). POGLUT3 shows a marked preference for NOTCH1 EGF11, suggesting a specific interaction with this EGF repeat (Takeuchi2018Two).

POGLUT3 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains a C-terminal KDEL-like ER retention signal, indicating its role in the quality control of EGF repeat folding. This localization suggests potential interactions with other proteins involved in the folding and modification of EGF repeats, such as POFUT1 and POGLUT1, which are known to participate in the folding of NOTCH1 EGF repeats (Takeuchi2018Two). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed in the available literature, and the enzyme's role is primarily inferred through its modification activity and localization (Williamson2021POGLUT2; Takeuchi2018Two).
