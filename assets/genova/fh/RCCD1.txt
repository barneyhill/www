# RCCD1

## Overview
RCCD1 (Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 Domain Containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in essential cellular processes, including chromatin organization, cell cycle regulation, and genomic stability. The protein, also referred to as RCC1 domain containing 1, is a chromatin-related protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity by interacting with key cellular components such as the tumor suppressor TP53 and the histone H3K36 demethylase KDM8 (JMJD5). These interactions are crucial for processes like spindle organization, chromosome segregation, and transcriptional silencing during mitosis, thereby preventing genomic instability and tumorigenesis (Plummer2020Transcriptome; Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated). Dysregulation of RCCD1 has been linked to cancer susceptibility, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Hoffman2017CiseQTLbased).

## Function
RCCD1 (RCC1 domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in crucial cellular processes such as chromatin organization, cell cycle regulation, and genomic stability. In healthy human cells, RCCD1 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair by interacting with the DNA-binding domain of TP53, a key tumor suppressor gene. This interaction is essential for spindle organization, chromosome segregation, and accurate mitotic division, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Plummer2020Transcriptome).

RCCD1 is a part of a complex with the histone H3K36 demethylase KDM8 (JMJD5), which is necessary for cell cycle progression. RCCD1 stimulates KDM8's enzymatic activity, which is otherwise autoinhibited, and this interaction is crucial for the demethylation of H3K36me2, a process important for chromosomal stability during cell division (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated). The RCCD1-KDM8 complex is enriched at centromeres and is involved in the transcriptional silencing of satellite repeats during the M phase, further contributing to chromosomal stability (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated).

RCCD1's function in healthy cells is vital for preventing genomic instability and tumorigenesis, as its dysregulation can lead to defects in mitotic spindle formation and organization (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RCCD1 gene have been implicated in breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. RCCD1 is located at the 15p26.1 locus and interacts with the TP53 gene, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair. Overexpression of RCCD1 has been observed in tumors, and its interaction with TP53 suggests a role in early-stage neoplastic development. Knockout studies in cells with TP53 mutations have shown decreased TP53 protein expression, indicating that RCCD1 may influence cancer progression by affecting TP53 activity (Plummer2020Transcriptome).

RCCD1 is also involved in DNA repair processes, interacting with RAD21, a gene essential for DNA double-strand break repair. This interaction is linked to poor prognosis in BRCA2-associated breast cancers (Plummer2020Transcriptome). Additionally, RCCD1's interaction with the histone H3K36 demethylase KDM8 is important for chromosomal stability during mitosis. Lower expression of RCCD1 could lead to errors in cell division, potentially increasing breast cancer risk (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated; Hoffman2017CiseQTLbased).

Genetic studies have identified SNPs associated with decreased RCCD1 expression, correlating with increased breast cancer risk. These findings suggest that RCCD1 mutations and expression alterations could have clinical significance in cancer development (Hoffman2017CiseQTLbased).

## Interactions
RCCD1 (RCC1 domain containing 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the histone H3K36 demethylase KDM8, forming a complex that is essential for cell cycle progression and chromatin-related processes. This interaction is mediated through their N-terminal regions, and RCCD1 stimulates the demethylase activity of KDM8, which is otherwise autoinhibited (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated). The KDM8/RCCD1 complex is necessary for the demethylation of H3K36 and transcriptional silencing of satellite repeats during the M phase of the cell cycle (Marcon2014HumanChromatinRelated).

RCCD1 also interacts with the DNA-binding domain of TP53, negatively regulating its activity, which is important for spindle organization and chromosome segregation (Plummer2020Transcriptome). This interaction suggests RCCD1's involvement in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair. Additionally, RCCD1 is associated with transcription factors such as RAD21, ESR1, and MYC, which are involved in cancer biology and development (Plummer2020Transcriptome). These interactions highlight RCCD1's role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability, particularly in the context of cancer susceptibility.
