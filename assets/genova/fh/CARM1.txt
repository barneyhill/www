# CARM1

## Overview
CARM1, or coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family, specifically classified as PRMT4. This enzyme is involved in the methylation of arginine residues on histone and non-histone proteins, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and various cellular processes. The CARM1 protein functions as a transcriptional coactivator, influencing chromatin structure and facilitating transcriptional activation through interactions with several transcription factors and coactivators. Its enzymatic activity is crucial for normal cellular functions, including T-cell development, adipocyte differentiation, and spermatogenesis. CARM1 is also implicated in cancer development and progression, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis in several cancer types, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Shishkova2017Global; Xie2024The; Naeem2007The).

## Structure
CARM1, also known as PRMT4, is a protein arginine methyltransferase with a complex molecular structure. It consists of three main domains: a catalytic core domain, an N-terminal domain, and a C-terminal domain. The catalytic core domain, spanning residues 150-470 in mouse CARM1, features a Rossmann fold and a β-barrel domain, which are common in methyltransferases and crucial for its enzymatic activity (TrofferCharlier2007Functional). The N-terminal domain includes a PH domain-like fold, characterized by a β-sandwich structure, which is important for protein-protein interactions (TrofferCharlier2007Functional). The C-terminal domain contains unique extensions that are essential for CARM1's methyltransferase activity, particularly towards histone H3 Arg17 (Yue2007Insights).

CARM1 forms a head-to-tail dimeric arrangement, which is necessary for its methyltransferase function. This dimerization involves interactions between the dimerization arm and the Rossmann fold helices, forming a ring-shaped dimer with a central cavity for substrate and cofactor access (Yue2007Insights; TrofferCharlier2007Functional). The protein undergoes conformational changes upon cofactor binding, which are crucial for its activity (TrofferCharlier2007Functional). CARM1 also has splice variant isoforms that can affect its function and localization.

## Function
CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the methylation of arginine residues on both histone and non-histone proteins, influencing gene expression and various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CARM1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, modulating chromatin structure and facilitating transcriptional activation. It interacts with transcription factors such as p53, estrogen receptor, and E2F1, thereby modulating gene expression (Shishkova2017Global).

CARM1 is involved in the regulation of transcriptional activity by methylating coactivators like p/CIP/SRC-3, which affects their stability and turnover. This methylation is crucial for the stability and degradation of p/CIP, influencing transcriptional complex assembly and activity (Naeem2007The). CARM1 also plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the transition from meiosis to the formation of mature sperm cells, by regulating the transcriptional activity of CREM in haploid germ cells (Bao2018The).

CARM1's enzymatic activity is essential for normal cellular functions, including T-cell development and adipocyte differentiation. Its role in methylating specific substrates, such as those with proline-rich motifs, highlights its importance in cellular physiology and potential implications in cancer therapy (Shishkova2017Global).

## Clinical Significance
CARM1 (coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1) plays a significant role in cancer development and progression due to its involvement in gene expression regulation through arginine methylation. Overexpression of CARM1 is observed in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, liver, and lung cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis in several types, such as adrenocortical carcinoma, bladder cancer, and skin cutaneous melanoma (Qiu2022Systematic; Xie2024The). In breast cancer, CARM1 overexpression correlates with high tumor grade, negative estrogen receptor status, and increased HER2 expression, particularly in HER2, luminal B, and triple-negative subtypes (Cheng2013Overexpression).

CARM1's role extends to influencing therapeutic resistance. Its phosphorylation is linked to tamoxifen resistance in breast tumors, and its methylation of MED12 is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (Xie2024The). CARM1 also affects the tumor immune microenvironment, with its expression correlating with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, impacting immunotherapy responses (Qiu2022Systematic).

In some contexts, CARM1 may have tumor-suppressive roles, as seen in liver cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its low expression suggests that activation might be beneficial (Xie2024The). These findings highlight CARM1 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for cancer treatment strategies.

## Interactions
CARM1, also known as PRMT4, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional coactivator. It interacts with the transcriptional coactivator p/CIP and the protein CARM1 itself, forming a complex on target genes in the context of chromatin, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (Naeem2007The). CARM1 also interacts with GRIP1 and TIF1α, forming a ternary complex that enhances nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. TIF1α acts as a bridge between GRIP1 and CARM1, facilitating their synergistic coactivator activity (Teyssier2006Transcriptional).

CARM1 is part of large multiprotein complexes, as seen in its interaction with the p160 family of coactivators, which aids in chromatin remodeling and gene activation (TrofferCharlier2007Functional). It also interacts with various RNA molecules, including long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, which influence its stability and activity in cancer cells (Suresh2021CARM1PRMT4:). The N-terminal EVH1 domain of CARM1 is crucial for substrate recognition and methylation, highlighting its role in protein-protein interactions (Shishkova2017Global). These interactions underscore CARM1's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.
