The protein plays a role in cellular antiviral response and innate immune signaling. Antiviral effects result from inhibition of viral RNA replication, interference in the secretory pathway, binding to viral proteins and dysregulation of cellular lipid metabolism. The protein has been found to inhibit both DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Zika virus.
