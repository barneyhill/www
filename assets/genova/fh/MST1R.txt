# MST1R

## Overview
The MST1R gene encodes the macrophage stimulating 1 receptor, commonly referred to as the RON receptor tyrosine kinase. This receptor is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and migration. Structurally, the RON receptor comprises an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Angeloni2000Gene). The receptor is activated upon binding with its ligand, macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), leading to the initiation of downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for cellular responses (Yao2013MSP–RON). MST1R is implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where its altered expression and mutations contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Catenacci2011RON(MST1R)). As a result, MST1R and its encoded protein, RON, are considered potential targets for therapeutic intervention in oncology (Wang2024MST1Rtargeted).

## Structure
The MST1R gene encodes the RON receptor tyrosine kinase, a protein involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of RON includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain (Angeloni2000Gene). The extracellular region is composed of a semaphorin (Sema) domain, a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, and four immunoglobulin-plexin-transcription (IPT) domains (Chao2014Structural; Chao2012Crystal).

The secondary structure of the Sema domain features a seven-bladed β-propeller fold, which is crucial for ligand binding (Chao2012Crystal). The PSI domain contains a cysteine-knot motif, characterized by four disulfide linkages, which acts as a hinge for receptor-ligand interactions (Chao2012Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, RON can form homodimers, which are important for its activation and function. This dimerization can occur in a ligand-independent manner, particularly in cancer cells (Chao2012Crystal). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its activity and stability (Zarei2016Strategies).

RON also has splice variants, such as ROND160 and ROND85, which can alter its functional properties and are implicated in cancer progression (Chao2012Crystal).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MST1R gene, also known as RON, is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEC), MST1R is overexpressed in 74% of cases, correlating with poor survival outcomes. Co-expression with MET is linked to the worst survival rates, and high MST1R gene copy number is associated with poor prognosis (Catenacci2011RON(MST1R)is page 0 of 12). A specific mutation, R1018G, found in the juxtamembrane domain, is present in 11% of GEC samples and may contribute to tumor progression (Catenacci2011RON(MST1R)is page 9 of 12).

In pancreatic cancer, MST1R overexpression accelerates disease progression, leading to increased infiltration of immune cells and rapid transition from low-grade to high-grade lesions, resulting in reduced survival. Conversely, loss of MST1R function delays disease progression and improves survival (Babicky2019MST1R).

MST1R is also upregulated in gallbladder cancer, where targeting it with the inhibitor MGCD-265 shows significant anti-cancer effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2024MST1Rtargeted).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, MST1R is identified as a genetic susceptibility gene, with rare deleterious variants more common in cases than controls. These variants are associated with early-onset disease and aggressive cancer phenotypes (Dai2016Wholeexome).

## Interactions
The MST1R gene encodes the RON receptor tyrosine kinase, which participates in various protein interactions crucial for its role in cellular signaling. MST1R interacts with macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), which binds to the receptor's high-affinity site in the β-chain and a low-affinity site in the α-chain, leading to receptor activation and downstream signaling (Yao2013MSP–RON). MST1R forms complexes with other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, MET, PDGFR, and IGF1R, facilitating crosstalk that can enhance tumorigenic activity (Yao2013MSP–RON). 

MST1R also interacts with adaptor proteins like GRB2 and SOS, which are recruited upon receptor activation to stimulate the RAS-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways, essential for cell growth and survival (Yao2013MSP–RON). The receptor is part of a complex with syndecans and integrins, such as α3β1 and α6β4, which is crucial for carcinoma S-phase progression by preventing p38MAPK activation (Beauvais2018MST1RRON). MST1R's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is necessary for keratinocyte migration, facilitated by phosphorylation at the S1394 site by Akt (Santoro2003The). These interactions highlight MST1R's role in regulating cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
