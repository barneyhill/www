# GP1BA

## Overview
The GP1BA gene encodes the glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit alpha (GPIbα), a critical component of the GPIb-IX-V receptor complex on the surface of platelets. This transmembrane protein plays a pivotal role in hemostasis by mediating platelet adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, particularly under high shear conditions, through its interaction with the von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Chang2018Identification; Huizinga2002Structures). The GPIbα protein is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is essential for its binding to VWF, and a heavily glycosylated extracellular region that contributes to its structural integrity and function (López2017The; Dumas2004Crystal). Mutations in the GP1BA gene can lead to bleeding disorders such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in platelet function and blood clotting (Minkov2021Novel; Afrasiabi2007Genetic).

## Structure
The GP1BA gene encodes the glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), a key component of the platelet GPIb-IX-V receptor complex. GPIbα is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1 domain. This domain consists of eight short LRRs flanked by conserved sequences, forming an elongated, curved structure typical of LRR proteins (Huizinga2002Structures; Dumas2004Crystal). The N-terminal region of GPIbα features a β-hairpin, known as the β-finger, which protrudes from the protein surface, while the C-terminal region includes a nine-residue α-helix and several 3_10 helices stabilized by disulfide bonds (Huizinga2002Structures).

GPIbα is polymorphic, with four isoforms (A, B, C, and D) differing in the repetition of a 13-amino acid sequence. The D isoform, commonly referenced, contains 610 amino acids and includes an N-terminal extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (López2017The). The extracellular region is heavily glycosylated, contributing to the protein's molecular mass, and contains a mechanosensitive domain that unfolds under tensile force, facilitating signal transmission (Zhang2015Identification; López2017The). The cytoplasmic domain, unique among proteins, lacks typical kinase domains but contains phosphorylation sites and binding sites for adaptor proteins (López2017The).

## Function
The GP1BA gene encodes the glycoprotein Ib platelet α subunit, which is a critical component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the surface of platelets. This complex plays a vital role in platelet adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, a key step in the formation of a hemostatic plug during blood clotting. The GPIb-IX-V complex functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF), facilitating the binding of platelets to sites of vascular injury (Chang2018Identification; Skalníková2022A).

The interaction between GPIbα and VWF is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat domain of the GPIbα protein, which is essential for platelet adhesion under high shear conditions (Skalníková2022A). This binding initiates platelet activation and aggregation, processes crucial for primary hemostasis and the prevention of excessive bleeding (Curtis2013Human).

In healthy human cells, the GPIb-IX-V complex is active in the plasma membrane of platelets, where it ensures proper platelet function and hemostasis. Deficiencies or mutations in the GP1BA gene can disrupt this process, leading to bleeding disorders such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome (Minkov2021Novel; Afrasiabi2007Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GP1BA gene are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. BSS results from defects in the glycoprotein GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet surface, which is crucial for platelet adhesion and activation. Mutations in GP1BA can lead to decreased expression or loss of function of this complex, resulting in clinical manifestations such as easy bruising, nosebleeds, mucocutaneous bleeding, and sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding (Minkov2021Novel; Özdemir2020A).

Specific mutations in GP1BA, such as the p.C33Y and p.C33R variants, have been linked to monoallelic BSS, which is characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytopenia. These mutations disrupt the structure of the GPIbα protein, affecting its stability and function (Skalníková2022A). Another mutation, Ala156Val, is associated with the Bernard-Soulier syndrome type Bolzano variant, leading to a dysfunctional GPIb-IX-V complex that cannot effectively bind von Willebrand factor, crucial for platelet adhesion (Ware1993Point).

Alterations in GP1BA expression or interactions may also contribute to thrombotic conditions, as the GPIb-IX-V complex plays a role in thrombosis and hemostasis (Skalníková2022A).

## Interactions
GP1BA, or glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit alpha, is a critical component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on platelets, which plays a significant role in platelet adhesion and aggregation. This protein interacts with von Willebrand factor (vWF), facilitating platelet adhesion to sites of vascular injury, a key step in thrombus formation (Xu2021Antiplatelet). GP1BA also interacts with thrombin, contributing to platelet activation and aggregation processes (Xu2021Antiplatelet).

The interaction of GP1BA with ginsenoside Rg1, a compound from Panax notoginseng triol saponins (PTS), has been studied using surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking techniques. Ginsenoside Rg1 binds to the N-terminal amino acid residues of GP1BA, forming a stable structure through ten hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. This binding potentially inhibits GP1BA's interaction with vWF and thrombin by occupying the amino N-terminal of GP1BA, thereby reducing platelet adhesion and aggregation (Xu2021Antiplatelet).

In the context of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, mutations in GP1BA can lead to defective expression or assembly of the GPIb-IX complex, affecting its interaction with vWF and resulting in a bleeding tendency (Minkov2021Novel).
