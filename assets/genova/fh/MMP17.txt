# MMP17

## Overview
MMP17, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 17 or MT4-MMP, is a gene that encodes a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, specifically categorized as a membrane-bound metalloproteinase. The protein product of MMP17 is characterized by its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring, which distinguishes it from other membrane-type MMPs that typically possess a transmembrane domain (Itoh1999Membrane). This GPI-anchored enzyme is primarily expressed on the surface of smooth muscle cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the intestinal epithelium, particularly by modulating the intestinal stem cell niche and facilitating epithelial repair (MartínAlonso2021Smooth). MMP17 is involved in various physiological processes, including tissue repair and cellular communication, and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (MartínAlonso2015Deficiency; MuñozSáez2023Molecular).

## Structure
MMP17, also known as MT4-MMP, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family characterized by its unique structural features. The protein consists of 578 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 64.3 kDa (English2000Membrane). Its primary structure includes a signal sequence, a prodomain with a cysteine residue, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding consensus sequence, and a hemopexin-like domain (English2000Membrane). Notably, MMP17 contains a 9-residue insertion between the propeptide and catalytic domain, a feature common among membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (English2000Membrane).

MMP17 is distinct from other MT-MMPs due to its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring, which is indicated by its C-terminal sequence. This GPI anchoring differentiates it from other MT-MMPs that have a transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic tail (Itoh1999Membrane). The C-terminal region is rich in hydrophobic residues and is shorter than those in other MT-MMPs, lacking a putative cytoplasmic tail (English2000Membrane). The protein is expressed on the cell surface and can be shed by an endogenous metalloproteinase, suggesting a unique biological function (Itoh1999Membrane). MMP17 does not activate pro-MMP2, unlike MT1-MMP, indicating a distinct functional role (English2000Membrane).

## Function
MMP17, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 17, is a membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the intestinal epithelium. It is specifically expressed by smooth muscle cells in the intestine and is crucial for maintaining intestinal stem cell (ISC) stemness during homeostasis. MMP17 supports the regenerative capacity of the intestinal epithelium by modulating the intestinal stem cell niche and facilitating repair mechanisms after damage, such as inflammation or irradiation-induced injury (MartínAlonso2021Smooth).

MMP17 is involved in the cleavage of matricellular proteins like PERIOSTIN, which activates signaling pathways such as AKT and YAP, essential for epithelial repair and reprogramming towards a reparative state. This activity is particularly important for the formation of de novo crypts, which are necessary for effective epithelial repair (MartínAlonso2021Smooth). The enzyme is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which allows it to modulate cellular functions at the cell periphery, influencing processes like cellular migration and communication (Itoh1999Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MMP17 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cardiovascular and cancer-related diseases. In cardiovascular health, MMP17 deficiency is linked to the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA). Mice lacking MMP17 exhibit vascular abnormalities, including altered vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) orientation and increased extracellular matrix deposits, which predispose them to aortic aneurysms (MartínAlonso2015Deficiency). A specific missense mutation, R373H, in the MMP17 gene has been identified in patients with inherited thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissections (TAAD), suggesting a genetic predisposition to these conditions (MartínAlonso2015Deficiency).

In cancer, MMP17 is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Overexpression of MMP17 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, correlating with shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival (Yu2021Comprehensive). MMP17 also plays a role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, particularly in breast and gastric cancers, by promoting tumor cell migration and invasion (MuñozSáez2023Molecular). Its involvement in the tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis further underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (MuñozSáez2023Molecular).

## Interactions
MMP17, also known as MT4-MMP, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is anchored to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) motif and co-localizes with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in lipid rafts, suggesting potential cooperation in cell adhesion and migration (Itoh1999Membrane). MMP17 interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), with TIMP-1 being the most effective inhibitor, regulating its proteolytic activity (MuñozSáez2023Molecular).

MMP17 is known to cleave several substrates, including periostin (POSTN) and osteopontin (Opn), which are involved in tissue repair and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function, respectively (MartínAlonso2015Deficiency; MartínAlonso2021Smooth). The cleavage of POSTN by MMP17 is crucial for epithelial repair in the intestine, potentially activating YAP signaling (MartínAlonso2021Smooth). In the context of cancer, MMP17 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing its activation and promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (MuñozSáez2023Molecular). These interactions highlight MMP17's role in both physiological and pathological processes, including tissue regeneration and cancer progression.
