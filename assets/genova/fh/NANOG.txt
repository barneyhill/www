# NANOG

## Overview
NANOG is a gene that encodes the Nanog homeobox protein, a pivotal transcription factor involved in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. The Nanog protein is characterized by a homeodomain, which is a conserved DNA-binding motif, and it functions as part of a complex regulatory network with other key pluripotency factors such as OCT4 and SOX2. This network is essential for sustaining the undifferentiated state of stem cells by promoting the expression of genes that support self-renewal while repressing differentiation pathways (Chambers2003Functional; Das2011Alternative). NANOG's role extends beyond embryonic development, as its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Alemohammad2020Signaling). The protein's ability to interact with other transcription factors and signaling pathways underscores its significance in both normal stem cell biology and pathological conditions (Suzuki2006Nanog; Wang2008Requirement).

## Structure
The NANOG protein is a transcription factor essential for maintaining pluripotency in stem cells. Its primary structure consists of 305 amino acids, including a homeodomain similar to those in the NK-2 family, although the rest of the protein shows no homology to known proteins (PAN2003Identification). The homeodomain, spanning residues 96-155, is a conserved DNA-binding motif characterized by three α-helices, with helix α3 crucial for DNA interaction (Jauch2008Crystal). 

The secondary structure of the NANOG homeodomain includes these α-helices, which form a canonical HD-type fold. The longest helix, α3, inserts into the major groove of DNA, facilitating DNA recognition (Jauch2008Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the NANOG homeodomain maintains a rigid helical core, which does not undergo significant structural changes upon DNA binding. The N-terminal arm becomes ordered upon binding to DNA's minor groove (Jauch2008Crystal).

The quaternary structure of NANOG involves dimerization, which is mediated through a tryptophan repeat (WR) region, essential for its function (Mullin2008The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate NANOG's activity, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The NANOG gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. NANOG functions by forming a regulatory network with other core pluripotency factors such as OCT4 and SOX2, which collectively govern the expression of genes that promote self-renewal while repressing those that drive differentiation (Das2011Alternative). NANOG is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with these factors to sustain the undifferentiated state of ES cells (Chambers2003Functional).

NANOG's activity is essential for the maintenance of the inner cell mass in embryos and is involved in early embryonic development. It acts independently of the LIF receptor/gp130/stat3 signaling pathway, which is typically involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of stem cells (Hart2004Identification). NANOG expression is dynamic and can fluctuate, with high expression levels correlating with a reduced propensity for differentiation, while low expression levels are associated with a higher tendency to differentiate (Kalmar2009Regulated).

Alternative splicing of the NANOG gene results in different protein variants, which have varying capacities to maintain the undifferentiated state of ES cells. These variants can form heterodimers and interact with other pluripotency transcription factors, influencing the preservation of self-renewal and pluripotency (Das2011Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NANOG gene are significantly associated with various cancers, contributing to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Overexpression of NANOG is observed in several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, gastric, brain, and ovarian cancers, and is linked to cancer stem cell resistance to treatment and poor survival rates (Alemohammad2020Signaling). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, NANOG expression is inversely correlated with E-cadherin and positively correlated with N-cadherin, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (GawlikRzemieniewska2015The). In ovarian cancer, NANOG overexpression is associated with excessive proliferation and migration, while its knockdown reduces metastatic potential (GawlikRzemieniewska2015The).

NANOG is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, where its knockdown can induce apoptosis in cancer cells by upregulating tumor suppressor genes like Trp53 (Najafzadeh2020The). The gene's involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasion is significant, as it enhances metastasis through various signaling pathways, including the Nanog/Tcl1a/Akt axis (Najafzadeh2020The). Additionally, NANOG's interaction with signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT and Hedgehog contributes to its role in maintaining cancer stem cell properties and promoting tumor progression (Wu2013Targeting; Alemohammad2020Signaling). These findings highlight NANOG's potential as a target for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
NANOG, a transcription factor crucial for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a cooperative interaction with the SOX2 protein, which influences the orientation and dynamics of NANOG when bound to DNA, thereby affecting the induction of downstream genes. This interaction is enhanced by a specific mutation (L103E) in NANOG, which introduces electrostatic interactions with DNA, increasing the DNA binding affinity and stability of the NANOG-SOX2 complex (Yesudhas2019Structural).

NANOG also interacts with Sall4 in embryonic stem cells. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and both proteins co-occupy enhancer regions of their respective genes, suggesting a collaborative role in transcription regulation (Wu2006Sall4).

Additionally, NANOG binds to Smad1, a signal transducer in the TGF-β signaling pathway, to block bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells. This interaction prevents the recruitment of coactivators to active Smad transcriptional complexes, thereby inhibiting transcriptional activation of downstream targets (Suzuki2006Nanog).

NANOG's dimerization is crucial for its interaction with other pluripotency factors, including Sall4, Zfp281, and Oct4. This dimerization is mediated by its C-terminal domain and is essential for forming NANOG-containing complexes within the pluripotency network (Wang2008Requirement).
