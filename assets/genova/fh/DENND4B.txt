# DENND4B

## Overview
DENND4B is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 4B, which is part of the DENN domain family known for its role in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically for Rab GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating vesicle transport and membrane dynamics (Marat2011DENN). These processes are critical for cellular activities such as endocytosis and exocytosis, thereby influencing cellular communication and homeostasis. While the broader DENND4 family has been implicated in various cellular functions, the precise role of DENND4B in human cells remains to be fully characterized (Marat2011DENN). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, suggesting its involvement in vesicular trafficking pathways and cellular compartmental communication. Further research is necessary to delineate its specific contributions to cellular physiology.

## Function
DENND4B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The protein contains a DENN domain, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, crucial regulators of vesicle transport and membrane dynamics (Marat2011DENN). These processes are essential for cellular activities such as endocytosis and exocytosis, impacting cellular communication and homeostasis.

The DENND4 family, which includes DENND4B, is known for its role in regulating Rab GTPases, although specific details about DENND4B's function in healthy human cells remain unclear (Marat2011DENN). The DENND4A protein, a member of the same family, has been studied for its GEF activity toward Rab10, which is involved in basolateral trafficking in polarized cells and Glut4 recycling in adipocytes. However, the specific role of DENND4B in these or other processes has not been explicitly detailed (Marat2011DENN).

DENND4B's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it regulates vesicular trafficking pathways. This localization suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating communication between cellular compartments, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its specific functions in human cells.
