# DNASE2

## Overview
The DNASE2 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme deoxyribonuclease 2, which is crucial for DNA degradation within cells. This enzyme, categorized as an endonuclease, plays a significant role in the clearance of nucleic acids during apoptosis and the phagocytosis of erythroblast nuclei, thereby preventing the accumulation of self-derived nucleic acids that could trigger immune responses (Rodero2017Type; Evans2003DNase). The DNASE2 protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and undergoes essential post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which are vital for its enzymatic activity and lysosomal targeting (MacLEA2003Structural). Functioning optimally at acidic pH levels, DNASE2 operates independently of divalent cations, aligning with its lysosomal localization (Evans2003DNase). Mutations in the DNASE2 gene can lead to autoinflammatory conditions due to the chronic activation of type I interferon signaling, underscoring its importance in immune regulation (Rodero2017Type).

## Structure
The human DNASE2 gene encodes a lysosomal enzyme involved in DNA degradation. The protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (MacLEA2003Structural; Evans2003DNase). DNASE2 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide at the amino terminus, which is essential for proper glycosylation and targeting to the lysosome (MacLEA2003Structural). The protein structure includes several conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, critical for maintaining its active conformation (MacLEA2003Structural).

The enzyme's primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that includes a catalytic domain, which is highly conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Evans2003DNase). The secondary structure likely involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is maintained by disulfide linkages, which are essential for the enzyme's stability and activity (MacLEA2003Structural). DNASE2 functions as a monomer in vivo, and its activity is dependent on the correct folding and post-translational modifications (MacLEA2003Structural).

## Function
DNASE2, or deoxyribonuclease 2, is a lysosomal enzyme that plays a crucial role in the degradation of DNA within cells. It is primarily involved in the clearance of nucleic acids generated through apoptosis and the phagocytosis of maturating erythroblast nuclei. This process is essential for preventing the accumulation of self-derived nucleic acids that could otherwise trigger inappropriate immune responses (Rodero2017Type). DNASE2 functions optimally at acidic pH levels, which aligns with its lysosomal localization, and it operates independently of divalent cations (Evans2003DNase).

In healthy human cells, DNASE2 is responsible for digesting the DNA of apoptotic cells and the nuclei expelled from erythroid precursors during erythropoiesis. This activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the activation of cytosolic DNA signaling pathways, which can lead to inflammatory responses (Rodero2017Type). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of erythropoiesis and the prevention of excessive inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the severe anemia and developmental defects observed in DNASE2-deficient mice (Evans2003DNase). DNASE2's role in degrading DNA is also important for preventing the chronic activation of type I interferon signaling, which can result in autoinflammatory conditions (Rodero2017Type).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNASE2 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions characterized by type I interferon-mediated autoinflammation. Biallelic mutations in DNASE2 can lead to a deficiency in DNase II activity, resulting in the accumulation of undigested DNA in macrophage lysosomes. This triggers chronic activation of type I interferon production, contributing to a multisystem autoinflammatory syndrome. Clinical manifestations include severe neonatal anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, cholestatic hepatitis, recurrent fevers, proteinuria, deforming arthropathy, and vasculitic skin lesions (Rodero2017Type).

In mouse models, DNase II deficiency results in severe anemia and chronic polyarthritis, with the latter being alleviated by crossing with mice defective in STING or cGAS, indicating the involvement of TLR-independent cytosolic DNA signaling pathways (Rodero2017Type). In humans, DNase II deficiency is linked to life-threatening anemia and thrombocytopenia in the neonatal period, which may resolve spontaneously, but can also lead to recurrent febrile episodes and other systemic symptoms (Rodero2017Type).

Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNASE2 have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting the gene's role in immune regulation (Fujihara2016Functional).

## Interactions
DNASE2, or deoxyribonuclease 2, is a lysosomal endonuclease involved in the degradation of DNA. It primarily interacts with nucleic acids by cleaving DNA into smaller fragments, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including apoptosis and DNA sensing by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) (Chan2015DNase). DNASE2 is recruited into lysosomes upon stimulation by CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotides, where it cleaves DNA to facilitate TLR9 activation. This interaction suggests a physical association with DNA substrates, particularly in the context of immune responses (Chan2015DNase).

DNASE2 also plays a role in the degradation of DNA within phagolysosomes after phagocytosis, working in conjunction with lysosomal proteases that degrade DNA-associated proteins, allowing DNASE2 to access and digest the DNA (Evans2003DNase). In the context of apoptosis, DNASE2 collaborates with caspase-activated DNase (CAD) to fragment DNA, highlighting its involvement in multiprotein complexes that facilitate DNA degradation during programmed cell death (Evans2003DNase).

Mutations in DNASE2 can lead to the accumulation of undigested DNA, resulting in chronic activation of type I interferon signaling pathways, which underscores its critical role in preventing the misrepresentation of self-nucleic acids as non-self (Rodero2017Type).
