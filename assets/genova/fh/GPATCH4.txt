# GPATCH4

## Overview
GPATCH4 is a gene that encodes the protein G-patch domain containing 4, which is characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function, facilitating interactions with RNA helicases such as DHX15, thereby enhancing their ATPase activity and playing a crucial role in RNA processing (HirawakeMogi2021Gpatch; Kanwal2024Analysis). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleolus and is involved in ribosome biogenesis, a vital process for protein synthesis in human cells (Memet2024Insights). GPATCH4 is intrinsically disordered, allowing it to serve as a hub for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation and interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, including components of the snoRNP machinery (Kanwal2024Analysis). Despite lacking a canonical RNA-binding domain, it crosslinks to RNA, suggesting a role in pre-rRNA sorting and ribosome assembly (Kanwal2024Analysis). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in the regulation of gene expression and RNA maturation, contributing to cellular function and growth.

## Structure
GPATCH4 is a protein characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain, which is approximately 48 amino acids long and rich in glycine, located in its N-terminal region (HirawakeMogi2021Gpatch). This domain is crucial for its interaction with the RNA helicase DHX15, enhancing its ATPase activity and facilitating RNA processing (Kanwal2024Analysis). The G-patch domain interacts with the winged-helix and RecA2 domains of RNA helicases, optimizing them for catalysis (Kanwal2024Analysis).

GPATCH4 also contains a central coiled-coil (CC) domain, which is involved in interactions independent of the G-patch domain, such as with NOLC1, a nucleolar and Cajal body chaperone (Kanwal2024Analysis). The protein is highly intrinsically disordered, which is common among nucleolar proteins that facilitate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the nucleolus (Kanwal2024Analysis).

Despite lacking a canonical RNA-binding domain, GPATCH4 crosslinks to RNA via cysteine and histidine residues in its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), suggesting a role in pre-rRNA sorting and ribosome assembly (Kanwal2024Analysis). The protein's IDRs provide conformational flexibility, allowing it to serve as a hub for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation (Kanwal2024Analysis).

## Function
GPATCH4 is a protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing within healthy human cells. It is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it is involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis. The protein is strongly enriched in nucleoli, indicating its potential role in ribosome production, similar to its yeast homologs (Memet2024Insights). GPATCH4 is identified as a component of pre-ribosomes and is localized to sites of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) processing and maturation (Rathje2024Analysis).

GPATCH4 interacts with the RNA helicase DHX15, suggesting it may regulate helicase activity, which is crucial for RNA remodeling and processing (Memet2024Insights). Although knockdown of GPATCH4 does not significantly affect pre-rRNA processing, it negatively impacts nucleolar components and cell growth, indicating its role in maintaining nucleolar structure and supporting cell proliferation (Rathje2024Analysis).

The protein's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in the regulation of gene expression and RNA maturation, contributing to the overall cellular function and growth in healthy human cells.

## Interactions
GPATCH4 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and modification. It forms a stable interaction with NOLC1, which is resistant to RNase treatment, indicating a protein-protein interaction independent of RNA (Kanwal2024Analysis). GPATCH4 also interacts with the RNA helicase DHX15 through its G-patch domain, which is crucial for stimulating DHX15's ATPase activity. This interaction is essential for efficient 2'-O-methylation of rRNA and snRNA (Kanwal2024Analysis).

GPATCH4 associates with components of the snoRNP machinery, including Fibrillarin and Dyskerin, although these interactions are RNA-mediated and disrupted by RNase treatment (Kanwal2024Analysis). It binds to snoRNAs, particularly those from the box C/D subfamily, and is involved in guiding rRNA modifications (Kanwal2024Analysis). Despite lacking a canonical RNA binding domain, GPATCH4 crosslinks to RNA via specific cysteine and histidine residues in its intrinsically disordered regions, suggesting a role in ribonucleoprotein complex formation (Kanwal2024Analysis). These interactions highlight GPATCH4's multifaceted role in RNA processing and modification.
