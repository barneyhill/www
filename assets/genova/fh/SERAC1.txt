# SERAC1

## Overview
The SERAC1 gene encodes the serine active site-containing protein 1, a critical component in mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking. This protein is categorized as a serine-lipase/esterase and is primarily involved in phospholipid remodeling, particularly at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM). The SERAC1 protein plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis by facilitating lipid transfer and remodeling, which are essential for mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy production. Mutations in the SERAC1 gene can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including MEGDEL syndrome and juvenile-onset complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, due to disrupted mitochondrial function and altered lipid metabolism (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated; Alagoz2020A; Yan2022Complicated).

## Structure
The SERAC1 protein is involved in phospholipid remodeling and mitochondrial function. It contains a serine-lipase domain, which is crucial for its role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and phosphatidylglycerol remodeling (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated; Alagoz2020A). This domain is located at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), where it participates in lipid transfer and mitochondrial dynamics (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated).

The secondary structure of SERAC1 includes alpha-rod repeats, which are structural domains composed of stacked pairs of anti-parallel alpha-helices. These repeats are flexible and facilitate protein interactions (Palidwor2009Detection). The presence of alpha-rod repeats in SERAC1 was confirmed through a manually tuned iterative PSIBLAST sequence search, highlighting its potential role in protein interactions (Palidwor2009Detection).

Mutations in the SERAC1 gene, such as the c.1015G>C (p.Gly339Arg) variant, can lead to changes in the protein's conformation and binding sites, impairing protein-protein interactions and affecting its function (Alagoz2020A). These mutations are associated with severe manifestations of MEGDEL syndrome, a condition linked to mitochondrial dysfunction (Alagoz2020A).

## Function
The SERAC1 gene encodes the serine active site-containing protein 1, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking. This protein is involved in phosphatidylglycerol remodeling, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. It contains a C-terminal serine-lipase/esterase domain with a consensus lipase motif located at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), which is vital for lipid remodeling and maintaining mitochondrial and cholesterol homeostasis (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated).

In healthy cells, SERAC1 is active in both the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to cellular energy production and membrane dynamics. Its role in phospholipid remodeling is critical for the integrity of mitochondrial membranes and the regulation of cholesterol and phosphatidylglycerol metabolism. This function is essential for proper mitochondrial dynamics, including calcium homeostasis, lipid transfer, and mitophagy/apoptosis, which are necessary for maintaining cellular function and communication between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated).

Deficiencies in SERAC1 can disrupt these processes, leading to altered phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin composition, which affects cholesterol accumulation and can result in developmental diseases such as MEGDEL syndrome (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERAC1 gene are associated with MEGDEL syndrome, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. This condition is marked by increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid, sensorineural deafness, encephalopathy, progressive spasticity, dystonia, and Leigh-like lesions on brain MRI scans (Wortmann2013Inborn; Alagoz2020A). The SERAC1 gene is crucial for phosphatidylglycerol remodeling, which is essential for mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking (Alagoz2020A).

In addition to MEGDEL syndrome, SERAC1 mutations have been linked to juvenile-onset complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (cHSP), a condition characterized by predominant lower limb spasticity and additional neurological features. A case study identified novel compound heterozygous variants in SERAC1 in a 7-year-old girl, leading to symptoms similar to cHSP, including dyskinesia, enhanced muscular tension, and abnormal MRI findings (Yan2022Complicated).

These findings highlight the diverse phenotypic spectrum associated with SERAC1 deficiency, emphasizing the importance of considering SERAC1 variants in the diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia and related metabolic disorders (Yan2022Complicated).

## Interactions
SERAC1 is involved in mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking, playing a crucial role in phosphatidylglycerol remodeling, which is essential for mitochondrial function. It contains a C-terminal serine-lipase/esterase domain with a consensus lipase motif located at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) (Saneto2022MitochondriaAssociated). The protein is hypothesized to interact with SFXN1, potentially facilitating the transport of cytosolic serine into mitochondria by interacting with and stabilizing SFXN1. This interaction was previously supported by a high-throughput BioID-based protein-protein interaction map, although it was not detected in a recent study using MCF7-derived mitochondrial extracts, possibly due to differences in cell lines or the transient nature of the interaction (Tifoun2022A).

Mutations in the SERAC1 gene, such as the c.1015G>C (p.Gly339Arg) mutation, can alter protein-protein interactions, potentially affecting intracellular cholesterol trafficking and leading to severe manifestations of MEGDEL syndrome. This mutation is located upstream in a serine-lipase domain, which may impact the protein's conformation and binding sites (Alagoz2020A). Understanding these interactions is crucial for elucidating the role of SERAC1 in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms.
