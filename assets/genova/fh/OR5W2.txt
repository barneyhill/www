# OR5W2

## Overview
The OR5W2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily W member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR5W2 protein, like other olfactory receptors, is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. While the primary function of OR5W2 is related to olfaction, its expression and potential roles in other tissues, including its involvement in cancer-related processes, have been subjects of recent research (Toth2019Random; Saadeh2020Correlation; Zhang2022Whole).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR5W2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, is not extensively documented. In the context of prostate cancer, OR5W2 is associated with differentially methylated sites (DMS) located in partially methylated domains (PMDs). These regions are linked to higher somatic mutation densities in tumors, and stronger hypomethylation in PMDs is significantly associated with more aggressive prostate cancer (Toth2019Random). However, specific diseases directly resulting from OR5W2 mutations or alterations in its expression are not detailed in the available literature.

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) studies, OR5W2 did not show any mutations in the analyzed samples, suggesting it may not play a significant role in this condition (Saadeh2020Correlation). In mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma (MPA), OR5W2 was identified among the top 30 genes with the most mutant frequencies, but its clinical impact remains unclear (Zhang2022Whole). Overall, while OR5W2 is mentioned in various cancer studies, its specific clinical implications and the conditions resulting from its mutations or expression changes are not well-established. Further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease processes.
