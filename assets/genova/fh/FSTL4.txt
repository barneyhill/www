# FSTL4

## Overview
FSTL4, or follistatin-like 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SPARC family, characterized by its involvement in cellular signaling and interactions. The protein encoded by FSTL4 is a multi-domain entity featuring a Kazal-like domain, a follistatin-like module, EF-hand domains, and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which collectively suggest its role in intercellular communication and modulation of signaling pathways (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). FSTL4 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is implicated in neuronal viability and synaptic function, potentially influencing neural development and plasticity (Tian2022Roles). Despite its structural complexity and expression profile, the precise physiological roles and mechanisms of FSTL4 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its functions and potential clinical significance (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

## Structure
FSTL4, a member of the SPARC family, shares structural similarities with follistatin and includes several distinct domains. The protein architecture of FSTL4 comprises a Kazal-like domain, a follistatin-like module, one or two EF-hand domains, and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are involved in intercellular interactions (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). These domains contribute to its role in cellular signaling and interactions.

The follistatin-like proteins, including FSTL4, typically feature a cysteine-rich follistatin module and a Kazal domain, characteristic of serine protease inhibitors (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). The presence of these domains suggests potential roles in binding and inhibiting members of the TGF-beta superfamily, although specific interactions for FSTL4 are not detailed in the available literature.

FSTL4 is encoded by 16 exons located on chromosome 5q31.1, with the last exon containing a microRNA coding sequence (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). Despite the detailed domain organization, specific information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of FSTL4, is not provided in the current context. The protein's structural features and potential modifications remain areas for further research.

## Function
FSTL4, also known as follistatin-like 4, is a protein that is part of the SPARC family, sharing structural and functional similarities with other follistatin-like proteins. It contains a Kazal-like domain, a follistatin-like module, one or two EF-domains, and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are involved in intercellular interactions (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). These structural components suggest that FSTL4 may play a role in modulating cell signaling pathways, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood.

FSTL4 is expressed in the central nervous system and is suggested to be involved in regulating neuronal viability and synapse-related protein expression in primary neurons (Tian2022Roles). This implies a potential role in neural development and synaptic function, contributing to the maintenance of neural networks and plasticity. The protein is typically active in the extracellular matrix, where it influences cell communication and tissue homeostasis (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

Despite these insights, the precise physiological roles and mechanisms of action of FSTL4 remain unclear, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its functions in cellular and organismal contexts (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

## Clinical Significance
The FSTL4 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of familial vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a congenital malformation associated with urinary tract infections and potential renal failure, a specific copy number variation (CNV) deletion at chromosomal region 5q31.1, which includes the FSTL4 gene, was identified in all affected relatives of one family. This suggests a potential role of FSTL4 in the genetic basis of VUR, although it had not previously been associated with this condition (Bartik2021A).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease, FSTL4 was found to be decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. This decrease is consistent with its role as a negative regulator of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) maturation, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of ALS (Oh2023Discovery). However, the clinical significance of FSTL4 gene mutations or specific expression alterations in ALS remains to be fully elucidated. These findings highlight the potential of FSTL4 as a biomarker for ALS, although it was not among the top-performing biomarkers in predictive models (Oh2023Discovery).
