# ADRA2C

## Overview
The ADRA2C gene encodes the alpha-2C adrenergic receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release within the central and peripheral nervous systems. The alpha-2C adrenergic receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including vasoconstriction, pain perception, and mood regulation, by modulating synaptic transmission (Small2000A). It is particularly significant in the sympathetic nervous system, where it contributes to the presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release, thus maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (Chotani2011Intracellular; Hein1999Two). The receptor's function is further influenced by its interaction with proteins such as filamin-2, which affects its cellular localization and surface expression (Pawlowski2014In). Variations in the ADRA2C gene have been linked to cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Rivero2016Alpha2Cadrenoceptor; Neumeister2005Sympathoneural).

## Structure
The ADRA2C protein, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a common feature among GPCRs (Pawlowski2014In). These helices form a transmembrane domain that is crucial for its function in signal transduction. The primary structure of ADRA2C consists of a sequence of amino acids that include regions rich in arginine or lysine residues, particularly in the C-terminal helix, which are important for its interaction with filamin-2 (Pawlowski2014In).

The secondary structure of ADRA2C includes these alpha-helices, which are approximately perpendicular to the cell membrane, forming a hydrophobic cavity that is typical of GPCRs (Congreve2011Progress). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing for specific ligand binding and receptor activation. The quaternary structure is not detailed in the available context.

ADRA2C may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interaction with other proteins. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing of its mRNA, which can lead to different functional forms of the receptor (Belfer2004Haplotypebased).

## Function
The ADRA2C gene encodes the alpha-2C adrenergic receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. This receptor is primarily active in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it modulates synaptic transmission and influences processes such as vasoconstriction, pain perception, and mood regulation (Small2000A). In the sympathetic nervous system, the α2C-adrenoceptor plays a crucial role in presynaptic feedback inhibition of neurotransmitter release, particularly norepinephrine, at low-frequency stimulation. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal cardiovascular function and preventing excessive catecholamine release, which can lead to cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (Chotani2011Intracellular; Hein1999Two).

The α2C-adrenoceptor is also involved in cold-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction, a process that helps maintain body temperature by reducing blood flow to the skin during cold exposure. This function is mediated by a signaling pathway involving reactive oxygen species, RhoA, and Rho kinase, which facilitate the translocation of α2C-adrenoceptors to the cell surface, enabling their functional response (Chotani2011Intracellular). Additionally, the receptor's intracellular localization and retention mechanisms involve specific motifs that regulate its transport and surface expression, impacting its availability and function in cellular signaling (Chotani2011Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADRA2C gene have been linked to several cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. The α2C Del322-325 polymorphism, a deletion of four amino acids, is associated with increased risk of heart failure, particularly in African-Americans. This polymorphism leads to heightened sympathetic nervous and adrenomedullary activities, resulting in increased catecholamine release, which can exacerbate heart failure (Neumeister2005Sympathoneural; Small2002Synergistic). The polymorphism is also linked to higher blood pressure and increased risk of congestive heart failure, especially when combined with other genetic variants like the β1-adrenergic receptor Arg389 variant (Lobmeyer2007Synergistic; Small2002Synergistic).

In psychiatric disorders, the α2C Del322-325 polymorphism has been associated with opiate abuse and dependence, with a significantly higher frequency in affected individuals compared to controls (Rivero2016Alpha2Cadrenoceptor). The polymorphism may also contribute to conditions like major depression and schizophrenia, although these associations are not statistically significant (Rivero2016Alpha2Cadrenoceptor). Alterations in ADRA2C expression or function can lead to dysregulation of neurotransmitter release, impacting conditions such as depression and schizophrenia (Uys2017Therapeutic).

## Interactions
The human α2C-adrenoceptor (ADRA2C) interacts with filamin-2, an actin-binding protein, through its C-terminal helix. This interaction is primarily driven by electrostatic forces between specific arginine residues in ADRA2C (R454, R456, and R461) and negatively charged residues in filamin-2. Additionally, lysine 449 (K449) in ADRA2C is stabilized by aspartic acid at position 2032 in filamin-2. These interactions are crucial for the translocation of the receptor to the cell surface, a process regulated by stimuli such as cold temperature. The arginine-rich region of ADRA2C is also important for retaining mature receptors in the Golgi compartment (Pawlowski2014In).

The interaction between ADRA2C and filamin-2 has been modeled using in silico methods, which identified a specific protein-protein interface. This interface is conserved among homologs of human ADRA2C and filamin-2, particularly in mammals and birds, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for interaction in warm-blooded animals (Pawlowski2014In). These findings propose that targeting the protein-protein interface between ADRA2C and filamin-2 could lead to new therapeutics for conditions like Raynaud's phenomenon (Pawlowski2014In).
