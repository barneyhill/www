# PRKCD

## Overview
The PRKCD gene encodes protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), a member of the novel protein kinase C (PKC) subfamily, which functions as a serine/threonine kinase. PKCδ is involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, and plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. The protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, which include a regulatory domain with pseudosubstrate and C1 and C2-like domains, and a catalytic domain essential for its kinase activity. Unlike conventional PKCs, PKCδ is activated in a calcium-independent manner, primarily through diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol esters. It is subject to various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage, which modulate its activity and subcellular localization. PKCδ's involvement in proapoptotic signaling pathways and mitophagy underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease (Kuehn2013Lossoffunction; Salzer2016Protein; Munson2021GAK).

## Structure
Protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), encoded by the PRKCD gene, is a serine/threonine kinase with a molecular weight of 78 kDa, consisting of 676 amino acids. The protein is categorized under novel PKCs and is structurally divided into a regulatory and a catalytic domain. The catalytic domain contains ATP- and substrate-binding sequences, essential for its kinase activity (Salzer2016Protein).

The regulatory domain of PKCδ includes a pseudosubstrate and two constant regions, C1 and C2-like domains. The C1 domain is responsible for membrane binding through hydrophobic interactions with diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The C2 domain is involved in calcium-independent phospholipid binding, distinguishing PKCδ from conventional PKCs that require calcium for activation (Salzer2016Protein).

PKCδ undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, which are crucial for its activation. Proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3 generates an active fragment that can translocate to mitochondria or the nucleus, promoting apoptosis (Salzer2016Protein). The protein also has a lipid-independent form phosphorylated by Src family kinases, allowing it to phosphorylate substrates in various cellular compartments (Salzer2016Protein).

## Function
The PRKCD gene encodes protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, PKCδ plays a crucial role in regulating B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, acting as a negative regulator to prevent excessive immune responses. It ensures proper immune function and tolerance by controlling B-cell signaling and autoimmunity regulation (Kuehn2013Lossoffunction; Salzer2016Protein).

PKCδ is activated by diacylglycerol and is part of the novel PKC subfamily. It is involved in proapoptotic signaling pathways, particularly in response to phorbol ester stimulation and DNA damage, facilitating apoptosis in healthy cells (Kuehn2013Lossoffunction). PKCδ also affects natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity, which is important for immune responses (Kuehn2013Lossoffunction).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, PKCδ is involved in mitophagy, specifically in PRKN-independent pathways. It facilitates the recruitment of ULK1/ATG13 to early autophagic structures, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease prevention (Munson2021GAK). PKCδ's activity is modulated by various phosphorylation events and interactions with other proteins, underscoring its complex regulatory functions in immune homeostasis (Salzer2016Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKCD gene, which encodes protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), are associated with several immune-related disorders. PKCδ deficiency, often resulting from autosomal recessive mutations in PRKCD, leads to a range of conditions including antibody deficiency, immune dysregulation, and symptoms resembling common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Clinical manifestations include respiratory tract infections, autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, nephritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like diseases (Salzer2016Protein).

In particular, PRKCD mutations have been linked to ALPS-like diseases, characterized by autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and recurrent infections. Patients may present with elevated double-negative T cells, CD8+ T cells, and serum IgG levels, along with reduced NK cells (Sharifinejad2020Protein). PKCδ deficiency also results in impaired B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to the development of autoimmune conditions such as SLE, where there is a breakdown of immune tolerance (Salzer2016Protein).

Additionally, PKCδ deficiency can mimic chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) due to impaired reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to increased susceptibility to infections (Neehus2022Chronic). These findings underscore the critical role of PKCδ in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity.

## Interactions
Protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. PRKCD interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 in vascular smooth muscle cells, forming complexes that enhance p65's DNA binding ability and regulate proinflammatory chemokine expression, such as Ccl2. This interaction is primarily cytosolic and independent of the IκB pathway (Ren2014Protein).

PRKCD is also known to interact with Src family kinases (SFKs) like Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn, which are constitutively complexed with PRKCD in cardiomyocytes. This interaction is enhanced by H2O2 treatment, leading to increased phosphorylation of PRKCD at Tyr311 (STEINBERG2004Distinctive). Additionally, PRKCD interacts with the RACK protein p32/gC1qBP, which is crucial for its localization and function in cellular signaling pathways (STEINBERG2004Distinctive).

In the context of mitophagy, PRKCD is enriched in mitochondrial fractions and interacts with proteins that facilitate its mitochondrial localization, independent of its lipid-binding domains. It regulates mitophagy by affecting the recruitment of early autophagy markers and interacting with Protein Kinase D1 (Munson2021GAK).
