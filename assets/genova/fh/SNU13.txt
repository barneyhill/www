# SNU13

## Overview
SNU13 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 13, a protein integral to the assembly and function of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) in human cells. As a member of the L7Ae family, the SNU13 protein is characterized by its ability to recognize and bind to kink-turn (K-turn) motifs in RNA, a critical step in the biogenesis of box C/D snoRNPs. These snoRNPs are essential for the 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), processes that are vital for RNA stability and function (Watkins2000A; Massenet2016Assembly). The protein's structural features, including a conserved αβ sandwich motif, facilitate its interaction with other proteins such as NOP56, NOP58, and fibrillarin, contributing to the proper processing and modification of rRNA within the nucleolus and Cajal bodies (Reichow2007The; Chauhan2024SnoRNAs:). Through its interactions with NUFIP1 and ZNHIT3, SNU13 plays a crucial role in the hierarchical assembly and maturation of snoRNPs, ensuring the fidelity of ribosomal RNA processing (Quinternet2016Structural; Massenet2016Assembly).

## Structure
The SNU13 protein, also known as the 15.5-kDa protein in humans, is a member of the L7Ae family and plays a crucial role in the assembly of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) by recognizing K-turn motifs in RNA (Reichow2007The). The protein's structure includes a conserved αβ sandwich motif, characterized by a four-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by six alpha-helices, which provides shape complementarity and specificity for RNA binding (Reichow2007The). 

SNU13 is involved in forming a tripartite complex with NUFIP1 and ZNHIT3, which is essential for the snoRNP assembly pathway. This interaction is conserved across species, as shown by structural studies and yeast two-hybrid assays (Quinternet2016Structural). The interaction between SNU13 and NUFIP1 involves the PEP motif in NUFIP1 directly contacting the helix α3 of SNU13 (Quinternet2016Structural). 

The protein is known to bind to specific RNA motifs, particularly the B/C and C/D motifs in U3 snoRNA, with a higher affinity for the B/C motif. This binding involves a kink-turn (K-turn) structure, which is a helix-bulge-helix motif crucial for the interaction (MARMIERGOURRIER2003A).

## Function
SNU13, also known as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 13, is a core protein involved in the assembly and function of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) in human cells. It plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of snoRNPs by recognizing and binding to the kink-turn (K-turn) motifs formed by the conserved C/D motifs in snoRNAs. This binding is essential for the proper assembly of snoRNPs, which are involved in the 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), processes critical for RNA stability and function (Watkins2000A; Massenet2016Assembly).

SNU13 is part of a protein complex that includes NOP56, NOP58, and fibrillarin (FBL), which together facilitate the methylation of target RNAs. The protein is active in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, where it contributes to the structural organization and function of snoRNPs, ensuring the proper processing and modification of rRNA (Massenet2016Assembly; Chauhan2024SnoRNAs:). The interaction of SNU13 with other proteins, such as NUFIP1 and ZNHIT3, is crucial for the maturation and stability of snoRNPs, preventing premature catalytic activity that could be detrimental to the cell (Massenet2016Assembly).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SNU13, also known as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 13, is involved in several critical interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. It binds directly to the conserved box C/D motif and the U3-specific box B/C motif in small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), forming a stem-internal loop-stem structure that is crucial for its function in RNA metabolism (Watkins2000A). SNU13 is a core component in the assembly of box C/D snoRNPs, where it initiates the folding of the K-turn motif in snoRNA, facilitating the binding of other proteins such as NOP56 and NOP58 (Quinternet2016Structural).

SNU13 also forms a tripartite complex with NUFIP1 and ZNHIT3 in humans, analogous to the yeast complex involving Snu13p, Rsa1p, and Hit1p. This interaction is mediated by NUFIP1, which acts as a bridging platform, suggesting a conserved functional mode across species (Quinternet2016Structural). The protein is part of an early protein-only complex that includes NOP58 and the AAA+ ATPase RUVBL1/2, which are crucial for the assembly of snoRNPs (Massenet2016Assembly). These interactions highlight SNU13's role in the hierarchical assembly and maturation of snoRNPs, ensuring proper ribosomal RNA processing and modification.
