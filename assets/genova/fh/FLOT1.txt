# FLOT1

## Overview
FLOT1 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein flotillin 1, a scaffold protein associated with lipid rafts. Flotillin 1 is a member of the SPFH protein superfamily and is characterized by its prohibitin homology (PHB) and flotillin domains, which contribute to its structural and functional roles in cellular processes (Zhan2023The). As a lipid raft-associated protein, flotillin 1 is involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis and plays a significant role in cellular signaling, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal differentiation (Zhan2023The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its membrane association and function (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin). Flotillin 1's interactions with various receptors and proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases (Zhan2023The).

## Structure
Flotillin 1 (FLOT1) is a scaffold protein associated with lipid rafts, characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes. The protein is composed of 427 amino acids and is encoded by the FLOT1 gene located on chromosome 6, which contains 13 exons (Zhan2023The). FLOT1 is part of the SPFH protein superfamily and contains a prohibitin homology (PHB) domain spanning amino acids 1-154 and a flotillin domain spanning amino acids 190-363 (Zhan2023The). The flotillin domain is characterized by glutamate-rich and alanine-rich repeat sequences, expected to form three coiled-coil stretches (Zhan2023The).

The secondary structure of FLOT1 includes a cluster of beta-sheets at the N-terminus, an extended α-helical region in the middle, and a C-terminus with one beta-sheet and several short helices (Singh2022Crosslinking). The protein forms heterodimers with FLOT2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry, contributing to its quaternary structure (Singh2022Crosslinking). FLOT1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its membrane association and function (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin). The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, such as Y160, is involved in flotillin hetero-oligomerization and protein-protein interactions (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; GauthierRouvière2020Flotillin).

## Function
FLOT1, or flotillin-1, is a scaffold protein associated with lipid rafts, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in lipid raft protein-dependent or clathrin-independent endocytosis, facilitating the internalization of several receptors and transporters, such as the dopamine transporter, glial glutamate transporter, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (Zhan2023The). FLOT1 is primarily localized at the plasma membrane but is also present in other cellular compartments like the Golgi, lysosomes, and endosomes (Zhan2023The).

In the nervous system, FLOT1 is significant for the formation of hippocampal synapses, which are essential for learning and memory. It promotes synaptic plasticity, neuronal differentiation, and neurite growth, particularly in glutamatergic synapses, by interacting with NMDA receptors (Zhan2023The). FLOT1 also plays a role in axonal growth and cell proliferation regulation through interactions with various receptors in lipid rafts (Zhan2023The).

FLOT1 is implicated in maintaining cell homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and receptor signaling regulation. It undergoes post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation and phosphorylation, which influence its subcellular localization and function (Zhan2023The). These functions highlight FLOT1's importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and membrane dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
FLOT1 (flotillin 1) is implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression and interactions. In cancer, FLOT1 is overexpressed in several types, including breast cancer, where it correlates with poor prognosis and promotes tumorigenesis by affecting cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways such as AKT/FOXO3a (Lin2011Knockdown). In hepatocellular carcinoma, FLOT1 downregulation inhibits cancer cell growth by inactivating key signaling pathways (Zhan2023The). In colorectal cancer, FLOT1 knockdown reduces drug resistance by affecting the PI3K/AKT pathway (Zhan2023The). FLOT1 is also an independent prognostic marker in cancers like laryngeal cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its expression correlates with poor survival (Zhan2023The).

Beyond cancer, FLOT1 is involved in cardiovascular diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where its overexpression may influence disease progression (Zhan2023The). In diabetes mellitus, FLOT1 is associated with insulin resistance and impaired lipoprotein metabolism (Zhan2023The). FLOT1 also plays roles in neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and immune responses, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target across a range of conditions (Zhan2023The).

## Interactions
Flotillin 1 (FLOT1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. FLOT1 interacts with Flotillin 2 (FLOT2) to form oligomeric and heterodimeric complexes, which are essential for its function in endocytosis and signal transduction (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; Zhan2023The). It is involved in clathrin/caveolin-independent endocytosis and interacts with proteins such as the dopamine transporter (DAT), glial glutamate transporter (EAAT2), and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; Zhan2023The).

FLOT1 also interacts with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), specifically binding to the NR2A and NR2B subunits, with a stronger interaction noted with NR2A (Zhan2023The). Additionally, FLOT1 forms complexes with guanine-nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-4 (GNB4), which is associated with lysosomal functions and diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Gaucher Disease (Singh2022Crosslinkinga; Singh2022Crosslinking).

The interaction between FLOT1 and the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) has been confirmed, suggesting a role in neurodegenerative processes (Chen2006The). These interactions highlight FLOT1's involvement in diverse cellular pathways and its potential impact on human health.
