# SPG21

## Overview
The SPG21 gene encodes the protein maspardin, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Mast syndrome, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Maspardin is characterized by its α/β hydrolase domain, although it lacks the catalytic triad typical of this superfamily, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions rather than enzymatic activity (Hanna2009Interaction). The protein is primarily involved in intracellular trafficking and endocytic sorting, localizing to the cytoplasm and membranes of the endosomal/trans-Golgi network (Hanna2009Interaction). Maspardin interacts with the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH16A1, which may play a role in cellular homeostasis and neuroprotection (Hanna2009Interaction). Mutations in SPG21 are linked to Mast syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative conditions (Klebe2015Clinical).

## Structure
The SPG21 gene encodes the protein maspardin, which is implicated in Mast syndrome, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Maspardin contains a domain with limited similarity to the α/β hydrolase superfamily. This domain features a nucleophile elbow and parallel β strands but lacks the catalytic triad typical of α/β hydrolases, suggesting it may function as a peptide-binding module for protein-protein interactions rather than having enzymatic activity (Hanna2009Interaction). 

Maspardin is expressed as a monomer and is approximately 33 kDa in size, consistent with its predicted molecular weight (Hanna2009Interaction). The protein localizes to the cytoplasm and membranes of the endosomal/trans-Golgi network, indicating a role in intracellular trafficking and endocytic sorting pathways (Hanna2009Interaction). 

The interaction of maspardin with the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH16A1 has been confirmed, suggesting a potential role in the cellular pathogenesis of Mast syndrome (Hanna2009Interaction). Despite its structural resemblance to α/β hydrolases, the mutation of the Ser109 residue, part of the nucleophile elbow, does not affect its interaction with ALDH16A1, indicating that this residue is not critical for the interaction (Hanna2009Interaction).

## Function
The SPG21 gene encodes the protein maspardin, which is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in membrane trafficking and intracellular transport. Maspardin is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to both cytoplasmic and membrane compartments, including the trans-Golgi network and endosomal pathways, indicating its role in intracellular trafficking (Hanna2009Interaction). It is implicated in the endocytic sorting pathway, with partial colocalization with markers for late endosomes and lysosomes, suggesting a function in the later stages of endocytic sorting (Hanna2009Interaction).

Maspardin interacts with the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH16A1, a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily, which suggests a potential role in aldehyde detoxification, crucial for preventing neuronal dysfunction and death (Hanna2009Interaction). This interaction may be significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative conditions. Although maspardin lacks enzymatic activity, it may function as a peptide-binding module, mediating protein-protein interactions (Hanna2009Interaction). The precise role of maspardin in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in membrane sorting and intracellular trafficking is critical for cellular function and structure (Boutry2019Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPG21 gene, also known as maspardin, are associated with Mast syndrome, a form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (ARHSP). This condition is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs, along with neurodegeneration that can affect motor function and cognitive abilities (Klebe2015Clinical). Individuals with Mast syndrome often exhibit pyramidal signs, which are indicative of damage to the motor pathways in the central nervous system (Klebe2015Clinical).

The clinical presentation of SPG21-related HSP can vary, with some cases involving intellectual disability or cognitive decline, classifying it as a complicated form of ARHSP (Klebe2015Clinical). The genetic heterogeneity of hereditary spastic paraplegias, including those linked to SPG21, underscores the complexity of these disorders, with phenotypes ranging from pure forms to more complicated presentations involving additional neurological symptoms (Klebe2015Clinical). Advances in next-generation sequencing have facilitated the identification of SPG21 mutations, aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of the disease's genetic basis (Klebe2015Clinical).

## Interactions
The SPG21 protein, also known as maspardin, is involved in several protein-protein interactions. It interacts with the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH16A1, a relationship confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells and observed in the mouse cerebral cortex. This interaction is specific, as maspardin binds selectively to ALDH16A1 and not to other aldehyde dehydrogenases like ALDH1A1 (Hanna2009Interaction). The interaction is direct, as demonstrated by fusion protein pull-down assays, and both proteins colocalize in neurons and nonneuronal cells (Hanna2009Interaction).

Maspardin is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the trans-Golgi network and endosomal pathways. It is distributed throughout the cell, with a concentration in the perinuclear region, and is found in both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (Hanna2009Interaction). The protein was originally identified as a binding partner for CD4, suggesting it may interact with multiple proteins beyond ALDH16A1 (Hanna2009Interaction). The interaction with ALDH16A1 may influence its localization and function, potentially contributing to the neurological symptoms of Mast syndrome, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by loss-of-function mutations in maspardin (Hanna2009Interaction).
