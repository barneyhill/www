# DERL3

## Overview
DERL3 is a gene that encodes the protein derlin 3, a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Derlin 3 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the retrotranslocation of misfolded or surplus proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytoplasm for degradation. This process is vital for cellular quality control, particularly under conditions of ER stress, and is integral to the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Lin2022Integrated; LopezSerra2014A). Derlin 3 is co-expressed with other proteins involved in ERAD, such as DERL1, DERL2, and EDEM1, and is known to interact with specific substrates like the glucose transporter SLC2A1, mediating their degradation (Lin2022Integrated; LopezSerra2014A). The expression and regulation of DERL3 have significant implications in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (LopezSerra2014A; Shibata2017Overexpression).

## Function
DERL3, also known as Derlin-3, is a key component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. This pathway ensures the degradation of misfolded or unnecessary proteins by facilitating their retrotranslocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytoplasm, where they are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (LopezSerra2014A). DERL3, along with other Derlin proteins, is believed to form an export channel in the ER membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular quality control, particularly under conditions of ER stress (LopezSerra2014A).

DERL3 is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and IRE1-mediated UPR, processes that are vital for managing ER stress and maintaining protein quality control (Lin2022Integrated). It is co-expressed with other proteins like DERL1, DERL2, and EDEM1, which are also involved in these processes (Lin2022Integrated). In cardiomyocytes, DERL3 is upregulated in response to ER stress, enhancing ERAD and preventing apoptosis, indicating its protective role against ER stress-induced apoptosis (Bhaduri2022The). This function is critical for cellular health and survival, helping cells adapt to ER stress (Bhaduri2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in DERL3 expression have been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma. In breast cancer, DERL3 overexpression is associated with a malignant phenotype, increased cell proliferation, and invasiveness. High DERL3 expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Shibata2017Overexpression).

In colorectal cancer, DERL3 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its epigenetic silencing through promoter CpG island hypermethylation leads to the overexpression of SLC2A1, contributing to the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis. This silencing is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis, as well as sensitivity to glycolysis inhibitors like shikonin (LopezSerra2014A).

In lung adenocarcinoma, DERL3 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and response to chemotherapy, indicating its role in the tumor microenvironment and potential as a biomarker for treatment response (Lin2022Integrated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DERL3 in cancer progression and treatment.

## Interactions
DERL3 (derlin 3) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It is primarily co-expressed with DERL2, DERL1, and EDEM1, which are integral to the ERAD process, including the transport of proteins from the ER to the cytosol and the cellular response to unfolded proteins (Lin2022Integrated). DERL3 interacts specifically with the SLC2A1 protein, a glucose transporter, mediating its degradation at the protein level. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies, indicating that DERL3 and SLC2A1 are both located in the endoplasmic reticulum (LopezSerra2014A). The interaction between DERL3 and SLC2A1 is specific, as no global protein degradation was observed, highlighting DERL3's role in targeting specific substrates for degradation (LopezSerra2014A).

DERL3's role in promoting ERAD of glucose transporter proteins like Glut1 is also noted, with its expression being silenced in some cancer lines, leading to elevated Glut1 levels and altered tumor cell metabolism (Lemberg2016Inactive). These interactions underscore DERL3's involvement in critical cellular processes related to protein quality control and stress responses in the endoplasmic reticulum.
