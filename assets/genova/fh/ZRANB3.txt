# ZRANB3

## Overview
ZRANB3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger RANBP2-type containing 3 protein, which plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and repair processes. The protein is categorized as a structure-specific ATP-dependent endonuclease and is integral to maintaining genomic stability, particularly under conditions of replication stress. It is characterized by a modular structure that includes a helicase core, a PCNA-interacting protein motif (PIP-box), an AlkB homolog 2 PCNA-interaction motif (APIM), and an NZF-type zinc finger, which facilitate its recruitment to sites of DNA damage. The protein's interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains is crucial for its function in remodeling replication fork structures and preventing inappropriate recombination events. Mutations in ZRANB3 have been linked to genomic instability in cancers and are also associated with type 2 diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated; Weston2012ZRANB3; Adeyemo2019ZRANB3).

## Structure
ZRANB3 is a protein characterized by a modular structure with several functional domains. At its N terminus, it contains a helicase core typical of the SNF2 ATPase family, which is crucial for its role in DNA replication and repair (Weston2012ZRANB3). The protein also features a PCNA-interacting protein motif (PIP-box) and an AlkB homolog 2 PCNA-interaction motif (APIM), both of which facilitate its recruitment to sites of DNA damage through interactions with PCNA (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated; Sebesta2017Structural).

ZRANB3 includes an unusual zinc finger of the NZF-type, which interacts with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, and a C-terminal HNH-type endonuclease domain responsible for its ATP-dependent nuclease activity (Weston2012ZRANB3; Sebesta2017Structural). The HNH domain is structurally unique among vertebrates, featuring a specific sequence insert that forms a well-structured alpha-helical domain essential for endonuclease activity (Sebesta2017Structural).

The protein's tertiary structure includes a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet surrounded by eight helices, adopting a beta-beta-alpha fold typical of the HNH protein family (Sebesta2017Structural). ZRANB3's interaction with PCNA is mediated by both the PIP-box and APIM motifs, which bind to the same site on the PCNA ring, forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Sebesta2017Structural).

## Function
ZRANB3 is a crucial protein involved in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells, particularly during replication stress. It functions as a structure-specific ATP-dependent endonuclease and is recruited to sites of DNA damage and stalled replication forks through interactions with polyubiquitinated PCNA and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated; Weston2012ZRANB3). ZRANB3 contains several functional domains, including a PIP box and an APIM motif, which mediate its interaction with PCNA, and an NZF zinc finger that binds polyubiquitin chains (Weston2012ZRANB3; Sebesta2017Structural).

ZRANB3 plays a significant role in the replication stress response by remodeling replication fork structures and disassembling D-loop intermediates, which helps prevent inappropriate recombination events and sister chromatid exchanges (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated). It also facilitates fork restart by cleaving DNA structures at replication forks, generating a 3'-OH terminus that can be extended by DNA polymerase, thus preventing replication fork collapse and maintaining genome stability (Weston2012ZRANB3). This activity is crucial for the repair of replication-blocking lesions and the continuation of DNA replication on undamaged templates (Weston2012ZRANB3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZRANB3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in maintaining genomic stability. In the context of cancer, particularly endometrial carcinomas, ZRANB3 mutations are associated with significant genomic instability. These mutations often occur in functionally critical domains such as the helicase core and the HNH domain, leading to loss-of-function variants that impair the gene's ATPase and endonuclease activities (Sebesta2017Structural). Specific mutations, like E97*, R947*, and C1041Hfs*13, result in truncated proteins that are endonuclease-deficient, while others, such as T66A and D1020Y, render the protein enzymatically inactive (Sebesta2017Structural).

ZRANB3 is also involved in the replication stress response, where its interaction with PCNA is crucial for DNA repair processes. Mutations affecting this interaction can lead to impaired DNA replication and repair, contributing to cancer development (Sebesta2017Structural). Additionally, ZRANB3's role in type 2 diabetes has been highlighted, particularly in African populations, where it is associated with beta-cell mass and insulin response. Alterations in ZRANB3 expression can impact beta-cell function and insulin secretion, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (Adeyemo2019ZRANB3).

## Interactions
ZRANB3 is a DNA replication-associated protein that interacts with several key proteins and nucleic acids involved in the DNA damage response. It contains a PIP-box and an APIM motif, both of which mediate interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These interactions are crucial for ZRANB3's recruitment to sites of DNA damage and replication stress (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated; Sebesta2017Structural). The PIP-box and APIM motifs allow ZRANB3 to bind to PCNA, with the PIP-box forming a hydrogen-bond interaction network and occupying a hydrophobic pocket on the PCNA surface (Sebesta2017Structural).

ZRANB3 also interacts with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains through its NZF-type zinc finger motif, which is important for its role in template switching and maintaining genomic stability (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated; Weston2012ZRANB3). This interaction is enhanced by the presence of polyubiquitinated PCNA, which recruits ZRANB3 to replication forks (Ciccia2012Polyubiquitinated).

In addition to its interactions with PCNA and ubiquitin chains, ZRANB3 forms complexes with branched DNA substrates, supporting its role in DNA replication and repair (Weston2012ZRANB3). These interactions highlight ZRANB3's critical function in the replication stress response and genomic stability maintenance.
