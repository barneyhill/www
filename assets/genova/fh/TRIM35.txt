# TRIM35

## Overview
TRIM35 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 35, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, thereby regulating protein degradation, signaling pathways, and immune responses. TRIM35 is involved in various cellular processes, including antiviral defense, tumor suppression, and cardiac remodeling. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences the stability and activity of target proteins through ubiquitination. Notably, TRIM35 has been implicated in the regulation of the AKT signaling pathway and the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which are crucial for cellular growth and metabolism. Its role in disease contexts, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiac fibrosis, highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stimuli (Zhang2022The; Yang2024TRIM35).

## Structure


## Function
TRIM35, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in protein ubiquitination. This process is essential for regulating protein degradation, signaling pathways, and immune responses. In healthy human cells, TRIM35 is involved in various cellular processes, including antiviral defense and tumor suppression (Zhang2022The).

TRIM35 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in the ubiquitination of target proteins, influencing their stability and activity. This activity is significant in modulating cellular growth, immune responses, and metabolism (Yang2024TRIM35). TRIM35 has been shown to enhance the ubiquitination of specific proteins, such as PDK1, thereby inactivating the AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for inhibiting tumor proliferation (Zhang2022The).

In the context of cardiac fibroblasts, TRIM35 regulates amino acid transport and mTORC1 activation, which are vital for cellular metabolism and growth. This regulation is achieved through the ubiquitination of the amino acid transporter SLC7A5, enhancing its protein level and facilitating amino acid transport (Yang2024TRIM35). These molecular activities underscore TRIM35's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
TRIM35 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TRIM35 is frequently downregulated, with more than two-fold reduction in expression observed in 60% of HCC tumors compared to noncancerous tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting that TRIM35 acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC (Jia2011Genomewide). The loss of TRIM35 expression is correlated with higher tumor grade, larger tumor size, and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, indicating its involvement in HCC progression (Jia2011Genomewide).

TRIM35 also plays a role in cardiac remodeling. It is upregulated in cardiac fibroblasts during pressure overload-induced ventricular remodeling, contributing to cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy. TRIM35 regulates the amino acid transporter SLC7A5, enhancing amino acid transport and activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for fibroblast activation and myocardial fibrosis (Yang2024TRIM35). This suggests that TRIM35 is involved in the development of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, potentially linking it to conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Yang2024TRIM35).

In hypoxic HCC cells, TRIM35 is involved in regulating the Warburg effect, a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells. It interacts with PKM2 to inhibit the Warburg effect and tumorigenicity, and its expression is influenced by miR-103a-3p levels (Ding2024HBO).

## Interactions
TRIM35, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cardiac remodeling. It interacts with the amino acid transporter SLC7A5, regulating its protein level through K63-linked ubiquitination. This post-translational modification enhances the stability and activity of SLC7A5, which is important for suppressing cardiac fibrosis (Yang2024TRIM35). The interaction between TRIM35 and SLC7A5 has been confirmed through protein structure docking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct interaction (Yang2024TRIM35).

TRIM35 also plays a role in activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. This activation is facilitated by the up-regulation of SLC7A5, which promotes amino acid transport, a critical process for fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis in cardiac fibrosis (Yang2024TRIM35). The interaction between TRIM35 and SLC7A5 is stress-dependent, as shown by the lack of down-regulation of SLC7A5 in TRIM35 conditional knockout mice under non-stress conditions (Yang2024TRIM35).

In addition to its role in cardiac remodeling, TRIM35 is involved in various cellular processes, including tumor growth and inflammatory responses, through mechanisms like ubiquitination (Yang2024TRIM35).
