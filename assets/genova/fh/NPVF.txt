# NPVF

## Overview
The NPVF gene encodes the neuropeptide VF precursor, a protein that plays a multifaceted role in various physiological processes. This precursor protein is categorized as a neuropeptide and is involved in the modulation of neuropeptide signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the regulation of sleep and arousal, as well as in promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis through its interaction with specific receptors such as the Neuropeptide FF Receptor 1 (NPFFR1) (Lee2017Genetic; Yu2023Application). The NPVF gene's influence extends to the regulation of bone marrow stromal cell differentiation and vascular development, highlighting its importance in both central nervous system functions and peripheral physiological processes (Yu2023Application). Additionally, the gene has been implicated in clinical conditions such as sleep disorders and central precocious puberty, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Lee2020Neuropeptide; Toutoudaki2023The).

## Function
The NPVF gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed into active peptides involved in various physiological functions. In healthy human cells, NPVF plays a significant role in modulating neuropeptide signaling, particularly through its interaction with the Neuropeptide FF Receptor 1 (NPFFR1). This interaction is crucial for promoting angiogenesis and migration in endothelial cells, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The activation of NPFFR1 by NPVF leads to the upregulation of angiogenesis-associated genes and proteins, including VEGF, EGF, and PDGF, which are essential for vascular development and bone regeneration (Yu2023Application).

NPVF also influences osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) via the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, enhancing extracellular mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity, which are critical for bone formation (Yu2023Application). Additionally, NPVF is involved in the regulation of sleep, as it is part of an evolutionarily conserved system that promotes sleep in vertebrates. In zebrafish, NPVF signaling is necessary for maintaining normal sleep levels and affects arousal thresholds, suggesting a similar role in humans (Lee2017Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NPVF gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of sleep disorders, NPVF signaling is crucial for normal sleep regulation. Mutations in the npvf gene, such as those leading to the absence of RFRP2 and RFRP3 peptides, result in increased activity and reduced sleep, suggesting a potential link to sleep disturbances like insomnia (Lee2017Genetic; Lee2020Neuropeptide). The NPVF system, acting through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), presents a potential therapeutic target for sleep disorders, as these receptors are amenable to small molecule manipulation (Lee2017Genetic).

In the realm of reproductive health, the NPVF gene has been studied for its role in central precocious puberty (CPP). A specific mutation in NPVF was found to be protective against CPP, indicating that alterations in this gene can influence the onset of puberty (Toutoudaki2023The).

NPVF is also involved in stress-related psychopathologies. Its human equivalent, RFRP-3, is implicated in the stress response, potentially affecting anxiety and depression through its action on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Kovács2024Brain). These findings highlight the diverse roles of NPVF in human health and disease.

## Interactions
NPVF, or neuropeptide VF precursor, is involved in several interactions that influence sleep regulation and other physiological processes. In zebrafish, NPVF signaling interacts with receptors NPFFR1 and NPFFR2, playing a crucial role in sleep regulation and arousal threshold modulation. Pharmacological inhibition of these receptors using antagonists like RF9 and GJ-14 results in increased activity and decreased sleep, highlighting the importance of these interactions in maintaining normal sleep levels (Lee2017Genetic).

NPVF neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus project to serotonergic neurons in the inferior raphe (IRa), forming dense bundles and making direct contacts with IRa somas. This interaction suggests a functional connection where optogenetic stimulation of NPVF neurons activates IRa neurons, indicating a direct interaction that promotes sleep through serotonergic pathways (Lee2020Neuropeptide).

NPVF also interacts with the NPFFR1 receptor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis. This interaction involves the upregulation of miR-181c-3p, which enhances migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis, demonstrating NPVF's role in cellular processes beyond the central nervous system (Yu2023Application).
