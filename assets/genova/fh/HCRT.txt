# HCRT

## Overview
The HCRT gene encodes the hypocretin neuropeptide precursor, which is subsequently processed into two neuropeptides, orexin-A and orexin-B. These neuropeptides are integral to the regulation of wakefulness and energy homeostasis, primarily functioning within the central nervous system. Orexin-A and orexin-B are synthesized in the hypothalamus and exert their effects by interacting with specific orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R, across various brain regions. These interactions influence numerous physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles, feeding behavior, and reward processing. The hypocretin system's dysfunction is notably associated with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal sleep architecture and arousal states (Hayakawa2017Reactivation; Li2020The).

## Structure
The HCRT gene encodes the precursor protein for hypocretins, also known as orexins, which are neuropeptides involved in regulating wakefulness and appetite. The primary structure of the hypocretin precursor protein is processed into two active peptides, orexin-A and orexin-B. Orexin-A is a 33-residue peptide characterized by two disulfide bonds, while orexin-B is a 28-residue peptide without cysteine residues, despite having 46% sequence identity with orexin-A (Kim2004Solution).

The secondary structure of orexin-A includes α-helices, particularly from Cys 12 to Thr 32 and Asn 25 to Leu 31, with a helical conformation supported by disulfide bonds between Cys 6 and Cys 12, and Cys 7 and Cys 14 (Kim2004Solution). The presence of these disulfide bonds induces a hydrophilic turn, distinguishing orexin-A from orexin-B (Kim2004Solution).

The tertiary structure of orexin-A, determined using NMR spectroscopy, reveals two α-helices with hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on opposite sides, which is crucial for its interaction with orexin receptors (Kim2004Solution). There is no information available on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of the HCRT protein. Common post-translational modifications include the proteolytic cleavage of prepro-orexin and the formation of N-terminal pyroglutamyl cyclic forms (Kim2004Solution).

## Function
The HCRT gene encodes the precursor for hypocretin neuropeptides, also known as orexins, which are crucial for regulating wakefulness and energy homeostasis. These neuropeptides, orexin-A and orexin-B, are produced in the hypothalamus and play a significant role in maintaining arousal by modulating various brain regions involved in sleep-wake cycles, feeding behavior, and reward processing (Hayakawa2017Reactivation; Li2020The).

Hypocretin neurons project to several brain areas, including the locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, and tuberomammillary nucleus, where they influence noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic systems, respectively. This network is essential for promoting wakefulness, regulating motivated behaviors, and integrating metabolic signals (Li2020The). The hypocretin system is also involved in reward processing and addiction, with its activity affecting drug-seeking behavior and hedonic responses (Li2020The).

In healthy human cells, hypocretin neurons respond to metabolic cues such as glucose and hormones like ghrelin and leptin, which regulate orexin secretion and influence energy balance (Hayakawa2017Reactivation). Dysfunction in the hypocretin system is linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (Li2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HCRT gene are closely linked to the development of narcolepsy, particularly type 1 narcolepsy, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. A specific mutation in the HCRT gene, identified as a G->T transversion, was found in a patient with early onset narcolepsy. This mutation introduced a charged arginine into the poly-leucine hydrophobic core of the HCRT signal peptide, leading to severe narcolepsy symptoms, including cataplexy, daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations (Peyron2000A). 

In narcoleptic patients, there is often a generalized absence of hypocretin peptides in the brain, which is associated with the disorder. This absence is due to impaired processing and trafficking of mutant hypocretin alleles, resulting in diminished localization to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network and accumulation in a membrane system resembling the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Peyron2000A). 

The loss of hypocretin neurons, rather than mutations in the HCRT system, is suggested to be responsible for most cases of human narcolepsy. This loss may be due to a degenerative process, as indicated by the presence of gliosis in the hypocretin cell region in narcoleptic brains (Thannickal2000Reduced).

## Interactions
The HCRT gene encodes the hypocretin neuropeptide precursor, which is cleaved into orexin-A and orexin-B. These neuropeptides interact with orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R, influencing various physiological processes. Hypocretin neurons project to multiple brain regions, interacting with several neurotransmitter systems. In the nucleus accumbens, hypocretin peptides modulate neurotransmitter activity by decreasing NMDA current amplitudes and increasing GABA current amplitudes, with hypocretin-2 having a more pronounced effect on GABA currents (Martin2002Interaction).

Hypocretin also interacts with the histaminergic system by projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus, where it releases glutamate and depolarizes neurons, affecting conditions like narcolepsy (Li2016Hypocretins). In the cholinergic system, hypocretin influences wakefulness and attentional processing by depolarizing basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which affects cortical acetylcholine release (Li2016Hypocretins). Additionally, hypocretin interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, where corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) can stimulate hypocretin neurons, influencing stress responses (Kim2020Possible).

In the immune context, hypocretin peptides interact with HLA-DQ6 molecules, influencing T cell receptor (TCR) activation in narcolepsy patients. Specific hypocretin peptides, such as HCRT 56-69, bind to DQ6, affecting TCR-mediated signaling and clonal expansion of TCR clonotypes (Jiang2019In).
