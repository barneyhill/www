# ZNF672

## Overview
ZNF672 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 672, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF672, are characterized by their ability to interact with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. ZNF672 has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including schizophrenia, cancer, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia, through its regulatory interactions and expression patterns. The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its interactions with other genes suggest its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease contexts (Budczies2020Decoding; yazdani2019transcriptomic; Zhu2018Systematic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF672 has been implicated in several medical conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a significant copy number variation (CNV) involving a 113-kb loss at chromosome region 1q44, which includes ZNF672, was identified in patients. This CNV was statistically significant and absent in population controls, suggesting a potential association with CDH (Zhu2018Systematic). 

In schizophrenia (SCZ), ZNF672 is one of the mediator genes that lost its impact on downstream gene transcriptional regulation in SCZ cases compared to controls. This loss of interaction suggests a role for ZNF672 in the altered gene regulatory networks observed in SCZ (yazdani2019transcriptomic).

ZNF672 expression is also linked to miscarriage. Higher levels of miR-940, which targets ZNF672, were found in miscarriage cases, leading to lower ZNF672 expression. This interaction may contribute to early spontaneous pregnancy loss by inhibiting trophoblast cell proliferation (Omeljaniuk2023The).

In cancer, specifically colorectal cancer, ZNF672 shows a negative correlation with MACC1, a gene associated with cancer progression and metastasis, indicating its potential involvement in cancer biology (Budczies2020Decoding).

## Interactions
ZNF672 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions, particularly in the context of gene regulation. In schizophrenia (SCZ) cases, ZNF672 is identified as one of the mediator genes that lose interactions with downstream genes compared to controls. This loss of interaction suggests that ZNF672 may play a role in the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes, and its altered function could be implicated in SCZ. The study by Yazdani et al. uses the STRING database to analyze these protein interactions, highlighting their importance for normal brain function (yazdani2019transcriptomic).

In cancer research, ZNF672 has been noted to have a negative correlation with MACC1, a gene involved in cancer metastasis, particularly in colon and rectal cancers. This negative correlation suggests a potential regulatory interaction between ZNF672 and MACC1, which could be significant for understanding cancer progression and identifying therapeutic targets (Budczies2020Decoding).

In the context of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma, ZNF672 is identified as a trans-regulated gene associated with the SNP rs2858870 on chromosome 6. However, specific protein interactions for ZNF672 in this context are not detailed (Kirsten2015Dissecting).
