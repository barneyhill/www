# CYBC1

## Overview
The CYBC1 gene encodes the cytochrome b-245 chaperone 1 protein, also known as EROS, which is integral to the proper functioning of the NADPH oxidase complex in phagocytes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the NADPH oxidase complex, which is essential for the oxidative burst that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) used by immune cells to combat pathogens (Mortimer2023A; Arnadottir2018A). The EROS protein facilitates the dimerization of the gp91^phox and p22^phox subunits, crucial components of cytochrome b-245, thereby ensuring the stability and functionality of the NADPH oxidase complex (Randzavola2021EROS). Mutations in CYBC1 can lead to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), highlighting its clinical significance in immune response and pathogen defense (PerezHeras2021HSCT).

## Structure
The CYBC1 gene encodes the EROS protein, which plays a crucial role in the maturation and stabilization of the NADPH oxidase complex. The molecular structure of EROS, as predicted by AlphaFold 2.0, reveals a tripartite organization. It consists of a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, an integral membrane segment, and a flexible C-terminal tail. The PH domain is characterized by specific residues forming beta strands and alpha helices, with two integral membrane alpha helices inserted between certain beta strands (Randzavola2021EROS).

The C-terminal tail of EROS is noted for its disordered structure, which may contribute to its flexibility and interaction with other proteins. EROS is involved in the early stages of gp91phox biosynthesis, suggesting its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear compartment (Randzavola2021EROS). EROS interacts with components of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, particularly the catalytic subunit STT3A, which is involved in N-linked glycosylation, indicating a role in post-translational modifications (Randzavola2021EROS).

EROS's interaction with the gp91phox-p22phox heterodimer and its role in purinergic signaling highlight its function in the quaternary structure of the NADPH oxidase complex (Randzavola2021EROS).

## Function
The CYBC1 gene, also known as cytochrome b-245 chaperone 1, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and stabilization of the NADPH oxidase complex in phagocytes. This complex is essential for the oxidative burst, a process that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) used by immune cells to kill pathogens (Arnadottir2018A; Thomas2019EROSCYBC1). CYBC1 functions as a chaperone, facilitating the dimerization of the gp91phox and p22phox subunits, which are components of cytochrome b-245, a key part of the NADPH oxidase complex (Mortimer2023A; Arnadottir2018A).

In healthy human cells, CYBC1 is highly expressed in whole blood and is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with two transmembrane regions (Arnadottir2018A). Its activity is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of the NADPH oxidase complex, ensuring effective ROS production during the immune response (Arnadottir2018A). The proper functioning of CYBC1 is vital for the immune system, particularly in the oxidative burst mechanism of phagocytes, which is essential for defending against infections (Mortimer2023A; Arnadottir2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYBC1 gene are clinically significant as they lead to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a severe immunodeficiency disorder. This condition is characterized by the inability of phagocytes to produce reactive oxygen species due to a dysfunctional NADPH oxidase complex, resulting in increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections (PerezHeras2021HSCT; Arnadottir2018A). A specific homozygous loss-of-function mutation, p.Tyr2Ter, in CYBC1 has been identified as a cause of CGD. This mutation introduces a premature stop codon, preventing the full-length protein assembly and leading to impaired neutrophil oxidative burst (PerezHeras2021HSCT; Arnadottir2018A).

Individuals with CYBC1 mutations often exhibit atypical CGD symptoms, including inflammatory manifestations such as granulomatous gastrointestinal disease and inflammatory bowel disease (Arnadottir2018A; Dinauer2019Inflammatory). The mutation is also associated with reduced height and unusual infectious profiles, including invasive fungal sepsis and miliary tuberculosis (Arnadottir2018A). Genetic screening for CYBC1 mutations is crucial for early detection and treatment of CGD, as residual reactive oxygen species production in CYBC1-deficient individuals correlates with a milder clinical presentation and improved survival (Arnadottir2018A).

## Interactions
The CYBC1 gene, also known as cytochrome b-245 chaperone 1, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and stabilization of the NADPH oxidase complex. This complex is essential for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in immune cells. CYBC1 interacts directly with the immature 58kDa form of gp91^phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, preventing its degradation and facilitating its maturation and incorporation into the gp91^phox-p22^phox heterodimer (Randzavola2021EROS). This interaction is crucial for the proper function of the NADPH oxidase complex, as evidenced by the impaired expression of gp91^phox in individuals with CYBC1 mutations (Arnadottir2018A).

CYBC1 also interacts with components of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in the N-glycosylation of proteins. This interaction suggests a role for CYBC1 in the early stages of gp91^phox biosynthesis, likely facilitating its stabilization and maturation (Randzavola2021EROS). The absence of CYBC1 leads to a significant reduction in the expression of gp91^phox and p22^phox, highlighting its importance in the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex (Randzavola2021EROS).
