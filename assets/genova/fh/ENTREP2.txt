# ENTREP2

## Overview
ENTREP2 is a gene that encodes the protein endosomal transmembrane epsin interactor 2, which is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in the regulation of membrane dynamics and vesicular transport. It interacts with other proteins to facilitate the sorting and transport of endosomal cargo, thereby influencing cellular signaling pathways and homeostasis. The functional implications of ENTREP2 and its encoded protein are significant in understanding cellular mechanisms and potential clinical applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
