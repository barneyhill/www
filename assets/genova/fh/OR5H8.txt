# OR5H8

## Overview
The OR5H8 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily H member 8, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins. The OR5H8 gene is located on chromosome 11 and is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are characterized by their single coding-exon structure and significant sequence diversity (Qiu2020aarFDC).
