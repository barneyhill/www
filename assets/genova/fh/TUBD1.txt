# TUBD1

## Overview
TUBD1 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin delta 1, which is a critical component of the microtubule network in eukaryotic cells. Tubulin delta 1 is involved in the formation and stabilization of microtubules, particularly within centrioles, which are essential for cell division and intracellular organization. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of centrioles by stabilizing triplet microtubules, and it is active in the cytoplasm, especially at the centrosome. Tubulin delta 1 is also crucial for the formation of basal bodies and axonemes, which are the structural cores of cilia and flagella, thereby contributing to cellular processes such as signaling and division (Stathatos2021Delta; Wang2017Centriole). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and genetic conditions affecting ciliary function in cattle (Schwarzenbacher2016A; VillegasRuiz2017Genomewide).

## Function
TUBD1 (tubulin delta 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation and stabilization of microtubules, which are critical components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, TUBD1 plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of centrioles, which are essential for proper cell division and intracellular organization. The protein is crucial for the stabilization of triplet microtubules within centrioles, ensuring their structural integrity and persistence throughout the cell cycle (Wang2017Centriole).

TUBD1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the centrosome, where it contributes to the formation of basal bodies and axonemes, the structural cores of cilia and flagella. This function is vital for maintaining the stability of B- and C-tubules in centrioles, which are necessary for the proper formation and function of cilia (Stathatos2021Delta). The protein's role in stabilizing microtubule structures is also linked to its involvement in cellular processes such as signaling and division, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular organization and stability (Stathatos2021Delta).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TUBD1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the expression and splicing variations of TUBD1 have been studied as potential biomarkers for the disease. Research has identified specific TUBD1 isoforms associated with different risks of DR. For instance, the presence of the Vab isoform is linked to a lower risk of DR, while the Vabd isoform is associated with an increased risk of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (VillegasRuiz2017Genomewide). These findings suggest that TUBD1 splicing variants could serve as indicators for DR development, highlighting the clinical significance of TUBD1 expression alterations in diabetic retinopathy (VillegasRuiz2017Genomewide).

In cattle, a missense mutation in the TUBD1 gene, specifically the rs383232842 C-allele, has been associated with high juvenile mortality in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh breeds. This mutation leads to chronic airway disease due to defective cilia in the respiratory tract, resulting in poor growth performance and high mortality rates. The mutation causes a damaging substitution at a conserved histidine residue, affecting microtubule polymerization and leading to significant health issues in homozygous animals (Schwarzenbacher2016A).
