# IL4

## Overview
Interleukin 4 (IL4) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 4, which is a key regulator in the immune system. This cytokine is primarily involved in the differentiation of naive T helper cells into Th2 cells, a process crucial for humoral immunity and the production of immunoglobulins such as IgE and IgG1 (Luzina2012Regulation; Idzerda1990Human). The IL4 gene is located on chromosome 5q31 and is expressed in various immune cells, including T cells, mast cells, and basophils (IsidoroGarcía2005Interleukin4). The protein interleukin 4 is characterized by a four-helix bundle structure, which is typical of cytokines, and functions as a monomer (Walter1992Crystal). It exerts its biological effects by binding to the IL-4 receptor, initiating signaling pathways that involve JAK kinases and the transcription factor STAT6, ultimately influencing gene expression and promoting immune responses (Luzina2012Regulation). IL4 is implicated in various allergic and autoimmune conditions, such as asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus, due to its role in immune regulation and IgE production (Tachdjian2009Pathogenicity; May2015Strategies).

## Structure
The human interleukin 4 (IL4) protein is characterized by a compact, globular structure primarily composed of a four-helix bundle. This bundle is arranged in a left-handed, up-up-down-down topology, with helices labeled A, B, C, and D (Smith1992Human; Walter1992Crystal). The helices form a hydrophobic core, stabilized by three disulfide bonds: Cys3-Cys127, Cys24-Cys65, and Cys46-Cys99, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's stability and structural integrity (Walter1992Crystal; Vaz2023Lessons). 

The secondary structure of IL4 includes a short antiparallel β-sheet, which is packed against the helices (Mueller2002Structure). The protein's tertiary structure is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds, contributing to its thermal stability (Walter1992Crystal). IL4 contains two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, which are exposed to the solvent and may play a role in its function (Walter1992Crystal).

IL4 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The protein's structure is similar to other cytokines like granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, sharing the four-helix bundle topology (Walter1992Crystal).

## Function
Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by influencing various cellular processes. It is primarily produced by activated T cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils, and is crucial for the differentiation of naive helper T cells into Th2 cells, which are essential for humoral immunity (Luzina2012Regulation). IL-4 promotes B-cell proliferation and differentiation, leading to the production of immunoglobulins IgE and IgG1, which are important for allergic responses and defense against parasites (Idzerda1990Human).

IL-4 exerts its effects by binding to the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) on target cells, initiating signaling pathways that involve the activation of JAK kinases and the transcription factor STAT6. This signaling cascade results in the regulation of gene expression, promoting cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Luzina2012Regulation). IL-4 also plays a role in the alternative activation of macrophages, leading to the M2 phenotype, which is associated with anti-inflammatory responses and tissue repair (Luzina2012Regulation).

In addition to its role in immune cell regulation, IL-4 influences the expression of surface antigens on monocytes, such as down-regulating CD14 and up-regulating CD23, which are involved in immune signaling and antigen presentation (Vercelli1988Human; Lauener1990Interleukin). Through these diverse functions, IL-4 is integral to maintaining immune homeostasis and modulating inflammatory responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL4 gene are associated with several allergic and autoimmune conditions. The IL4 gene, located on chromosome 5q31, plays a crucial role in regulating IgE production and is implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and atopy. Polymorphisms in the IL4 gene, such as the -33C>T variant in its promoter region, have been linked to asthma, with the T allele being more frequent in patients with persistent asthma, suggesting a genetic predisposition (IsidoroGarcía2005Interleukin4).

IL4 is also involved in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where IL4 and STAT6 gene polymorphisms are associated with lupus nephritis. IL4 promotes Th2 cell differentiation, which can lead to the production of autoreactive IgG1 and IgE, contributing to autoimmune pathologies (May2015Strategies).

In asthma, the IL4/IL4RA pathway is significant, with the IL4Rα polymorphism, particularly the R576 substitution, being linked to severe asthma and increased airway eosinophilia. This polymorphism enhances IL4-driven isotype switching in B cells, leading to increased IgE responses and contributing to asthma symptoms (Tachdjian2009Pathogenicity).

## Interactions
Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that engages in several critical interactions with proteins as part of its signaling mechanism. IL-4 initially binds with high affinity to the IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Rα), forming a ligand/receptor complex. This complex then recruits a secondary receptor chain, either the common gamma chain (γc) or IL-13 receptor alpha 1 chain (IL-13Rα1), to form a functional receptor complex. The type I IL-4 receptor, which includes γc, is primarily found in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, while the type II IL-4 receptor, which includes IL-13Rα1, is expressed in myeloid and non-hematopoietic cells (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4; Junttila2018Tuning).

Upon binding, the receptor complex undergoes a conformational change that activates intracellular signaling molecules. Janus kinases (JAKs), associated with the receptor chains, auto- and cross-phosphorylate, leading to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on IL-4Rα. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for signaling molecules like STAT6 and IRS proteins. STAT6, once activated, homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, influencing gene expression (Junttila2018Tuning; Kelly-Welch2003Interleukin-4). IRS proteins, particularly IRS-2, are recruited to IL-4Rα and undergo phosphorylation, linking to cellular proliferation and survival pathways (Nelms1999THE).
