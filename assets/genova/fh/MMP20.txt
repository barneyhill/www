# MMP20

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 20 (MMP20), also known as enamelysin, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent endopeptidase belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in dental enamel formation, primarily by facilitating the proteolytic processing of enamel matrix proteins during amelogenesis (Hu2015MMP20; Caterina2002Enamelysin). MMP20 is predominantly expressed by ameloblasts in the secretory stage of enamel development, where it contributes to the proper growth and organization of enamel crystallites, essential for enamel hardening (Yamakoshi2011Enamel). The protein's structure includes a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, crucial for its enzymatic activity, and a hemopexin-like domain that influences substrate specificity (Shintani2007Identification; Llano1997Identification). Mutations in the MMP20 gene are linked to amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by defective enamel formation, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in dental health (Nikolopoulos2021Spectrum; Wang2020Dental).

## Structure
The MMP20 protein, also known as enamelysin, is a matrix metalloproteinase involved in dental enamel formation. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (Shintani2007Identification; Llano1997Identification). The catalytic domain contains three histidine residues that coordinate zinc ions, essential for its enzymatic activity (Llano1997Identification). The secondary structure of MMP20 is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its globular tertiary structure (Li1999Activation).

The catalytic domain of MMP20 is crucial for its function, featuring a consensus sequence (H-E-X-G-H-X-X-G-X-X-H) that coordinates the zinc atom at the active site, and a methionine turn motif (A-L-M-Y-P) that enhances zinc-binding ability (Shintani2007Identification). The hemopexin-like domain, connected to the catalytic domain by a hinge region, is involved in substrate specificity and is conserved among MMPs (Shintani2007Identification).

MMP20 undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic activation, which is necessary for its enzymatic activity (Li1999Activation). The enzyme is expressed as a latent zymogen and requires cleavage of the propeptide to become active (Li1999Activation).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 20 (MMP20), also known as enamelysin, is a critical enzyme involved in the formation and mineralization of dental enamel. MMP20 is primarily expressed by ameloblasts during the secretory stage of enamel development, where it plays a crucial role in the proteolytic processing of enamel matrix proteins such as amelogenin, ameloblastin, and enamelin (Hu2015MMP20; Caterina2002Enamelysin). This processing is essential for the proper growth and organization of enamel crystallites, allowing them to increase in width and thickness, which is necessary for the hardening of enamel (Lu2008Functions; Yamakoshi2011Enamel).

MMP20's activity is vital for the removal of enamel proteins, facilitating the mineralization process by enabling the orderly replacement of the organic matrix with mineral content (Lu2008Functions). The enzyme's function is complemented by kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4), which further degrades enamel proteins during the maturation stage, although there is limited functional redundancy between these enzymes (Yamakoshi2011Enamel). In the absence of MMP20, as observed in Mmp20 null mice, there is a retention of organic matrix in the enamel, leading to enamel malformations and a failure at the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) (Hu2015MMP20; Caterina2002Enamelysin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMP20 gene are associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a genetic condition affecting dental enamel. This condition is characterized by enamel that is soft, thin, and often pigmented, leading to dental malformations. MMP20 mutations result in improper processing of enamel matrix proteins, which is crucial during the secretory and early transition stages of amelogenesis, leading to hypomaturation of dental enamel (Nikolopoulos2021Spectrum; Wang2020Dental). 

Various types of mutations in MMP20, including missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site mutations, have been identified. These mutations often lead to a loss-of-function mechanism, affecting the stability and function of the MMP20 protein (Nikolopoulos2021Spectrum; Wang2020Dental). For instance, the p.Glu209Gln variant disrupts calcium ion binding, which is critical for MMP20 function, while other mutations affect protein stability and folding (Nikolopoulos2021Spectrum).

MMP20 mutations may also impact dentin formation, as evidenced by reduced dentin thickness and mineral density in Mmp20 null mice, although dentin abnormalities are not typically reported in patients with MMP20-associated AI (Wang2020Dental). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MMP20 in dental health.

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 20 (MMP20), also known as enamelysin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. MMP20 interacts with dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This interaction is characterized by the coexpression and potential regulatory role of DSPP in MMP20 transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown significant enrichment of DSPP at MMP20 promoter-proximal elements, suggesting DSPP's involvement in regulating MMP20 expression (Saxena2015Matrix).

MMP20 also interacts with kallikrein 4 (KLK4) during enamel formation. It activates proKLK4 by cleaving at the propeptide-enzyme junction, which is essential for the proper removal of proteins from the enamel matrix, facilitating enamel maturation. KLK4, in turn, can inactivate MMP20 by cleaving it at specific sites in its catalytic domain (Yamakoshi2013MMP20).

Additionally, MMP20 is activated by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in dental tissues. MT1-MMP converts the inactive proMMP-20 into its active form, indicating a regulatory interaction between these proteins in the dentin-pulp complex (Palosaari2002Regulation).
