# ZNF195

## Overview
ZNF195 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 195, a member of the KRAB-containing zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its KRAB domain at the N-terminal and multiple Kruppel-type zinc finger motifs at the C-terminal, which are integral to its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Hussey1997Characterization). The zinc finger protein 195 is primarily involved in transcriptional repression, a common role for proteins with KRAB domains, and is expressed in various adult and fetal tissues, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological processes, including development and differentiation (Hussey1997Characterization). In the context of cancer, ZNF195 has been associated with kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where its expression correlates with tumor characteristics, although its prognostic value remains uncertain (Czerwinska2021Low). The protein's role in transcriptional regulation and potential involvement in cancer biology highlight its significance in cellular function and disease (Sobocińska2021KRAB-ZFP).

## Structure
The ZNF195 gene encodes a zinc finger protein characterized by a KRAB domain at the N-terminal and 14 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type zinc finger motifs at the C-terminal (Hussey1997Characterization). The protein consists of 629 amino acids and includes several key domains typical of KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins. These domains include a KRAB A domain located immediately after a methionine at the end of exon 1, a KRAB B domain, a spacer region, and a zinc finger domain (Hussey1997Characterization). The zinc finger motifs are of the C2H2 type, known for their DNA-binding capabilities, and are connected by a highly conserved H/C linker region (Hussey1997Characterization).

The molecular structure of ZNF195 is significant for its role in DNA binding and gene regulation. The presence of the KRAB domain suggests a role in transcriptional repression, a common function of KRAB-containing proteins. The protein's structure is modular, with multiple zinc finger motifs contributing to its function. The gene's expression results in predominant transcript sizes of 4.3 kb in adult tissues and 3.5 kb in fetal tissues, indicating potential splice variant isoforms with distinct functions or localization (Hussey1997Characterization).

## Function
ZNF195, a zinc finger protein, plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. It is characterized by an N-terminal KRAB domain and 14 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type zinc finger motifs at its C-terminus, which are structural features common to KRAB-containing zinc finger genes. The KRAB domain is known to function as a potent DNA binding-dependent repression domain, suggesting that ZNF195 is involved in the repression of gene expression (Hussey1997Characterization).

The gene is expressed in various adult tissues, including the heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes. In fetal tissues, such as the lung, liver, kidney, and brain, ZNF195 is also expressed, which suggests a role in development and differentiation (Hussey1997Characterization). The presence of alternative splicing of exons 4a and 4b between the KRAB B box and the spacer region may contribute to the regulation of its activity and function in different cellular contexts (Hussey1997Characterization).

ZNF195 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA to modulate the activity of specific genes, potentially influencing cellular differentiation and development (Hussey1997Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF195 has been implicated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its expression is associated with tumor characteristics and patient outcomes. High expression of ZNF195 is significantly linked to higher tumor grade and stage, and tumors with elevated ZNF195 levels exhibit cancer stemness characteristics, indicating a role in tumor progression and dedifferentiation. However, despite its association with more aggressive tumor features, ZNF195 expression does not correlate with patient prognosis, suggesting it lacks direct prognostic value in KIRC (Czerwinska2021Low).

The study by Czerwinska and Mackiewicz highlights that while ZNF195 is among the KRAB-ZNF proteins associated with better survival outcomes in KIRC, its specific role in predicting patient prognosis remains unclear. The research suggests that ZNF195, along with other KRAB-ZNFs, could potentially serve as a biomarker for cancer progression, although its prognostic utility is limited (Czerwinska2021Low).

In the context of cancer biology, KRAB-ZNF proteins, including ZNF195, are involved in transcriptional regulation and may act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Their expression levels and interactions can influence cancer cell phenotypes and are associated with clinicopathological features (Sobocińska2021KRAB-ZFP).
