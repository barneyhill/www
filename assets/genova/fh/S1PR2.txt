# S1PR2

## Overview
S1PR2, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological processes. The receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure, is integral to cell signaling pathways that regulate immune responses, cell migration, and vascular integrity. S1PR2 interacts with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, to mediate its effects on cellular functions such as cytokine production and osteoclastogenesis. The receptor's role extends to maintaining cerebrovascular integrity and modulating T cell distribution, highlighting its importance in both immune and vascular systems. Mutations in the S1PR2 gene have been implicated in clinical conditions like autosomal recessive hearing loss and cerebrovascular disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Hofrichter2018The; Yu2016Sphingosine1Phosphate; Kim2015Critical).

## Structure
The S1PR2 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical structure, typical of the GPCR family. These helices form the core of the receptor and are connected by three extracellular loops (ECLs), which are crucial for ligand binding. The extracellular loops, particularly ECL1, ECL2, and ECL3, play a significant role in forming the ligand-binding pocket, with ECL1 bridging helices II and III, ECL2 connecting helices IV and V, and ECL3 linking helices VI and VII (Hofrichter2018The).

The primary structure of S1PR2 includes conserved residues such as Arg108 and Glu109, which are essential for ligand interaction. Arg108, in particular, forms a salt bridge with the phosphate head of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a key interaction for receptor function (Hofrichter2018The). The receptor's tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, facilitating its function in a lipid bilayer environment (Soniya2024Selective).

S1PR2 can form multi-site/multi-ligand receptor complexes, indicating potential quaternary structures. These complexes may involve interactions with other receptors like NgR1 and PirB, enhancing the dynamics of signal transduction (Kempf2014The). The receptor may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its function (MasudaKuroki2022Sphingosine).

## Function
Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation, cell migration, and bone homeostasis. In healthy human cells, S1PR2 is involved in regulating proinflammatory cytokine production and osteoclastogenesis. It interacts with G proteins such as Gi, Gq, and G12/13, influencing signaling pathways like PI3K, ERK, JNK, p38, and NF-κB, which are crucial for cytokine production and osteoclast differentiation (Yu2016Sphingosine1Phosphate).

S1PR2 is also implicated in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity by regulating endothelial cell permeability and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation. This function is particularly important in the context of ischemic/reperfusion injury, where S1PR2 influences blood-brain barrier integrity and vascular responses (Kim2015Critical).

In the immune system, S1PR2 controls the migration and positioning of certain T cells, such as CCR6+ γδ T cells, by modulating their response to sphingosine-1-phosphate gradients. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance of T cell distribution between tissues and lymph nodes (Laidlaw2019Sphingosine1phosphate).

Overall, S1PR2's activity in the cell membrane influences intracellular signaling pathways that affect cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the S1PR2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of hearing loss and cerebrovascular integrity. In humans, variants in S1PR2 are associated with autosomal recessive hearing loss (DFNB68). Specific mutations, such as the c.323G>A (p.Arg108Gln) variant, have been identified in consanguineous families and are linked to profound sensorineural hearing loss without vestibular defects (Hofrichter2018The). These mutations affect the function of the S1PR2 receptor, which is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient necessary for hearing (Hofrichter2018The).

In the context of cerebrovascular integrity, S1PR2 plays a critical role in the disruption of neurovascular integrity during ischemic stroke and reperfusion injury. Alterations in S1PR2 expression or function can lead to increased cerebrovascular permeability, contributing to neurovascular injury and intracerebral hemorrhage. Inhibition of S1PR2 has been shown to decrease matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, reduce infarct size, and improve neurological outcomes in experimental stroke models (Kim2015Critical). These findings suggest that S1PR2 is a potential therapeutic target for reducing complications associated with stroke reperfusion therapies.

## Interactions
S1PR2, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2, is involved in various interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. It acts as a receptor for the Nogo-A protein, specifically interacting with the Nogo-A-D20 domain. This interaction occurs through the extracellular loops ECL2 and ECL3 of S1PR2, leading to the inhibition of synaptic plasticity by repressing neurite outgrowth and cell spreading (Kempf2014The). S1PR2 also interacts with G proteins, particularly G13, to activate the small GTPase RhoA, which is crucial for the signaling pathway that mediates these inhibitory effects (Kempf2014The).

S1PR2 is involved in the regulation of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) permeability and junction molecule expression through the ERK signaling pathway. It influences the expression of junction molecules like VE-cadherin, occludin, and ZO-1, which are essential for maintaining cell junction integrity. This interaction is significant for T cell migration and transcellular endothelial migration (TEM) (Xiong2019CD4).

Additionally, S1PR2 can bind to the ligand Siponimod, sharing structural similarities with S1PR1, although Siponimod fails to activate S1PR2 unlike S1PR1 (Soniya2024Selective).
