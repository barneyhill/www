# LTF

## Overview
LTF, or lactotransferrin, is a gene that encodes the multifunctional glycoprotein lactotransferrin, which is primarily involved in iron homeostasis and immune response modulation. Lactotransferrin is categorized as a glycoprotein and is known for its ability to bind iron ions, thereby limiting bacterial growth by reducing the availability of this essential nutrient to pathogens (Cao2011The). It is predominantly found in exocrine secretions such as saliva, tears, and milk, where it plays a crucial role in antimicrobial defense and the modulation of inflammatory responses (Hu2017Extraordinarily). The protein's structure is characterized by two globular lobes, each capable of binding iron, and it can form dimers, contributing to its functional versatility (Anderson1987Structure; Takayama2011Lactoferrin). LTF's interactions with various receptors and proteins underscore its significance in immune signaling pathways and its potential implications in disease mechanisms, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Chiu2020Lactotransferrin; Kruzel2017Lactoferrin).

## Structure
Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a glycoprotein with a primary structure consisting of approximately 700 amino acids (Anderson1987Structure). The protein is organized into two globular lobes, the N-lobe and C-lobe, each containing a metal-binding site (Takayama2011Lactoferrin). These lobes are connected by a short alpha-helix and are subdivided into two domains each, resulting in four domains: NI, NII, CI, and CII (Anderson1987Structure). The secondary structure of LTF includes about 32% alpha-helices and 22% beta-sheets (Anderson1987Structure).

The tertiary structure of LTF is characterized by its bilobal configuration, with each lobe capable of binding one iron ion. The iron-binding sites are located at the interface between the two domains of each lobe and are coordinated by conserved protein ligands, including tyrosines, histidine, and aspartate (Anderson1987Structure). The lobes are joined with their long axes roughly antiparallel (Anderson1987Structure).

LTF is a monomeric protein but can form dimers, representing its quaternary structure (Takayama2011Lactoferrin). It contains N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-137 and Asn-490, which are adjacent to large solvent regions (Anderson1987Structure). These glycosylation sites contribute to the protein's resistance to protease cleavage (Takayama2011Lactoferrin).

## Function
Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various molecular processes essential for maintaining health in human cells. It plays a critical role in iron homeostasis by binding iron ions, which limits bacterial growth by reducing the availability of iron, a necessary nutrient for many pathogens (Cao2011The). LTF is found in exocrine secretions such as saliva, tears, and milk, and is active on mucosal surfaces, contributing to antimicrobial defense and modulating inflammatory responses (Hu2017Extraordinarily).

In the immune system, LTF acts as a mediator of immune defense, responding to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic injuries. It interacts with various receptors, including CD14, TLR4, and TLR2, influencing immune signaling pathways and modulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (Kruzel2017Lactoferrin). LTF also plays a role in controlling oxidative cell injury by sequestering iron, which helps maintain the balance of reactive oxygen species production and elimination, thus preventing oxidative stress (Kruzel2017Lactoferrin).

LTF's ability to modulate immune responses and its antimicrobial properties make it a crucial component in the body's defense against infections and inflammation-induced pathologies (Kruzel2017Lactoferrin).

## Clinical Significance
The LTF gene, encoding lactoferrin, is implicated in various diseases through mutations and alterations in expression levels. In glioblastoma (GBM), LTF expression is significantly upregulated compared to normal tissues and lower-grade gliomas. This high expression is associated with poor overall survival, suggesting LTF as a potential prognostic biomarker in GBM (Qiu2024LTF). The gene's role in GBM may involve dysregulated immune infiltration, affecting immune cells like CD4+ T cells and macrophages (Qiu2024LTF).

In prostate cancer, LTF is linked to the immune microenvironment through the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Its expression is generally lower in tumor tissues, and high LTF levels correlate with better progression-free survival, indicating a potential role in maintaining tumor remission (Zhao2021LTF). 

LTF polymorphisms are also associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and chronic periodontitis. Specific SNPs, such as rs2073495, increase OSCC risk, while others like p.Lys47Arg are linked to chronic periodontitis susceptibility (Gołąbek2022Single; Zupin2017LTF). These findings highlight LTF's diverse roles in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
Lactotransferrin (LTF) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), LTF interacts with lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). This interaction is crucial for modulating metastatic progression, as LRP1 knockdown impairs LTF's ability to inhibit cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker expression (Chiu2020Lactotransferrin). LTF also shows an inverse correlation with the expression of ENO2 and a positive correlation with CDH6, suggesting interactions that influence cancer progression (Chiu2020Lactotransferrin).

LTF forms a high-affinity complex with ceruloplasmin (CP), which is significant in iron metabolism. This interaction is stronger than that between CP and transferrin, highlighting LTF's active role in iron metabolism through its interaction with CP (Sokolov2017Comparison).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, LTF interacts with SNCA (Alpha-synuclein) in bovine models, although this interaction is not observed in humans. This suggests a species-specific role of LTF in neurodegenerative pathways (Talebi2016Parkinson’s).
