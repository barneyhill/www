# DEFA4

## Overview
DEFA4 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin alpha 4, a member of the α-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are integral to the innate immune system, primarily functioning within neutrophils to combat bacterial and fungal infections. The protein is characterized by its small size, positive charge, and a β-sheet-rich structure stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for its antimicrobial activity (Winter2012Human). DEFA4 is located on chromosome 8, within a genomic region that includes other defensin genes, highlighting its evolutionary significance in host defense mechanisms (Taudien2004Polymorphic). Beyond its role in immunity, DEFA4 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including salivary gland tumors, Parkinson's disease, and lupus nephritis, where its expression levels serve as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis (Wang2022Predicting; Infante2015Identification; Winter2012Human).

## Structure
DEFA4, also known as human neutrophil peptide 4 (HNP4), is a member of the α-defensin subfamily of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are characterized by their small size, with molecular weights ranging from 3.5 to 6.5 kDa, and their positive charge (Winter2012Human). The primary structure of DEFA4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain, which is typical for defensins. The secondary structure of DEFA4 is dominated by a β-sheet configuration, a common feature among defensins, stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Taudien2004Polymorphic; Winter2012Human).

The tertiary structure of DEFA4 is defined by its characteristic β-sheet-rich fold, which is crucial for its antimicrobial function. This structure is maintained by the specific pattern of disulfide bridges, with cysteine residues linked in a 1-6/2-4/3-5 pattern, distinguishing it from other defensin subtypes (Winter2012Human). The quaternary structure of DEFA4 is not detailed in the available context, and there is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for this protein. The gene encoding DEFA4 is located on chromosome 8, within a complex and variable genomic region that includes other defensin genes (Taudien2004Polymorphic).

## Function
DEFA4, or defensin alpha 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the innate immune response. This protein is part of the α-defensin family, which is known for its antimicrobial properties. DEFA4 is primarily active in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, where it contributes to the body's defense against bacterial and fungal infections by disrupting the membrane integrity of pathogens (Winter2012Human). The protein's cationic nature and β-sheet structure enable it to disintegrate the membranes of various pathogens, thereby playing a crucial role in the immune system's first line of defense (Winter2012Human).

In the context of salivary gland tumors, DEFA4 expression is significantly increased in most tumors compared to healthy tissue, suggesting a role in tumor pathology. However, a notable decrease in DEFA4 expression is observed in pleomorphic adenomas, which may protect these benign tumors from malignant transformation (Winter2012Human). This indicates that DEFA4 might be involved in the inflammation-tumor sequence, highlighting its potential importance in both immune response and carcinogenesis (Winter2012Human).

## Clinical Significance
DEFA4 (defensin alpha 4) has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In Parkinson's disease (PD), DEFA4 is significantly upregulated in patients with the LRRK2-G2019S mutation and idiopathic PD, suggesting its potential role in PD pathogenesis (Infante2015Identification). The gene is also associated with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF), where it shows a 7.7-fold increase in expression compared to chronic hepatitis B patients, indicating its potential as a biomarker for HBV-ACLF diagnosis and prognosis (Zhou2016Comparative).

In lupus nephritis (LN) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), DEFA4 is identified as a key biomarker, with its expression levels correlating with disease activity and immune cell infiltration. It is positively correlated with macrophages and monocytes, and negatively with certain T cells, highlighting its role in the immune response in these conditions (Wang2022Predicting). Additionally, DEFA4 is part of a neutrophil signature in patients with CECR1 mutations, which are associated with ADA2 deficiency, further linking it to immune system disorders (Belot2014Mutations). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DEFA4 in various inflammatory and immune-related diseases.
