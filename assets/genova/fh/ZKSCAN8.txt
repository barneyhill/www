# ZKSCAN8

## Overview
ZKSCAN8 is a human gene that encodes the protein zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 8. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in binding to DNA, and it also contains KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) and SCAN domains, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. The KRAB domain is often associated with transcriptional repression, suggesting that ZKSCAN8 may play a role in regulating gene expression. The SCAN domain is a leucine-rich region that facilitates dimerization and interaction with other proteins, potentially influencing various cellular processes. ZKSCAN8 is implicated in several biological pathways and may have relevance in certain disease contexts, although its precise functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
