# SMC5

## Overview
The SMC5 gene encodes the structural maintenance of chromosomes 5 (SMC5) protein, which is a critical component of the SMC5/6 complex. This complex is integral to maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA repair, chromosome assembly, and segregation processes. The SMC5 protein is characterized by its hinge, coiled-coil, and ATPase head domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and DNA, enabling the complex to adopt various conformations necessary for its function (Alt2017Specialized; SoléSoler2020Smc56). The SMC5/6 complex plays a pivotal role in the stabilization of replication forks and the facilitation of homologous recombination, thereby ensuring error-free DNA repair and proper cell division (Potts2006Human; GallegoPaez2014Smc56mediated). Mutations in the SMC5 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, highlighting its importance in cardiac and neurodevelopmental health (O’Brien2023SMC5; Grange2022Pathogenic).

## Structure
The SMC5 protein is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, which plays a crucial role in chromosome maintenance and DNA repair. Structurally, SMC5 is characterized by several distinct domains, including the hinge, coiled-coil, and ATPase head domains. The hinge domain facilitates dimerization with SMC6, forming a toroidal structure with two interfaces, known as North and South, which are essential for DNA binding and complex stability (Alt2017Specialized; SoléSoler2020Smc56).

The coiled-coil region of SMC5 is involved in interactions with other subunits, such as Mms21 and NSE2, forming a moderately bent structure that contributes to the complex's flexibility and ability to adopt various conformations (Duan2009Structural; Adamus2020Molecular). The ATPase head domain is crucial for the protein's DNA-binding activity, which is enhanced by ATP hydrolysis (Roy2015The).

Post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation by the Nse2 subunit, are important for the protein's function in DNA repair processes (SoléSoler2020Smc56). The SMC5/6 complex can adopt both rod-like and ring-like conformations, with the rod-like conformation being more rigid (Adamus2020Molecular). These structural features enable SMC5 to participate in maintaining genomic integrity and facilitating DNA repair.

## Function
The SMC5 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the SMC5/6 complex, which plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. This complex is involved in several key molecular processes, including DNA repair, chromosome assembly, and segregation during mitosis. The SMC5/6 complex is essential for the proper progression of DNA replication and the stabilization of replication forks, particularly in late-replicating regions such as centromeres and telomeres (GallegoPaez2014Smc56mediated). It also facilitates homologous recombination by recruiting the cohesin complex to double-strand breaks, ensuring the proximity of sister chromatids and promoting error-free DNA repair (Potts2006Human).

In the cell, the SMC5/6 complex associates with chromatin during interphase and is involved in the reorganization of topoisomerase IIα distribution along chromosomes, which is crucial for chromosome structure and segregation (GallegoPaez2014Smc56mediated). The complex also plays a role in resolving DNA-mediated linkages that arise during replication, preventing chromosome missegregation (GallegoPaez2014Smc56mediated). The SMC5/6 complex's activity is regulated by SUMOylation, which is important for its function in DNA repair and maintaining chromosome stability (Diaz2018Scaffolding). Overall, the SMC5/6 complex is crucial for ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic integrity in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMC5 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting cardiac and neurodevelopmental systems. Variants such as p.Arg372del can destabilize interactions within the SMC5/6 complex, leading to congenital heart diseases like persistent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, and supravalvular pulmonic stenosis. These mutations can result in complex cardiac anatomies, including severe mitral stenosis and aortic valve stenosis, potentially due to disrupted proliferation of embryonic heart progenitor cells (O’Brien2023SMC5).

In neurodevelopment, SMC5 mutations are linked to conditions such as microcephaly, short stature, and developmental delays. These are thought to arise from increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in neural progenitor cells, as observed in Smc5 knock-out models in mice and zebrafish (Grange2022Pathogenic). The SMC5/6 complex plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability, and its dysfunction can lead to chromosomal instability, characterized by segmented and dicentric chromosomes, as seen in Atelís Syndrome (Grange2022Pathogenic).

Patient-derived cell lines with SMC5 mutations exhibit increased replication stress, indicating a compromised DNA damage response, which may contribute to the observed clinical phenotypes (Grange2022Pathogenic). These findings underscore the importance of SMC5 in both cardiac and neurodevelopmental health.

## Interactions
The SMC5 protein is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, which is involved in various DNA-related processes, including repair and chromosome segregation. SMC5 interacts with several proteins within this complex, forming stable interactions with subunits such as NSMCE2 (also known as Nse2), which binds to the coiled-coil region of SMC5. This interaction is crucial for the SUMOylation activity of NSMCE2, which is linked to ATP binding to SMC5, suggesting a conformational change during the ATPase cycle (Aragón2018The; SoléSoler2020Smc56).

The SMC5/6 complex also includes the Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 subcomplex, which bridges the SMC5 ATPase head and the SMC6 neck. This subcomplex regulates the DNA binding activity of the complex and is involved in the disjunction of homologues during meiosis (SoléSoler2020Smc56). SMC5 interacts with DNA through its hinge, arms, and ATPase head regions, and the complex can bind both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, with a higher affinity for the latter when SMC5 and SMC6 form a heterodimer (Roy2015The).

The SMC5/6 complex can also bind RNA-DNA hybrids and stabilize DNA supercoils in a plectonemic configuration, which is important for DNA repair processes (Serrano2020The). These interactions highlight the role of SMC5 in maintaining genomic stability through its participation in the SMC5/6 complex.
