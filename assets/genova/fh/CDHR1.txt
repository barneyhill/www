# CDHR1

## Overview
CDHR1, or cadherin-related family member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cadherin superfamily, which is primarily involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. The CDHR1 protein is a transmembrane protein characterized by its six extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. It plays a critical role in the retina, particularly in the maintenance and organization of photoreceptor cells. The protein is localized at the junction between the inner and outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptors, where it is essential for the assembly and stabilization of outer segment discs, crucial for phototransduction. Mutations in the CDHR1 gene are linked to various retinal dystrophies, including cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its significance in retinal health and vision (Malechka2022Clinical; Stingl2017CDHR1; Yusuf2022Retinal).

## Structure
The CDHR1 protein, encoded by the CDHR1 gene, is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its role in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. The protein structure includes six extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (Nikopoulos2015Identification; Stingl2017CDHR1). These cadherin repeats are large extracellular calcium-binding domains that are crucial for the protein's function and stability (Nikopoulos2015Identification). The protein is primarily expressed in the retina, where it localizes at the junction between the inner and outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptors (Stingl2017CDHR1).

The CDHR1 protein's structure is further defined by its interaction with calcium ions, which are essential for maintaining the architecture of its ectodomains (Nikopoulos2015Identification). Mutations affecting these domains can disrupt calcium binding, leading to structural instability (Malechka2022Clinical). The protein's role in photoreceptor maintenance is underscored by studies showing that its absence leads to disorganized photoreceptor outer segments and progressive degeneration (Malechka2022Clinical).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, although specific details on these aspects are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
The CDHR1 gene encodes a photoreceptor-specific cadherin protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is primarily localized at the base of the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptors, where it is involved in the assembly and stabilization of outer segment discs, which are essential for housing phototransduction proteins necessary for vision (Malechka2022Clinical; Yusuf2022Retinal). 

CDHR1 forms physical connections between the nascent outer segment discs and the periciliary ridge of the inner segment, providing an external scaffold that stabilizes the process of evagination and horizontal disc elongation (Yusuf2021Deep; Yusuf2022Retinal). This structural role is vital for the proper organization and morphogenesis of photoreceptor outer segments, ensuring the functional integrity of these cells (Stingl2017CDHR1).

In healthy human cells, CDHR1 contributes to the structural integrity of photoreceptors, which is essential for normal vision. Disruption of CDHR1 function can lead to disorganized outer segments and progressive loss of photoreceptor cells, highlighting its importance in retinal health (Yusuf2021Deep; Stingl2017CDHR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDHR1 gene are associated with several forms of retinal dystrophies, including cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), rod-cone dystrophy (RCD), and late-onset macular dystrophy (LOMD) (Yusuf2021Deep; Malechka2022Clinical). These conditions are characterized by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina, leading to progressive vision loss. CDHR1 mutations can manifest as different autosomal recessive phenotypes, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and cone dystrophy (Nikopoulos2015Identification; Stingl2017CDHR1).

The clinical presentation of CDHR1-associated retinal dystrophies is highly variable, with symptoms ranging from early-onset visual impairment to late-onset macular degeneration. Common features include macular atrophy and reduced visual acuity, with the age of onset varying from childhood to adulthood (Malechka2022Clinical; Haque2019A). Specific mutations, such as the c.601G > A (p.Glu201Lys) variant, affect protein function by altering calcium ion binding, which can lead to structural changes in the protein and impact its normal function (Malechka2022Clinical).

The CDHR1 gene is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor structure, and its mutations disrupt normal protein interactions, leading to photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration (Yusuf2022Retinal). The gene's role in disc morphogenesis and its interaction with other proteins underscore its importance in photoreceptor function (Yusuf2022Retinal).

## Interactions
CDHR1, also known as cadherin-related family member 1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for retinal function. It interacts with PROM1, a protein expressed throughout cone outer segments, which is significant for disc morphogenesis. This interaction is supported by evidence showing that mutant PROM1 affects the proteolytic processing of CDHR1, suggesting a shared molecular mechanism in retinal dystrophies (Yusuf2022Retinal).

CDHR1 also forms connections with PCDH15, another cadherin, in the calyceal processes of photoreceptor cells. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of photoreceptor cells and is conserved across species, including humans and zebrafish. The loss of CDHR1 function leads to disorganization and shortening of calyceal processes, indicating its role in photoreceptor homeostasis (Patel2024Cdhr1a).

In zebrafish, the homolog cdhr1a interacts with pcdh15b, linking photoreceptor outer segments with inner segment calyceal processes. This interaction is crucial for cone homeostasis and may be involved in cone-rod dystrophy. The absence of pcdh15b impairs cdhr1a localization, suggesting that pcdh15b is necessary for cdhr1a's function in photoreceptor cells (Patel2024Cdhr1a).
