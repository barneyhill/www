# CCDC89

## Overview
CCDC89 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 89, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These structural motifs are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions, allowing the protein to dimerize or oligomerize, thereby contributing to its functional versatility within cellular processes. The CCDC89 protein is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes and interacts with various proteins, such as FEM1B and TCTEX1D4, indicating its role in ubiquitination and cation binding processes (Chen2024Mechanism; Freitas2014TCTEX1D4). While the full clinical significance of CCDC89 is not yet fully understood, it has been implicated in neurodevelopmental processes and ciliopathies, suggesting potential roles in conditions such as epilepsy and other ciliary disorders (Fuller2024Insights; Pir2023CilioGenics:). Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise biological functions and clinical implications of this gene and its encoded protein.

## Structure
CCDC89 encodes a protein characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to dimerize or oligomerize, contributing to its functional versatility. The primary structure of CCDC89 is defined by its specific amino acid sequence, which dictates the formation of these coiled-coil regions. 

The secondary structure of the CCDC89 protein includes alpha helices, which are typical of coiled-coil domains. These helices contribute to the protein's stability and its ability to interact with other proteins. The tertiary structure, which describes the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, is influenced by the arrangement of these helices and the interactions between them.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of CCDC89, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins or its activity within cellular processes. Additionally, splice variants of the CCDC89 gene can lead to the production of different isoforms, each with potentially distinct functions. These isoforms may vary in their structural domains, influencing their role in cellular activities. The presence of these variants highlights the complexity and adaptability of the CCDC89 protein in human biology.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CCDC89 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several potential health conditions. Research using zebrafish models suggests that knockdown of the ccdc89 gene results in a hypoactive response to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), which may indicate tonic seizures or resistance to PTZ. This finding suggests a possible role for ccdc89 in neurodevelopmental processes and epilepsy, although its contribution to epilepsy in zebrafish is not definitive. The study notes that mutations in humans might have subtle effects or be gain-of-function alleles contributing to seizures and epilepsy, which zebrafish studies might not reveal (Fuller2024Insights).

In transcriptional studies, CCDC89 has been identified as a potential regulator of neurogenesis, interacting with transcription factors in Xenopus and mouse models. However, specific diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in the CCDC89 gene have not been detailed in these studies (Maino2014Transcriptional).

Additionally, CCDC89 has been validated as a ciliary candidate gene, suggesting a potential role in ciliopathies, although specific conditions related to its mutations or alterations have not been explicitly identified (Pir2023CilioGenics:). Further research is needed to clarify its clinical implications.

## Interactions
CCDC89 interacts with the FEM1B component of the CRL2 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is mediated by the recognition of the CCDC89 C-degron by FEM1B, where specific residues such as Pro-1 and His-21 are critical for binding. These residues form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with FEM1B residues like Ser122, Arg126, and Tyr84. Mutagenesis studies have shown that alterations in these key residues significantly affect binding affinity (Chen2024Mechanism).

CCDC89 is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes, as demonstrated in in vitro ubiquitination assays where it was combined with proteins such as FEM1B, ELOB, ELOC, and neddylated CUL2-RBX1. These assays were used to study the ubiquitination process and the structural interactions between CCDC89 and these protein complexes (Chen2024Mechanism).

CCDC89 also interacts with TCTEX1D4 in human testis, where it is expressed at significant levels. This interaction is part of a broader network involving proteins associated with cation binding and various biological processes (Freitas2014TCTEX1D4). However, there is no evidence of CCDC89 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
