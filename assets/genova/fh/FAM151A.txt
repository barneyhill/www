# FAM151A

## Overview
FAM151A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 151 member A. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functions are not fully understood. It has been implicated in metabolic regulation, particularly in the context of insulin dynamics and β-cell function, suggesting a potential role in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Additionally, FAM151A expression is altered in certain pathological conditions, including Crohn's Disease, where it is down-regulated in patients with a secondary loss of response to anti-TNFα therapy. The gene has also been identified as a candidate in studies related to mastitis resistance in dairy cattle, indicating its potential involvement in immune response mechanisms (Luther2018Loss; Cai2018Prioritizing; Miranda2021Integrated). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the functional roles and clinical implications of FAM151A.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The FAM151A gene has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. In the context of β-cell function, FAM151A is associated with insulin regulation. Studies in SM/J mice have shown that FAM151A expression negatively correlates with serum insulin levels, particularly under the influence of a high-fat diet. This suggests that alterations in FAM151A expression may impact insulin regulation and β-cell subpopulation dynamics, potentially contributing to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes (Miranda2021Integrated).

In Crohn's Disease, FAM151A has been identified as significantly down-regulated in patients who experience a secondary loss of response to anti-TNFα therapy. This down-regulation is part of a broader pattern of altered gene expression, which includes changes in oxidative stress and metabolic pathways, although it is not associated with the emergence of new inflammatory pathways (Luther2018Loss).

FAM151A has also been identified as a candidate gene in the context of mastitis resistance in dairy cattle, though its specific role or clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Cai2018Prioritizing). These findings suggest that FAM151A may play a role in various disease mechanisms, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
