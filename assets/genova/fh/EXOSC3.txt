# EXOSC3

## Overview
EXOSC3 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 3, a critical part of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in the processing and degradation of RNA within eukaryotic cells. The protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein, featuring domains such as the S1 and KH domains that facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules. EXOSC3 plays a vital role in maintaining RNA homeostasis by participating in the maturation of stable RNA species and the degradation of unstable RNA, thus ensuring proper gene expression and cellular function. Mutations in the EXOSC3 gene have been linked to pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1B (PCH1B), a severe neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (FrançoisMoutal2018A; Gillespie2017Mutations; Schwabova2013HomozygousEXOSC3Mutation).

## Structure
EXOSC3 is a component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. The protein features a core domain with two key RNA-binding domains: the S1 domain and the KH domain. These domains are crucial for its ability to bind RNA as it threads through the exosome (FrançoisMoutal2018A; Gillespie2017Mutations). The structure of EXOSC3 contributes to the formation of a ring-like assembly within the exosome, interacting with other exosome components such as EXOSC1, EXOSC2, EXOSC5, and EXOSC9 (FrançoisMoutal2018A).

Mutations in EXOSC3, particularly in the S1 and KH domains, have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1b (PCH1B), affecting the protein's RNA-binding capabilities and interactions within the exosome complex (FrançoisMoutal2018A; Gillespie2017Mutations). These mutations can lead to altered RNA binding preferences and impaired RNA processing functions (FrançoisMoutal2018A; Gillespie2017Mutations).

The EXOSC3 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The structural integrity and function of EXOSC3 are essential for the proper operation of the RNA exosome complex.

## Function
EXOSC3 is a core component of the RNA exosome complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. This complex is involved in the maturation of stable RNA species, such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and the degradation of unstable RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA. EXOSC3 is active in both the nucleolus and cytoplasm, contributing to RNA quality control and the regulation of gene expression (Zhang2022Integrated).

The RNA exosome complex, including EXOSC3, is responsible for the 3' to 5' degradation of RNA molecules, a process essential for maintaining cellular RNA homeostasis. This degradation pathway is critical for eliminating defective RNAs and controlling the levels of coding and non-coding RNAs within the cell (Zhang2022Integrated; Zhang2019Exosome). EXOSC3, as part of the exosome complex, is also implicated in various cellular processes, such as DNA repair and B-cell activation pathways, which are important for cell survival and function (Zhang2019Exosome).

In healthy human cells, EXOSC3's role in RNA metabolism and degradation ensures the proper turnover and processing of RNA, which is vital for normal cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOSC3 gene are primarily associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1), a severe neurodegenerative disorder. This condition is characterized by cerebellar atrophy, anterior horn motor neuron degeneration, and symptoms such as severe perinatal weakness, hypotonia, and respiratory insufficiency, often leading to early death (Schwabova2013HomozygousEXOSC3Mutation). The specific mutation c.92G → C, p.G31A in the EXOSC3 gene is identified as a founder mutation among the Czech Roma population, with a significant prevalence and associated with severe clinical manifestations, including infantile spinal motor neuron disease and progressive microcephaly (Schwabova2013HomozygousEXOSC3Mutation).

EXOSC3 mutations can also lead to pontocerebellar hypoplasia subtype 1B (PCH1B), which involves progressive atrophy of the pons and cerebellum, resulting in muscle weakness, developmental delay, and other neurological symptoms (Van2022Atypical). The EXOSC3 gene is part of the RNA exosome complex, and mutations can disrupt RNA metabolism, affecting cerebellar and spinal neuron motor function, which underscores the importance of genetic investigation in patients with unexplained neurological symptoms (Kunz2023Pathological). Genetic testing and counseling are recommended for populations at risk due to the high frequency of these mutations (Schwabova2013HomozygousEXOSC3Mutation).

## Interactions
EXOSC3 is a core component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. It forms part of the S1/KH cap structure of the exosome, along with EXOSC1 and EXOSC2, creating a trimeric central pore that caps the barrel-like structure of the exosome. This central pore is crucial for RNA binding and recruitment of RNA and protein cofactors, which are essential for the specificity of the RNA exosome's actions (Ogami2021Nuclear; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

EXOSC3 interacts with various proteins and complexes to manage RNA degradation and prevent DNA damage. It is involved in the recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to genomic target loci in B-lymphocytes, facilitating somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). EXOSC3 also interacts with senataxin (SETX), an RNA helicase, which is crucial for resolving R-loops and maintaining genome stability (Ogami2021Nuclear; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

In the context of telomerase regulation, EXOSC3 depletion in human embryonic stem cells can partially rescue telomerase RNA component (TERC) levels, indicating its role in telomerase activity and telomere length regulation (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EXOSC3 in cellular processes and genomic stability.
