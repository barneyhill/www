# GRIN2B

## Overview
The GRIN2B gene encodes the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor that plays a pivotal role in synaptic transmission and plasticity within the central nervous system. The GluN2B protein is a transmembrane receptor subunit that forms part of the NMDA receptor complex, which is essential for calcium-permeable excitatory synaptic transmission. This receptor is crucial for various neural processes, including learning, memory, and brain development. The GRIN2B gene is highly expressed during prenatal development, indicating its significant role in neuronal circuit formation and synaptic plasticity. Mutations or dysregulation of GRIN2B have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal brain function (Hu2016Human; Lemke2014GRIN2B; Myers2019Distinct).

## Structure
The GRIN2B gene encodes the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is a crucial component of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the brain. The GluN2B protein is part of a tetrameric assembly that includes two glycine-binding GluN1 subunits and two glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits, with GluN2B being one of the four different GluN2 subunits (A-D) (Wells2018The; Hu2016Human).

The molecular structure of GluN2B includes several domains: the amino-terminal domain (ATD), the agonist-binding domain (ABD), the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) (Hu2016Human; Myers2019Distinct). The ABD is formed by two separate portions of the polypeptide chain, S1 and S2, which are responsible for binding neurotransmitters like glutamate and glycine (Wells2018The). The TMD comprises three membrane-spanning alpha-helices and a re-entrant loop, forming the ion channel pore (Hu2016Human).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the function of the GluN2B subunit (Shah2022Molecular). Variants in the GRIN2B gene, particularly in the ATD and ABD, have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy (Hu2016Human; Lemke2014GRIN2B).

## Function
The GRIN2B gene encodes the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory in the central nervous system (CNS) (Jiang2017Functional; Hu2016Human). NMDARs, including those containing the GluN2B subunit, mediate a slow, calcium-permeable component of excitatory synaptic transmission, which is essential for neuronal communication and development (Hu2016Human). The GluN2B subunit is highly expressed prenatally and plays a significant role in brain development, circuit formation, cellular migration, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (Hu2016Human; Myers2019Distinct).

In healthy human cells, GRIN2B is essential for normal neuronal development, learning, and memory. It is involved in the regulation of neural morphology and cognitive processes, contributing to the proper functioning of NMDARs (AlavianGhavanini2018Prenatal). The GluN2B subunit is primarily active in the postsynaptic membrane of neurons, where it influences synaptic currents and neurotransmitter signaling, facilitating processes such as synaptic pruning and synapse refinement (Myers2019Distinct). Disruptions in GRIN2B expression or function can lead to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal brain function (Hu2016Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRIN2B gene, which encodes the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) (Hu2016Human; Myers2019Distinct). Specific mutations, such as p.Asn615Ile and p.Val618Gly, have been linked to West syndrome, characterized by infantile spasms and ID, due to a gain-of-function phenotype that increases NMDAR current (Lemke2014GRIN2B; Myers2019Distinct). 

GRIN2B mutations are also implicated in schizophrenia, with studies suggesting a potential role in susceptibility to the disorder, although no protein variants were detected in some analyses (Ohtsuki2001Mutation). Variants in GRIN2B can lead to altered NMDA receptor function, contributing to conditions such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, macrocephaly, and corticogenesis issues (Shah2022Molecular). 

Alterations in GRIN2B expression or function are linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal cognitive function and synaptic plasticity (Hu2016Human). The gene's high prenatal expression underscores its importance in brain development (Hu2016Human).

## Interactions
The GRIN2B gene encodes a subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is involved in various protein interactions critical for synaptic function and plasticity. GRIN2B interacts with other NMDA receptor subunits, such as GRIN2A and GRIN1, forming a calcium channel complex essential for synaptic transmission (McClatchy2023In). It also associates with proteins like Nlgn3, Kcna4, Kcna6, and Kcnab2, which are linked to schizophrenia, indicating its role in a complex network involving synaptic transmission and plasticity (McClatchy2023In).

In the context of hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal mouse brains, GRIN2B-containing NMDA receptor complexes recruit new proteins, including kinases that phosphorylate the GluN2B subunit, potentially altering its function (Lu2018Hypoxiaischemia). Notable interactions include those with scaffold proteins such as TANC2, which may compete for binding with PSD95, affecting synaptic stability and transmission (Lu2018Hypoxiaischemia). GRIN2B also interacts with CaMKII, a kinase that modulates its activity and localization, forming part of large multiprotein complexes at synapses (Baucum2015Quantitative). These interactions are crucial for anchoring NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and linking them with the postsynaptic density backbone structure (Lu2018Hypoxiaischemia).
