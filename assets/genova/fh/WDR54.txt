# WDR54

## Overview
WDR54 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 54 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and forming a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Jain2018WD40; Schapira2017WD40). The WD repeat domain 54 protein plays a significant role in signal transduction pathways, particularly in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth and proliferation (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated). It is involved in enhancing the activation of the Erk and Akt pathways and is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (Yuan2018Clinical). The protein's interactions and modifications, such as ubiquitination and cross-linking by transglutaminase 2, further underscore its importance in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

## Structure
WDR54 is a protein characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains, which are known for forming a β-propeller structure. This structure typically consists of seven bladed β-propellers, each blade comprising a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Jain2018WD40; Schapira2017WD40). The WD40 repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions, acting as scaffolds for various cellular processes (Li2001Human).

The WDR54 protein has three isoforms (a, b, and c) derived from three mRNA transcript variants in humans (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated). Isoform c is notably overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells (Yuan2018Clinical). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at lysine 280, which is crucial for its cross-linking and interaction with other proteins (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

WDR54 can be cross-linked by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), enhancing EGF receptor-mediated signaling. This cross-linking involves the most carboxyl-terminal WD domain, with lysine 280 playing a critical role (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated). The protein's interaction with TG2 and the EGF receptor is significant for tumor cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer drug development (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

## Function
WDR54, also known as WD repeat domain 54, is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction pathways. It plays a significant role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation. WDR54 enhances the activation of the Erk and Akt pathways in response to EGF stimulation, indicating its importance in cellular signaling (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

The protein is a member of the WD40 repeat domain-containing family, known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated). WDR54 is found in a unique vesicular location within cells, co-localizing with the activated EGF receptor at the plasma membrane, which supports its role in sustaining receptor internalization and enhancing downstream signaling (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

WDR54 is also involved in protein cross-linking, a process influenced by its ubiquitination at Lys280, mediated by transglutaminase 2 (TG2). This cross-linking may affect its subcellular localization and function, further impacting its role in signaling pathways (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

## Clinical Significance
WDR54 has been identified as an oncogene in colorectal cancer (CRC), with its expression significantly elevated in CRC tissues compared to noncancerous tissues. High levels of WDR54 are associated with poor disease-specific survival, particularly in patients with stage III CRC or with moderate to poor differentiation grades (Yuan2018Clinical). Knockdown of WDR54 in CRC cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration, and to reduce tumor growth in animal models, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and aggressiveness (Yuan2018Clinical).

The study also indicates that WDR54 knockdown sensitizes CRC cells to the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099, highlighting a potential therapeutic approach for WDR54-high tumors (Yuan2018Clinical). Mechanistically, WDR54 is involved in the regulation of AKT and ERK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation (Yuan2018Clinical). Additionally, WDR54 is implicated in EGF receptor signaling, where it undergoes cross-linking and ubiquitination, processes that are essential for its role in sustaining Erk activity and promoting cell growth (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

## Interactions
WDR54 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway. It can be cross-linked by transglutaminase 2, which enhances EGF receptor-mediated signaling. This cross-linking involves the carboxyl-terminal WD domain and lysine 280, which are crucial for both cross-linking and ubiquitination. WDR54 is found in vesicles at the plasma membrane, co-localizing with the activated EGF receptor, which sustains its internalization into the cytosol and enhances Erk activity in response to EGF stimulation (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

WDR54 also influences Erk activation, a downstream effect of EGF receptor signaling. Overexpression of WDR54 enhances Erk activation, while knockout of WDR54 suppresses it, indicating its crucial role in this signaling pathway (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated). Additionally, WDR54 is subject to ubiquitination at Lys280, which affects its cross-linking. EGF stimulation increases WDR54 ubiquitination and inhibits its cross-linking, highlighting the importance of Lys280 in these processes (Maeda2019Transglutaminasemediated).

In colorectal cancer, WDR54 interacts with the AKT and ERK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Knockdown of WDR54 significantly inhibits CRC cell growth and aggressiveness, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Yuan2018Clinical).
