# TRHDE

## Overview
The TRHDE gene encodes the thyrotropin-releasing hormone-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE), a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that plays a pivotal role in the inactivation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the extracellular space. As a type II integral membrane protein, TRH-DE is characterized by its specificity for TRH, distinguishing it from other neuropeptides. This enzyme is crucial for regulating TRH levels, thereby maintaining the balance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, which is essential for normal thyroid function (Charli2020The; Schomburg1999Human). TRHDE is expressed predominantly in the brain and adenohypophysis, with additional expression in peripheral tissues such as the liver, where it contributes to TRH regulation in circulation (Visser2018Regulation). The gene's expression and activity are influenced by peripheral hormones, indicating its involvement in broader endocrine feedback mechanisms (Schomburg1999Human).

## Structure
The TRHDE protein, also known as thyrotropin-releasing hormone-degrading ectoenzyme, is a member of the M1 family of zinc-aminopeptidases. It is composed of 1,024 amino acids in humans, forming its primary structure (Charli2020The). The protein is suggested to be a type II cell surface peptidase, featuring a small intracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular part. The extracellular portion includes a flexible stem, a catalytic domain, and an additional domain separated by a flexible loop, which aligns with its function as an ectoenzyme (Charli2020The).

TRHDE is N-glycosylated, with 12 putative N-glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain, and can be partially deglycosylated without affecting its enzymatic activity (Charli2020The). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing events. A soluble isoform, known as thyroliberinase, may result from alternative splicing or proteolysis. Additionally, a truncated membrane-bound form, TRH-DE*, is produced through alternative splicing and can inhibit the activity of the full-length enzyme when dimerized, although it does not hydrolyze TRH itself (Charli2020The). The specific 3D structure of TRHDE is not yet known, but its domain topology is consistent with its role in TRH hydrolysis (Charli2020The).

## Function
The TRHDE gene encodes the thyrotropin-releasing hormone-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE), which plays a crucial role in the inactivation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the extracellular space. TRH is a tripeptide hormone that acts as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter, stimulating the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH-DE is a type II integral membrane protein and a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase, characterized by its specificity for TRH, as it does not cleave other Glp-containing neuropeptides (Schomburg1999Human; Schauder1994Cloning).

TRH-DE is primarily active in the brain and adenohypophysis, where it terminates TRH signals, thus regulating the levels of TRH available to stimulate TSH release. This regulation is essential for maintaining the balance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, which is critical for normal thyroid function (Charli2020The; Schomburg1999Human). The enzyme's activity is influenced by peripheral hormones, suggesting its involvement in endocrine feedback loops (Schomburg1999Human). TRH-DE is also expressed in various peripheral tissues, including the liver, where it is released into the circulation in a soluble form, further contributing to TRH regulation (Visser2018Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRHDE gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs), TRHDE mutations have been associated with differences in disease-free survival rates, suggesting a potential role in the malignancy of these tumors. Genetic analysis indicates that TRHDE could serve as a candidate marker for screening and monitoring aggressive tumor behavior in PCC/PGLs (Suh2017Malignancy).

In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), TRHDE has been identified as a differentially expressed gene associated with lymph node metastasis. This association highlights its potential role in the metastatic nature of SCLC, which is a major factor in the poor prognosis of this cancer subtype (Kong2023Integrative).

Additionally, TRHDE is located near a chromosomal breakpoint in a translocation associated with vascular phenotypes and neurological symptoms. This translocation may lead to inappropriate activation of TRHDE, potentially affecting TRH levels in the cerebellum and contributing to neurological dysfunctions (Luukkonen2017Breakpoint).

## Interactions
The thyrotropin-releasing hormone-degrading ectoenzyme (TRHDE) is involved in the inactivation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and participates in various interactions that influence its function. TRHDE is a metallopeptidase with a narrow substrate specificity, primarily targeting TRH and TRH-like peptides (Charli2020The). It is known to be a N-glycosylated protein, which may affect its interactions and stability (Charli2020The).

TRHDE can form a truncated version, TRH-DE*, through alternative splicing. This truncated form can dimerize and inhibit the full-length TRH-DE, suggesting a regulatory mechanism within its own activity (Charli2020The). TRH-DE* has been shown to potentially interact with Akt1 in mesenchymal-derived soft tissue sarcoma cell lines, although the physiological relevance of this interaction remains unclear (Charli2020The).

In the central nervous system, TRHDE is expressed in various brain regions, particularly in glutamatergic neurons, where it hydrolyzes TRH in the extracellular fluid (Charli2020The). This activity suggests that TRHDE plays a role in modulating TRH signaling pathways, which can affect processes such as hormone regulation and neurotransmission.
