# ONECUT1

## Overview
ONECUT1, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF-6), is a gene that encodes the one cut homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor integral to the development and differentiation of pancreatic and hepatic tissues. This transcription factor is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate the expression of genes critical for pancreatic endocrine specification and β-cell development, such as PDX1 and NGN3 (Heller2021Transcriptional; Jacquemin2000Transcription). ONECUT1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors, including FOXA2, GATA6, and NKX6.1, to modulate gene expression during pancreatic development (Heller2021Transcriptional). The gene's function is essential for proper pancreatic development, and its dysfunction is linked to various forms of diabetes, underscoring its clinical significance (Jacquemin2003The; Heller2021Transcriptional).

## Function
ONECUT1, also known as HNF-6, is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of pancreatic cells. It is involved in the regulation of key transcription factors such as PDX1 and NGN3, which are essential for pancreatic endocrine specification and β-cell development (Heller2021Transcriptional; Jacquemin2000Transcription). ONECUT1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the transcription of target genes, influencing cellular functions and organismal development (Heller2021Transcriptional).

During pancreatic differentiation, ONECUT1 is associated with active enhancers, particularly during the pancreatic progenitor stage, indicating its role in activating pancreatic and endocrine system development processes (Heller2021Transcriptional). It co-binds with other transcription factors such as FOXA2, GATA6, and NKX6.1, which are crucial for β-cell maturation and adaptation (Heller2021Transcriptional). ONECUT1 also regulates the expression of the proendocrine gene NGN3, which is vital for the differentiation of endocrine cell precursors (Jacquemin2000Transcription).

The gene's function is crucial for the proper development of the pancreas, as it influences the timing of pancreas specification and the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells (Jacquemin2003The). Dysfunction in ONECUT1 is associated with various forms of diabetes, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal pancreatic function (Heller2021Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ONECUT1 gene are associated with various forms of diabetes. Rare coding variants, such as ONECUT1-p.E231D, have been linked to monogenic dominant diabetes, showing defects in pancreatic differentiation and reduced protein-protein binding with NKX2.2, which may contribute to their pathogenicity (Philippi2021Mutations). Biallelic variants in ONECUT1 can cause neonatal diabetes mellitus, with some cases confirmed in studies, while heterozygous null variants are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (RussSilsby2023The). 

The gene is also implicated in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and other forms of diabetes, including severe neonatal syndromic diabetes and young-onset nonautoimmune diabetes (Heller2021Transcriptional). Common variants near ONECUT1 affect regulatory elements in pancreatic islets and liver cells, influencing the expression of a long noncoding RNA, RP11-209K10.2, which is co-expressed with ONECUT1 (Philippi2021Mutations). 

In Arab cohorts, specific variants like rs202151356_p.H33Q and rs61735385_p.P94P have been identified, affecting transcription factor binding and gene expression, and are associated with different types of diabetes (Dashti2023ONECUT1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ONECUT1 in diabetes pathogenesis.

## Interactions
ONECUT1, also known as HNF-6, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development of the pancreas and liver. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. ONECUT1 is known to bind to DNA sequences, particularly at active enhancers and promoters, influencing the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in pancreatic differentiation and endocrine system development (Heller2021Transcriptional).

ONECUT1 interacts with other transcription factors such as PDX1, GATA6, FOXA2, and NKX6.1. These interactions are crucial for the co-binding events at active enhancers, suggesting a collaborative role in gene regulation during pancreatic development (Heller2021Transcriptional). The co-binding of ONECUT1 with these transcription factors is enriched in specific chromatin states, indicating its involvement in the activation of pancreatic enhancers and the specification of a β-cell-specific program (Heller2021Transcriptional).

In addition to its interactions with other proteins, ONECUT1 is implicated in the regulation of islet cell genes, where its binding is associated with the priming and activation of pancreatic enhancers (Heller2021Transcriptional). These interactions highlight the central regulatory role of ONECUT1 in the transcriptional network governing pancreatic differentiation.
