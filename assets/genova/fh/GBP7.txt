# GBP7

## Overview
GBP7, or guanylate binding protein 7, is a gene that encodes a member of the guanylate-binding proteins family, which are large GTPases induced by interferons. The protein product, guanylate binding protein 7, plays a significant role in the host's antiviral innate immune responses. It is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and immune signaling pathways. GBP7 facilitates the trafficking of mono-ubiquitinated protein cargo into autolysosomes and interacts with components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex, contributing to antimicrobial defense. Additionally, GBP7 modulates immune signaling by inhibiting pathways such as NF-κB and JAK-STAT, which are crucial for the regulation of immune responses (Zhang2021When; Huang2019Cell-autonomous).

## Function
GBP7 (guanylate binding protein 7) is a member of the guanylate-binding proteins family, which are interferon-inducible GTPases involved in the host's antiviral innate immune responses. In healthy human cells, GBP7 is constitutively expressed mainly in the liver and plays a role in protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions. It is involved in the trafficking of mono-ubiquitinated protein cargo into autolysosomes, facilitating the process of autophagy by bringing ATG4B for LC3b+ membrane elongation and closure around the cargo (Zhang2021When).

GBP7 is also implicated in the regulation of immune signaling pathways. It has been shown to facilitate influenza A virus replication by inhibiting innate immune responses through the NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Specifically, GBP7 prevents the phosphorylation of IκBα, thereby impeding NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, and attenuates the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, inhibiting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Zhang2021When).

The subcellular distribution of GBP7 varies, with its involvement in specific cellular processes related to autophagy and membrane trafficking, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune response regulation (Zhang2021When).

## Interactions
GBP7 (guanylate binding protein 7) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune defense. GBP7 interacts with components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, specifically gp91^phox and p22^phox, which are part of the cytochrome b_558 heterodimeric membrane (Nox2). This interaction facilitates the assembly of the Nox2 holoenzyme on intracellular bacteria, promoting the production of superoxide for antimicrobial defense (Huang2019Cell-autonomous).

GBP7 also plays a role in autophagy and cellular trafficking. It is involved in the trafficking of mono-ubiquitinated protein cargo into autolysosomes and recruits ATG4B for LC3b membrane elongation and closure around the cargo. This indicates GBP7's involvement in protein interactions related to autophagy (Zhang2021When).

In murine models, GBP7 (mGBP7) has been shown to form transient dimers, a process influenced by protein concentration rather than nucleotide presence. This dimerization is part of its biochemical properties, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Legewie2019Biochemical). These interactions highlight GBP7's multifaceted role in immune response and cellular processes.
