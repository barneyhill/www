# HRAS

## Overview
The HRAS gene encodes the HRas proto-oncogene, a GTPase that plays a pivotal role in cell signaling pathways. As a member of the RAS family of small GTPases, HRas functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active and inactive states to regulate various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and survival. The HRas protein is characterized by its ability to bind guanine nucleotides and undergo conformational changes that are essential for its signaling functions. It is primarily involved in the Ras/Raf-1/Erk signaling pathway, which is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and is crucial for transmitting extracellular signals to the nucleus (Simanshu2017RAS; Ahearn2011Regulating). Mutations in the HRAS gene are associated with several genetic disorders and cancers, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Gripp2012A; Aoki2008The).

## Structure
The HRAS protein is a GTPase involved in cell signaling, characterized by a well-defined molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, including regions critical for its function, such as the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) and switch regions. The secondary structure of HRAS includes a six-stranded central beta-sheet surrounded by five alpha-helices, which are typical features of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (Araki2011Solution; Lukman2010The).

The tertiary structure of HRAS is a compact, globular form that facilitates its role as a molecular switch. This structure is stabilized by interactions within the protein and with bound nucleotides, such as GTP or GDP. The presence of a gamma phosphate in GTP-bound forms induces significant conformational changes, particularly in the switch I and switch II regions, which are crucial for the protein's function (Brünger1990Crystal; Shima2010Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, HRAS can form dimers, as observed in crystal structures where molecules are related by noncrystallographic symmetry axes (Brünger1990Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as farnesylation, are essential for HRAS membrane localization and function. These structural features and modifications are vital for HRAS's role in signal transduction and its involvement in oncogenic processes.

## Function
HRAS is a proto-oncogene that encodes a GTPase involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, HRAS functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. This cycling is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP and accelerate GTP hydrolysis, respectively (Aoki2008The; Simanshu2017RAS).

HRAS is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it plays a crucial role in the Ras/Raf-1/Erk signaling pathway. This pathway is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) upon growth factor binding and is essential for cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Ahearn2011Regulating). HRAS interacts with various effectors, including Raf-1, PI3K, and RalGDS, to regulate processes such as gene expression, cell cycle entry, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Ahearn2011Regulating).

Post-translational modifications, such as farnesylation and palmitoylation, are critical for HRAS's membrane association and function. These modifications ensure proper localization and enable HRAS to participate effectively in signal transduction pathways (Hancock1989All; Ahearn2011Regulating). Through these molecular activities, HRAS influences organismal outcomes like cell proliferation and differentiation, playing a vital role in maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HRAS gene are associated with several genetic disorders and cancers. Costello syndrome is a rare congenital disorder linked to HRAS mutations, characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delays, cardiac abnormalities, and an increased risk of malignancies, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and bladder carcinoma (Gripp2012A; Aoki2008The). The most common mutation in Costello syndrome is p.G12S, found in over 80% of cases, leading to constitutive activation of HRAS and increased signaling through the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways (Gripp2012A; Kerr2005Genotypephenotype).

HRAS mutations are also implicated in various cancers, including bladder, kidney, and thyroid cancers. These mutations often occur in a heterozygous form, indicating autosomal dominant inheritance (Aoki2008The). Specific mutations, such as G12V, have a high transformation potential and are associated with severe developmental issues (Aoki2008The).

A novel HRAS mutation, p.S89C, has been identified, which reduces HRAS activation and downstream signaling, suggesting a new pathomechanism for HRAS-related diseases (Gripp2012A). This mutation highlights the complexity of HRAS-related disorders and the potential for diverse clinical outcomes based on specific genetic alterations.

## Interactions
HRAS, a member of the RAS family of GTPases, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cell signaling pathways. HRAS interacts with RAF kinases, including BRAF and CRAF, through their Ras-binding domains (RBDs). These interactions are characterized by allosteric conformational changes in the RBDs upon HRAS binding, which are essential for the activation of RAF kinases and subsequent signaling through the ERK-MAPK pathway (Aramini2015The).

The interaction between HRAS and RAF is direct, although RAF can also bridge HRAS interactions with MEK, another kinase in the signaling cascade. This bridging role of RAF suggests a complex network of interactions where RAF acts as a downstream effector of HRAS, facilitating the activation and localization of MEK and MAP kinase (Van1993Complex).

HRAS also forms complexes with other proteins, such as the Sch. pombe byr2 kinase, although byr2 does not interact with RAF or MEK, indicating specificity in HRAS interactions (Van1993Complex). Additionally, HRAS signaling is compartmentalized within cells, with interactions varying based on subcellular localization, affecting pathways like receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways (Santra2019An).
