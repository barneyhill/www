# ENPP5

## Overview
ENPP5 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5, which is part of the ENPP family. This family of proteins is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds in nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives, playing a significant role in extracellular signaling processes. ENPP5 is characterized as a type I membrane protein, featuring an extracellular catalytic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail, which aligns it with the alkaline-phosphatase superfamily (Möller2007Monitoring). While the specific substrates and functions of ENPP5 remain less defined compared to other ENPP family members, it is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, suggesting a role in neural cell function (Stefan2005NPPtype). The gene has also been implicated in various pathological conditions, including diabetic foot ulcers and pediatric high-grade gliomas, indicating its potential involvement in disease processes and as a biomarker for certain conditions (Smith2012CD105; Xiaohua2023Identification).

## Structure


## Function
ENPP5 is a member of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP) family, which plays a crucial role in extracellular signaling by hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds of nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives. This protein is involved in regulating the availability of extracellular nucleotides, which are essential for purinergic signaling pathways. ENPP5, along with other members of the ENPP family, is structurally similar to the alkaline-phosphatase superfamily and is characterized by a type I membrane protein structure. This includes a hydrophobic N-terminus acting as a signal peptide, an extracellular catalytic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytosolic tail (Möller2007Monitoring).

The catalytic domains of ENPP orthologues, including ENPP5, show high sequence identity, suggesting a conserved function across species. However, specific substrates for ENPP5 have not been identified, and its precise role in healthy human cells remains less understood compared to other ENPP family members (Stefan2005NPPtype). ENPP5 is typically expressed in the nervous system, where it may contribute to neural cell function and maintenance, although detailed functional studies are limited (Möller2007Monitoring).

## Clinical Significance
ENPP5 has been identified as a potential biomarker in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), a severe complication of diabetes mellitus. The gene is significantly down-regulated in DFU, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathology. ENPP5 is involved in the tyrosine metabolism signaling pathway, and its expression is correlated with various immune cells, including neutrophils and Th2 cells. This correlation indicates that ENPP5 may influence immune infiltration in DFU, which could be critical for understanding the disease's progression and developing therapeutic strategies (Xiaohua2023Identification).

In the context of pediatric high-grade glioma, ENPP5 is highly differentially expressed between tumors with high and low vascularity. Although the specific role of ENPP5 in these tumors is not fully understood, its expression pattern suggests a potential involvement in tumor angiogenesis and microvascular niche dynamics. This association highlights the need for further research to explore ENPP5's role in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target (Smith2012CD105).

Despite these findings, there is limited information on diseases directly caused by mutations or alterations in the ENPP5 gene, indicating a need for further investigation into its clinical significance.
