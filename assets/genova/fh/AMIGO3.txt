# AMIGO3

## Overview
AMIGO3 is a gene that encodes the adhesion molecule with Ig-like domain 3, a type I transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling within the nervous system. The protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which includes six leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, contributing to its role in axon tract development and neural circuit formation (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). AMIGO3 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and is implicated in promoting neurite extension while inhibiting neurite fasciculation (Li2021The). The protein's interactions, particularly within the NgR1-p75 receptor complex, are crucial for mediating axon growth inhibition, making it a significant factor in the context of central nervous system injuries (Ahmed2013AMIGO3).

## Structure
AMIGO3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by a structure that includes six leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and one immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain in its extracellular region (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The LRR domains are flanked by cysteine-rich LRRNT and LRRCT domains, which are important for protein-protein interactions (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The Ig-like domain is located near the transmembrane region, contributing to its role in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

The primary structure of AMIGO3 includes a signal sequence for secretion, followed by the LRRs and Ig domain, and a transmembrane domain leading to a cytoplasmic tail (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The cytoplasmic region contains conserved serine-rich areas with potential phosphorylation sites for Casein kinase I, suggesting regulatory roles through post-translational modifications (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

AMIGO3 shares structural homology with other proteins like the Slit family and the Nogo-66 receptor, indicating potential functional similarities in neuronal development (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The protein's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but its domain organization suggests it may form complex structures with other proteins. AMIGO3 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and is involved in axon tract development and neural circuit formation (Li2021The).

## Function
AMIGO3 is a type I transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes, primarily within the nervous system. It contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are crucial for its role in axon tract development and cell-cell interactions (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). AMIGO3 is expressed in neuronal tissues and is implicated in the formation of fiber tracts, promoting neurite extension and inhibiting neurite fasciculation (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

In healthy human cells, AMIGO3 is suggested to function as a cell adhesion molecule, facilitating interactions between cells, particularly in the nervous system. It exhibits both homophilic and heterophilic binding, indicating its involvement in complex cell signaling pathways (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The protein's cytoplasmic region contains conserved serine-rich areas, which may be involved in signaling through potential phosphorylation sites for Casein kinase I, although AMIGO3 lacks a consensus sequence for Casein kinase II (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

While specific functions of AMIGO3 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its structural similarities with other neuronal proteins suggest a role in axon guidance and neuronal development (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

## Clinical Significance
AMIGO3 has been implicated in the inhibition of axon regeneration following central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Elevated levels of AMIGO3 are observed in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGN) after dorsal column lesions, suggesting its role in axon growth inhibition during the acute phase of CNS injury (Ahmed2013AMIGO3). This gene interacts with the NgR1-p75/TROY receptor complex, activating the RhoA pathway, which is known to inhibit axon growth (Ahmed2013AMIGO3). 

Research indicates that AMIGO3 knockdown can promote axon regeneration and functional recovery in spinal cord injury models. Suppression of AMIGO3, particularly when combined with neurotrophin-3 (NT3) stimulation, enhances neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for spinal cord injuries (Almutiri2018Nonviralmediated). The knockdown of AMIGO3 also reduces spinal cord cavitation, possibly by limiting inflammatory cell influx, which may contribute to improved recovery outcomes (Almutiri2018Nonviralmediated).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of AMIGO3 in CNS injuries, where its dysregulation can impede recovery, and its targeted suppression may offer therapeutic benefits.

## Interactions
AMIGO3 is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in axon growth inhibition in the central nervous system. It acts as a co-receptor in the NgR1-p75 receptor complex, which is crucial for mediating axon growth inhibition. AMIGO3 interacts with NgR1 and p75 in transfected COS7 cells and in rat and human brain lysates, forming a receptor complex that responds to CNS myelin ligands, leading to RhoA activation (Ahmed2013AMIGO3). This interaction is significant for the axon growth inhibitory signaling cascade.

AMIGO3 can substitute for LINGO-1 in the Nogo-66 receptor complex, which includes p75 NTR/TROY, and is involved in signaling axon growth cone collapse through the RhoA pathway (Almutiri2018Nonviralmediated). The extracellular portion of AMIGO3 is sufficient for its interaction with NgR1 and p75/TROY, indicating that its role in inhibiting neurite outgrowth is dependent on these interactions (Ahmed2013AMIGO3).

In the context of spinal cord injury, AMIGO3 knockdown combined with NT3 overexpression promotes axon regeneration, suggesting that AMIGO3's interaction with the receptor complex is crucial for understanding inhibitory pathways that prevent axon regeneration (Almutiri2018Nonviralmediated).
