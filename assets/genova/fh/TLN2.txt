# TLN2

## Overview
The TLN2 gene encodes the protein talin 2, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating cell adhesion and signal transduction. Talin 2 is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is particularly significant in muscle tissues, where it is involved in the assembly and maintenance of muscle-specific adhesion complexes such as costameres and intercalated disks. These complexes are essential for the structural integrity and function of mature striated muscle. The protein is highly expressed in muscle tissues and is upregulated during muscle differentiation, indicating its critical role in muscle function. Additionally, talin 2 is expressed in brain tissues, suggesting a potential role in neuronal differentiation. Mutations in the TLN2 gene have been linked to certain genetic conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Senetar2006Talin2).

## Structure
Talin 2 (TLN2) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. It shares structural similarities with talin 1, featuring an N-terminal head domain and a flexible rod domain. The head domain contains a FERM domain, which is essential for integrin activation and binding. The rod domain is composed of multiple helical bundles that contribute to force transmission and adhesion complex reinforcement (Rahikainen2019Talinmediated).

Talin 2 has a higher affinity for β1-integrin tails compared to talin 1, primarily due to the presence of specific residues such as Ser339, which forms critical hydrogen bonds with β1-integrin tails. This interaction is crucial for maintaining strong binding affinity and is not present in talin 1 without specific mutations (Yuan2017The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and the presence of splice variant isoforms, influence the function and regulation of talin 2. These modifications may affect its binding affinity and interactions with other proteins (Yuan2017The). The structural conformation of talin 2, including its β-sheet structures, plays a significant role in its high affinity toward integrin tails, impacting cellular adhesion processes (Yuan2017The).

## Function
Talin 2, encoded by the TLN2 gene, is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating cell adhesion and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, Talin 2 is predominantly active in stable adhesion complexes such as costameres and intercalated disks, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of mature striated muscle. It is highly expressed in muscle tissues, where it is upregulated during muscle differentiation and associates with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, forming larger adhesions compared to Talin 1 (Senetar2006Talin2).

Talin 2 is involved in the assembly and maintenance of muscle-specific adhesion complexes, contributing to force generation and muscle function. It interacts with muscle-specific proteins like integrin-β1D and metavinculin, indicating its role in muscle-specific adhesion complexes (Senetar2006Talin2). The TLN2 gene is also expressed in brain tissues, suggesting a role in neuronal differentiation (Senetar2006Talin2). Talin 2's function in healthy cells is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular processes such as adhesion and migration (Senetar2006Talin2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TLN2 gene, which encodes the talin 2 protein, have been implicated in the development of certain genetic conditions. A notable mutation is the substitution of serine with leucine at position 339 (p.S339L), which has been associated with fifth finger camptodactyly, a condition characterized by the permanent bending of the little finger. This mutation disrupts talin2's binding to β1-integrins, which is crucial for proper cellular adhesion and signaling (Yuan2017The; Deng2016Exome). The p.S339L mutation was identified through exome sequencing in a family with a history of camptodactyly, where it co-segregated with the disease phenotype, suggesting its pathogenic role (Deng2016Exome).

In addition to camptodactyly, carriers of the p.S339L mutation have exhibited benign cardiac phenotypes, such as sinus arrhythmia and sinus bradycardia, and in one case, coronary myocardial bridge with ST segment depression and chest pain (Deng2016Exome). Bioinformatics analyses predict this mutation to be deleterious and disease-causing, highlighting the importance of the conserved serine at position 339 in maintaining talin2's function (Deng2016Exome). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TLN2 mutations in human disease.

## Interactions
Talin 2 (TLN2) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a significant role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, particularly in muscle tissues. It interacts with several muscle-specific proteins, including integrin-β1D, metavinculin, and archvillin, which are involved in muscle-specific adhesion complexes such as costameres and intercalated disks (Senetar2006Talin2). Talin 2 is highly expressed in mature striated muscle and is upregulated during muscle differentiation, where it localizes to stable adhesion complexes like costameres and intercalated disks, crucial for mature muscle assembly (Senetar2006Talin2).

In addition to its role in muscle tissues, Talin 2 interacts with F-actin and PIPKI γ90, contributing to its localization and function in muscle adhesion sites (Senetar2006Talin2). Unlike Talin 1, Talin 2 does not undergo calpain-mediated cleavage, which suggests a distinct regulatory mechanism in muscle and brain tissues (Senetar2006Talin2). These interactions highlight Talin 2's critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of muscle cells through its involvement in adhesion complex formation and signaling pathways.
