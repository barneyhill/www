# C6orf226

## Overview
C6orf226 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 226. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, indicating that it does not function as an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups or as a molecule that binds to signaling molecules to initiate a cellular response. Research into C6orf226 is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its role in cellular pathways and its potential implications in human health and disease. Understanding the interactions and clinical significance of the protein encoded by C6orf226 could provide insights into its contribution to biological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
