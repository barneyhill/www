# DHDH

## Overview
The DHDH gene encodes the enzyme dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, which is a member of the oxidoreductase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, contributing significantly to cellular detoxification processes. Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase is characterized by its ability to catalyze the oxidation of dihydrodiols to catechols, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful compounds and protecting cells from oxidative stress. Structurally, the enzyme is defined by a two-domain configuration, with an N-terminal NADP(H)-binding domain and a C-terminal α/β-domain, and it functions as a dimer. The enzyme's activity is crucial in detoxifying carcinogenic metabolites, such as those derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and it is involved in the reduction of reactive carbonyl compounds, thus preventing protein glycation. DHDH's expression and activity have been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and drug resistance, underscoring its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (DiazVidal2022Characterization; Wang2012Dietary; Hara2020Dimeric).

## Structure
The DHDH protein, also known as dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, is characterized by a two-domain structure. It consists of an N-terminal NADP(H)-binding domain and a C-terminal α/β-domain, which is involved in substrate binding and catalysis (Hara2020Dimeric). The active site of DHDH includes a catalytic triad formed by Lys97, Asp176, and Tyr180, with Tyr180 acting as a proton acceptor/donor (Hara2020Dimeric). This configuration is crucial for its function as an efficient reductase.

The protein's structure is further defined by its involvement in the Gfo/Idh/MocA protein family, suggesting shared ligand binding domains among family members (Hara2020Dimeric). DHDH exhibits broad substrate specificity, capable of oxidizing and reducing various carbonyl compounds, aldehydes, and ketones (Fukushima2022Detecting). The enzyme's quaternary structure is dimeric, which may contribute to its functional properties.

DHDH is also involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, and its activity can be influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may affect its stability and function (Wang2012Dietary). The enzyme's role in detoxifying carcinogenic metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons highlights its importance in cellular defense mechanisms (DiazVidal2022Characterization).

## Function
Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DHDH) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, playing a crucial role in detoxification processes. It catalyzes the oxidation of dihydrodiols to catechols, which are then further processed to prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful compounds. This activity is significant in protecting cells from oxidative stress by metabolizing reactive carbonyl compounds and preventing protein glycation (Wang2012Dietary). DHDH is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular protection against oxidative damage by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and detoxifying carcinogenic metabolites such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Méausoone2019In; Liu2022New).

In primates, DHDH functions as an efficient 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (AF) reductase, converting AF to 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (AG), thereby preventing the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that can cause cellular damage (Hara2020Dimeric). The enzyme's high catalytic efficiency and affinity for AF are attributed to its structural features, including a catalytic triad in the active site (Hara2020Dimeric). DHDH's activity in human cells is implied through its comparison with other human enzymes, although specific data on its activity in human cells is not directly provided (Hara2020Dimeric).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DHDH gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), low expression levels of DHDH are linked to improved patient survival rates, suggesting that DHDH expression levels are significantly associated with patient outcomes in this type of cancer (Wang2022Identification). In contrast, DHDH is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer, where high expression levels are correlated with early tumor recurrence, distant metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Borlak2015Proteome).

In the context of Dupuytren's disease (DD), while no direct association was found between DHDH gene variants and the disease, a higher prevalence of DHDH gene variants was noted in patients with a positive familial history of DD. This suggests a potential genetic component in the disease's etiology, possibly influenced by environmental factors such as alcohol metabolism, in which DHDH plays a role (Żyluk2013Common).

Additionally, DHDH is upregulated in methotrexate-resistant primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) cells, indicating its potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Takashima2020GSEAassisted). These findings highlight the diverse roles of DHDH in different pathological contexts.
