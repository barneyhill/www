# GID8

## Overview
GID8 is a gene that encodes the protein GID complex subunit 8 homolog, a crucial component of the GID/CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of LisH, CTLH, and CRA motifs, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization within the complex (Maitland2022Structural). As a core member of the scaffold, GID8 is integral to the structural integrity and function of the complex, facilitating the ubiquitination process that regulates protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Maitland2022Structural). Additionally, GID8 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, acting as a β-catenin nuclear retention factor, which is significant for the activation of Wnt target genes (Lu2017Twa1Gid8). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Lu2017Twa1Gid8; Corrêa2020Candidate).

## Structure
The GID8 protein is a subunit of the GID/CTLH E3 ligase complex and is characterized by the presence of LisH, CTLH, and CRA motifs, which are crucial for its function within the complex. These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization. The LisH motif forms a two-helix hairpin that pairs with another LisH motif from an adjacent protein, promoting oligomerization. The CTLH motif consists of three α-helices that connect to the CRA motif, which has a more extended conformation (Maitland2022Structural). GID8 serves as an essential core complex member, using its helices to bind multiple subunits. The arrangement and orientation of the LisH-CTLH-CRA motif in GID8 are similar to those found in other proteins like Smu1 and TOPLESS, although the orientation appears to be altered in GID8 (Maitland2022Structural).

GID8 is the smallest CTLH subunit and does not contain additional domains beyond these motifs (Maitland2022Structural). The protein is involved in forming a stable pentameric core in the human GID complex, which includes other subunits such as RMND5, MAEA, and TWA1 (Liu2019The). The GID8 protein, also known as C20orf11/TWA1/GID8, is integral to the structural integrity and function of the GID complex (Maitland2022Structural). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
GID8, also known as TWA1, is a component of the CTLH complex, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex conserved from yeast to humans. In humans, GID8 serves as a core member of the scaffold within the CTLH complex, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity. This complex is involved in ubiquitination, a process that regulates protein degradation and proteome dynamics by marking proteins for degradation (Maitland2022Structural). GID8 contains LisH, CTLH, and CRA motifs, which are essential for binding multiple subunits within the complex, maintaining its structural integrity and function (Maitland2022Structural).

GID8 is also implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it functions as a β-catenin nuclear retention factor. This role is critical for the nuclear accumulation and retention of β-catenin, which is necessary for the activation of Wnt target genes. The interaction between GID8 and β-catenin is facilitated by the conserved CRA domain of GID8, which enhances β-catenin's nuclear localization (Lu2017Twa1Gid8). GID8's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in cellular regulation and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
GID8, also known as Twa1, plays a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC) through its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts as a β-catenin nuclear retention factor, which is crucial for the progression of CRC. Studies have shown that nuclear Twa1 is significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its levels correlate with nuclear β-catenin levels. High levels of nuclear Twa1 are associated with a shorter overall survival time for CRC patients, indicating a poor prognosis (Lu2017Twa1Gid8). 

The overexpression of GID8 is common in various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancers, and is linked to advanced disease and poor prognosis. This overexpression is independent of the tissue of origin, as shown in TCGA data (Huffman2019The). GID8 is also part of the CTLH complex, which is associated with protumorigenic effects, with increased expression linked to cancer cell plasticity and therapy resistance (Huffman2019The).

In addition to its role in cancer, GID8 has been implicated in neurological conditions. It is identified as a bottleneck node in the protein-protein interaction network of genes located in the deleted region of ring chromosome 20, suggesting its involvement in the development of symptoms such as seizures, intellectual disability, and developmental delay (Corrêa2020Candidate).

## Interactions
GID8, also known as TWA1, is a core component of the human GID/CTLH E3 ligase complex, which is involved in protein ubiquitination. It contains LisH, CTLH, and CRA motifs that facilitate its interactions with other proteins within the complex. GID8 forms dimers that are crucial for the dimerization of other subunits, such as MAEA and RMND5A, and is pivotal for recruiting peripheral members of the complex (Liu2019The). 

GID8 interacts with Gid1/RanBP9 and ARMC8 in the scaffold of the complex. ARMC8 contains helical armadillo repeats that provide a versatile protein interaction surface (Maitland2022Structural). In yeast, Gid8 interacts with Gid1 through LisH and CRA domains, and with Gid5 through ARM repeats, which are crucial for the stability of the complex. The human homologues of these proteins, including GID8, form a similar scaffold (Maitland2022Structural).

GID8 is also part of the catalytic trimer in the human GID complex, linking RMND5A and MAEA (Bagci2023The). However, specific interactions of GID8 with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts (Maitland2022Structural).
