# ZNF318

## Overview
ZNF318 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 318, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is primarily involved in transcriptional repression, acting as a co-repressor of the androgen receptor (AR) and playing a significant role in spermatogenesis (Alam2016StructureBased). ZNF318 is characterized by its interaction with various nuclear proteins, including Sirt7 and HDAC2, and is subject to post-translational modifications such as deacetylation by HDAC8, which influences its regulatory functions (Alam2016StructureBased). The protein's involvement in cellular processes extends to the regulation of blood pressure and potential implications in disease contexts, such as breast cancer and tinnitus, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Chasapis2021A; Mathioudaki2020Targeted; Wells2021Genomewide).

## Function
ZNF318 is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus where it interacts with DNA and other nuclear proteins. It functions as a co-repressor of the androgen receptor (AR) and plays a role in spermatogenesis (Alam2016StructureBased). ZNF318 is identified as a strong peptidic substrate for HDAC8, specifically involved in the deacetylation of the lysine residue at position 1275, which suggests its role in the crosstalk between phosphorylation and acetylation, affecting cellular homeostasis (Alam2016StructureBased). The protein interacts with other partners such as Sirt7, HDAC2, and the AR, which it associates with to prevent transforming activity, indicating its involvement in regulating transcriptional activity and modulating protein interactions (Alam2016StructureBased).

Additionally, ZNF318 is noted for its role in regulating blood pressure, although specific details on this function in healthy human cells are limited (Chasapis2021A). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its significance in cellular growth, differentiation, and development, contributing to the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF318 has been implicated in several health conditions through its involvement in transcriptional regulation. In breast cancer, ZNF318 is frequently affected by somatic events such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number alterations (CNAs). It is noted as a potential target for drug development due to its role in the deacetylation of ARID1A, which may influence cancer progression (Mathioudaki2020Targeted). Additionally, changes in DNA methylation near ZNF318 have been associated with increased breast cancer risk, suggesting that methylation alterations could impact gene expression and contribute to cancer development (Zhou2022Alcohol).

ZNF318 has also been linked to tinnitus, with genetic variations in this gene associated with the condition. Although the exact mechanism is not well understood, it is suggested that the genetic association with tinnitus may not be directly related to hearing loss (Wells2021Genomewide; Wells2020Genetic). Furthermore, ZNF318 has been associated with serum uric acid levels, which are relevant to conditions like gout or hyperuricemia, indicating its potential role in metabolic regulation (Nakatochi2019Genomewide).

## Interactions
ZNF318, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It acts as a co-repressor of the androgen receptor (AR) and is involved in spermatogenesis. ZNF318 has been reported to bind with PPP1CC phosphatase, Sirt7, HDAC2, and the AR, with whom it associates to prevent its transforming activity (Alam2016StructureBased). The deacetylation of ZNF318 by HDAC8 at the K1275 site suggests a regulatory role in the crosstalk between phosphorylation and acetylation, affecting cellular homeostasis (Alam2016StructureBased).

In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ZNF318 is identified as a zinc-binding protein that may play a role in regulating blood pressure. The study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could disturb intracellular zinc homeostasis, potentially impacting ZNF318's function (Chasapis2021A). Although specific interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are not detailed, the presence of ZNF318 in the human metalloproteome interacting with the virus highlights its potential involvement in the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 (Chasapis2021A). These interactions underscore the multifaceted roles of ZNF318 in both normal physiological processes and disease contexts.
