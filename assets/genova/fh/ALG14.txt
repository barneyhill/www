# ALG14

## Overview
ALG14 is a gene that encodes the ALG14 UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit, a crucial component of the glycosyltransferase complex involved in N-linked glycosylation. This process is essential for the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, which are critical for the proper folding and function of glycoproteins. The ALG14 protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, with its structure facilitating its role as a membrane anchor within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with other proteins, such as ALG13 and ALG7, to form a functional complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. Mutations in the ALG14 gene have been linked to congenital myasthenic syndromes and other severe neurodegenerative conditions, underscoring its importance in neuromuscular and neurological development (Wang2022An; Lu2011Alg14; Schorling2017Early).

## Structure
The ALG14 protein is a subunit of the UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex involved in N-glycosylation. Its primary structure includes a predicted transmembrane domain (TMD) spanning amino acids 5-24, which is crucial for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Averbeck2007Membrane; Lu2011Alg14). The N-terminal region of ALG14 is essential for its function and stability, contributing to the protein's membrane association and interaction with other proteins like ALG7 and ALG13 (Lu2011Alg14).

The secondary structure of ALG14 features a conserved amphiphilic α-helix, specifically the third α-helix (α3), which is involved in membrane association. This helix is homologous to the helix Nα3 of E. coli MurG and is conserved among eukaryotic ALG14 proteins (Lu2011Alg14).

In terms of tertiary structure, ALG14's orientation involves its N-terminus within the ER lumen and the C-terminus in the cytosol, facilitating interaction with ALG13 on the cytosolic face of the ER (Averbeck2007Membrane; Gao2005Alg14). The quaternary structure involves forming a hetero-oligomeric complex with ALG13, essential for glycosyltransferase activity (Gao2005Alg14).

## Function
The ALG14 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (GnTase) complex, which also includes ALG13. This complex is essential for the second step of lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis, a key process in N-linked glycosylation. N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification that affects the structure and function of glycoproteins, influencing many essential biological processes (Wang2022An). The ALG13/14 complex specifically transfers a β1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-pyrophosphate-dolichol (Gn-PDol) on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which is crucial for the assembly of the LLO precursor (Wang2022An).

ALG14 acts as a membrane anchor, recruiting ALG13 to the ER membrane, where it becomes active. This recruitment is facilitated by interactions between the C-terminal regions of ALG13 and ALG14 (Lu2011Alg14). The ALG14 protein is structurally conserved across eukaryotes and is necessary for the enzymatic activity of the ALG13/14 complex (Wang2022An). The activity of the ALG13/14 complex is crucial for the viability of cells, as it affects the synthesis of N-glycans, which are important for various cellular functions (Wang2022An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG14 gene are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), a group of genetic disorders characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission leading to muscle weakness. ALG14 mutations can result in reduced cell-surface expression of acetylcholine receptors, which are crucial for neuromuscular function (Cossins2013Congenital; Houlden2013Defective). Specific mutations, such as c.194C>T (p.Pro65Leu) and c.310C>T (p.Arg104*), have been identified in individuals with CMS, leading to reduced ALG14 expression and impaired acetylcholine receptor function (Cossins2013Congenital).

In addition to CMS, ALG14 mutations have been linked to severe early-onset neurodegenerative conditions. These conditions are characterized by muscular hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, and therapy-refractory epilepsy, often resulting in early death (Schorling2017Early). The mutations disrupt the N-linked glycosylation pathway, crucial for protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a broad spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) (Schorling2017Early).

ALG14 mutations have also been implicated in severe intellectual disability, with affected individuals exhibiting symptoms such as early-onset seizures and hypotonia. These findings suggest that ALG14 plays a significant role in neurological development and function (Kvarnung2018Genomic).

## Interactions
ALG14 is a crucial component of the multiglycosyltransferase complex involved in the initiation of lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. It interacts with ALG13 and ALG7 proteins to facilitate this process. The interaction between ALG14 and ALG13 is mediated by their C-terminal regions, forming a dimeric UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex essential for the enzymatic activity required in N-linked glycosylation (Gao2008Interaction; Lu2011Alg14). The last three amino acids of ALG14 are critical for its interaction with ALG13, and altering these residues disrupts the function of ALG14 (Gao2008Interaction).

ALG14 also interacts with ALG7 through its N-terminal region, which is important for the formation of a multiglycosyltransferase complex. This interaction is crucial at higher temperatures, indicating its physiological significance (Lu2011Alg14). ALG14's N-terminal region is also essential for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it recruits ALG13 to the cytosolic face of the ER (Lu2011Alg14; Gao2005Alg14). These interactions highlight ALG14's role as a scaffold that organizes the formation of the glycosyltransferase complex necessary for proper glycosylation processes.
