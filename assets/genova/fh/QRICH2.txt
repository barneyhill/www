# QRICH2

## Overview
QRICH2 is a gene located on human chromosome 17 that encodes the protein glutamine rich 2, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in sperm cells. The protein is characterized by its high glutamine content and is involved in regulating microtubule glutamylation and mitochondrial function, playing a crucial role in sperm motility and energy production (Zhang2024Metabolic). Glutamine rich 2 interacts with α-TUBULIN and other proteins essential for sperm flagellar structure, contributing to the stability and function of microtubules (Zhang2024Metabolic). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as tubulin glutamylation, which are vital for maintaining microtubule integrity (Zhang2024Metabolic). Mutations in the QRICH2 gene are linked to male infertility, particularly due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella, underscoring its significance in reproductive biology (Shen2019Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The QRICH2 gene encodes a protein located on human chromosome 17, consisting of 1663 amino acids and 19 exons (Shen2019Lossoffunction). The protein includes three principal domains: the Glutenin hmw super family, the SMC_N super family, and DUF4795 (Shen2019Lossoffunction). The SMC_N domain is involved in chromatin and DNA dynamics and is conserved in ciliary and centrosomal proteins, suggesting a role in intraflagellar transport (Shen2019Lossoffunction). 

QRICH2 is characterized by a high glutamine content, which may influence its function as a glutamine sensor, regulating microtubule glutamylation and mitochondrial function in sperm (Zhang2024Metabolic). The protein interacts with α-TUBULIN, particularly in the middle piece of the flagella, through specific regions including a magenta helix (His107 to Arg157) and a loop (His570 to Arg584), which are crucial for maintaining microtubule stability (Zhang2024Metabolic). 

QRICH2 has multiple isoforms, with varying lengths such as 1968, 1934, and 1827 amino acids, depending on the splice variant (Hiltpold2022A). These isoforms may result in different functional properties of the protein. The protein's structure and function are further influenced by post-translational modifications, such as tubulin glutamylation, which is critical for microtubule stability (Zhang2024Metabolic).

## Function
The QRICH2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in regulating tubulin glutamylation, mitochondrial function, and sperm motility in both mice and humans. QRICH2 acts as a glutamine sensor, influencing the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, which is essential for maintaining tubulin stability and function. In healthy cells, QRICH2 positively regulates the glutamylation levels of tubulin, crucial for the proper assembly of flagella and sperm motility (Zhang2024Metabolic). The gene interacts with tubulin proteins such as TUBA1C, TUBB4B, and TUBB, and regulates the expression of enzymes like glutamine synthase (GLUL) and glutaminase (GLS) (Zhang2024Metabolic).

QRICH2 is also involved in maintaining normal mitochondrial function. Its knockout or knockdown results in reduced mitochondrial activity and ATP production, particularly evident in sperm cells, where QRICH2 deficiency leads to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and activity, contributing to infertility (Zhang2024Metabolic). The gene's function extends to regulating the ubiquitination of proteins essential for flagella development, suggesting its broader role in spermatogenesis (Zhang2024Metabolic). QRICH2's interaction with tubulin and its regulation of glutamylation and mitochondrial function underscore its importance in cellular processes related to energy production and structural integrity (Zhang2024Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the QRICH2 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Loss-of-function mutations in QRICH2 lead to defects in sperm tail structure, resulting in conditions such as asthenozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility (Shen2019Lossoffunction). Homozygous nonsense mutations in QRICH2 have been identified as a cause of MMAF, leading to dysplasia of the sperm flagellum and male infertility (Shen2019Lossoffunction). These mutations result in irregular sperm ultrastructures, such as absent peripheral fibers or microtubules, and abnormal axonemal arrangements (Shen2019Lossoffunction).

In addition to human studies, QRICH2 mutations have been linked to similar infertility phenotypes in animal models. For instance, a 1-bp deletion in the QRICH2 gene in cattle results in a frameshift mutation, leading to low sperm count and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities (Hiltpold2022A). QRICH2-deficient mice also exhibit MMAF phenotypes and abnormal flagellum ultrastructure, supporting the gene's critical role in sperm motility and structure (Shen2019Lossoffunction).

The QRICH2 gene is also implicated in regulating microtubule glutamylation and mitochondrial function in sperm. Mutations in QRICH2 can lead to dysregulated amino acid metabolism, affecting microtubule stability and sperm motility (Zhang2024Metabolic). These findings underscore the importance of QRICH2 in maintaining normal sperm function and its potential link to conditions like asthenozoospermia (Zhang2024Metabolic).

## Interactions
QRICH2 is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of sperm flagellar development and function. It interacts with α-TUBULIN, a key component of microtubules, through co-immunoprecipitation and Duolink PLA experiments. This interaction is crucial for maintaining microtubule stability and occurs primarily in the middle piece of the sperm flagella (Zhang2024Metabolic). QRICH2 also interacts with proteins such as AKAP3, ODF2, CABYR, and TSSK4, which are essential for sperm tail structure and function. These interactions help regulate the expression and stability of these proteins, preventing their ubiquitination degradation and ensuring proper sperm flagellar formation (Shen2019Lossoffunction).

QRICH2 acts as a trans-acting factor, enhancing the transcriptional activity of ODF2 and CABYR by binding to their promoter regions (Shen2019Lossoffunction). It also stabilizes the TSSK4/ODF2-mediated pathways, which are crucial for sperm tail structure growth (Shen2019Lossoffunction). These interactions highlight QRICH2's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella, contributing to its importance in male fertility.
