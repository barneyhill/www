# BACH1

## Overview
BACH1 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of oxidative stress response and heme metabolism. The protein encoded by BACH1, known as BTB domain and CNC homolog 1, is characterized by the presence of a BTB domain and a basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor. BACH1 primarily functions by binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoters of target genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), thereby modulating gene expression in response to intracellular heme levels and oxidative stress (Reichard2008BACH1; Pulkkinen2011Heme). The protein's activity is regulated through interactions with small MAF proteins and heme, which influence its nuclear localization and stability (Padilla2021A; ZenkeKawasaki2007Heme). BACH1's dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it plays a role in processes such as angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis (Xie2022Overexpression; Igarashi2021The).

## Structure
The BACH1 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a BTB domain and a basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain. The BTB domain, located at residues 1-122, is crucial for protein-protein interactions, facilitating dimerization and oligomerization, which are common features among BTB domains (Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins; Ohira1998Characterization). The bZip domain, found at residues 527-619, is involved in DNA binding and dimerization, essential for the protein's role in gene regulation (Ohira1998Characterization).

The primary structure of BACH1 includes 736 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 82 kDa (Ohira1998Characterization). The secondary structure likely comprises α-helices and β-strands, particularly in the BTB domain, which is known for its core BTB fold (Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation of the protein, including the folding of the BTB domain and the arrangement of the bZip region (Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins).

In terms of quaternary structure, BACH1 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other bZip proteins, such as MafK, influencing its regulatory functions (Ohira1998Characterization; Oyake1996Bach). The BTB domain is particularly important for these interactions, as it mediates the formation of multiprotein complexes (Oyake1996Bach).

## Function
BACH1 (BTB domain and CNC homolog 1) is a transcriptional repressor that plays a crucial role in regulating heme metabolism and oxidative stress response in healthy human cells. It functions by binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoters of target genes, most notably the heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) gene, which is involved in heme degradation and protection against oxidative damage (Reichard2008BACH1; Pulkkinen2011Heme). BACH1's repression of HMOX1 is significant because HMOX1 breaks down heme into products with antioxidant properties, thus preventing toxicity from excessive heme accumulation (Reichard2008BACH1).

Under normal physiological conditions, BACH1 is active in the nucleus, where it forms heterodimers with Maf-related proteins to bind Maf recognition elements (MAREs) and suppress gene expression (Hou2012The). The activity of BACH1 is regulated by intracellular heme levels; increased heme or oxidative stress leads to BACH1 inactivation, allowing for the induction of HMOX1 and other protective genes (Reichard2008BACH1). This regulation is crucial for maintaining intracellular heme homeostasis and preventing oxidative damage (Reichard2008BACH1; Pulkkinen2011Heme). BACH1's role is specific to HMOX1 induction and does not broadly affect other MARE-regulated genes (Reichard2008BACH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BACH1 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In cancer, BACH1 is involved in processes such as angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. It can promote angiogenesis in ovarian cancer by increasing VEGFC expression, while in pancreatic cancer, it inhibits angiogenesis by repressing genes like HMOX1 and VEGFA (Igarashi2021The). BACH1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis (Xie2022Overexpression; Lignitto2019Nrf2). In breast and lung cancers, high BACH1 expression correlates with increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis (Padilla2021A).

BACH1 mutations are prevalent in cancer cells, with significant mutation frequencies observed in Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), where they are associated with better prognosis (Liu2022Uncovering). In pancreatic cancer, BACH1 promotes metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is involved in a feedback loop with labile iron (Song2023Pathophysiological). BACH1 also plays a role in DNA damage repair, and mutations in its interacting domains can lead to chromosomal instability, contributing to cancer development (Muhseena2021The). These findings highlight BACH1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
BACH1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in both transcription regulation and mitotic processes. During mitosis, BACH1 interacts with CRM1, which is crucial for its nuclear export and mitotic spindle orientation. The deletion of the C-terminal CLS of BACH1 disrupts its ability to orient mitotic spindles, highlighting the importance of CRM1 in this process (Li2018Phosphorylation). BACH1 also interacts with HMMR, a key player in spindle orientation, although BACH1 functions downstream of HMMR (Li2018Phosphorylation).

In transcription regulation, BACH1 forms heterodimers with small MAF proteins, such as MAFF, MAFG, and MAFK, to recognize DNA elements known as MAF recognition elements (MAREs) (Padilla2021A). BACH1 also interacts with heme, which leads to its nuclear export and proteasomal degradation, thereby releasing transcription suppression of target genes like heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) (Padilla2021A). Additionally, BACH1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HOIL-1, which mediates its ubiquitination in a heme-regulated manner (ZenkeKawasaki2007Heme). These interactions underscore BACH1's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
