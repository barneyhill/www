# SDHAF2

## Overview
SDHAF2, or succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein essential for the proper assembly and function of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as mitochondrial complex II. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating the conversion of succinate to fumarate within the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, processes critical for ATP production and energy metabolism (Wolf2019A; Kugelberg2013Role). SDHAF2 is specifically involved in the flavinylation of the SDHA subunit, a necessary step for the SDH complex's activity and stability (Dwight2017Analysis). Mutations in the SDHAF2 gene have been linked to hereditary paragangliomas, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis (Hensen2010Recent; Wolf2019A).

## Function
SDHAF2, also known as succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2, is a crucial component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also referred to as mitochondrial complex II. This complex is integral to both the electron transport chain and the Krebs cycle, playing a vital role in cellular respiration by facilitating the conversion of succinate to fumarate, which is essential for ATP production (Wolf2019A; Kugelberg2013Role).

SDHAF2 is specifically involved in the assembly and stabilization of the SDH complex. It is necessary for the covalent attachment of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to the SDHA subunit, a process critical for the proper functioning of the SDH complex (Dwight2017Analysis). This flavinylation is essential for SDH activity, ensuring efficient electron transfer within the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is crucial for energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Dwight2017Analysis).

The SDHAF2 protein is active in the mitochondria, where it supports the assembly and function of complex II, contributing to the overall efficiency of cellular respiration. Proper function of SDHAF2 is essential for maintaining energy balance and metabolic processes in healthy human cells (Wolf2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHAF2 gene are primarily associated with hereditary paragangliomas, particularly those occurring in the head and neck region. These tumors are linked to a specific missense mutation, c.232G>A (p.Gly78Arg), which has been identified in a large Dutch kindred and another unrelated family, indicating a potential residual activity of the mutated protein (Hensen2010Recent). Another variant, a nonsense mutation (c.347G.A;p.W116X), results in premature protein truncation and affects conserved areas of the gene, leading to carotid body paragangliomas and thyroid neoplasias (Wolf2019A).

SDHAF2 mutations exhibit high penetrance, with a significant proportion of carriers developing tumors, often in a familial pattern (Hensen2010Recent). These mutations are characterized by low metastatic potential and are typically inherited in a paternal manner (Wolf2019A). The gene's role in tumorigenesis is linked to its function in the succinate dehydrogenase complex, where mutations can impair the interaction with SDHA, leading to destabilization of the SDHAF2 protein (Wolf2019A). Screening for SDHAF2 mutations is recommended for patients with familial antecedents, multiple tumors, or early onset of head and neck paragangliomas (Hensen2010Recent).

## Interactions
SDHAF2, also known as succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2, plays a crucial role in the maturation and assembly of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as Complex II. SDHAF2 interacts directly with the SDHA subunit, forming the initial SDHA-SDHAF2 complex during the maturation process. This interaction is independent of the presence or covalent status of FAD, indicating that SDHAF2 binding does not require FAD (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). SDHAF2 acts as a protein-protein binding interface, enhancing the covalent flavinylation of SDHA indirectly by optimizing the active site architecture for this process (Sharma2019Maturation).

SDHAF2 must be displaced by SDHAF4 for the proper assembly of Complex II, as SDHAF4 binds to SDHA and displaces SDHAF2, forming a new complex, SDHA-AF4. This displacement is crucial for the transition of SDHA between different assembly intermediates (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). The interactions between SDHAF2 and SDHA are characterized by strong binding at the N- and C-termini of SDHAF2, although this does not significantly increase the secondary structure of SDHAF2 (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of the SDH complex.
