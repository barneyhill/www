# KCNRG

## Overview
The KCNRG gene encodes a protein known as the potassium channel regulator, which is a member of the KCTD protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of potassium ion channels, particularly those with a tetramerization domain homologous to voltage-gated potassium channels. KCNRG plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis by modulating the activity of these channels, thereby influencing cellular excitability and proliferation. Structurally, the KCNRG protein forms a pentameric assembly and is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with specific potassium channels to suppress their activity. This suppression is crucial for its proposed function as a tumor suppressor, as it reduces the surface expression of potassium channels, thereby impacting cell division and apoptosis. The gene is located on chromosome 13q14 and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, due to its regulatory role in potassium channel activity (Ivanov2003A; Usman2010Potassium; Alimohammadi2009Pulmonary).

## Structure
The KCNRG protein is encoded by the KCNRG gene located in the 13q14 region and is a member of the KCTD protein family. It encodes two isoforms in humans: KCNRG-L and KCNRG-S, which differ in their C-terminal ends but share a common N-terminal sequence of 184 amino acids. The T1 tetramerization domain, spanning amino acids 7 to 98, is crucial for its function and shows homology to the tetramerization domain of voltage-gated potassium channels (Ivanov2003A; Birerdinc2009Proapoptotic).

The KCNRG protein forms a pentameric structure, as predicted by AlphaFold models. Its C-terminal domain (CTD) adopts a propeller-like assembly with a central cavity surrounded by exposed β-strands, a structural motif common among KCTD family members (Esposito2022Alphafold). The protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and oligomerizes in the cytosol, interacting with the N-terminus of specific potassium channels (Usman2010Potassium).

The KCNRG-S isoform is characterized by an out-of-frame insertion of an alternatively spliced exon derived from an AluSp SINE repeat, which is unique to humans (Birerdinc2009Proapoptotic). The protein's structure includes primary sequence information and specific domains like the T1 domain, but details on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The KCNRG gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating potassium ion channels, specifically those homologous to the tetramerization domain of voltage-gated potassium channels. This regulation is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing cellular excitability. KCNRG is involved in modulating the activity of these channels by interacting with their tetramerization domain, which can suppress potassium channel activity. This suppression is important because enhanced potassium channel activity is associated with increased cell division and proliferation (Ivanov2003A).

In healthy human cells, KCNRG is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor by interfering with the normal assembly of potassium channel proteins, thereby reducing their activity. This reduction in activity is achieved by retaining a fraction of these channels in endomembranes, thus decreasing their surface expression and whole-cell potassium currents (Usman2010Potassium). The protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it can oligomerize and interact with the N-terminus of specific potassium channels, such as hKv1.1 and hKv1.4, impacting cellular processes like cell division and apoptosis (Usman2010Potassium).

## Clinical Significance
The KCNRG gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In the context of cancer, KCNRG is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene. It is located at chromosome band 13q14.3, a region associated with deletions in various tumors, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) and prostate cancer. The gene is thought to suppress potassium channel activity, which is significant because potassium channels are involved in cell proliferation (Ivanov2003A).

In hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), a missense mutation in KCNRG at codon 92 has been identified, which may lead to a loss of its regulatory role on potassium channels, contributing to increased cell proliferation. This mutation, along with allelic loss of the gene, is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis in HCC, particularly in hepatitis B virus-positive cases (Cho2006Genetic).

KCNRG is also identified as a bronchial autoantigen in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), where it is associated with pulmonary autoimmunity. Autoantibodies against KCNRG are found in APS-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, suggesting its role in the disease's pulmonary manifestations (Alimohammadi2009Pulmonary).

## Interactions
KCNRG interacts with various potassium channels, including hKv1.1 and hKv1.4, by reducing their total currents when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This suggests a regulatory role in modulating the surface expression and function of these channels. KCNRG does not affect the voltage dependence or activation kinetics of the channels, indicating that its effect might be due to a reduction in the number of channels reaching the plasma membrane. KCNRG is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and does not appear on the plasma membrane, suggesting it may regulate channel trafficking by retaining a fraction of channels in endomembranes (Usman2010Potassium).

KCNRG can oligomerize in the cytosol, forming complexes with itself, and interacts with the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of hKv1.1. The presence of the T1 domain in hKv1.4 is essential for KCNRG to reduce whole-cell current, as hKv1.4 lacking this domain does not show reduced current when co-expressed with KCNRG (Usman2010Potassium). KCNRG is also proposed to interfere with the assembly of the T1 domain of Kv channels, reducing the number of functional channels and whole-cell K+ currents (Usman2010Potassium).
