# BTG3

## Overview
BTG3, also known as BTG anti-proliferation factor 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the BTG/Tob family, which is recognized for its involvement in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The BTG3 protein functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage responses. It achieves this by promoting the ubiquitination and activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), thereby facilitating DNA repair processes and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Cheng2013Candidate). Additionally, BTG3 interacts with various signaling pathways, including the Akt and Ras/MAP kinase pathways, to suppress tumorigenic processes (Gou2015The). The gene's expression is often altered in various cancers, where its downregulation is associated with increased malignancy and poor prognosis, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Deng2013Decreased; Lv2017The).

## Function
BTG3 (BTG anti-proliferation factor 3) is a crucial component in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It is a member of the BTG/Tob family, known for its role in cell cycle control and apoptosis. BTG3 functions primarily by promoting the ubiquitination and activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a key player in the DNA damage response. This process is mediated through the cullin-RING ligase 4 Cdt2 E3 complex, facilitating CHK1's chromatin association and activation, which is essential for cell cycle checkpoint maintenance and cell survival after DNA damage (Cheng2013Candidate).

BTG3 also interacts with the transcription factor E2F1, inhibiting its DNA-binding activity and thus regulating S-phase entry and cell cycle progression (Winkler2009The). It is involved in the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring proper kinetochore attachment and preventing mitotic slippage, which is crucial for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Cheng2013Candidate).

In addition to its nuclear functions, BTG3 is involved in cytoplasmic signaling pathways, where it suppresses Akt and Ras/MAP kinase signaling, contributing to its role as a tumor suppressor (Gou2015The). Overall, BTG3's activities are vital for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
BTG3 (BTG anti-proliferation factor 3) is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. Alterations in BTG3 expression are associated with cancer progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, BTG3 mRNA expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with hypoexpression linked to poorer survival outcomes (Zheng2022The). In colorectal cancer (CRC), BTG3 is significantly downregulated, and its reduced expression correlates with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as decreased apoptosis. This downregulation is associated with unfavorable prognosis, making BTG3 an independent prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival in CRC patients (Lv2017The).

In ovarian cancer, lower BTG3 expression is observed in more aggressive and advanced-stage epithelial ovarian carcinomas, correlating with shorter overall and disease-free survival times. This suggests that BTG3 downregulation contributes to the pathogenesis and aggressiveness of the disease (Deng2013Decreased). In renal cancer, BTG3 is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which silences its tumor suppressor function. Reactivation of BTG3 through demethylating agents like genistein has shown potential in reducing cancer cell proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest (Majid2009BTG3).

## Interactions
BTG3, a member of the BTG/Tob family, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role as a tumor suppressor. In the nuclear compartment, BTG3 interacts with E2F1, Smad8, and the CCR4-associated protein Caf1, which are crucial for suppressing cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (Zheng2022The). BTG3 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by promoting Lys63-linked ubiquitination and CHK1 activation, forming a positive feedback loop (Zheng2022The).

In the cytosolic compartment, BTG3 binds to and suppresses the src, Akt, and Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathways, highlighting its involvement in regulating cell cycle, metabolism, splicing, and RNA translation (Zheng2022The). In colorectal cancer, BTG3 knockdown affects the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (Lv2017The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, the RNA-binding protein PUM2 interacts with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of BTG3, influencing its expression. This interaction is confirmed through RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays, suggesting that PUM2 regulates BTG3 expression and impacts cell proliferation and apoptosis (Liu2022RNA).
