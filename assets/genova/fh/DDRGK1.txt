# DDRGK1

## Overview
DDRGK1, or DDRGK domain-containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, and autophagy. The DDRGK1 protein is integral to the NF-kB signaling pathway, where it modulates the stability of IkBa, influencing cell proliferation and stress responses (Xi2013DDRGK1). Additionally, DDRGK1 plays a critical role in maintaining ER homeostasis by stabilizing IRE1α, a key protein in the unfolded protein response, through ufmylation-dependent interactions (Liu2017A). The protein is also essential for lysosomal function and autophagy regulation, as it supports the expression of v-ATPase subunits necessary for lysosomal acidification (Cao2021DDRGK1). Mutations in the DDRGK1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including Shohat-type spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia and certain leukemias, highlighting its clinical significance (Egunsola2017Loss; Xi2013DDRGK1).

## Function
DDRGK1, also known as DDRGK domain-containing protein 1, is a crucial component in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in regulating the NF-kB signaling pathway by modulating the stability of IkBa, a protein that inhibits NF-kB activity. DDRGK1 interacts with IkBa, affecting its phosphorylation and degradation, which is essential for NF-kB activation and the transcription of target genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses (Xi2013DDRGK1).

In addition to its role in NF-kB signaling, DDRGK1 is vital for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. It stabilizes the IRE1α protein, a key sensor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), through ufmylation-dependent interactions. This stabilization is crucial for the proper functioning of the IRE1α-XBP1 signaling pathway, which helps restore ER homeostasis and promotes cell survival under stress conditions (Liu2017A).

DDRGK1 is also involved in autophagy regulation and lysosomal function. It maintains the expression of v-ATPase subunits, which are essential for lysosomal acidification and function. DDRGK1 deficiency can lead to impaired autophagic degradation and lysosomal dysfunction, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis (Cao2021DDRGK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DDRGK1 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. A homozygous c.408+1G>A mutation in DDRGK1 is associated with Shohat-type spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), a form of chondrodysplasia characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as very short limbs and vertebral defects. This mutation leads to the loss of DDRGK1 protein expression, resulting in increased ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of SOX9, a transcription factor crucial for cartilage development (Egunsola2017Loss).

DDRGK1 is also implicated in hematopoietic dysfunction and impaired intestinal homeostasis due to its role in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and autophagic degradation. Deficiency in DDRGK1 can lead to extensive ER stress, lysosomal dysfunction, and increased apoptosis, contributing to various physiological and pathological conditions (Cao2021DDRGK1).

Alterations in DDRGK1 expression have been linked to acute myeloblastic leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia through translocations near its gene region. Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism within DDRGK1 is associated with decreased platelet counts in response to hepatitis C therapy (Xi2013DDRGK1). DDRGK1 has also been associated with myocardial infarction in Koreans and potentially with Parkinson's disease, although the latter requires further confirmation (Lee2017Genomebased; Redenšek2017Genetic).

## Interactions
DDRGK1 is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), a key protein in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining IRE1α stability and is dependent on the ufmylation of DDRGK1 at lysine 267. DDRGK1's interaction with IRE1α helps regulate the IRE1α-XBP1 signaling pathway and the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP apoptotic pathway, which are essential for managing ER stress (Liu2017A).

DDRGK1 also interacts with SOX9, a transcription factor important for chondrogenesis. It forms a complex with SOX9 to regulate its ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting its proteasomal degradation and stabilizing the protein. This interaction is significant during cartilage development, particularly in the mesenchymal condensation stage of chondrocyte differentiation (Egunsola2017Loss).

In the context of lysosomal function, DDRGK1 interacts with Atp6v0d1, a subunit of the lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase. This interaction is important for the proteasome-mediated degradation of v-ATPase subunits, which is crucial for maintaining normal lysosomal function (Cao2021DDRGK1).
