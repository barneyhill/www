# SYN2

## Overview
The SYN2 gene encodes synapsin II, a neuronal phosphoprotein that plays a pivotal role in synaptic function and plasticity. Synapsin II is primarily involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle dynamics, including mobilization, docking, fusion, and recycling at the presynaptic terminal. As a member of the synapsin family, synapsin II is categorized as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein, which interacts with actin filaments and synaptic vesicle phospholipids to facilitate synaptic vesicle clustering and stabilization. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, which influences its interactions and activity. Synapsin II is crucial for maintaining the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles, thereby ensuring sustained neurotransmitter release during repetitive neuronal activity. Dysregulation of SYN2 has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal communication and function (Longhena2021An; Cesca2010The).

## Structure
Synapsin II (SYN2) is a neuronal phosphoprotein involved in synaptic vesicle regulation. The primary structure of SYN2 includes specific domains such as the N-terminal A domain and the C-terminal E domain. The N-terminal region is highly conserved and includes domains A, B, and C. Domain A contains a major phosphorylation site crucial for modulating the association with synaptic vesicles, while domain B acts as a linker. Domain C is involved in core functions like interaction with actin filaments and synaptic vesicle phospholipids, and it facilitates synapsin homo- and heterodimerization (Longhena2021An; Cesca2010The).

The C-terminal region of SYN2 varies among isoforms due to alternative splicing, with domain E being highly conserved and important for synapsin targeting and synaptic vesicle trafficking. Domain E is also implicated in synapsin dimerization and synaptic vesicle clustering, playing a key role in maintaining the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles and regulating exocytosis kinetics (Monaldi2010The; Longhena2021An).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are significant for SYN2 function. Phosphorylation sites, such as serine 546 in domain E, are consensus sites for CaMKII, indicating a complex regulation of synapsin function (Cesca2010The). Synapsin II can form homodimers or heterodimers with other synapsins, which are crucial for synaptic vesicle clustering and stabilization (Monaldi2010The).

## Function
Synapsin II (SYN2) is a synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in synaptic function and plasticity. It is primarily active in the presynaptic terminal, where it regulates neurotransmitter release by modulating synaptic vesicle (SV) mobilization, docking, fusion, and recycling (Longhena2021An; Cesca2010The). SYN2 is involved in maintaining the reserve pool of SVs, which is essential for sustained neurotransmitter release during repetitive stimulation (Cesca2010The). It interacts with actin filaments and synaptic vesicle phospholipids, facilitating synapsin dimerization and clustering of SVs at presynaptic sites (Cesca2010The).

SYN2 also plays a role in synaptogenesis, contributing to the formation, maintenance, and rearrangement of synaptic contacts (Cesca2010The). It is involved in the regulation of both synchronous and asynchronous neurotransmitter release, influencing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission, which is crucial for normal neuronal function (Longhena2021An). Alterations in SYN2 activity can lead to dysfunctions in neuronal communication and are associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (Longhena2021An; Schwark2022Synapsin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SYN2 gene have been associated with various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. The SYN2 rs3773364 A>G polymorphism, in particular, has been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy in certain populations. Studies have shown that the AG genotype of this polymorphism is more prevalent among epilepsy patients, suggesting it may confer a risk for the condition (Lakhan2009Association; Hameedi2021Association). However, this association is not consistent across all ethnic groups, as research in a Malaysian tri-ethnic population found no significant link between the SYN2 rs3773364 A>G polymorphism and epilepsy susceptibility (Haerian2011Lack).

In addition to epilepsy, alterations in SYN2 expression or mutations can lead to presynaptic functional defects, contributing to the pathogenesis of other neurological disorders. The gene's role in synaptic vesicle regulation is crucial for maintaining neuronal network excitability, and its dysfunction can result in unbalanced brain excitability, leading to epileptic seizures (Hameedi2021Association). The presence of seizures in synapsin-depleted animal models further underscores the clinical relevance of SYN2 in neurochemical and physiological functioning (Etholm2012Neuroethologically).

## Interactions
Synapsin II (SYN2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synaptic function. SYN2 interacts with presynaptic calcium channels, particularly the P/Q-type (Cav2.1), to modulate neurotransmitter release at inhibitory synapses. This interaction is essential for promoting asynchronous GABA release, which is disrupted in SYN2 knockout models (Medrihan2013Synapsin). SYN2 does not interact with Cav2.2 (N-type) or Cav2.3 (R-type) channels, highlighting its specificity (Medrihan2013Synapsin).

SYN2 also binds to the actin cytoskeleton, influencing actin dynamics and neurite outgrowth. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which can inhibit SYN2's actin-binding and bundling activity (Cesca2010The). SYN2's interaction with actin is crucial for synaptic vesicle tethering and synaptic plasticity (Cesca2010The).

Additionally, SYN2 interacts with other proteins such as CAPON, an adapter for neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1, which may be involved in neurological disorders like schizophrenia (Cesca2010The). These interactions underscore SYN2's role in maintaining synaptic structure and function through its involvement in complex protein networks.
