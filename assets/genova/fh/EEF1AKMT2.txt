# EEF1AKMT2

## Overview
EEF1AKMT2 is a gene that encodes the protein EEF1A lysine methyltransferase 2, also known as METTL10. This protein is categorized as a lysine methyltransferase, which specifically targets the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) at lysine 318, facilitating its trimethylation. The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT2 is a critical post-translational modification that influences the function of eEF1A, a pivotal component of the protein synthesis machinery responsible for the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome during translation elongation (Jakobsson2018Regulation; Xu2022Functions). Beyond its role in translation, EEF1AKMT2-mediated methylation is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton organization and protein degradation, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Xu2022Functions). The activity of EEF1AKMT2 is predominantly cytoplasmic, where it affects translation efficiency and fidelity, influencing cellular growth and differentiation (Jakobsson2018Regulation).

## Function
EEF1AKMT2, also known as METTL10, is a lysine methyltransferase that specifically targets the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) at lysine 318, resulting in trimethylation (Jakobsson2018Regulation; Xu2022Functions). This post-translational modification plays a crucial role in regulating the function of eEF1A, which is a key component of the protein synthesis machinery. eEF1A is responsible for delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome during translation elongation, a process essential for protein synthesis (Xu2022Functions).

The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT2 is significant for various cellular processes beyond its canonical role in translation. It is involved in cytoskeleton organization, protein degradation, and other cellular activities, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Xu2022Functions). The activity of EEF1AKMT2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it modulates translation efficiency and fidelity, impacting cellular growth and differentiation (Jakobsson2018Regulation).

While the specific function of EEF1AKMT2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in methylating eEF1A suggests it is crucial for maintaining proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Jakobsson2018Regulation).
