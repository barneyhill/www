# LIPJ

## Overview
LIPJ is a gene that encodes the protein lipase family member J, which is part of the broader lipase family. Lipases are enzymes that play a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of fats into fatty acids and glycerol. The protein encoded by LIPJ is involved in various biological processes, including lipid digestion, transport, and processing. As a member of the lipase family, lipase family member J is characterized by its ability to interact with lipid substrates, facilitating their breakdown and absorption. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in the study of metabolic pathways and disorders related to lipid metabolism (Qiu2020aarFDC).
