# GHDC

## Overview
The GHDC gene encodes the GH3 domain-containing protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a GH3 domain, a motif commonly associated with proteins that participate in signal transduction and regulatory functions. Although the precise biological role of the GH3 domain-containing protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in modulating cellular responses to external stimuli, potentially through interactions with other signaling molecules. The GHDC gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in human health and disease, as suggested by emerging research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
