# KRTAP7-1

## Overview
KRTAP7-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 7-1, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral to the structure and function of hair, particularly in the processes of keratinization and crosslinking within the hair follicle. The KRTAP7-1 gene is predominantly expressed in the cortex/matrix cell region of the hair follicle, with notable expression in scalp hair compared to other body regions, such as beard hair. This suggests a specialized role in the structural integrity and function of hair in different areas of the body (Rogers2006Human). The protein itself is distinguished by its unique amino acid composition, which includes lower levels of glycine and tyrosine and higher levels of serine and asparagine, potentially affecting its interaction with keratin intermediate filaments and contributing to the mechanical properties of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP7-1 (keratin-associated protein 7-1) is a member of the keratin-associated protein family, which plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair. This protein is primarily expressed in the hair follicle, particularly in the cortex/matrix cell region, which is involved in hair keratinization and crosslinking processes (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP7-1 is noted for its high level of expression in scalp hairs compared to beard hairs, indicating a body region-specific variation in expression, which suggests its role in the structural integrity or function of hair in different body regions (Rogers2006Human).

The protein encoded by KRTAP7-1 is characterized by a lower glycine and tyrosine content compared to other KAP families, and it has a high serine and asparagine content (Rogers2006Human). This composition may influence its interaction with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. Although the specific molecular activities of KRTAP7-1 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression pattern and amino acid composition suggest a role in maintaining hair fiber formation and integrity (Rogers2006Human).
