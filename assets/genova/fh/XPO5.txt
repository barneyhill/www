# XPO5

## Overview
Exportin 5 (XPO5) is a gene that encodes the protein exportin 5, which is a member of the karyopherin family of transport receptors. This protein plays a pivotal role in the nuclear export of precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and other small RNAs, facilitating their transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Exportin 5 is characterized by its unique structure, which includes HEAT repeats that form a superhelical shape, allowing it to bind RNA molecules in a sequence-independent manner. The protein's interaction with RanGTP is essential for its function, as it forms a ternary complex that is recognized by the nuclear pore complex, ensuring efficient RNA transport. Disruptions in the function of XPO5 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where mutations can impair miRNA processing and contribute to tumorigenesis (Wang2011Dynamic; BOHNSACK2004Exportin; Melo2010A).

## Structure
Exportin 5 (XPO5) is a protein involved in the nuclear export of pre-microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and other small RNAs. The structure of XPO5 is characterized by a series of HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs composed of hairpins of two antiparallel alpha-helices. These repeats form a superhelical structure, giving XPO5 a U-like shape that is crucial for its function in RNA binding and transport (Wang2011Dynamic). The protein's inner surface is positively charged, allowing it to interact with the negatively charged RNA molecules through hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions (Okada2009A).

XPO5 forms a complex with RanGTP and pre-miRNA, adopting a conformation that resembles a baseball mitt, which securely holds the pre-miRNA and protects it from degradation (Okada2009A). The protein's structure is flexible, allowing it to undergo conformational changes necessary for binding and releasing its RNA cargo (Wang2011Dynamic). The interaction with RanGTP is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of XPO5 and facilitating the export process (Wang2011Dynamic).

XPO5 does not have an obvious double-stranded RNA-binding domain, which is common in other RNA-binding proteins, indicating a unique structural feature for its RNA-binding site (BOHNSACK2004Exportin). The protein's ability to bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner is primarily due to its interaction with the RNA's phosphate backbone (Wang2011Dynamic).

## Function
Exportin 5 (XPO5) is a crucial protein in the nuclear export of precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in healthy human cells. It functions as a transport receptor, facilitating the movement of pre-miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a critical step in miRNA biogenesis. XPO5 operates in conjunction with the GTP-bound form of the Ran cofactor, forming a ternary complex that is recognized by the nuclear pore complex, ensuring the proper maturation and function of miRNAs (Okada2009A; Melo2010A). 

In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are further processed by Dicer into mature miRNAs, which are essential for regulating gene expression and various biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Wu2018The; Okada2009A). XPO5 also plays a role in the nuclear export of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), enhancing RNA interference mediated by shRNAs and miRNAs (YI2004Overexpression). 

The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as disruptions in XPO5 function can lead to impaired miRNA processing and have been associated with pathological conditions such as cancer (Wu2018The; Melo2010A). XPO5's role in miRNA biogenesis underscores its importance in gene regulation and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the XPO5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer cells, mutations in XPO5 can lead to the trapping of precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in the nucleus, resulting in inefficient processing and reduced expression of mature miRNAs with tumor-suppressor properties. This impairment is associated with the upregulation of target oncoproteins such as EZH2, MYC, and K-RAS, contributing to cancer progression (Melo2010A). Reintroducing wild-type XPO5 in mutant cells can restore miRNA expression and inhibit cancer growth (Melo2010A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), XPO5 is downregulated, which is linked to increased cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. Knockdown of XPO5 promotes cell migration and decreases the expression of E-cadherin and p53, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Li2016Downregulation).

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XPO5, such as rs11077, have been associated with increased cancer risk and altered mRNA expression levels. This SNP is linked to higher cancer susceptibility and affects miRNA binding, potentially influencing miRNA expression and function (Wang2020SingleNucleotide; Shao2020Association). XPO5 mutations have also been implicated in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), highlighting its role in renal diseases (Braun2016Mutations).

## Interactions
Exportin 5 (XPO5) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA metabolism. XPO5 primarily interacts with pre-microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and other small RNAs, facilitating their nuclear export in a RanGTP-dependent manner. It binds to pre-miRNA hairpins and their flanking regions, indicating its role in miRNA processing (Wang2020XPO5). XPO5 also interacts with primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) independently of RanGTP, enhancing their processing by the DROSHA/DGCR8 microprocessor complex (Wang2020XPO5).

In cancer cells, mutations in XPO5 can impair its ability to bind and export pre-miRNAs, leading to their nuclear retention and disrupted miRNA biogenesis (Melo2010A). XPO5 also binds to double-stranded RNA binding proteins (dsRBPs) such as ILF3, mediating their nuclear export in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Brownawell2002Exportin5). This interaction is sensitive to deletions in specific helices of the dsRBD, indicating a precise binding domain (Brownawell2002Exportin5).

XPO5's interactions extend to various cellular RNAs, including vtRNA, 7SL RNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and tRNA, showing a preference for double-stranded RNA regions (Wang2020XPO5). These interactions highlight XPO5's multifaceted role in RNA transport and processing.
