# CREBZF

## Overview
CREBZF is a gene that encodes the CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor, also known as Zhangfei, which is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), cell growth, and apoptosis. It functions primarily as a transcriptional coregulator, interacting with other proteins to modulate their activity rather than binding DNA directly as a homodimer. CREBZF is involved in significant cellular pathways, such as the stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the modulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Its interactions with proteins like STAT3, Smad8, and ATF4 highlight its diverse regulatory roles. Clinically, alterations in CREBZF expression have been linked to various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2013Effects; Zhou2023CREBZF; Lee2012CREBZF).

## Structure
The CREBZF protein, also known as Zhangfei, is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. Its primary structure includes a polypeptide of 354 amino acids, with the potential for alternative splicing and differential translational initiation, resulting in multiple isoforms (Li2022A). The protein contains a leucine zipper and a basic region, which lacks an asparagine residue typically conserved in most bLZip proteins (Zhang2013Effects). This structure facilitates its interaction with other proteins rather than binding DNA as a homodimer (Zhang2010Amino).

CREBZF can produce several isoforms, including a long isoform (lZF), a short isoform (sZF), and a short-tailed isoform (stZF), which is induced by prolonged ER stress and includes a pentapeptide tail, IFFFR, at the C-terminus (Li2022A). The stZF isoform is particularly significant for activating the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP during cellular stress (Li2022A). The long isoforms have a molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa, which is greater than the calculated mass due to post-translational modifications on the extra 82 amino acids at the N-terminus (Li2022A). These modifications likely contribute to the protein's functional diversity.

## Function
CREBZF, also known as Zhangfei, is a transcriptional coregulator involved in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cell growth regulation. In healthy human cells, CREBZF plays a significant role in modulating the UPR, a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum. It achieves this by interacting with and suppressing the activity of transcription factors such as Xbp1s, leading to the degradation of Xbp1s and reducing the expression of UPR-related genes and proteins (Zhang2013ZhangfeiCREBZF).

CREBZF also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, stabilizing it by displacing Mdm2, a protein that facilitates p53 degradation. This interaction enhances p53's tumor suppressor functions, such as cell growth arrest and apoptosis, particularly in cells with functional p53 (Zhang2013Effects). CREBZF's influence on p53 is mediated through its basic-region leucine zipper domain, which is crucial for its regulatory functions (Zhang2013Effects).

In addition to its role in stress responses, CREBZF is involved in chromatin modification processes, interacting with proteins like HCF-1 to influence histone methylation and gene expression (Jueraitetibaike2023MiR4255p). These activities highlight CREBZF's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CREBZF gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC) and breast cancer (BC). In gastric cancer, CREBZF acts as a tumor suppressor by enhancing p53 activity, a key tumor suppressor protein. The downregulation of CREBZF, often mediated by upregulated miRNAs such as hsa-miR-421 and hsa-miR-29b-1-5p, is associated with increased cell migration and progression from gastric adenoma/dysplasia to gastric adenocarcinoma (Kim2020miRNAs). In breast cancer, CREBZF inhibits the transcription of ADAR1 by suppressing STAT3 dimerization, which is crucial for cell cycle progression. Overexpression of CREBZF in BC cells suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2023CREBZF).

CREBZF is also involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cellular stress responses. It can induce apoptosis by promoting p53 stabilization and nuclear retention, which may be leveraged for cancer treatment (Zhang2013Effects). In canine osteosarcoma, CREBZF suppresses cell growth and metastasis by stabilizing p53, although its effectiveness may depend on the presence of functional p53 (Zhang2015The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CREBZF in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CREBZF, also known as Zhangfei, is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that interacts with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular pathways. It interacts with the STAT3 protein, affecting its dimerization and transcriptional activity. Overexpression of CREBZF in breast cancer cells hinders STAT3 dimerization, leading to decreased ADAR1 expression and increased circPAPD4 levels (Zhou2023CREBZF).

CREBZF also binds to Smad8, as well as Smads 1 and 5, which are involved in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways. This interaction inhibits the promoter activity of the BMP response element, suggesting a role in modulating BMP signaling (Lee2012CREBZF).

In the context of cellular stress responses, CREBZF interacts with ATF4, enhancing its binding to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and augmenting its transactivation potential. This interaction is facilitated through their bZIP regions, forming heterodimeric complexes (Hogan2005Cooperative).

CREBZF also interacts with the host cell factor (HCF), inhibiting the transcription factor Luman, which requires HCF for its activity. This interaction is crucial for CREBZF's ability to suppress Luman's transcriptional activation (Misra2005Zhangfei).
