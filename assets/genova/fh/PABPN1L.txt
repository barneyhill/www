# PABPN1L

## Overview
PABPN1L is a gene that encodes the protein PABPN1 like, cytoplasmic, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of maternal mRNA during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in mammals. This protein functions as a poly(A) adaptor, facilitating the degradation of maternal mRNAs, a process essential for the activation of the zygotic genome. PABPN1L is expressed in oocytes and early embryos, with its protein levels peaking at the metaphase II stage and decreasing post-fertilization. It interacts with the maternal mRNA clearance factor BTG4, promoting the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex to the 3ʹ-poly(A) tails of maternal mRNAs, leading to their deadenylation and subsequent degradation. The absence of PABPN1L results in impaired mRNA decay and developmental arrest at the 1-to-2-cell stage, underscoring its critical role in early embryonic development (Zhao2020PABPN1L; EMORI2024PABPN1L).

## Function
PABPN1L is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the regulation of maternal mRNA during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in mammals. This protein acts as a poly(A) adaptor, facilitating the degradation of maternal mRNAs, which is essential for the activation of the zygotic genome. PABPN1L interacts with the MZT licensing factor BTG4, promoting the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex to the 3ʹ-poly(A) tails of maternal mRNAs, leading to their deadenylation and subsequent degradation (Zhao2020PABPN1L).

PABPN1L is expressed in oocytes and early embryos, with its protein levels peaking at the metaphase II (MII) stage and decreasing post-fertilization. It stabilizes BTG4 by preventing its polyubiquitination and degradation, ensuring the proper progression of the MZT (Zhao2020PABPN1L). The absence of PABPN1L results in impaired mRNA decay and developmental arrest at the 1-to-2-cell stage, highlighting its critical role in early embryonic development (Zhao2020PABPN1L; EMORI2024PABPN1L). PABPN1L's function is distinct from its homolog PABPN1, which is involved in nuclear mRNA processing (Zhao2020PABPN1L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PABPN1L gene are associated with female infertility due to disrupted maternal mRNA degradation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In mouse models, the absence of PABPN1L leads to female infertility, as embryos arrest at the 1-to-2-cell stage, despite normal ovarian morphology and oocyte numbers (Zhao2020PABPN1L; Wang2020Maternal). This developmental arrest is linked to impaired deadenylation and degradation of maternal mRNAs, which are crucial for early embryonic development (Zhao2020PABPN1L).

PABPN1L functions as a poly(A) adaptor for the maternal mRNA clearance factor BTG4, facilitating the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex to maternal mRNAs, thus triggering their degradation. The absence of PABPN1L impairs this process, leading to the accumulation of undegraded maternal mRNAs and subsequent developmental arrest (Zhao2020PABPN1L; Zhao2021Revisiting). Additionally, PABPN1L stabilizes BTG4 by preventing its polyubiquitination and degradation, further underscoring its role in mRNA decay during MZT (Zhao2020PABPN1L).

While PABPN1L's role in male infertility is less clear, a study identified a copy number variation involving PABPN1L in infertile men, suggesting a potential association with male infertility (Zhang2015DeAnnCNV:).

## Interactions
PABPN1L interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) by mediating cytoplasmic mRNA decay. It acts as a poly(A) adaptor for the maternal mRNA clearance factor BTG4, facilitating the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex to maternal mRNAs, which triggers their degradation (Zhao2020PABPN1L; Zhao2021Revisiting). PABPN1L binds to the 3ʹ-poly(A) tail of maternal transcripts, enhancing the binding efficiency of BTG4 to these mRNAs, which is essential for proper mRNA deadenylation and turnover during the MZT (Zhao2020PABPN1L).

PABPN1L also stabilizes BTG4 by preventing its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation, ensuring BTG4's effective function in oocytes (Zhao2020PABPN1L). This interaction is critical for the regulation of mRNA stability and decay, highlighting PABPN1L's role as a scaffold for the BTG4 and CCR4-NOT complex (EMORI2024PABPN1L). The interaction between PABPN1L and BTG4 is facilitated by distinct domains, with PABPN1L increasing BTG4-mRNA binding efficiency, which is crucial for the MZT (Zhao2020PABPN1L).
