# IFNL2

## Overview
IFNL2 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon lambda 2, a member of the type III interferon family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system's antiviral response. The protein is categorized as a cytokine and is primarily involved in modulating immune responses at mucosal surfaces, such as those found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Interferon lambda 2 exerts its effects by signaling through a specific receptor complex, which includes IL-28Rα and IL-10Rβ, predominantly expressed on epithelial cells. This signaling pathway is crucial for inducing an antiviral state by promoting the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit viral replication (Sheppard2002IL-28; Mordstein2010Lambda). Beyond its antiviral functions, IFNL2 also influences immune regulation by affecting T-cell differentiation and B-cell activation, thereby impacting responses to infections and vaccinations (Egli2014The). The gene's expression and its associated protein functions have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of viral infections and cancer (Wang2023Portraying; Peterson2019Disruption).

## Structure
The IFNL2 protein, also known as interferon lambda 2, is a member of the type III interferon family and plays a role in antiviral responses. Its primary structure is defined by a specific sequence of amino acids, which is crucial for its biological function. The secondary structure of IFNL2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of IFNL2 forms a three-dimensional shape that is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its overall activity.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are known to occur in IFNL2. These modifications can influence the protein's stability and activity, potentially affecting its role in immune responses. Glycosylation may enhance the protein's solubility and protect it from proteolytic degradation, thereby extending its functional lifespan.

IFNL2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. These isoforms may have variations in their amino acid sequences, which can lead to differences in their functional properties and interactions with other cellular components. The existence of multiple isoforms allows for a diverse range of functions and regulatory mechanisms within the immune system.

## Function
IFNL2, or interferon lambda 2, is a cytokine involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. It is part of the type III interferon family and plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses at mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. IFNL2 is primarily active in epithelial cells, where it helps regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit viral replication (Peterson2019Disruption; Mordstein2010Lambda).

The protein encoded by IFNL2 signals through a distinct receptor complex composed of IL-28Rα and IL-10Rβ, which is expressed on a limited number of cell types, mainly epithelial cells. This signaling pathway is crucial for inducing an antiviral state in cells, similar to type I interferons, but with a more sustained induction of ISGs (Sheppard2002IL-28; Mordstein2010Lambda). IFNL2's activity is particularly important at epithelial barriers, where it enhances the resistance of these cells to viral infections, thereby maintaining the integrity of these critical areas (Mordstein2010Lambda).

In addition to its antiviral functions, IFNL2 influences the immune response by modulating the balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokines, affecting T-cell differentiation and B-cell activation (Egli2014The). This modulation can impact immune responses to infections and vaccinations.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFNL2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and viral infections. In cancer, IFNL2, along with IFNL3, is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. The amplification of IFNL2 copy number variants is linked to increased expression of IFN-λ, which promotes cancer progression through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and is associated with more mutations in the TP53 gene and lower levels of DNA methylation (Wang2023Portraying). Patients with specific expression of IFNL2 and IFNL3 exhibit a survival disadvantage, and this expression serves as an independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes (Wang2023Portraying).

In the context of viral infections, IFNL2 plays a crucial role in antiviral defense, particularly at mucosal surfaces. Disruption of IFNL2, along with IFNL3, results in impaired control of viral infections such as influenza and reovirus, leading to higher viral loads and more severe symptoms (Peterson2019Disruption). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFNL2 are associated with different outcomes in viral infections, such as hepatitis C, where certain alleles are linked to non-beneficial effects in chronic infections (Chinnaswamy2016Gene–disease).

## Interactions
IFNL2, or interferon lambda 2, is known to interact with specific proteins as part of its role in the immune response. The primary interaction involves the formation of a ligand-receptor complex with the IL-28RA receptor, also known as IFNLR1, and the IL-10 receptor subunit 2 (IL-10R2). This complex is crucial for the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which leads to the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that enhance antiviral activity (Hemann2017Interferon; Egli2014The).

The interaction between IFNL2 and IL-28RA is mediated by specific amino acids, with Arg49 and His51 playing significant roles in the binding process. Additionally, Val95 in IFNL2 is important for binding to IL-10RB, another component of the receptor complex (Egli2014The). These interactions are largely characterized by van der Waals and hydrophobic forces, contributing to the stability of the ligand-receptor complex.

While IFNL2 is involved in these protein interactions, there is no specific information available regarding its interactions with nucleic acids. The stability and specificity of these interactions are essential for the differential responses observed among the IFNL cytokines (Egli2014The).
