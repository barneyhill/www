# YTHDF3

## Overview
YTHDF3 is a gene that encodes the YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F3, a member of the YTH domain family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the recognition and binding of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA, playing a crucial role in mRNA metabolism, including translation and degradation processes. The YTHDF3 protein is characterized by its YTH domain, which facilitates the specific binding to m6A-modified RNA, and its involvement in cellular processes such as embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation. YTHDF3 interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various biological pathways and contributing to the regulation of gene expression. Clinically, alterations in YTHDF3 expression have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhou2022A; Terkelsen2021Mono‐allelic; Chen2023N6-methyladenosine).

## Structure
YTHDF3 is a protein characterized by the presence of a YTH domain, which is crucial for recognizing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA. The YTH domain is located at the C-terminal and is essential for binding m6A-modified RNA, featuring a hydrophobic pocket formed by three highly conserved aromatic residues, known as an aromatic cage. This structure allows the m6A adenine moiety to be sandwiched between the rings of two aromatic residues, with the methyl group pointing towards one of these residues. The YTH domain also includes a positively charged groove that tightly locks m6A, and some amino acids within this domain interact with m6A through hydrogen bonds (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine).

The YTH domain of YTHDF3 has a mixed alpha-helix-beta-sheet fold, with alpha-helices surrounding a barrel-shaped center formed by beta-sheets (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine). The N-terminal domain of YTHDF3 is rich in proline, glutamine, and asparagine (P/Q/N) and contains prion-like low-complexity sequence regions (LCRs) associated with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine). This structural feature facilitates the localization of YTHDF3-m6A complexes in membrane-less compartments such as processing bodies and stress granules (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine).

## Function
YTHDF3 is a protein that plays a significant role in mRNA metabolism by binding to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA. It is involved in both the translation and degradation of m6A-modified mRNAs. YTHDF3 enhances mRNA translation by cooperating with YTHDF1 and interacting with ribosome subunits, and it recruits eIF4G2 to m6A sites to initiate translation of circular RNAs (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine). It also promotes mRNA decay in conjunction with YTHDF2, forming a functional model where m6A-modified mRNAs are first bound by YTHDF3 or a YTHDF3-YTHDF1 complex and then recognized by YTHDF2 (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine).

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), YTHDF3 is crucial for maintaining pluripotency. Its depletion leads to the loss of pluripotency and the induction of genes involved in the formation of the three germ layers: endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm (Wang2020Differential). YTHDF3 also plays a role in the differentiation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes, where its depletion accelerates differentiation and promotes cardiac marker gene expression (Wang2020Differential). These functions highlight YTHDF3's involvement in regulating stem cell properties and differentiation processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the YTHDF3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. In neurodevelopmental disorders, YTHDF3 haploinsufficiency has been associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability. A study identified four individuals with deletions in the 8q12.3 region, which includes YTHDF3, who exhibited these symptoms. The deletions were mostly de novo, and the smallest deletion overlapped only with the YTHDF3 gene, suggesting its haploinsufficiency as a likely causative factor (Terkelsen2021Mono‐allelic).

In cancer, YTHDF3 is notably overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. High YTHDF3 expression is correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients, and its overexpression is linked to enhanced glycolysis and tumor progression. YTHDF3 affects the expression of phosphofructokinase PFKL, a key enzyme in glycolysis, thereby influencing cancer metabolism (Zhou2022A). Additionally, YTHDF3 has been implicated in testicular germ cell tumors, particularly seminomas, where it is associated with early-stage disease and non-metastatic status (Lobo2019m6A).

## Interactions
YTHDF3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), YTHDF3 interacts with phosphofructokinase PFKL, a key enzyme in glycolysis. This interaction is facilitated by EFTUD2, a core subunit of the U5 snRNP component, which acts as a mediator between YTHDF3 and PFKL. EFTUD2 helps stabilize YTHDF3 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby promoting PFKL expression and contributing to cancer progression (Zhou2022A).

YTHDF3 is also involved in mRNA translation and decay through its interactions with other YTH domain family proteins, such as YTHDF1 and YTHDF2. It cooperates with YTHDF1 to enhance m6A-mRNA translation by interacting with ribosomal proteins of the 40S and 60S subunits. YTHDF3 also recruits eIF4G2 to m6A sites, facilitating translation initiation (Li2017Cytoplasmic; Chen2023N6-methyladenosine).

Additionally, YTHDF3 binds to m6A-modified mRNAs, influencing their stability and translation. It plays a role in regulating glycolysis in HCC by suppressing the degradation of PFKL mRNA through m6A modification, thereby enhancing PFKL expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Zhou2022A).
