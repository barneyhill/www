# TAS2R50

## Overview
TAS2R50 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 50, which is part of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors. These receptors are categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs that facilitates their role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Pallante2021On). The TAS2R50 protein is primarily involved in the perception of bitter tastes, but it is also expressed in extra-oral tissues, suggesting additional roles beyond taste perception (Lu2017Extraoral). The gene has been associated with various health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential significance in both gustatory and non-gustatory physiological processes (Shiffman2005Identification; Alves2023Epigenetic).

## Structure
The TAS2R50 protein is a member of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) structure. This structure is a common feature among GPCRs, consisting of seven alpha-helices that span the cell membrane (Pallante2021On). The TAS2R50 receptor, like other TAS2Rs, has a short extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus, with three extracellular loops (ECLs) and three intracellular loops (ICLs) connecting the transmembrane domains (Pallante2021On). 

The primary structure of TAS2R50 consists of its amino acid sequence, which determines the receptor's specific binding properties and functional characteristics. While the tertiary structure, or the 3D folding of the protein, is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, molecular modeling approaches have been used to study the interaction of TAS2R50 with ligands such as trans-resveratrol (RSV) (Tiroch2021Bitter). These studies help elucidate the binding modes and potential functional sites within the receptor. 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, are common in GPCRs and may influence the function and localization of TAS2R50, although specific modifications for TAS2R50 are not detailed in the context provided.

## Clinical Significance
The TAS2R50 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its genetic variations and altered expression levels. Variants of TAS2R50, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with cardiovascular diseases. These SNPs are expressed in the heart and may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease risk, rather than indirectly through dietary changes (Lu2017Extraoral). Specifically, the rs1376251 SNP in TAS2R50 has been linked to an increased risk of myocardial infarction, with consistent risk alleles identified across multiple studies (Shiffman2005Identification).

In the context of middle ear health, genetic variations in TAS2R50 have been associated with chronic otitis media (COM). The rs137625 I allele of TAS2R50 increases the risk for COM, suggesting a role in middle ear immunity (Harris2024Extragustatory).

TAS2R50 expression is also altered in neurological conditions. It is down-regulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients, potentially influenced by antipsychotic medication (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). Additionally, TAS2R50 expression is downregulated in the orbitofrontal cortex during early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease, possibly due to epigenetic mechanisms (Alves2023Epigenetic).

## Interactions
TAS2R50, a member of the bitter taste receptor family, is involved in oligomerization with other TAS2R receptors. Studies using coimmunoprecipitation and Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) methods have demonstrated that TAS2R50 can form both homo- and hetero-oligomers with other TAS2Rs, including TAS2R44. These interactions were confirmed in living cells, indicating that TAS2R50 participates in significant protein-protein interactions within the TAS2R family (Kuhn2010Oligomerization).

Despite the ability of TAS2R50 to oligomerize, functional analyses have not shown any significant impact of these interactions on the plasma membrane localization or pharmacological properties of the receptors. No heteromer-specific agonists have been identified, suggesting that hetero-oligomerization does not lead to the formation of functionally distinct receptors (Kuhn2010Oligomerization).

TAS2R50 is also expressed in extra-oral tissues, including various muscle cells, where it may play roles beyond taste perception. This expression pattern suggests potential interactions with other proteins involved in muscle contraction or relaxation, although specific interaction partners in these contexts have not been detailed (Pallante2021On).
