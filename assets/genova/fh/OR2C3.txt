# OR2C3

## Overview
The OR2C3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily C member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, OR2C3 is involved in the initial stages of olfactory perception by binding specific odor molecules and activating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to neuronal responses. These processes are essential for the discrimination of diverse smells, facilitating an organism's interaction with its environment through olfactory cues. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR2C3 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including autism spectrum disorder and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory biology and disease (Iwata2024Genomewide; Lee2018Therapeutic).

## Function
The OR2C3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, which is the initial step in the signal transduction pathway leading to the perception of smell. OR2C3 is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, a specialized tissue within the nasal cavity responsible for detecting airborne substances. Upon binding specific odorants, OR2C3 triggers neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell. This process involves the activation of a G-protein, which subsequently initiates a cascade of intracellular events, ultimately resulting in a neuronal signal being sent to the brain. The ability of OR2C3 to bind specific odorants and initiate these signaling pathways is essential for the discrimination of a wide range of smells, playing a significant role in the organism's ability to interact with its environment through olfactory cues. The precise molecular interactions and pathways activated by OR2C3 are integral to its function in olfactory perception, highlighting its importance in the sensory biology of humans.

## Clinical Significance
The OR2C3 gene, which encodes the olfactory receptor 2C3, has been implicated in several clinical contexts. In patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), significant hypermethylation of the OR2C3 gene at two promoter CpG islands has been observed. This epigenetic alteration is suggested to be linked to olfactory impairments commonly seen in individuals with ASD, potentially contributing to sensory processing issues associated with the disorder (Iwata2024Genomewide). The study highlights the potential clinical significance of OR2C3 gene methylation changes in relation to the olfactory dysfunction observed in ASD patients (Iwata2024Genomewide).

Additionally, OR2C3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for certain cancers, including breast carcinoma, melanoma, and urinary tract cancers. This suggests a role for OR2C3 in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, although specific clinical associations with gene mutations or expression alterations in these contexts are not well-documented (Lee2018Therapeutic). The broader implications of OR2C3 in cancer and other diseases remain an area of ongoing research, with its role in non-olfactory tissues suggesting potential involvement in various physiological and pathological processes.
