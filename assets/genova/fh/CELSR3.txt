# CELSR3

## Overview
CELSR3 is a gene that encodes the cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 3, a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane segments and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication and tissue organization. The protein plays a crucial role in neural development, particularly in axon guidance and synapse formation within the central nervous system. CELSR3 is essential for the proper formation of neural circuits, influencing behaviors related to learning and memory. It interacts with several proteins, such as Frizzled3 and synaptic proteins, to mediate its functions. Clinically, CELSR3 has been associated with conditions like lung adenocarcinoma and neural tube defects, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Goffinet2017Seven; Chen2018Genetic; Thakar2017Evidence).

## Structure
CELSR3 is a member of the cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor family, characterized by its seven transmembrane segments, which is a hallmark of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Goffinet2017Seven). The protein has a large ectodomain of approximately 2700 amino acids, which includes nine N-terminal cadherin repeats, several epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, two laminin G-type repeats, a hormone receptor motif, and a GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) embedded in a GAIN (GPCR Autoproteolysis INducing) domain (Goffinet2017Seven). These domains are thought to confer adhesive properties and facilitate cell-cell communication (Goffinet2017Seven).

The cytoplasmic tail of CELSR3 varies in size from 300 to 600 residues and is poorly conserved among the CELSR family members, which may contribute to functional differences (Goffinet2017Seven). Despite being part of the adhesion GPCR class, CELSR3 is cleavage-deficient in its GAIN domain, unlike CELSR2, which undergoes efficient autoproteolysis (Huong2023The). The protein's structure includes potential post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect protein folding and stability. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CELSR3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CELSR3 is a critical component in the development and function of neural circuits, particularly in the central nervous system. It is involved in axon guidance and dendrite development, playing a significant role in the formation of axonal tracts such as the anterior commissure and corticospinal tract. In mammals, CELSR3 is essential for the organization of monoaminergic axons in the brainstem and the guidance of commissural axons in the spinal cord (Goffinet2017Seven; Zhou2008Early).

CELSR3 is also crucial for the formation of glutamatergic synapses, particularly in the hippocampus, where it promotes synapse assembly. This function is vital for proper learning and memory, as evidenced by impaired hippocampus-dependent behaviors in Celsr3 knockout mice (Thakar2017Evidence). The protein interacts with synaptic proteins like PSD-95 and Frizzled3, suggesting a direct role in synapse assembly (Thakar2017Evidence).

At the cellular level, CELSR3 is a seven-pass transmembrane cadherin receptor, primarily active in the cell membrane, where it participates in intercellular communication and tissue organization. It is involved in processes like planar cell polarity, dendritic outgrowth, and branching, contributing to the precise synaptic connections necessary for normal neural circuit function (Lewis2011Celsr3).

## Clinical Significance
CELSR3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or altered expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CELSR3 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression is associated with poor prognosis and early tumor progression, suggesting that CELSR3 could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in LUAD (Li2021Systematic).

CELSR3 is also involved in neural tube defects (NTDs), where it is one of the top genes with the highest percentage of mutations in affected individuals. Mutations in CELSR3, along with CELSR1 and CELSR2, are often clustered at specific domains, indicating that these genes are mutational hotspots in the etiology of NTDs. These mutations contribute to diverse phenotypes such as spina bifida and anencephaly (Chen2018Genetic).

In bladder exstrophy epispadias complex (BEEC), rare exonic variants in CELSR3 have been identified, although these variants were classified as likely benign or benign. The study suggests a potential role for CELSR3 in BEEC, but no direct association with other diseases was established (Jelin2024Rare).

## Interactions
CELSR3, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for neural development. It interacts with Frizzled 3 (FZD3) as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies, suggesting that they function together in the same cells. This interaction is essential for the guidance of spinal commissural axons and neuronal migration in the embryonic cortex. CELSR3/FZD3 complexes respond to WNT factors, which are important for axonal guidance and neuronal migration (Goffinet2017Seven).

CELSR3 also co-immunoprecipitates with EPHRIN-A2, EPHRIN-A5, and RET, indicating its role in assembling signaling platforms that integrate multiple guidance cues. It is implicated in NOTCH signaling through the regulation of JAG1 expression, necessary for the timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis (Goffinet2017Seven).

In the context of synapse formation, CELSR3 interacts with synaptic proteins such as SV2, PSD-95, and Frizzled3, playing a direct role in synapse assembly and function. These interactions are part of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, where CELSR3 promotes synapse assembly while Vangl2 inhibits it (Thakar2017Evidence).
