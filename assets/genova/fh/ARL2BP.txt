# ARL2BP

## Overview
The ARL2BP gene encodes the ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2 binding protein, which is integral to the function and structure of cilia and flagella in human cells. This protein is categorized as a binding protein and is crucial for the maintenance of ciliary microtubules, playing a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in left-right patterning and organ positioning (Moye2019Mutations). In the retina, ARL2BP is essential for the organization of photoreceptor cells, contributing to the formation and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment, which is vital for visual function (Moye2018ARL2BP). The protein's interactions, particularly with ARL2, suggest its involvement in microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial processes, although these mechanisms are not fully understood (Francis2016Higher). Mutations in ARL2BP are linked to various clinical conditions, including retinitis pigmentosa, male infertility, and situs inversus, highlighting its critical role in cellular and developmental processes (Moye2019Mutations; Davidson2013Mutations).

## Function
The ARL2BP gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ARL2BP is involved in the proper formation and maintenance of ciliary microtubules, which are vital for left-right patterning during embryonic development and the normal positioning of internal organs (Moye2019Mutations). The protein is also essential for the elongation of sperm tails, supporting the organization of the 9+2 axoneme structure, which is critical for spermatogenesis (Moye2019Mutations).

ARL2BP is necessary for the normal function and structure of photoreceptor cells in the retina. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment, an extension of the primary cilium, which is crucial for phototransduction. The absence of ARL2BP leads to disorganization of the outer segment and impaired visual function (Moye2018ARL2BP). The protein localizes in the connecting cilium and basal body regions of photoreceptor cells, indicating its role in ciliogenesis and the maintenance of photoreceptor cell structure (Moye2018ARL2BP). ARL2BP's interaction with ARL2 suggests its involvement in microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial processes, although its exact mechanisms remain partially understood (Francis2016Higher).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL2BP gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting ciliary function. One of the most significant conditions linked to ARL2BP mutations is retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative eye disease that leads to progressive vision loss. Studies have identified specific mutations, such as a homozygous splice-site mutation and a homozygous missense mutation, which result in abnormal splicing and premature termination of the ARL2BP gene, contributing to the development of RP (Davidson2013Mutations).

ARL2BP mutations are also implicated in syndromic male infertility, characterized by immotile sperm and impaired spermatogenesis. This condition is observed in both humans and mouse models, where mutations lead to significant abnormalities in sperm tail development and axoneme maturation (Moye2019Mutations).

Additionally, ARL2BP mutations can cause situs inversus, a condition involving the reversed positioning of internal organs, due to defects in nodal cilia during embryonic development. This phenotype is notably present in ARL2BP knockout mice (Moye2019Mutations).

The gene is also linked to other syndromic presentations, including unilateral renal agenesis and microcysts, as seen in a case study of a patient with a novel splice site variant (Placidi2024A).

## Interactions
ARL2BP, or ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2 binding protein, is known to interact with ARL2, a small GTPase involved in microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial function. The interaction between ARL2BP and ARL2 is crucial for the proper localization of ARL2 to the basal body of photoreceptor cells, which is essential for ciliogenesis and outer segment formation. This interaction is selective, occurring when ARL2 is in its active GTP-bound state (Wright2024Complex).

ARL2BP is also associated with the BART complex, which partially localizes to mitochondria and is involved in regulating ATP production and mitochondrial morphology. However, the specific role of ARL2BP within this complex remains unclear (Francis2016Higher).

Despite its known interactions with ARL2, attempts to confirm the interaction between ARL2BP and ARL2 in photoreceptors have been unsuccessful, suggesting that the interaction may be context-dependent or involve additional factors (Moye2018ARL2BP). ARL2BP does not appear to interact with the BBSome complex, which is involved in protein trafficking in photoreceptors (Moye2018ARL2BP). The specific functional aspects of ARL2BP's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
