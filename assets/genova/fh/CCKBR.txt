# CCKBR

## Overview
The CCKBR gene encodes the cholecystokinin B receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including the regulation of gastric acid secretion and modulation of anxiety and pain perception. The cholecystokinin B receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is involved in complex signaling pathways through its interactions with endogenous peptides such as gastrin and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) (Bläker2000CCKBGastrin; Anders1999Direct). The receptor's expression and function have significant implications in clinical contexts, particularly in gastric neoplastic conditions and potential therapeutic applications (Mjønes2017Expression; Mihara2023Deterioration).

## Structure
The cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Anders1999Direct; Zhang2021Structures). The receptor's primary structure includes a core protein of approximately 50 kDa, with significant regions such as the sequence L52-ELAIRITLY61 identified as critical for ligand binding (Anders1999Direct). The secondary structure involves transmembrane helices and extracellular loops, with the first extracellular loop containing residues like Asn115, Leu116, Phe120, and Phe122, which are crucial for high-affinity binding (Anders1999Direct).

The tertiary structure of CCKBR includes a binding pocket formed by the transmembrane domains and extracellular loops, with specific residues such as Arg57 and Tyr61 forming hydrogen bonds with ligands (Anders1999Direct). The quaternary structure is not detailed in the provided context.

CCKBR undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of N-linked glycosylation sites in the N-terminal domain (Anders1999Direct). The receptor also has potential phosphorylation sites and conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, contributing to its structural stability (SilventePoirot1996A). Splice variant isoforms are mentioned, with one variant lacking the N-terminal extracellular domain and part of the first transmembrane domain, affecting receptor pharmacology (Anders1999Direct).

## Function
The cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. In the stomach, CCKBR is involved in regulating gastric acid secretion and cellular proliferation. It binds to endogenous peptides such as gastrin and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), which stimulate receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C, leading to the generation of inositol phosphates (Bläker2000CCKBGastrin). This receptor is expressed on enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, where it mediates the effects of gastrin, leading to the release of histamine and subsequent stimulation of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells (Mjønes2017Expression).

In the central nervous system, CCKBR is implicated in modulating anxiety and pain perception. It interacts with dopamine D1-like receptors, particularly in the regulation of renal sodium excretion and blood pressure, highlighting its role in maintaining sodium homeostasis (Jiang2016The). The receptor's involvement in synaptic potentiation in the brain is crucial for memory formation, as it facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP), a process considered the basis of memory traces (Zhang2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) have been implicated in various gastric neoplastic conditions. High expression of CCKBR is observed in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), while lower expression is noted in neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), potentially due to tumor cell dedifferentiation. CCKBR is also expressed in some gastric adenocarcinomas, particularly of the diffuse type, which may originate from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. This expression pattern suggests that CCKBR could be a therapeutic target for CCKBR antagonists in treating gastric cancer (Mjønes2017Expression).

In Cckbr-deficient mice, the absence of this receptor leads to gastric hypochlorhydria and calcium malabsorption, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism and excessive bone resorption, which manifests as an osteoporotic phenotype. This indicates a potential link between CCKBR function and bone health, with implications for osteoporosis, especially in the context of gastric hypochlorhydria induced by long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy (Mihara2023Deterioration).

A variant in the CCKBR gene, c.811+32C>A, was investigated for its association with pancreatic adenocarcinoma but was not found to significantly impact cancer risk or survival in a Hungarian cohort (Balázs2016A).

## Interactions
The cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in signaling pathways. CCKBR forms complexes with G proteins, such as Gq and Gi2, which are essential for its role as a G-protein coupled receptor. Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have revealed that CCKBR interacts with gastrin-17 and G proteins, forming complexes that include specific residues of CCKBR, Gα subunits, Gβ1, Gγ2, and gastrin-17. These interactions are vital for understanding the receptor's activation mechanisms and its role in cellular signaling (Zhang2021Structures).

CCKBR also participates in heteromerization with the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), particularly through the third transmembrane domain of MOR. This interaction is significant as it contributes to the anti-opioid effects of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8). Disruption of this interaction using a TM3 MOR-TAT peptide has been shown to enhance MOR signaling and counteract CCK-8-induced antagonism to morphine analgesia, indicating a regulatory role in opioid signaling pathways (Yang2018Heteromerization).

Additionally, DNA aptamers have been developed to target CCKBR, specifically binding to its N-terminal extracellular regions. These aptamers, such as AP1153, exhibit high affinity for CCKBR without activating its signaling pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic applications (Clawson2017A).
