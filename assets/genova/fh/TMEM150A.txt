# TMEM150A

## Overview
TMEM150A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 150A, which is part of the TMEM150 family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating cytokine secretion and transcription in healthy human cells (Fan2023Overexpression). It is involved in the regulation of phospholipid asymmetry on the plasma membrane, which is essential for various cellular processes, including the balance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Lu2019DRAM1). TMEM150A is also implicated in immune regulation, as its expression affects cytokine secretion in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fan2023Overexpression). In pathological contexts, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TMEM150A is overexpressed and associated with poor prognostic indicators, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for disease progression (Fan2023Overexpression).

## Function
TMEM150A, a member of the TMEM150 family, is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating cytokine secretion and transcription in healthy human cells (Fan2023Overexpression). It is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in cell homeostasis, particularly in the regulation of phospholipid asymmetry on the plasma membrane. This function is crucial for maintaining the balance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) on the plasma membrane, which is important for various cellular processes (Lu2019DRAM1). TMEM150A is also implicated in the immune response, as decreased expression can lead to increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine secretion, indicating its role in immune regulation (Fan2023Overexpression).

In the context of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TMEM150A is overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognostic indicators. However, in healthy cells, its expression is linked to normal cellular functions, including the regulation of cytokine secretion and transcription (Fan2023Overexpression). TMEM150A's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM150A overexpression has been implicated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant brain cancer. Studies have shown that TMEM150A is significantly overexpressed in GBM tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognostic indicators, including overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free interval in patients (Fan2023Overexpression). The gene's overexpression correlates with various immune cell types and markers, suggesting its involvement in the tumor immune microenvironment and its potential role in GBM progression (Fan2023Overexpression).

TMEM150A's overexpression is linked to key signaling pathways such as IL-17, TNF, NF-ÎºB, and JAK/STAT, which are crucial in GBM progression (Fan2023Overexpression). The gene's expression level is also predictive of poor survival time, especially when combined with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status (Fan2023Overexpression). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that suppressing TMEM150A expression can inhibit GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2023Overexpression). These findings suggest that TMEM150A could serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis in GBM patients and that targeting its expression might improve survival outcomes.
