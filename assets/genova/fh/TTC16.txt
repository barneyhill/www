# TTC16

## Overview
TTC16, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 16, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. The TTC16 protein is implicated in a variety of biological processes, including structural and anti-inflammatory pathways, particularly in response to diabetic stroke (Qadri2024Mass). It also plays a role in blood clotting and is involved in the regulation of aspirin resistance in cardiovascular patients (Qadri2024Mass). In cancer research, TTC16 has been identified as a driver gene in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with pathways related to replicative senescence and the cell cycle (Nassir2024Whole). Additionally, TTC16 is part of the adaptive NK cell gene set in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role in immune function (Qi2022Alzheimer’s). The diverse interactions and functions of TTC16 underscore its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
TTC16 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), TTC16 is identified as a driver gene associated with poor outcomes and metastasis. It is involved in pathways related to replicative senescence and the cell cycle, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Nassir2024Whole). 

In the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, TTC16 is highlighted as a potential biomarker for predicting ICB response. It is among the top-ranked genes associated with tumor immune evasion and T cell dysfunction, indicating its potential role in cancer immunotherapy resistance (Gu2023PCSK9).

TTC16 is also noted for its differential expression in diabetic ischemic stroke patients. It is one of the most differentially expressed proteins in this group, with its expression being downregulated by antiplatelet therapy involving aspirin. This suggests a potential role in stroke complications, particularly in patients resistant to aspirin (Qadri2024Mass). 

These findings underscore the clinical significance of TTC16 in various pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TTC16, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 16, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily due to its TPR motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. In the context of diabetic stroke, TTC16 is significantly elevated and is associated with structural and anti-inflammatory pathways as an acute response to stroke (Qadri2024Mass). It is also noted for its role in blood clotting processes, particularly in patients undergoing antiplatelet therapy, where its expression is downregulated by aspirin in cardiovascular patients resistant to the drug (Qadri2024Mass).

In the realm of cancer research, TTC16 has been identified as a driver gene in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, enriched in pathways related to replicative senescence and cell cycle, indicating its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (Nassir2024Whole). Additionally, TTC16 is part of the adaptive NK cell gene set in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role in immune function, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Qi2022Alzheimer’s).

While TTC16 is listed among the interactors of GSK3A in studies related to sperm motility and testis function, specific details about its interactions in this context are not provided (Freitas2019Isoformspecific). Overall, TTC16's interactions appear to be diverse, spanning various physiological and pathological processes.
