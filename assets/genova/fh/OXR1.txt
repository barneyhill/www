# OXR1

## Overview
The OXR1 gene encodes the oxidation resistance 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity, thereby supporting cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Yang2014Human; Elliott2004Stress). The OXR1 protein is characterized by the presence of the TLDc domain, which is conserved across eukaryotes and is crucial for its neuroprotective functions (Murphy2012Structuralfunctional; Volkert2020Preventing). It interacts with various proteins, modulating their functions to enhance antioxidant responses and protect against neurodegenerative processes (Svistunova2019Oxidation; Finelli2018Oxidation). Mutations in the OXR1 gene are linked to neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in neurodevelopment and lysosomal function (Wang2019Loss; Lin2023A).

## Structure
The human OXR1 protein is involved in oxidative stress response and is characterized by several structural features. It contains multiple domains, including the TLDc domain, which is conserved across eukaryotes and is crucial for its neuroprotective functions (Murphy2012Structuralfunctional; Volkert2020Preventing). The TLDc domain is located in the C-terminal region and is associated with other domains like TBC and LysM (Blaise2012Crystal). Although the TLDc domain is not required for antioxidation activity in E. coli, it may have other regulatory roles in mammalian cells (Murphy2012Structuralfunctional).

Exon 8 of the OXR1 gene encodes a critical region for its antioxidant function, featuring a helix-turn-helix structural motif between residues 9-36, which is essential for oxidative damage suppression (Murphy2012Structuralfunctional). The protein's structure also includes several splice variant isoforms, such as hOXR1A, hOXR1B, hOXR1C, and hOXR1D, which contribute to its functional diversity and tissue-specific expression (Yang2014Human). These isoforms differ in their domain composition and length, with some containing additional domains like LysM and GRAM (Yang2014Human). The OXR1 protein is targeted to mitochondria, a major site of reactive oxygen species production, highlighting its role in cellular protection against oxidative stress (Murphy2012Structuralfunctional).

## Function
The human OXR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant responses and maintaining mitochondrial function. OXR1 is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it helps prevent oxidative damage, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Yang2014Human; Elliott2004Stress). The protein is involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress induced by agents like hydrogen peroxide (Yang2014Human).

OXR1 regulates the expression of antioxidant genes such as GPX2 and HO-1 through the p21-Nrf2 signaling pathway, which helps suppress oxidative stress and maintain mitochondrial DNA stability (Yang2014Human). It also plays a role in the p53 signaling pathway, influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis. OXR1 modulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as p21 and CDK6, and suppresses apoptosis-promoting genes like CASP9 (Yang2015Transcriptome).

The protein's mitochondrial localization is essential for its function, as it accumulates in the mitochondria during recovery from oxidative stress, providing protection against ROS (Elliott2004Stress). This localization is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial redox state and resistance to oxidative stress, which is important for cell survival and function (Elliott2004Stress).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OXR1 gene are associated with several neurological conditions, primarily characterized by cerebellar atrophy and lysosomal dysfunction. Individuals with bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in OXR1 exhibit severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, language delay, and seizures. These mutations include splice site, nonsense, and frameshift variants, which are rare and not found in the general population databases (Wang2019Loss). The OXR1 gene is crucial for proper lysosomal function, and its deficiency leads to an increase in aberrant lysosomal structures, contributing to the pathogenesis of the associated neurological disease (Wang2019Loss).

OXR1 mutations also impact neurodevelopment by disrupting histone arginine methylation, which is essential for gene expression regulation during neurogenesis. This disruption leads to impaired neural differentiation and neurodevelopmental defects, such as primary microcephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia (Lin2023A). The gene's deficiency is linked to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and impaired cell survival, which can be partially rescued by replacing the affected domain (Lin2023A). OXR1 is also implicated in other diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and lupus nephritis, due to its role in maintaining neuronal health (Lin2023A).

## Interactions
OXR1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in oxidative stress response and neuroprotection. It modulates the oligomerization and post-translational modifications of peroxiredoxin 2 (Prdx2), influencing its antioxidant and chaperone functions. This interaction suggests that OXR1 acts as a functional switch between these roles of Prdx2, contributing to neuroprotection against oxidative stress (Svistunova2019Oxidation).

OXR1 also interacts with glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi1), affecting its oligomerization and shifting its activity from glycolytic to cytokine functions, which are neuroprotective. This interaction is significant in modulating glycolytic pathways in the cerebellum and influencing neurodegenerative processes (Volkert2020Preventing; Finelli2018Oxidation).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), OXR1 interacts with ALS-associated proteins such as TDP-43 and FUS. These interactions help restore the nuclear localization of these proteins and reduce their cytoplasmic aggregation, which is crucial for mitigating ALS pathology (Finelli2015Oxr1). OXR1's interaction with these proteins is modulated by specific ALS mutations, which can alter binding affinity and affect cellular localization (Finelli2015Oxr1).
