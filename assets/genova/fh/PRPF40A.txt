# PRPF40A

## Overview
PRPF40A is a gene that encodes the protein pre-mRNA processing factor 40 homolog A, which plays a pivotal role in the splicing of pre-mRNA. This protein is characterized by its tandem WW domains and multiple FF domains, which are crucial for its function in the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. The WW domains facilitate protein-protein interactions by recognizing proline-rich motifs, while the FF domains are involved in RNA processing. PRPF40A is integral to the early stages of spliceosome assembly and is associated with the U2 snRNP, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation. Its interactions with various splicing factors and involvement in co-transcriptional splicing underscore its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions. Additionally, PRPF40A has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2024Splicing; Becerra2015Prp40a; Huo2019&lt).

## Structure
The PRPF40A protein is characterized by its tandem WW domains and six FF domains, which play crucial roles in pre-mRNA splicing. The WW domains are small protein-protein interaction modules that recognize proline-rich motifs, while the FF domains are involved in RNA processing (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular). The tandem WW domains of PRPF40A act as independent modules, separated by a hinge and a short helix, with a C-terminal α-helix running parallel to the linker helix. This structure is distinct due to differences in the C-terminal helix and linker flexibility, which is enhanced by a proline residue in the linker (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular).

The WW domains exhibit significant domain mobility and can bind independently to different proline-rich motifs, with WW1 binding to PPLP motifs and WW2 to PPPP motifs (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular). The structure of PRPF40A in complex with the SF1 peptide reveals extensive interactions involving the canonical WW domain interface, with unique recognition features enhancing binding affinity (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular). The protein's tertiary structure is supported by techniques such as NMR, SAXS, and ITC, which demonstrate the extended arrangement and interdomain mobility of the WW domains (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular).

## Function
PRPF40A is a crucial component of the spliceosome, involved in the early stages of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. It contains two WW domains and five FF domains, which are essential for its localization to nuclear speckles rich in splicing factors (Becerra2015Prp40a). PRPF40A interacts with splicing factors such as SF1 and U2AF and is present in the human A and B spliceosomal complexes, indicating its role in early spliceosomal complex formation and cross-intron interactions (Becerra2015Prp40a). It is also a component of the U2 snRNP, and its recruitment to nascent transcripts occurs co-transcriptionally, facilitated by its interaction with RNA polymerase II (Becerra2015Prp40a).

In myeloid cells, PRPF40A regulates the inclusion of cassette exons, impacting immune function and cell differentiation. Its knockdown leads to altered gene expression, affecting immune cell markers and transcription factors involved in myeloid cell differentiation and NF-κB signaling (Tan2024Splicing). PRPF40A also influences actin polymerization and cell migration, processes crucial for maintaining normal cell morphology and function (Tan2024Splicing). These activities underscore its importance in cellular processes and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
PRPF40A has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PRPF40A is highly expressed, and its knockdown in HL-60 cells leads to increased cell death and decreased proliferation, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis (Tan2024Splicing). PRPF40A is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where it is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (PRPF40A; p&gt; Huo2019&lt). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PRPF40A is significantly overexpressed and correlates with hypoxia markers, suggesting a role in tumor aggressiveness and resistance to therapy (Oleksiewicz2017COL1A1).

PRPF40A's involvement in cancer is further supported by its role in splicing regulation. It acts as a splicing activator, and its knockdown results in the downregulation of cassette exons, affecting genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Tan2024Splicing). These findings highlight PRPF40A's potential oncogenic properties and its significance in cancer progression.

## Interactions
PRPF40A is a multidomain protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It contains two WW domains and six FF domains, which facilitate its interactions with early splicing factors such as SF1 and SF3A1. The WW domains of PRPF40A specifically recognize proline-rich motifs in these proteins, with the first WW domain binding to the PPLP motif and the second to the PPPP motif in SF1 (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular). PRPF40A also interacts with non-splicing related proteins like WASP, formin, and huntingtin, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular).

PRPF40A is associated with early spliceosomal complexes, particularly the E and A complexes, and is classified as a U2 snRNP-associated protein. It mediates bridging connections in complex E by recognizing U1 snRNP at the 5′ splice site and SF1 at the branch point sequence (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular). The FF domains of PRPF40A interact with U1 snRNP components and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II CTD, suggesting a role in co-transcriptional splicing regulation (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular).

PRPF40A's interactions are modulated by intramolecular autoinhibition, which enhances the selectivity of its WW domains for high-affinity proline-rich motifs, acting as a proofreading mechanism to prevent unspecific binding (MartínezLumbreras2024Intramolecular).
