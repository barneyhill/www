# OR11H7

## Overview
The OR11H7 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily H member 7, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in olfactory signaling. This receptor is part of a large family of olfactory receptors that are primarily responsible for detecting odorants and initiating olfactory signal transduction. However, OR11H7 is uniquely expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the kidney, where it plays a role in renal physiology and blood pressure regulation. The receptor is activated by specific short-chain fatty acids, leading to intracellular signaling cascades that influence calcium flux and potentially affect renal function (Kalbe2016Olfactory; Raka2021Human).

## Function
The human gene OR11H7 encodes an olfactory receptor that is expressed in the kidney, specifically in renal proximal tubular cells. This receptor is involved in important physiological processes related to kidney function and blood pressure regulation. OR11H7 is activated by short-chain fatty acids such as isovaleric acid and 4-methylvaleric acid, which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels through a cAMP-mediated pathway. This signaling pathway involves the activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ flux (Kalbe2016Olfactory; Lee2018Therapeutic; Raka2021Human).

The activation of OR11H7 by these fatty acids suggests a role in modulating renal physiology, potentially influencing the secretion of renin and the regulation of blood pressure. The receptor's presence in the HK-2 human proximal tubule cell line and its response to specific ligands indicate its involvement in cellular signaling pathways within the kidney (Kalbe2016Olfactory; Tong2021Ectopic). While the precise physiological significance of OR11H7 in the renal system is not fully understood, its activation by isovaleric acid and the subsequent calcium influx highlight its potential role in renal function (Kalbe2016Olfactory).
