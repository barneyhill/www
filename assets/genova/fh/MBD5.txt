# MBD5

## Overview
MBD5 (methyl-CpG binding domain protein 5) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Unlike other members of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family, the MBD5 protein does not bind to methylated DNA but instead participates in protein-protein interactions, notably with the PR-DUB complex, which is involved in histone modification processes (Baymaz2014MBD5). The MBD5 protein is characterized by its methyl-CpG-binding domain and, in one isoform, a PWWP domain, which are crucial for its function in chromatin association (Laget2010The). MBD5 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the brain and testis, indicating its role in neurodevelopment and epigenetic regulation (Laget2010The). Mutations in the MBD5 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, underscoring its clinical significance (Mullegama2016Clinical; Camarena2014Disruption).

## Structure
The MBD5 gene encodes two isoforms of the MBD5 protein, which are distinguished by their exon composition and resulting amino acid sequences. Isoform 1 is encoded by exons 6 to 15 and consists of 1448 amino acids, while Isoform 2 is encoded by exons 6 to 9, including retention of the intron following exon 9, resulting in a protein of 851 residues. Both isoforms share the first 841 residues, with the remaining residues unique to Isoform 2 (Laget2010The).

The MBD5 protein contains several distinct domains. At the N-terminal, it features a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), which, despite its name, does not bind methylated DNA but is crucial for protein-protein interactions. The MBD of MBD5 has a deletion of 9 amino acids in the first third and an insertion of 6 amino acids in the last third, yet these alterations do not disrupt its overall structure (Laget2010The; Baymaz2014MBD5). Isoform 1 also includes a PWWP domain at the C-terminus, commonly found in chromatin-associated proteins, which is absent in Isoform 2 (Laget2010The; Baymaz2014MBD5).

MBD5 is known to interact with the PR-DUB complex through its MBD, highlighting its role in protein-protein interactions rather than DNA binding (Baymaz2014MBD5). The protein also contains putative nuclear localization signals, indicating its function as a nuclear protein (Laget2010The).

## Function
MBD5 (methyl-CpG binding domain protein 5) is a nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Unlike other members of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family, MBD5 does not bind to methylated DNA. Instead, it interacts with the human Polycomb repressive complex PR-DUB, which is involved in the deubiquitination of histone H2A, suggesting a role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation (Baymaz2014MBD5). MBD5 is also a stable subunit of the BAP1 complex, a chromatin-bound multi-protein complex that functions as a general transcriptional cofactor, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation by co-occupying chromatin regions with BAP1 (Tsuboyama2022MBD5).

MBD5 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the brain and testis, suggesting a significant role in neurodevelopment and epigenetic regulation (Laget2010The). In mouse models, MBD5 disruption leads to phenotypes similar to those seen in 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome, indicating its crucial role in the nervous system (Seabra2020Transcriptional). MBD5's interaction with histone acetyltransferases, such as KAT2A, further implicates it in the regulation of gene transcription through histone modification (Tao2014MBD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MBD5 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy. MBD5 is located in the 2q23.1 chromosomal region, and its haploinsufficiency is a key factor in the development of these conditions (Mullegama2016Clinical; Talkowski2011Assessment). The 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, seizures, and behavioral problems, is primarily caused by deletions affecting MBD5 (Mullegama2016Clinical). 

Alterations in MBD5 expression levels, whether through deletions or duplications, can lead to neurodevelopmental issues. Both decreased and increased expression of MBD5 are linked to developmental delay, motor delay, language impairment, and autistic-like symptoms (Mullegama2016Clinical). MBD5 mutations are implicated in up to 1% of ASD cases, highlighting its significant role in the genetic etiology of autism (Camarena2014Disruption).

Mouse models with disrupted Mbd5 genes exhibit phenotypes similar to human patients, including cognitive impairment and abnormal social behavior, which further supports the gene's role in these disorders (Camarena2014Disruption). These findings underscore the importance of MBD5 in maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes.

## Interactions
MBD5, a member of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family, is known for its interactions with the human PR-DUB Polycomb protein complex. This interaction is mediated by the MBD of MBD5, which is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the PR-DUB complex, marking the first instance of an MBD acting as a protein-protein interaction domain rather than binding to methylated DNA (Baymaz2014MBD5). MBD5 does not copurify with other MBD proteins such as MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4, indicating a specific interaction profile (Baymaz2014MBD5).

MBD5 is also a stable subunit within the BAP1 complex, a chromatin-bound multi-protein complex functioning as a transcriptional cofactor. It interacts with BAP1 through ASXL proteins, specifically via the C-terminal PHD fingers of ASXL1 and ASXL2, which serve as a scaffold for this interaction (Tsuboyama2022MBD5). MBD5 and MBD6, another MBD family member, co-occupy active chromatin regions with BAP1, with more than 96.5% of BAP1 peaks being co-occupied by MBD5 and/or MBD6 (Tsuboyama2022MBD5). These interactions are crucial for the stability of the BAP1 complex and its role in transcriptional regulation.
