# MRM1

## Overview
MRM1 (mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a methyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is specifically involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA), playing a crucial role in the methylation of the Gm1145 residue in the 16S rRNA of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) (Lopez2020Methylation; Lee2014Assignment). As a methyltransferase, MRM1 is essential for the proper assembly and function of mitochondrial ribosomes, which are critical for mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production (Lee2013Mitochondrial; Lee2014Assignment). The enzyme is localized in the mitochondria and is associated with mtDNA nucleoids, indicating its involvement in early mitoribosome assembly (Lee2013Mitochondrial). MRM1's activity is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular respiration (Lopez2020Methylation).

## Function
MRM1 (mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA). It specifically catalyzes the 2′-O-ribose methylation of the Gm1145 residue in the 16S rRNA of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) (Lopez2020Methylation; Lee2014Assignment). This modification occurs in the peptidyl transferase center, which is essential for the binding of tRNA in the P-site, thereby facilitating proper peptidyl-tRNA recognition and ribosomal function (Lopez2020Methylation).

MRM1 is localized to the mitochondria, where it is associated with mtDNA nucleoids, indicating its involvement in the early stages of mitoribosome assembly (Lee2013Mitochondrial; Lee2014Assignment). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the maturation and assembly of functional mitochondrial ribosomes, which are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and, consequently, cellular energy production (Lee2013Mitochondrial; Lee2014Assignment).

The methylation activity of MRM1 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular respiration (Lopez2020Methylation). Despite its critical role in rRNA modification, the specific function of MRM1 in healthy human cells beyond this methylation activity remains to be fully elucidated (RebeloGuiomar2022A).

## Clinical Significance
MRM1 (mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase 1) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. Alterations in MRM1 expression have been associated with gliomas, where it is upregulated in certain glioma grades and subtypes, contributing to a cancer-promoting microenvironment and potentially serving as a prognostic biomarker for overall survival and progression-free survival in glioma patients (Zhou2024Mitochondrial; Wang2021Human). MRM1 is also involved in the methylation of mitochondrial rRNA, and its dysregulation can disrupt mitochondrial protein synthesis, affecting the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which may lead to metabolic-related diseases (Wang2021Human).

In the context of rectal cancer, MRM1 mutations have been identified in patients who did not achieve a complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting a potential role in treatment resistance (Bagaria2022Discriminating). Additionally, MRM1 has been noted in studies of motor neuron degeneration, where it is similarly regulated in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), indicating its involvement in early motor neuron dysfunction (Kudo2010Integrative). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MRM1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
MRM1, a mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase, is involved in the methylation of mitochondrial 16S rRNA at the G1145 site. This enzyme is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is associated with mtDNA nucleoids, suggesting a role in modifying nascent rRNA near the DNA template (Lopez2020Methylation; Lee2013Mitochondrial). MRM1 does not co-localize with the mitochondrial large or small ribosomal subunits in sucrose gradient fractionation experiments, indicating it may function independently of the ribosome (d2018protein).

MRM1 has been shown to weakly interact with ERAL1, an mt-SSU biogenesis factor, and LYRM7, a late-stage assembly factor of Complex III, suggesting potential indirect roles in ribosome assembly or function (d2018protein). Despite its role in rRNA modification, MRM1 does not pull down known 16S rRNA-associated mitochondrial ribosomal proteins or biogenesis factors in immunopurification experiments, indicating that its interactions with other proteins may be limited or context-dependent (d2018protein). The enzyme's interaction with nucleic acids is primarily through its methylation activity on the 16S rRNA, which is crucial for ribosome structure and function (Lee2014Assignment).
