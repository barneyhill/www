# SLC2A13

## Overview
SLC2A13 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 13, also known as the H+/myo-inositol symporter (HMIT). This protein is a member of the GLUT family of membrane transporters, specifically classified as a Class III GLUT. Unlike other members of the GLUT family that primarily transport glucose, the SLC2A13-encoded protein is specialized for the transport of myo-inositol, functioning as a H+/myo-inositol co-transporter. It is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains and is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a critical role in neuronal function and development by regulating signaling pathways and maintaining cellular osmoregulation (Mueckler2013The; Uldry2004The).

## Structure
The SLC2A13 gene encodes the HMIT protein, a member of the GLUT family of membrane transporters, specifically classified as a Class III GLUT. The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature among GLUT transporters, with both the amino and carboxy-terminal ends located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (Uldry2004The; Cheeseman2015Structure). Unlike other GLUTs, SLC2A13 does not transport glucose but is specific for myo-inositol, functioning as a H+/myo-inositol co-transporter (Mueckler2013The; Uldry2004The).

Structurally, SLC2A13 lacks the QLS motif associated with glucose transport, which is present in Class I GLUTs, and instead features a tryptophan residue following the GPXXXP motif in transmembrane domain 10 (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein also lacks an N-linked glycosylation site in Loop1 but has predicted glycosylation sites in Loop9, with more than one N-linked glycosylation site predicted within this loop (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein is a glycoprotein, with its molecular weight ranging from 75-90 kDa, which can be reduced to 67 kDa upon enzymatic deglycosylation (Uldry2004The).

## Function
SLC2A13, also known as the H+/myo-inositol symporter (HMIT), is a crucial transporter responsible for the movement of myo-inositol across the plasma membrane into neurons. This function is vital for regulating signaling within the central nervous system, as myo-inositol plays a significant role in cellular osmoregulation and signal transduction (Li2021Mutation). SLC2A13 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra, indicating its importance in neuronal function and development (Li2021Mutation). The protein's activity in these areas suggests it may influence cognitive processes and contribute to maintaining neuronal health.

In healthy human cells, SLC2A13's role in transporting myo-inositol is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various biochemical pathways. The transporter's function is linked to the regulation of intracellular osmotic pressure and the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, a precursor for several signaling molecules. By facilitating the uptake of myo-inositol, SLC2A13 supports the production of inositol phosphates, which are involved in signal transduction pathways that affect cell growth, survival, and differentiation (Li2021Mutation).
