# SMIM24

## Overview
The SMIM24 gene encodes the small integral membrane protein 24, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its integration into cellular membranes, where it plays a role in maintaining membrane structure and function. While the specific biological functions of SMIM24 are still under investigation, it is believed to be involved in signaling pathways and cellular interactions due to its membrane-associated nature. Research into SMIM24 may provide insights into its potential roles in health and disease, as well as its interactions with other cellular components.
