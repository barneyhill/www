# CD177

## Overview
CD177 is a gene that encodes the CD177 protein, a glycoprotein prominently expressed on the surface of neutrophils. This protein is a member of the Ly-6 superfamily, which includes proteins involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion (Stroncek2004CD177:). The CD177 protein is characterized by its glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates its attachment to the cell membrane (Stroncek2004CD177:). Functionally, CD177 plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in neutrophil-mediated responses, and serves as a receptor for human immunoglobulin G (IgG), influencing immune functions (Li2024CD177). The gene exhibits polymorphic expression, with some individuals lacking CD177 expression due to genetic variations, which can have clinical implications such as the development of antibodies against neutrophil antigens (Wu2016Heterogeneity). CD177 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor by modulating signaling pathways (Kluz2020Cancer).

## Structure
CD177 is a glycoprotein expressed on neutrophils, characterized by a primary structure consisting of 437 amino acids encoded by a 1614-base pair cDNA (Kissel2002Molecular). The protein includes an N-terminal signal sequence of 21 amino acids and is predicted to have a molecular mass of 44.2 kDa, although it appears as a 58 to 64 kDa glycoprotein due to glycosylation (Stroncek2004CD177:). CD177 contains two highly homologous cysteine-rich domains, each with six cysteine residues, and three N-glycosylation sites, but lacks O-linked carbohydrates (Stroncek2004CD177:; Kissel2002Molecular). 

The protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage at its hydrophobic C-terminus (Stroncek2004CD177:). CD177 is a member of the Ly-6 superfamily, which includes proteins involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion, although its exact functions are not fully elucidated (Stroncek2004CD177:). The protein's structure is similar to the uPAR domain, suggesting it belongs to the uPAR/CD59/Ly-6 snake toxin superfamily (Kissel2002Molecular). CD177 expression is polymorphic, with variations affecting its expression levels on neutrophils (Stroncek2004CD177:).

## Function
CD177 is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of neutrophils, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular and molecular processes. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, including neutrophils, in the bone marrow (Li2024CD177). In peripheral blood, CD177 is exclusively expressed on neutrophils, which are essential for the body's first line of defense against infections and act as primary mediators of inflammation (Li2024CD177).

CD177 functions as a receptor for human immunoglobulin G (IgG), influencing IgG-mediated immune functions. It binds to IgG through its extracellular domain, and this interaction is modulated by specific genetic variants of the CD177 gene (Li2024CD177). The protein is also a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked surface receptor, which is necessary for the surface expression of proteinase 3 (PR3) on neutrophils. This interaction is significant for neutrophil-ANCA interactions, particularly in the context of ANCA-associated vasculitis (von2007NB1).

CD177's expression is heterogeneous among individuals, with some people being CD177 null due to allelic gene conversion involving the CD177 pseudogene (CD177P1), leading to a loss of CD177 expression (Wu2016Heterogeneity). This variability can have immunological consequences, such as the development of antibodies against neutrophil antigens (Wu2016Heterogeneity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD177 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP 829A>T) in the CD177 gene is a primary genetic determinant for human neutrophil antigen 2 (HNA-2) deficiency, affecting 3-5% of the population. This deficiency is linked to the production of HNA-2 alloantibodies, which can cause transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), neonatal alloimmune neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced immune neutropenia, and graft failure following marrow transplantation (Li2015Genetic). 

The CD177-null phenotype, resulting from the absence of CD177 expression, is associated with the formation of anti-CD177 isoantibodies, leading to conditions such as neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN) and TRALI (Traum2024The). In cancer, CD177 expression levels correlate with survival outcomes. It is positively associated with recurrence-free survival in breast cancer and overall survival in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, among others (Kluz2020Cancer). 

In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), altered CD177 expression serves as a diagnostic marker, with decreased expression being specific for MDS (Aladily2021Combined). CD177 also plays a role in modulating tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells, impacting tumor growth and immune evasion (Kim2021CD177).

## Interactions
CD177, a glycoprotein expressed on neutrophils, participates in several significant protein interactions. It interacts with proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease, forming a high-affinity complex that reduces PR3's enzymatic activity. This interaction is crucial for the surface presentation of PR3 on neutrophils and is characterized by a dissociation constant of 4.1 × 10^-9 M (Jerke2017Characterization; von2007NB1).

CD177 also interacts with platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) on neutrophils. This interaction downregulates membrane-bound proteinase-3 (mPR3) expression and attenuates neutrophil activation induced by PR3-ANCA, involving the phosphorylation of SHP-1, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (Deng2018Interaction).

In the context of cancer, CD177 interacts with β-Catenin, an intracellular protein, independently of E-Cadherin. This interaction suggests an indirect association along the plasma membrane, where CD177 acts as a tumor suppressor by attenuating β-Catenin signaling (Kluz2020Cancer).

CD177 is also identified as a novel binding partner for podoplanin (PDPN) in cancer-associated fibroblasts. This interaction modulates fibroblast elongation and contractility, impacting pathways related to cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell motility (Astarita2021The).
