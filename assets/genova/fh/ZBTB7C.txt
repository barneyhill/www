# ZBTB7C

## Overview
ZBTB7C is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 7C protein, which is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its BTB/POZ domain and multiple zinc finger domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and DNA binding, respectively (Du2015Integrative; Jeon2016Zbtb7c). As a member of the BTB-POZ family, ZBTB7C plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression related to gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and cell cycle progression. It interacts with several key proteins, including c-Jun, NCoR, and p53, to modulate transcriptional activity (Jeon2016Zbtb7c; Jeon2012KRPOK). Clinically, ZBTB7C has been implicated in cancer biology, where it influences tumor growth and proliferation, as well as in metabolic disorders and ischemic injury, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Du2015Integrative; Jeon2012KRPOK).

## Structure
ZBTB7C is a protein characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and four C2H2 zinc finger domains. The BTB/POZ domain, located at the N-terminus, is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the zinc finger domains facilitate DNA binding (Du2015Integrative; Jeon2016Zbtb7c). The POZ domain spans amino acids 1-132, and the zinc finger domain is found between amino acids 365-468 (Jeon2016Zbtb7c). 

ZBTB7C undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its stability and function. Phosphorylation at serine 529 by p-Jnk is crucial for its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Mutations at this site can increase the protein's stability, while phosphomimetic mutations decrease it (Jeon2016Zbtb7c). Ubiquitination occurs at lysine residues 290 and 326, which are essential for its proteolytic degradation (Jeon2016Zbtb7c).

The protein's role as a transcriptional regulator is highlighted by its ability to interact with other proteins, such as c-Jun and NCoR, forming complexes that regulate gene expression (Jeon2016Zbtb7c). These interactions are mediated by its structural domains, which are critical for its function in various cellular processes.

## Function
ZBTB7C, also known as Kr-pok, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is a member of the BTB-POZ family and is involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, particularly during fasting. ZBTB7C regulates the expression of key gluconeogenic genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) by forming a complex with histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) and binding to insulin response elements within their promoters. This complex enhances the binding of forkhead box O1 (Foxo1) to these elements, activating transcription and maintaining blood glucose homeostasis (Choi2019Zbtb7c).

ZBTB7C also acts as a transcriptional repressor of the SIRT1 gene, interacting with the tumor suppressor protein p53 to recruit corepressors and repress SIRT1 transcription. This repression affects lipid metabolism by influencing transcription factors and coregulators such as Pparγ and Pgc-1α, which are crucial for adipogenesis and lipid metabolism (Choi2021Protooncoprotein).

In cancer biology, ZBTB7C interacts with p53 to repress the transcription of the CDKN1A gene, which encodes the cell-cycle regulator p21WAF1, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Jeon2012KRPOK). It also regulates glutamine metabolism by upregulating GLS1, a key enzyme in glutaminolysis, supporting rapid cancer cell proliferation (Hur2017KrPOK).

## Clinical Significance
The ZBTB7C gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in gene regulation and interaction with other proteins. In the context of ischemic injury, ZBTB7C is identified as a susceptibility gene. Its expression is upregulated in endothelial cells under ischemic conditions, contributing to increased neuronal death and endothelial dysfunction. This upregulation is associated with pathways that lead to increased ischemic damage, highlighting its potential clinical significance in stroke susceptibility and outcomes (Du2015Integrative).

In cancer, particularly kidney cancer, ZBTB7C, also known as KR-POK, is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is linked to cancer development as ZBTB7C interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, repressing its ability to activate transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, such as CDKN1A. This repression may contribute to tumor growth by promoting cancer cell proliferation (Jeon2012KRPOK).

ZBTB7C also plays a role in metabolic disorders. It acts as a transcriptional repressor of SIRT1, a gene involved in metabolic processes. Alterations in ZBTB7C expression, particularly under high-fat diet conditions and aging, affect lipid metabolism and may contribute to obesity and related metabolic diseases (Choi2021Protooncoprotein).

## Interactions
ZBTB7C, also known as KR-POK, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate gene expression. It forms a transcriptional repressor complex with c-Jun and NCoR, where it binds to c-Jun at the AP-1 site and recruits an NCoR/Hdac3 complex to repress the transcription of MMP genes such as MMP-8, -10, -13, and -16 (Jeon2016Zbtb7c). ZBTB7C also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, inhibiting its ability to activate transcription of the CDKN1A gene, which encodes the cell-cycle regulator p21WAF1. This interaction involves the recruitment of corepressors like NCoR and SMRT, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Jeon2012KRPOK).

In the context of gluconeogenesis, ZBTB7C interacts with the transcription factor Foxo1 and histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3). It enhances Foxo1's binding to insulin response elements (IREs) in the promoters of gluconeogenic genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1), facilitating their transcriptional activation during fasting (Choi2019Zbtb7c). ZBTB7C also interacts with PIAS1, affecting the transcriptional activity of p-STAT1 and promoting GLS1 transcription by recruiting the co-activator p300 to the GLS1 promoter (Hur2017KrPOK).
