# ERG28

## Overview
ERG28 is a gene that encodes the protein ergosterol biosynthesis 28 homolog, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, involved in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, which is essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity. Ergosterol biosynthesis 28 homolog is part of a complex network of enzymes and proteins that facilitate the conversion of squalene into ergosterol, a process vital for fungal growth and viability. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential as targets for antifungal therapies, given the absence of ergosterol in human cells, which reduces the risk of off-target effects in antifungal drug development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
