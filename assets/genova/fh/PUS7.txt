# PUS7

## Overview
PUS7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme pseudouridine synthase 7, which is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA through pseudouridylation. This enzyme is categorized as a pseudouridine synthase and plays a crucial role in stabilizing RNA molecules, thereby ensuring their proper function. Pseudouridine synthase 7 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular homeostasis. It is particularly significant in the modification of tRNA and mRNA, contributing to the stability and function of these RNA molecules. The enzyme's activity is regulated by environmental conditions, suggesting its dynamic role in responding to cellular stress. PUS7 is evolutionarily conserved across species, indicating its fundamental biological importance (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic; de2018Variants; Penzo2017RNA).

## Structure
The human PUS7 protein is a 661-residue pseudouridine synthase with a complex molecular structure. It features a predicted N-terminal disordered region (residues 1-98) and a pseudouridine synthase domain (residues 99-645) that includes several insertions (Guegueniat2021The). The crystal structure of PUS7 reveals two additional subdomains compared to its bacterial homolog, TruD, which contribute to its ability to bind the entire length of the L-shaped tRNA (Guegueniat2021The). These subdomains include an R3H-like insertion in the catalytic domain, which interacts with the anticodon loop of tRNA, and a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in the C-terminal insertion domain, which interacts with the acceptor arm of tRNA (Guegueniat2021The).

The structure of PUS7 resembles a question mark, with a large positively charged cleft between the catalytic domain and TruD-like insertion, harboring the conserved catalytic aspartate 294 and other conserved residues forming the active site (Guegueniat2021The). The catalytic mechanism involves a conserved aspartate residue essential for catalysis, stabilized by a conserved arginine (Guegueniat2021The). The N-terminal region of PUS7 is crucial for its interaction with proteins like SIRT1, forming a stable complex through several hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions (Dalal2019Biochemical).

## Function
PUS7 (pseudouridine synthase 7) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the pseudouridylation of RNA, a post-transcriptional modification process that stabilizes RNA molecules and is essential for their proper function. In healthy human cells, PUS7 primarily targets cytosolic tRNAs at position 13, modifying over 70% of its targets, which underscores its importance in maintaining tRNA stability and function, crucial for protein synthesis (de2018Variants). PUS7 is also involved in the pseudouridylation of mRNA, although the functional significance of this modification in mRNA is not fully understood (de2018Variants).

PUS7 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Penzo2017RNA). It is implicated in the heat shock response, where it increases pseudouridylation in mRNAs, enhancing their stability and potentially regulating mRNA properties such as stability and protein interactions under stress conditions (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). The enzyme's activity is regulated by environmental conditions, suggesting a dynamic role in responding to cellular stress and regulating gene expression (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). PUS7's function is evolutionarily conserved, as evidenced by similar roles in other species like Drosophila melanogaster (de2018Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PUS7 gene are linked to a range of developmental and neurological disorders. Biallelic mutations in PUS7, such as the Asp503Tyr missense mutation and a truncating variant (c.329_332delCTGA), are associated with an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly, and other features like sensorineural hearing loss and aggressive behavior (Shaheen2019PUS7). These mutations impair the pseudouridylation process, leading to reduced levels of pseudouridine in tRNAs, which is crucial for RNA stability and function (Shaheen2019PUS7).

In addition to developmental disorders, PUS7 is implicated in cancer. Overexpression of PUS7 has been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis (Zhang2023Higher; Song2021HSP90dependent). In CRC, PUS7 promotes metastasis by regulating LASP1 abundance, independent of its pseudouridylation activity (Song2021HSP90dependent). These findings suggest that PUS7 plays a significant role in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PUS7 interacts with the protein LASP1, enhancing the metastasis and invasion capabilities of CRC cells. This interaction is significant as PUS7 overexpression increases LASP1 protein levels, promoting tumor metastasis through a PUS7/LASP1 axis (Song2021HSP90dependent). PUS7 also interacts with HSP90, a chaperone protein that stabilizes PUS7 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. This interaction leads to increased PUS7 levels in CRC cells, which correlates with elevated LASP1 expression and enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion (Song2021HSP90dependent).

In the context of SARS-CoV-2, PUS7 binds to the 5' and 3' terminal regions of the viral RNA, suggesting a role in pseudouridylation of the viral genome. This modification potentially affects RNA secondary structure and enhances the binding of the viral protein NSP1 to the RNA, which is crucial for the translation of viral RNA transcripts (Giambruno2023Unveiling). These interactions highlight PUS7's involvement in both cancer progression and viral RNA modification, indicating its diverse functional roles.
