# ADH6

## Overview
ADH6 is a gene that encodes the protein alcohol dehydrogenase 6 (class V), which is part of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. This family of enzymes is primarily involved in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes. Unlike other members of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, ADH6 is characterized by unique structural features, including distinctive amino acid sequences and a lack of stable dimer formation, which suggest it may function as a pseudoenzyme with an as-yet-undetermined physiological role (Östberg2016Computational). Despite its unclear enzymatic activity, ADH6 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in liver-related conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis (Liu2020Prognostic). Additionally, ADH6 may interact with other genes involved in alcohol metabolism, potentially influencing susceptibility to alcohol-related disorders (kuo2008association).

## Structure
The human ADH6 gene encodes class V alcohol dehydrogenase, which exhibits unique structural characteristics compared to other ADH classes. The primary structure of ADH6 includes unique amino acid sequences that differ from those conserved in classes I-IV, such as a distinctive Lys51 involved in the catalytic mechanism (Östberg2016Computational). The secondary structure is characterized by elongated β-strands and a labile α-helix at the subunit interface, which may contribute to its instability and inability to form stable dimers (Östberg2016Computational). 

The tertiary structure of ADH6 likely involves significant deviations from typical ADH structures, with molecular dynamics simulations indicating destabilized α-helices and elongated β-strands in the dimerization region (Östberg2016Computational). These structural features suggest that ADH6 may not form the typical quaternary structure seen in other ADH classes, where dimerization is crucial for stability (Östberg2016Computational). 

ADH6 is suggested to be a pseudoenzyme with an unknown physiological function, as it has not been isolated as a functional protein, and its quaternary structure is likely disrupted, preventing typical dimer formation (Östberg2016Computational).

## Clinical Significance
The ADH6 gene, encoding alcohol dehydrogenase 6, has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in relation to its expression levels and potential interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression of ADH6 is significantly decreased in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. High levels of ADH6 expression are associated with improved overall survival and recurrence-free survival in HCC patients, indicating its potential prognostic value (Liu2020Prognostic). 

While specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in ADH6 are not detailed, alterations in its expression have been linked to alcohol-related conditions. The gene's expression is increased in HCC patients with alcohol consumption, highlighting its involvement in alcohol metabolism and its potential impact on liver disease progression (Liu2020Prognostic). 

Interactions between ADH6 and other genes, such as ALDH2, have been noted in the context of alcohol dependence, suggesting a possible epistatic role in influencing susceptibility to alcohol-related disorders (kuo2008association). However, the precise clinical implications of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
