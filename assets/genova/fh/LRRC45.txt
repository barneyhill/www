# LRRC45

## Overview
The LRRC45 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 45, which is integral to centrosome cohesion and ciliogenesis in human cells. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and structural organization within the cell (Muto2010CLERC; He2013LRRC45). LRRC45 is a component of the centrosome linker, contributing to the maintenance of centrosome cohesion during interphase and playing a pivotal role in the separation of centrosomes during mitosis through its phosphorylation by the kinase Nek2A (He2013LRRC45). Additionally, LRRC45 is involved in the early stages of cilia formation, interacting with proteins such as Cep83 and SCLT1, and is essential for the recruitment of vesicles necessary for ciliary membrane extension (Kurtulmus2017Analysis). The protein's interactions and structural features underscore its importance in cellular processes related to cell division and cilia biogenesis.

## Structure
The LRRC45 protein is characterized by several leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains at its N terminus and a long coiled-coil domain at its C terminus. The LRR domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and typically form a horseshoe-shaped curved solenoid structure, with a concave surface made of a parallel β-sheet and a convex side composed of α-helices, 3 10 helices, polyproline II helices, and β-turns (Muto2010CLERC). The C terminus of LRRC45 is crucial for its centrosomal localization and is involved in forming filament-like structures, suggesting that LRRC45 can polymerize with itself to form a homopolymer (He2013LRRC45). This region contains a predicted SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) domain, which forms a slim α-helix rod-like structure and mediates protein dimerization (He2013LRRC45).

LRRC45 is phosphorylated by the kinase Nek2A at the S661 site during mitosis, which affects its centrosomal localization and the formation of fiber-like structures, leading to centrosome separation (He2013LRRC45). The interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains suggests a complex structural organization, although co-overexpressed fragments do not recruit each other in cells (He2013LRRC45).

## Function
The LRRC45 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in centrosome cohesion and ciliogenesis in healthy human cells. LRRC45 is a component of the centrosome linker, localizing at the proximal ends of centrioles and forming fiber-like structures that maintain centrosome cohesion during interphase. This cohesion is essential for the centrosomes to function as a single microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), which is critical for proper cell division. The protein interacts with C-Nap1 and rootletin, and its phosphorylation by Nek2A during mitosis leads to centrosome separation, a necessary step for spindle assembly (He2013LRRC45).

In ciliogenesis, LRRC45 is involved in the early stages of cilia formation. It associates with distal appendages of centrioles, interacting with proteins such as Cep83 and SCLT1, and is essential for the recruitment of Rab8a-positive vesicles, which are crucial for ciliary membrane extension. LRRC45 also influences the organization of centriolar satellites, such as PCM1 and SSX2IP, around centrosomes, which are important for cilia formation (Kurtulmus2017Analysis). The protein's role in maintaining centriole cohesion is also vital for ciliogenesis, as its depletion leads to defects in primary cilia formation (Loukil2017The).

## Interactions
LRRC45 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in centrosome cohesion and ciliogenesis. It interacts with C-Nap1 and rootletin, two proteins essential for centrosome cohesion. LRRC45 colocalizes with C-Nap1 and interacts with its C terminus, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays and yeast two-hybrid assays (He2013LRRC45). LRRC45 also interacts with the middle region of rootletin, although its depletion does not significantly affect rootletin's centrosomal localization (He2013LRRC45).

In ciliogenesis, LRRC45 associates with distal appendage proteins such as Cep83, SCLT1, and FBF1. It interacts with Cep83 and SCLT1, with the leucine-rich repeats of LRRC45 associating with the coiled coil domain of SCLT1, and its C-terminal domain associating with Cep83 and FBF1 (Kurtulmus2017Analysis). LRRC45 is recruited to the mother centriole by Cep83 and SCLT1, and it further recruits FBF1 to the centriole (Kurtulmus2017Analysis). These interactions highlight LRRC45's role in organizing centriolar satellites and facilitating Rab8-positive vesicle docking during cilia biogenesis (Kurtulmus2017Analysis).
