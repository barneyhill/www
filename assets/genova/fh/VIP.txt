# VIP

## Overview
The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene encodes a neuropeptide that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes across multiple systems in the human body. VIP is a member of the glucagon/secretin family of peptides and is primarily known for its function as a neurotransmitter and hormone. The peptide, composed of 28 amino acids, is involved in regulating circadian rhythms, glucose metabolism, and pulmonary and reproductive health. It exerts its effects through interactions with G-protein-coupled receptors, such as VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1R, which lead to the activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Dickson2009VPAC). VIP also plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, influencing cytokine production, and maintaining intestinal health (Seillet2019The; R.P.2001Immunology). The gene's structure, consisting of seven exons, is similar to other members of its multigene family, suggesting evolutionary conservation and functional significance (TSUKADA1985Structure). VIP's clinical relevance is underscored by its involvement in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory diseases, where its deficiency or altered expression can lead to significant pathological changes (Lelievre2007Gastrointestinal; Alcolado2014Cystic).

## Structure
The human vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide composed of 28 amino acids, primarily structured as a linear sequence. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure of VIP is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its biological activity. VIP may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interaction with receptors (Gozes1986Structure).

The gene encoding VIP is approximately 9 kilobases long and consists of seven exons. Exon 2 contains the coding information for a potential signal peptide, while exons 4 and 5 code for the PHM-27 and VIP hormones, respectively. Exon 3 codes for a spacer protein sequence, which may play a role in the proper folding of the polyprotein precursor, facilitating its processing and storage in secretory vesicles (Linder1987Structure). The structure of the VIP gene is similar to other members of its multigene family, such as glucagon and secretin, suggesting that VIP is part of a multigene family (TSUKADA1985Structure). The gene structure suggests that exons may serve as building blocks for functional domains of the corresponding proteins (Linder1987Structure).

## Function
The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene encodes a 28 amino acid peptide that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. VIP is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, glucose metabolism, pulmonary function, and reproductive health. It acts as a neurotransmitter and hormone, influencing vasodilation, smooth muscle relaxation, and electrolyte secretion in the gut (Dickson2009VPAC). VIP functions through G-protein coupled receptors, primarily VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1R, which activate adenylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Dickson2009VPAC).

In the immune system, VIP modulates immune responses by influencing cytokine production and signaling pathways. It inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 and TNFα, thereby promoting a shift towards Th2 cell differentiation and reducing Th1 responses (R.P.2001Immunology). VIP also enhances the production of IL-22 by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), which is crucial for maintaining intestinal health and protecting the intestinal epithelium from inflammation (Seillet2019The). These functions highlight VIP's role in maintaining homeostasis and protecting against inflammatory and immune-related conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene are linked to several clinical conditions. VIP plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal function, and its deficiency can lead to significant anatomical and physiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract. VIP-deficient mice exhibit altered intestinal morphology, thickening of smooth muscle layers, increased villi length, and mucus secretion defects, which suggest a potential role in conditions like chronic ileus and Hirschsprung's disease (Lelievre2007Gastrointestinal).

In the context of cystic fibrosis, VIP is essential for the proper localization and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). VIP knockout mice show CFTR mislocalization, leading to a CF-like phenotype, which can be reversed by VIP administration. This indicates that VIP is significant in maintaining CFTR-dependent secretion, and its absence can result in conditions resembling cystic fibrosis, such as mucus plugging and intestinal blockage (Alcolado2014Cystic).

VIP is also implicated in respiratory diseases, including bronchial asthma and pulmonary arterial hypertension. VIP knockout mice exhibit pathological changes in lung tissues, such as increased airway secretion and alveolar edema, which are reversible with VIP treatment, highlighting its role in maintaining normal lung function (Alcolado2014Cystic).

## Interactions
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interacts with several proteins, primarily through its binding to G-protein-coupled receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2. These interactions are crucial for VIP's role in various physiological processes. VIP binds to the VPAC1 receptor, where specific residues in the N-terminal ectodomain are essential for this interaction. Key residues such as Asp 68, Pro 87, Gly 109, and Trp 110 are necessary for VIP binding, and the presence of conserved cysteine residues likely contributes to the formation of disulfide bonds that maintain the domain's structure (Laburthe2002Molecular). 

The interaction of VIP with the VPAC1 receptor involves a two-step activation mechanism, where the peptide's 6-28 fragment fits into the receptor's N-terminal ectodomain, while the N-terminus interacts with the transmembrane region (Tan2006Peptide). Photoaffinity labeling experiments have identified specific receptor fragments involved in covalent bonding with VIP, such as the 104-108 sequence, with Asp 107 being a site of attachment (Tan2006Peptide). These interactions highlight the structural requirements for VIP's binding and activation of its receptors, which are critical for its biological activity.
