# ATXN2L

## Overview
The ATXN2L gene encodes the ataxin 2-like protein, which is a multifunctional protein involved in RNA processing and cellular stress responses. As a paralog of ataxin-2, ATXN2L shares structural similarities, including RNA-binding motifs and domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in mRNA regulation and stress granule dynamics (Kaehler2012Ataxin2Like). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but also associates with nuclear splicing speckles, a localization influenced by post-translational modifications such as arginine methylation (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated). ATXN2L plays a critical role in mRNA stability and translation, particularly under stress conditions, by promoting the formation of stress granules (Key2020MidGestation). Additionally, it is implicated in various signaling pathways, including mTOR and PI3K/Akt, and has been associated with diseases such as gastric cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Key2020MidGestation; Lin2019ATXN2L).

## Structure
The ATXN2L protein contains several conserved structural domains that are crucial for its function. It includes an Lsm and LsmAD motif, which enable direct interaction with RNAs, and a PAM2 motif that mediates association with the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 (Key2020MidGestation). The protein also features an alternatively spliced exon encoding a proline-rich domain (PRD), facilitating interaction with SH3 motifs in growth factor receptor endocytosis components (Key2020MidGestation). 

ATXN2L undergoes post-translational modifications, notably arginine methylation. It is asymmetrically dimethylated at arginine 361 within an RGG motif, a modification that affects its localization and interaction with other proteins (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated). This methylation is regulated by PRMT1 and influences ATXN2L's association with nuclear splicing speckles (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated).

The protein exists in several isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not extensively covered in the available literature (Key2020MidGestation). These isoforms may interact with tyrosine kinase receptor signaling at the plasma membrane (Key2020MidGestation). The absence of RNA-interaction domains in ATXN2L is incompatible with embryonic development, highlighting their importance (Key2020MidGestation).

## Function
The ATXN2L gene encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to RNA processing and regulation. In healthy human cells, ATXN2L functions as a direct RNA-binding protein with sequence homology to nuclear spliceosome factors, playing a significant role in mRNA processing and stability (Key2020MidGestation). It is involved in RNA surveillance, particularly during periods of cellular stress, by promoting the formation of stress granules in the cytosol (Key2020MidGestation). These granules are essential for managing mRNA translation and stability under stress conditions, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated).

ATXN2L is also implicated in the regulation of mTOR signaling, which is crucial for cell growth and metabolism (Key2020MidGestation). The protein's activity is modulated by nutrient availability, with its expression being induced under nutrient deprivation and excess glucose conditions (Key2020MidGestation). Additionally, ATXN2L interacts with poly(A)-binding proteins and stress-granule components, such as G3BP2, DDX6, and LSM12, indicating its involvement in mRNA processing and cellular stress responses (Key2020MidGestation).

In terms of cellular localization, ATXN2L is primarily active in the cytoplasm but also localizes to nuclear splicing speckles, a process regulated by arginine methylation mediated by PRMT1 (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated). This localization is crucial for its function in RNA processing and stress response mechanisms (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated).

## Clinical Significance
The ATXN2L gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions. Alterations in ATXN2L expression have been linked to gastric cancer, where it is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall and recurrence-free survival. ATXN2L promotes gastric cancer cell migration and invasion through epithelial to mesenchymal transition and contributes to resistance against the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin. This resistance is mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Lin2019ATXN2L).

In neurodegenerative diseases, ATXN2L is implicated due to its role in RNA metabolism and stress granule formation. Its expression is influenced by nutrient availability, and it may have therapeutic implications in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where hypercaloric feeding has shown benefits (Key2020MidGestation). The gene's involvement in stress granule dynamics and its interaction with proteins like DDX6 suggest a role in cellular stress responses, which are critical in neurodegenerative pathomechanisms (Kaehler2012Ataxin2Like).

ATXN2L is also involved in T-cell lymphomagenesis through a fusion with the JAK2 gene, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which may be targeted by JAK2 inhibitors (Panagopoulos2017Fusion).

## Interactions
ATXN2L, a paralog of ataxin-2, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes. It physically interacts with the RNA helicase DDX6 and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T and HeLa cells (Kaehler2012Ataxin2Like). ATXN2L also associates with the RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP, which is crucial for stress granule (SG) formation (Kaehler2012Ataxin2Like). The interaction with G3BP suggests ATXN2L's role in the nucleation step of SG assembly (Kaehler2012Ataxin2Like).

ATXN2L is a component of stress granules and processing bodies, influencing their formation and dynamics. Overexpression of ATXN2L induces SG formation, while its reduction decreases SG number and size (Kaehler2012Ataxin2Like). It also interacts with PRMT1, a protein arginine methyltransferase, and this interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated). The interaction with PRMT1 occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm and is independent of the arginines within the RGG motifs of ATXN2L, suggesting the involvement of the LSm domain (Kaehler2015PRMT1mediated). These interactions highlight ATXN2L's role in RNA metabolism and stress response pathways.
