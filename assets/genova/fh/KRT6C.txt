# KRT6C

## Overview
KRT6C is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 6C, a type II cytokeratin, which is part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins. Keratin 6C plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support and resilience to tissues such as skin, hair, and nails. The protein is particularly expressed in the plantar epidermis and is involved in conditions like focal palmoplantar keratoderma. KRT6C interacts with other keratins, such as KRT9, to form heterodimers essential for the organization of the intermediate filament-based cytoskeleton. Mutations in the KRT6C gene are linked to skin disorders like pachyonychia congenita and epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma due to its role in cancer proliferation and migration (Wilson2010Keratin; Ho2022Update; Hu2019High).

## Structure
Keratin 6C (KRT6C) is a type II cytokeratin, part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins. The primary structure of KRT6C consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Ho2022Update). This structure facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers, a characteristic feature of keratin proteins (Ho2022Update). The secondary structure is characterized by these coiled-coil motifs, which are crucial for the protein's function in forming stable heterodimers and homodimers (Ho2022Update).

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT6C forms intermediate filaments through dimerization and higher-order assembly. These filaments are essential for providing structural integrity to epithelial cells (Ho2022Update). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with other keratin proteins, such as KRT9, which is significant in the context of epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (Li2022Proteomic).

Post-translational modifications of KRT6C may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect filament dynamics and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Ho2022Update).

## Function
Keratin 6C, encoded by the KRT6C gene, is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It is part of the keratin filament network, which provides mechanical support and resilience to tissues such as skin, hair, and nails. In healthy human cells, keratin 6C is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of intermediate filaments. These filaments are essential for the mechanical resilience of the epidermis, particularly in areas subjected to high mechanical stress, such as the palms and soles (Kubo2013Collapse).

Keratin 6C is expressed in a tissue- and differentiation-specific manner, playing a major structural role in the epidermis. It is particularly expressed in the plantar epidermis, which aligns with its involvement in conditions like focal palmoplantar keratoderma (Wilson2010Keratin). The protein's function is critical for normal skin function, as it helps maintain the structural integrity of keratin filaments, which are crucial for resisting wear and tear (Wilson2010Keratin). The expression pattern of KRT6C is more restricted compared to other keratins like KRT6A, suggesting a specialized role in certain tissues (Ho2022Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KRT6C gene are associated with several skin-related conditions and diseases. KRT6C is implicated in pachyonychia congenita (PC), a rare genetic disorder characterized by nail dystrophy, painful palmoplantar keratoderma, and other symptoms. Mutations in KRT6C, along with other keratin genes, lead to the fragility of the epithelial cell cytoskeleton, resulting in hyperkeratosis and other clinical manifestations of PC (Goldberg2013Best; Samuelov2020Revisiting). 

KRT6C also plays a role in epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK), where it acts as a heterodimer partner for KRT9. Mutations in these genes can lead to phenotypic overlaps between EPPK and PC-K6c, suggesting that the KRT6C/KRT9 interaction is crucial for maintaining skin structure (Li2022Proteomic).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high expression of KRT6C is associated with poor prognosis. It accelerates cancer proliferation and migration by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Knockdown of KRT6C in LUAD cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role as a cancer facilitator (Hu2019High).

## Interactions
KRT6C (keratin 6C) is known to form heterodimers with KRT9, a type I keratin, in the context of epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK). This interaction was identified through proteomic profiling, co-immunoprecipitation, and mass spectroscopy, and it plays a crucial role in intermediate filament-based cytoskeleton organization and keratinization processes (Li2022Proteomic). The KRT6C/KRT9 pair forms a coiled-coil structure in their 2B domains, as demonstrated by in silico modeling (Li2022Proteomic). 

KRT6C is also part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes KRT19, contributing to the maintenance of epidermal integrity and response to external stressors (Li2022Proteomic). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, KRT6C shows correlations with other KRT6 proteins, particularly KRT6B, suggesting potential interactions in tumor and margin samples (Nałęcz2024Assessment). 

In addition, KRT6C is involved in various signaling pathways and biological processes relevant to melanoma, including the P53 pathway, KRAS signaling, and estrogen response (Han2021Transcript). These interactions highlight KRT6C's role in both structural and signaling functions within epithelial tissues.
