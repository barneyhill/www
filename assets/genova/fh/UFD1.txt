# UFD1

## Overview
UFD1 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin recognition factor in ER-associated degradation 1, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it facilitates the recognition and processing of ubiquitinated proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell (Cao2007Ufd1). UFD1 forms a complex with Npl4 and the AAA ATPase VCP/p97, acting as a bridge that enhances the binding of polyubiquitin chains, which is crucial for the degradation of misfolded proteins (Meyer2000A). Beyond its role in ERAD, UFD1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its multifaceted functions in cellular processes (Chen2011Ubiquitinrecognition; Cao2007Ufd1). The protein's structure, characterized by distinct domains such as the UT3 and UT6, facilitates its interactions with other proteins and ubiquitin chains, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular stability and function (Park2005Ufd1; Pye2007Structural).

## Structure
The UFD1 protein is characterized by an AAA-ATPase fold and contains distinct domains that facilitate its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The N-terminal domain of UFD1, known as the UT3 domain, exhibits a double-psi β barrel structure, which serves as a ubiquitin binding domain. This domain has two independent binding sites for mono- and polyubiquitin, with a higher affinity for polyubiquitin due to distinct binding sites with different affinities (Park2005Ufd1; Pye2007Structural). The UT3 domain is structurally similar to the N domains of p97 and other homologous AAA-ATPases (Park2005Ufd1).

The C-terminal portion of UFD1, referred to as the UT6 domain, is predicted to be unstructured when isolated from its binding partners and forms interactions with both Npl4 and p97 (Isaacson2007Detailed; Pye2007Structural). UFD1 forms a complex with Npl4 and p97, which is essential for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and other cellular processes (Pye2007Structural). The UFD1-Npl4 complex has an elongated bilobed structure, with the larger lobe attributed to Npl4 and the smaller lobe to the UFD1 UT3 domain (Pye2007Structural).

## Function
The UFD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Cao2007Ufd1). UFD1 forms a complex with Npl4 and the AAA ATPase VCP/p97, which recognizes polyubiquitin chains and transfers ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation (Cao2007Ufd1). This process is crucial for maintaining protein quality control within the ER.

In addition to its role in ERAD, UFD1 acts as a cofactor for the ubiquitin ligase gp78, enhancing its activity to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol metabolism (Cao2007Ufd1). This interaction is independent of VCP and is essential for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the stability of HMG-CoA reductase (Cao2007Ufd1).

UFD1 also plays a role in cell cycle regulation by modulating the ubiquitination and stability of Skp2, an F-box adaptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF Skp2. During prolonged ER stress, UFD1 expression is repressed, leading to Skp2 destabilization and accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, which delays cell cycle progression in the G1 phase (Chen2011Ubiquitinrecognition).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UFD1L gene are associated with several developmental disorders and diseases. The UFD1L gene is located on chromosome 22q11.2, a region frequently deleted in patients with DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS). This deletion leads to haploinsufficiency of the UFD1L gene, contributing to the pathogenesis of these syndromes, which are characterized by cardiac and craniofacial defects (Novelli1998Structure; Pizzuti1997UFD1L). In mice, a complete loss of UFD1L results in embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in development (Amati2002Functional).

The UFD1L gene is also implicated in schizophrenia. Studies have shown significant associations between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the UFD1L gene and schizophrenia in various populations, suggesting a genetic predisposition linked to this locus (Xie2008A).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, UFD1 expression is upregulated by PCBP2, enhancing oncogenic and metastatic capacities. Knockdown of UFD1 in breast cancer cells reduces proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Wang2021PCBP2Posttranscriptional). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UFD1L in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research into its mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
UFD1 is a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, forming a complex with Npl4 and p97 (also known as VCP in mammals). This complex is involved in various cellular pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and ubiquitin-mediated processing. UFD1 acts as a bridge in the complex, independently binding to both Npl4 and p97, while Npl4 and p97 do not bind in the absence of UFD1 (Meyer2000A). The UFD1-Npl4 complex can also bind ubiquitin conjugates directly, facilitated by a zinc finger domain in Npl4, which is crucial for binding polyubiquitylated proteins (Meyer2002Direct).

UFD1 contains two distinct ubiquitin interaction sites, with a higher affinity for polyubiquitin than monoubiquitin, due to separate binding sites with different affinities (Park2005Ufd1). The UFD1-Npl4 complex can bind ubiquitin close to the body of p97, potentially allowing a polyubiquitin chain to interact with both UFD1-Npl4 and p97, enhancing binding affinity (Pye2007Structural). UFD1 also interacts with SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier protein) through a C-terminal SUMO interaction motif, which is crucial for maintaining genome stability (Nie2012Dual).
