# ZNF613

## Overview
ZNF613 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 613, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role as transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger motifs, which enable them to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 613 is involved in critical cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function. The protein's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA to modulate transcriptional activity. While the specific pathways and target genes regulated by ZNF613 are not fully understood, its involvement in key biological processes suggests a significant role in development and cellular response mechanisms (Kennedy2012Genomewide; Arakelyan2021Transcriptome).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF613 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to DNA, influencing the transcriptional activity of specific target genes. In healthy human cells, ZNF613 is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. By modulating the expression of genes associated with these processes, ZNF613 contributes to the maintenance of normal cellular function and homeostasis.

Zinc finger proteins like ZNF613 are integral to the precise control of gene expression, which is essential for the proper development and functioning of cells. The activity of ZNF613 within the cell is likely localized to the nucleus, where it can interact directly with DNA to exert its regulatory effects. Through its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF613 may influence various organismal outcomes, including tissue development and response to cellular stress. The specific target genes and pathways regulated by ZNF613, however, remain to be fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research to understand its comprehensive role in human biology.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF613 has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its role in gene expression and cellular processes. In cattle, alterations in ZNF613 are associated with gestation length and calving difficulties, suggesting its involvement in reproductive traits (Fang2019Genetic; Purfield2019Genomic). Although these findings are specific to cattle, they highlight the gene's potential impact on developmental processes.

In humans, ZNF613 has been linked to immune response variations. A genome-wide association study identified significant associations between ZNF613 and immune responses to the smallpox vaccine, particularly in the African-American cohort, indicating that genetic polymorphisms in ZNF613 may influence immune function (Kennedy2012Genomewide).

ZNF613 is also involved in cancer progression. In ovarian cancer with BRCA2 mutations, ZNF613 is upregulated, suggesting a role in cancer stemness and metastasis (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome). Additionally, mutations in ZNF613 have been observed in metastatic hepatocellular carcinomas, indicating a potential role in cancer metastasis (Ouyang2014Wholegenome).

These associations underscore the clinical significance of ZNF613 in various diseases, although the precise mechanisms and broader implications require further investigation.
