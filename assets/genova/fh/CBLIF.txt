# CBLIF

## Overview
The CBLIF gene encodes the cobalamin binding intrinsic factor, a crucial protein involved in the absorption of vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, in humans. This protein functions as a binding factor, facilitating the transport and protection of vitamin B12 through the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the acidic environment of the stomach. The intrinsic factor is categorized as a binding protein due to its role in forming a stable complex with vitamin B12, which is essential for its subsequent absorption in the ileum. The proper functioning of the CBLIF gene is vital for preventing vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to serious health issues such as pernicious anemia and neurological disorders. The gene's significance is further underscored by its involvement in various clinical conditions, including congenital pernicious anemia and its exclusion in the diagnosis of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (Kingma2023ImerslundGräsbeck; Temple2023Framework; SobczyńskaMalefora2021Vitamin).

## Structure


## Function
The CBLIF gene encodes the cobalamin binding intrinsic factor, a protein essential for vitamin B12 absorption in humans. This protein is primarily active in the gastric lumen, where it binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex that protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach (Temple2023Framework). The intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex then travels to the ileum, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. This absorption process is crucial for DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation, highlighting the protein's vital role in maintaining healthy cellular and organismal functions. The proper function of CBLIF is necessary to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to conditions such as pernicious anemia, characterized by impaired red blood cell production and neurological disturbances. Although the specific function of CBLIF in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the provided studies, its role in vitamin B12 metabolism is well-established, underscoring its importance in human health (Temple2023Framework).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CBLIF gene, also known as cobalamin binding intrinsic factor, are associated with congenital pernicious anemia (PA). This condition arises from defects in the synthesis of intrinsic factor (IF), which is crucial for vitamin B12 absorption. Congenital PA typically presents within the first five years of life, although it can manifest later if the defect is partial. This condition shares features with non-dietary adult PA, an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibodies against gastric parietal cells or gastric IF (SobczyńskaMalefora2021Vitamin).

In the context of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS), the CBLIF gene is analyzed to exclude intrinsic factor deficiency as a cause of vitamin B12 malabsorption. IGS is primarily linked to mutations in the AMN and CUBN genes, but the exclusion of CBLIF mutations is part of the diagnostic process (Kingma2023ImerslundGräsbeck).

While the CBLIF gene was investigated in a study on inherited selective cobalamin malabsorption in Komondor dogs, it was excluded as a candidate gene for the disease, as no pathogenic variants were found in affected dogs (Fyfe2018Inherited).
