# NEGR1

## Overview
NEGR1 (neuronal growth regulator 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its role as a cell adhesion molecule. The protein, also named NEGR1, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein that plays a significant role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in the regulation of neurite arborization, which is crucial for the formation of neuronal circuits. NEGR1 interacts with various proteins, including the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 and the Na/K-ATPase beta1-subunit, influencing signaling pathways that are vital for cortical development and neuronal communication. Alterations in the NEGR1 gene have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as obesity, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its potential implications in neurological health and disease (Szczurkowska2018NEGR1; Sim2022The; Kumar2018In).

## Structure
NEGR1 (neuronal growth regulator 1) is a protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and contains three C2-type immunoglobulin-like domains, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Cheon2021NaKATPase). These domains contribute to its function in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Sim2022The). NEGR1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, indicating its localization in the cell membrane and involvement in neural cell communication (Cheon2021NaKATPase).

The protein undergoes N-glycosylation, a post-translational modification where N-glycans are attached to asparagine residues. This modification is essential for NEGR1's proper folding, stability, and functional interactions, particularly in homophilic interactions necessary for cell-cell adhesion (Sim2022The). NEGR1 has six putative N-glycosylation sites, with specific sites like N286, N294, and N307 being critical for these interactions (Sim2022The).

NEGR1 can form high molecular weight complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonds, which are likely due to incorrect protein folding in certain mutants (Sim2022The). The protein's interaction with the Na/K-ATPase beta1-subunit (ATP1B1) suggests a role in intercellular interactions, with both proteins co-localizing in membrane lipid rafts (Cheon2021NaKATPase).

## Function
NEGR1 (neuronal growth regulator 1) is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It is part of the IgLON superfamily and is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it influences neural connectivity and plasticity (Sim2022The). NEGR1 is involved in the regulation of neurite arborization, which is essential for the development of neuronal processes such as axons and dendrites. This regulation is vital for establishing functional neuronal circuits during development (Pischedda2014A).

NEGR1 functions as a synaptic adhesion protein, initially located at axons and presynaptic terminals, and later at postsynaptic sites. Its expression is crucial for proper neuronal maturation, affecting synapse numbers and the complexity of neurite arborization (Pischedda2014A). NEGR1 also acts as a soluble factor that promotes neuronal arborization through the FGFR2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2) pathway, influencing neurite length and number (Pischedda2016The).

The protein's activity is modulated by N-glycosylation, which is essential for its intracellular trafficking and functionality. Mutations in NEGR1's glycosylation sites can disrupt its localization and function, affecting its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development (Sim2022The). NEGR1's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its potential implications in neurological health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NEGR1 gene have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric conditions. Genetic variations in NEGR1 are associated with obesity, as they can affect neuronal control of food intake, potentially leading to increased body mass index (Kumar2018In). NEGR1 is also implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), with increased expression observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hypothalamic areas of MDD patients (Kaare2022DepressionAssociated). The gene's involvement in depression is further supported by its modulation through antidepressant treatments, which alter the expression of genes in the NEGR1-FGFR2 pathway (Carboni2020DepressionAssociated).

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), NEGR1 plays a role in cortical development and behaviors. Downregulation of NEGR1 affects ERK and AKT signaling pathways, leading to neurodevelopmental and behavioral deficits (Szczurkowska2018NEGR1). NEGR1 mutations or expression alterations are also linked to schizophrenia and learning difficulties, with evidence suggesting that these changes can impact cognitive functions and susceptibility to seizures (Singh2018Neuronal). In pediatric high-grade gliomas, low NEGR1 expression is associated with a worse prognosis, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Bobyn2020Ancestry).

## Interactions
NEGR1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for neuronal development and function. It interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2, modulating signaling pathways such as ERK and AKT, which are important for cortical development and behaviors related to autism spectrum disorders (Szczurkowska2018NEGR1). NEGR1's interaction with FGFR2 is specific, as it does not bind to FGFR1 or other control proteins (Szczurkowska2018NEGR1). This interaction influences FGFR2's intracellular trafficking and signaling, reducing its degradation from the plasma membrane (Szczurkowska2018NEGR1).

NEGR1 also interacts with the Na/K-ATPase beta1-subunit (ATP1B1), forming a stable complex that is important for intercellular interactions. This binding is mediated by the C-terminal regions of both proteins and is influenced by glycosylation (Cheon2021NaKATPase). The interaction with ATP1B1 suggests a role for NEGR1 in cellular adhesion and communication, potentially impacting various human diseases (Cheon2021NaKATPase). These interactions highlight NEGR1's involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate neuronal growth and development.
