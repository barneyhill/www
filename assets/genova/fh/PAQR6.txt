# PAQR6

## Overview
PAQR6 is a gene that encodes the protein progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 6, which is a member of the membrane progesterone receptor family. This protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain structure, typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and an additional eighth transmembrane domain that is intracellular (Smith2008Heterologous; Tang2005PAQR). PAQR6 functions primarily as a membrane progesterone receptor, playing a crucial role in non-genomic signaling pathways by interacting with stimulatory G proteins (Gs) (Thomas2022Membrane; Smith2008Heterologous). It is involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the reproductive and central nervous systems, and is known for its high affinity for progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone (Petersen2013Nonclassical; Smith2008Heterologous). The gene's expression and copy number variations have been implicated in several cancers, including prostate, bladder, and hepatic cancers, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (AbouFadel2023Key; Cai2021Copy; Yang2021PAQR6).

## Structure
PAQR6 is a member of the PAQR family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) pass motif, which is a common feature of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Tang2005PAQR). The protein structure includes a core of seven transmembrane domains and an additional eighth transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, which is intracellular (Smith2008Heterologous). This eighth domain is hypothesized to play a role in progesterone sensing, although its exact function remains complex and not fully understood (Smith2008Heterologous).

The PAQR6 protein is predicted to have a predominantly alpha-helical conformation, typical of its transmembrane domains, although no structural confirmation has been made (Tang2005PAQR). The protein's transmembrane regions are conserved in terms of hydrophobicity, despite lacking consistent amino acid identity (Tang2005PAQR). The PAQR6 protein also features an extracellular C-terminus, contrasting with other progestin-binding PAQRs that have an extracellular N-terminus (Tang2005PAQR).

PAQR6 is capable of binding progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, but not testosterone, indicating its specificity as a progesterone receptor (Smith2008Heterologous). The protein is also known to bind allopregnanolone, a neuroactive progesterone metabolite, with high affinity, suggesting its role in rapid progesterone signaling in the nervous system (Petersen2013Nonclassical).

## Function
PAQR6, also known as mPRδ, is a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family and functions as a membrane progesterone receptor. It is involved in non-genomic signaling pathways, primarily through its interaction with stimulatory G proteins (Gs), which suggests its role in rapid cellular responses to progesterone (Thomas2022Membrane; Smith2008Heterologous). PAQR6 is characterized by its structure, which includes seven transmembrane domains and an additional eighth transmembrane domain that is hypothesized to be involved in progesterone sensing (Smith2008Heterologous).

In healthy human cells, PAQR6 is implicated in various physiological processes, including reproductive and central nervous system functions. It is sensitive to progesterone, with an EC50 value of 2.6 nM, indicating its high affinity for this hormone (Smith2008Heterologous). PAQR6 is also capable of being activated by 17α-hydroxyprogesterone but not by testosterone, highlighting its specificity for certain ligands (Smith2008Heterologous). The receptor is active in the cell membrane, where it participates in complex signaling networks that maintain cellular functions and stability, particularly in cells lacking nuclear progesterone receptors (Aickareth2023Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAQR6 gene have been linked to various cancers, particularly prostate and bladder cancer. In prostate cancer, PAQR6 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages, higher Gleason scores, and poorer survival outcomes. This upregulation is associated with androgen receptor (AR) signaling, as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation enhances PAQR6 expression, which can be reversed by the AR antagonist Bicalutamide. These findings suggest that PAQR6 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Yang2021PAQR6).

In bladder cancer, copy number variations (CNVs) of PAQR6 have been identified as independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Copy number gains in PAQR6 are associated with poorer outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in bladder cancer (Cai2021Copy).

In hepatic cancers, altered expression of PAQR6 has been observed, particularly in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). These alterations may impact clinical aspects of hepatic cancers, potentially serving as prognostic biomarkers (AbouFadel2023Key). Overall, changes in PAQR6 expression or CNVs are significant in the prognosis and progression of these cancers.

## Interactions
PAQR6, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It is associated with G proteins, specifically coupling with stimulatory G (Gs) proteins, which play a role in its cellular functions (Aickareth2023Membrane). This interaction is part of a broader signaling network that includes coordination with the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER), where progesterone increases mPR expression but decreases GPER expression (Aickareth2023Membrane).

PAQR6 is also involved in the CSC-mPR-PRG-nPR (CmPn) signaling network, which facilitates cross-communication between classic and non-classic progesterone signaling pathways. This network is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of membrane progesterone receptors, particularly in cells lacking nuclear progesterone receptors (Aickareth2023Membrane).

Despite its structural similarities to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), PAQR6 does not require G-proteins for signaling, as demonstrated in yeast models. This suggests a unique mechanism of action that does not involve traditional G-protein signaling pathways (Smith2008Heterologous). The receptor's ability to bind allopregnanolone, a neuroactive progesterone metabolite, with high affinity further highlights its role in rapid progesterone signaling (Petersen2013Nonclassical).
