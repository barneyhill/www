# ERAL1

## Overview
ERAL1 is a gene that encodes the protein Era-like 12S mitochondrial rRNA chaperone 1, which is a mitochondrial RNA chaperone involved in the assembly of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This protein is characterized by its GTPase and KH domains, which are essential for its function in ribosome biogenesis. The GTPase domain acts as a molecular switch, cycling between active and inactive states, while the KH domain facilitates specific RNA binding. ERAL1 plays a critical role in stabilizing the 12S mitochondrial rRNA, thereby ensuring the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mutations in the ERAL1 gene have been linked to Perrault syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial function and human health (Gruffaz2023GTPase; Faridi2021New; Dennerlein2010Human).

## Structure
ERAL1 is a mitochondrial RNA chaperone involved in the assembly of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. The protein consists of two main domains: a GTPase domain and a KH domain. The GTPase domain is approximately 170 amino acids long and features a fold consisting of a 6-stranded β-sheet surrounded by 5 α-helices. This domain includes five diagnostic motifs (G1-G5) that are involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis, with the G1 motif, also known as the Walker A motif, playing a key role in binding the α- and β-phosphates of GTP/GDP (Gruffaz2023GTPase). The KH domain is a type II RNA-binding domain essential for ERAL1's function, interacting with specific RNA sequences (Gruffaz2023GTPase).

ERAL1's structure is highly conserved, indicating its biological importance. The protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an ON-state when bound to GTP and an OFF-state when bound to GDP or in its apo-form. This switching is crucial for its role in ribosome assembly (Gruffaz2023GTPase). The interaction between the GTPase and KH domains is necessary for proper ribosome biogenesis (Gruffaz2023GTPase). Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ERAL1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ERAL1 is a mitochondrial RNA chaperone that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the 28S small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU) in human cells. It specifically binds to the 12S mitochondrial rRNA (mt-rRNA) at the 3' terminal stem-loop region, which is essential for the stability of the 12S mt-rRNA and the formation of the 28S subunit (Dennerlein2010Human). This binding protects the 12S mt-rRNA from degradation, ensuring the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis (Dennerlein2010Human).

ERAL1 is localized within the mitochondrial matrix, where it associates with mitoribosomal subunits, particularly co-localizing with DAP3, a marker of the 28S mt-SSU, indicating its involvement in ribosome assembly (Dennerlein2010Human). The protein's RNA-binding KH domain is capable of binding RNA, with a minimal footprint of 33 nucleotides on the 12S mt-rRNA, highlighting its specific binding region (Dennerlein2010Human).

In healthy cells, ERAL1 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cell viability. Its depletion leads to the rapid decay of nascent 12S mt-rRNA and a loss of newly synthesized 28S subunits, which can induce apoptosis before significant impacts on mitochondrial protein synthesis or mRNA stability are observed (Dennerlein2010Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERAL1 gene are associated with Perrault syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysfunction. A specific homozygous missense mutation, c.707A > T (p.Asn236Ile), has been identified in patients with Perrault syndrome. This mutation affects the assembly of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis (Chatzispyrou2017A; Faridi2021New). The mutation is particularly prevalent in a Dutch population, where it is considered a founder mutation (Faridi2021New).

Experimental studies have shown that the p.Asn236Ile mutation results in decreased ERAL1 protein levels and reduced levels of 12S rRNA, which are critical for mitochondrial ribosome assembly. This disruption in mitochondrial protein homeostasis is a key pathogenic mechanism linking ERAL1 to Perrault syndrome (AntolínezFernández2024Molecular; Chatzispyrou2017A). In model organisms such as C. elegans, knockdown of the ERAL1 orthologue leads to decreased mitochondrial respiration and impaired fertility, further supporting the gene's role in mitochondrial function and its clinical significance in Perrault syndrome (AntolínezFernández2024Molecular; Chatzispyrou2017A).

## Interactions
ERAL1 is a mitochondrial RNA chaperone that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the small 28S mitochondrial ribosomal subunit by interacting with the 12S mitochondrial rRNA (mt-rRNA). It binds specifically to a 33-nucleotide region near the 3' terminus of the 12S mt-rRNA, which includes a stem-loop structure, protecting it from degradation (Dennerlein2010Human). This interaction is essential for the stability and assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome (Chatzispyrou2017A).

ERAL1 also interacts with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein uS7m, encoded by the MRPS7 gene, which anchors the GTPase domain of ERAL1 in the nascent mitochondrial small subunit (Gruffaz2023GTPase). This interaction is vital for mitoribosome biogenesis. ERAL1 is associated with the 28S small ribosomal subunit but not with the complete 55S monosome, indicating its specific role in the assembly or stability of the 28S subunit (Dennerlein2010Human).

In the context of CLPP-deficient mitochondria, ERAL1 interacts with the ClpXP protease complex, particularly with CLPX, suggesting a role in regulating mitoribosomal assembly through its turnover (Szczepanowska2016CLPP). These interactions highlight ERAL1's multifaceted role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function.
