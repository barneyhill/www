# MYLK2

## Overview
The MYLK2 gene encodes the protein myosin light chain kinase 2 (skMLCK), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissues, particularly in fast-twitch muscle fibers. This kinase plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction by phosphorylating the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin, thereby enhancing the interaction between actin and myosin filaments, which is crucial for muscle contraction and force generation (Stull2011Myosin). The protein structure of skMLCK includes a core kinase domain and a regulatory domain, which undergoes conformational changes upon binding with the Ca2+/calmodulin complex, facilitating its enzymatic activity (Fox2021Characterisation). MYLK2 is also involved in various protein interactions that are essential for muscle function and development, such as the phosphorylation of transcription factors like MEF2C, which is important for skeletal myogenesis (Al2011Skeletal). Mutations in MYLK2 have been implicated in cardiomyopathies and other muscle-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Qin2020FLNC; Seo2021High).

## Structure
The MYLK2 gene encodes the skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase specifically expressed in skeletal muscles, particularly in fast contracting muscles (Stull2011Myosin). The protein structure of skMLCK includes a core kinase domain and a regulatory domain with autoinhibitory and calmodulin-binding sequences (Fox2021Characterisation). The regulatory segment interacts with the catalytic core, blocking the binding of the regulatory light chain (RLC) but not ATP, and is displaced upon Ca2+/calmodulin binding, allowing phosphorylation of Ser15 on the RLC (Stull2011Myosin).

The skMLCK lacks an actin-binding domain, which may contribute to its weaker binding to myofilaments compared to smooth muscle MLCK (Tsukamoto2013Biochemical). The protein is monomeric and predicted to have a bi-lobed structure for the catalytic core, similar to other Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (Stull2011Myosin). The binding of calmodulin to skMLCK involves hydrophobic and ionic interactions, with specific residues forming anchor points and salt bridges (Stull2011Myosin). The MYLK2 gene does not have reported splice variant isoforms in the provided context (Tsukamoto2013Biochemical).

## Function
The MYLK2 gene encodes skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in muscle contraction by phosphorylating the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin in skeletal muscle fibers. This phosphorylation enhances the interaction between actin and myosin, facilitating muscle contraction, particularly in fast-twitch skeletal muscles (Stull2011Myosin). The activation of skMLCK occurs when Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, forming a complex that displaces a regulatory segment from the catalytic core of the kinase, allowing phosphorylation of the RLC at Ser15 (Stull2011Myosin).

The phosphorylation of RLC by skMLCK modulates mechanical aspects of skeletal muscle function, enhancing the rate of force generation by myosin cross bridges and increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. This process contributes to isometric and concentric force potentiation, enhancing muscle work and power, and may interact with neural strategies to mitigate fatigue (Stull2011Myosin). The enzyme's rapid activation by Ca2+/calmodulin and slow inactivation are crucial for its physiological role in muscle contraction (Stull2011Myosin). SkMLCK is particularly important for frequency-dependent potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction, as evidenced by changes in RLC phosphorylation and muscle contractility (Zhi2005Myosin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYLK2 gene have been associated with various forms of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases affecting the heart muscle. Specifically, MYLK2 variants have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In a study involving a Chinese family, a novel truncating mutation in the MYLK2 gene was identified in a family member with DCM, while another mutation was associated with HCM, suggesting a potential role in digenic forms of cardiomyopathy (Qin2020FLNC). Another study identified MYLK2 variants in patients with left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), a condition characterized by prominent trabeculations in the left ventricle, although the direct link to the disease phenotype remains unclear (Seo2021High).

The MYLK2 gene has also been investigated in the context of cancer. A study analyzing the kinase domain of MYLK2 in various carcinomas found a rare missense mutation in lung adenocarcinomas, but no significant role for MYLK2 mutations in cancer pathogenesis was established (Soung2006Mutational). These findings highlight the complexity and variability of MYLK2's involvement in different diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
MYLK2, also known as skeletal myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK), is involved in several protein interactions crucial for muscle function. One significant interaction is with the transcription factor MEF2C. MYLK2 phosphorylates MEF2C at Threonine-80, which is essential for enhancing skeletal myogenesis. This phosphorylation event is critical for the recruitment of coactivators like p300 to muscle-specific promoters, thereby facilitating the expression of myogenic regulatory factors such as MyoD, Myogenin, and Myf5 (Al2011Skeletal).

The interaction between MYLK2 and MEF2C was identified using tandem affinity purification and validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays in various cell types, including C2C12 myocytes and HEK-293 cells (Al2011Skeletal). MYLK2's role extends to the regulation of satellite cell activation and differentiation, where its inhibition leads to decreased expression of myogenic markers, highlighting its importance in muscle lineage commitment (Al2011Skeletal).

In addition to its interaction with MEF2C, MYLK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains, a process crucial for muscle contraction potentiation, particularly in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers (Zhi2005Myosin).
