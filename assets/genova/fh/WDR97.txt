# WDR97

## Overview
The WDR97 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 97 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that WD repeat domain 97 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific functions of WDR97 and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, proteins with WD repeat domains are often implicated in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. The study of WDR97 is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential involvement in cellular pathways and its clinical significance in human health and disease.
