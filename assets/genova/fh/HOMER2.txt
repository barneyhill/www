# HOMER2

## Overview
HOMER2 is a gene that encodes the homer scaffold protein 2, a member of the Homer family of scaffolding proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to facilitate intracellular signaling and synaptic function through its structural domains, including an N-terminal EVH1 domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain with leucine zipper motifs. These domains enable HOMER2 to multimerize and interact with various proteins, such as Rho family GTPases and metabotropic glutamate receptors, playing a crucial role in calcium signaling pathways and synaptic architecture (ShiraishiYamaguchi2007TheHomerfamilyproteins; Azaiez2015HOMER2). HOMER2 is particularly significant in the auditory system, where it is expressed in the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear, contributing to calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization essential for normal hearing (Azaiez2015HOMER2). Mutations in the HOMER2 gene have been linked to autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its importance in both auditory and neurological health (Gilks2010Replicated; Azaiez2015HOMER2).

## Structure
HOMER2, a member of the Homer family of proteins, is characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein. The protein contains an N-terminal EVH1 domain, which is involved in binding proline-rich sequences of target proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular signaling and synaptic function (ShiraishiYamaguchi2007TheHomerfamilyproteins; Azaiez2015HOMER2). The C-terminal region of HOMER2 includes a coiled-coil domain with leucine zipper motifs, which are essential for the protein's ability to multimerize and form tetrameric hubs. This multimerization is critical for its interaction with other proteins, such as Rho family GTPases like CDC42 (Azaiez2015HOMER2).

HOMER2 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the long forms, such as HOMER2a and HOMER2b, having extended C-terminal regions that contribute to the formation of protein clusters at the postsynaptic density (ShiraishiYamaguchi2007TheHomerfamilyproteins). These isoforms are involved in regulating signal transduction and synaptic activity. The protein's structure allows it to interact with various signaling molecules, including metabotropic glutamate receptors and inositol trisphosphate receptors, thereby influencing calcium signaling pathways (Azaiez2015HOMER2).

## Function
HOMER2 encodes a stereociliary scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization, particularly in the context of neuronal processes and auditory function. It is robustly expressed in the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear, where it is essential for normal hearing by regulating calcium ion dynamics within hair cell stereocilia. This regulation involves balancing TRPC-mediated calcium influx and PMCA-mediated calcium extrusion, with the PMCA2 pump being a potential interacting partner (Azaiez2015HOMER2).

HOMER2 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics in stereocilia through interaction with CDC42, a small GTPase that affects actin turnover. It also controls cytoplasmic calcium levels by interacting with calcium handling proteins such as TRPC and PMCA channels, which are crucial for maintaining normal auditory function (Azaiez2015HOMER2). In the nervous system, HOMER2 is predominantly localized at the postsynaptic density, where it acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes by binding to proteins like metabotropic glutamate receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, impacting synaptic architecture and signaling dynamics (ShiraishiYamaguchi2007TheHomerfamilyproteins; Thomas2002Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOMER2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting auditory and neurological functions. One significant condition linked to HOMER2 mutations is autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). Specific mutations, such as the p.Arg185Pro variant, have been identified in families with progressive hearing loss, suggesting a dominant-negative effect that disrupts protein multimerization and interaction with partner proteins, crucial for maintaining normal hearing (Azaiez2015HOMER2). Another variant, c.840_841insC, leads to a frameshift and truncated protein, affecting calcium homeostasis and signaling in the cochlea, which is essential for hearing (Lu2018Whole).

HOMER2 is also implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Studies have found associations between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HOMER2 and schizophrenia, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. The gene's role in glutamate signaling and synaptic plasticity may contribute to its involvement in this mental disorder (Gilks2010Replicated).

Additionally, HOMER2 mutations have been linked to hearing loss in zebrafish models, further supporting its role in auditory function (Vaché2023Identification). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in both hearing and neurological health.

## Interactions
HOMER2, a scaffolding protein, participates in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling. It interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), specifically inhibiting its processing and reducing amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. This interaction involves the EVH1 domain of HOMER2, which binds to APP, affecting its maturation and trafficking (Parisiadou2008Homer2).

HOMER2 also interacts with group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), such as mGluR1 and mGluR5, acting as a bimodular adapter protein that can crosslink these receptors or couple them to other proteins (Xiao1998Homer). It binds to a proline-rich motif found in several proteins, including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and dynamin III, facilitating synaptic signaling (Tu1998Homer).

In the context of hearing, HOMER2 interacts with CDC42, a small GTPase, through its CDC42-binding domain, playing a role in actin dynamics and stereocilia function. It also modulates the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) activity, which is essential for calcium signaling and auditory function (Azaiez2015HOMER2).
