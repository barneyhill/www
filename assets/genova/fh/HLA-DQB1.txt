# HLA-DQB1

## Overview
The HLA-DQB1 gene is a critical component of the human immune system, encoding the beta chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, DQ beta 1 protein. This protein is a transmembrane molecule that plays a pivotal role in antigen presentation, a process essential for the activation of CD4+ T-helper cells. The HLA-DQB1 protein forms a heterodimer with the DQA1 protein, facilitating the presentation of extracellular antigens to the immune system. The gene is highly polymorphic, which allows for a diverse range of antigenic peptides to be presented, thereby enhancing immune surveillance and response. Variations in the HLA-DQB1 gene are associated with susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in disease prognosis and immune regulation (Kwok1996HLADQB1; Ou2018The; Megiorni2012HLADQA1).

## Structure
The HLA-DQB1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells. The protein structure includes an alpha helix and beta sheet arrangement, forming a peptide-binding groove essential for its function in antigen presentation. 

The HLA-DQB1 protein forms a heterodimer with the DQA1 protein, contributing to its quaternary structure. This heterodimerization is critical for the stability and function of the MHC class II molecule, allowing it to effectively present peptides to CD4+ T lymphocytes. 

A significant feature of the HLA-DQB1 protein is the polymorphism at residue 57, which influences peptide binding and T cell recognition. The Ala-to-Asp substitution at this site affects the formation of a salt bridge structure at the peptide-binding cleft, impacting the binding specificity of different HLA-DQ alleles (Kwok1996HLADQB1). 

The protein typically undergoes glycosylation, a common post-translational modification that can affect its stability and interaction with other molecules. However, specific details on primary, secondary, tertiary structures, or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The HLA-DQB1 gene encodes a beta chain of the HLA class II molecules, which are crucial for the immune system's ability to present extracellular antigens to CD4+ T-helper cells. These molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The primary function of HLA-DQB1 is to bind antigenic peptides and present them to CD4+ T lymphocytes, a process essential for initiating and regulating immune responses (Megiorni2012HLADQA1; Zhang2019&lt; HLADQB1; p&gt).

In healthy individuals, the HLA-DQB1 gene plays a role in maintaining immune homeostasis by presenting exogenous antigens to CD4+ T cells, which helps protect against pathogens and prevent autoimmunity (Megiorni2012HLADQA1). The gene's polymorphic nature allows for a diverse range of antigen presentations, which is vital for effective immune surveillance and response (Ou2018The). The expression of HLA-DQB1 on tumor cells has also been associated with favorable prognostic outcomes in certain cancers, suggesting its role in enhancing antitumor immune responses by promoting T cell infiltration and activity (Zhang2019&lt; HLADQB1; p&gt).

## Clinical Significance
The HLA-DQB1 gene is associated with various diseases due to its polymorphisms and expression levels. In hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, certain HLA-DQB1 alleles influence susceptibility and clearance. HLA-DQB1*06:03 is protective against HBV, while HLA-DQB1*04:01, HLA-DQB1*05:02, HLA-DQB1*05:03, and HLA-DQB1*06:01 increase susceptibility. Chronic HBV infection is linked to HLA-DQB1*02:01 and HLA-DQB1*05:02, whereas spontaneous clearance is associated with HLA-DQB1*06:04 (Ou2018The).

HLA-DQB1 polymorphisms are also implicated in autoimmune diseases. The HLA-DQB1*02 allele is part of the MHC ancestral haplotype 8.1, associated with Type 1 Diabetes, Celiac Disease, and other autoimmune conditions (Shiina2009The). In celiac disease, the presence of DQ2.5 and DQ8 heterodimers, encoded by HLA-DQB1 alleles, is a major genetic factor (Megiorni2012HLADQA1).

In lymphoma, HLA-DQB1 variations are linked to increased risk and prognosis. HLA-DQB1*05:01 is associated with a higher risk of follicular lymphoma, while HLA-DQB1*06 is linked to decreased risk (Zhong2019The). Low expression levels of HLA-DQB1 in cervical cancer are associated with poor survival outcomes (Halle2021A).

## Interactions
HLA-DQB1 is involved in several critical interactions that influence immune responses. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which present peptides to CD4+ T cells. These interactions are essential for T cell recognition and activation. The polymorphism at residue 57 of the HLA-DQB1 polypeptide is particularly significant, as it affects peptide binding and T cell recognition by altering the binding affinity of peptides to different HLA-DQ molecules. This polymorphism is crucial for forming a salt bridge structure at the peptide-binding cleft, which is essential for the structural and functional complementarity in HLA-DQ-specific immune responses (Kwok1996HLADQB1).

HLA-DQB1 also interacts with peptides derived from myelin basic protein (MBP) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), influencing multiple sclerosis susceptibility. The interactions involve hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and aromatic stacking, with specific polymorphisms at residue positions 57, 74, and 77 affecting these interactions. These interactions are relevant for T-cell activation and autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and narcolepsy (Kumar2014Antigenic).

Additionally, recombinant human monoclonal antibodies specific to HLA-DQ epitopes have been developed, highlighting residue 55R as a functional epitope for certain antibodies. These antibodies recognize specific HLA-DQB1 alleles, indicating the role of both the alpha and beta chains in forming structural epitopes (Bezstarosti2022HLADQSpecific).
