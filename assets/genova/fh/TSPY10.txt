# TSPY10

## Overview
TSPY10 is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes the testis-specific protein Y-linked 10. This protein is part of the TSPY gene family, which is known for its role in male germ cell development and spermatogenesis. The TSPY10 protein is categorized as a testis-specific protein, indicating its expression is predominantly restricted to the testes. It is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation within the male reproductive system. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of TSPY10 remain under investigation, but it is considered to be a potential factor in male fertility and reproductive health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
