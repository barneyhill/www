# ECHS1

## Overview
The ECHS1 gene encodes the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase, short chain 1, which is a crucial component of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. This enzyme, categorized as a hydratase, facilitates the conversion of enoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, playing a significant role in the catabolism of short-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. The ECHS1 protein is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes post-translational modifications to become an active homohexamer within the mitochondrial matrix, essential for its enzymatic function. Mutations in the ECHS1 gene are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, including short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase deficiency and Leigh syndrome, which manifest in severe metabolic and neurological symptoms. The enzyme's interactions with other proteins, such as those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic integrity (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial; Muntean2022Pathogenic; Burgin2022Loss).

## Structure
The ECHS1 protein is initially synthesized as a 290 amino acid precursor with a 27-amino-acid N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, which is cleaved upon entry into the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in a mature protein with a molecular weight of 28.3 kDa (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial; Burgin2022Loss). The mature ECHS1 forms an active homohexamer, described as a 'dimer of trimers', which has been resolved at a 2.55 Å resolution, showing six ECHS1 units (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial). 

The primary structure of ECHS1 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ECHS1 gene, which consists of eight exons (Burgin2022Loss). The secondary structure likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of many proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure involves the formation of a hexameric complex, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial).

Post-translational modifications of ECHS1 include acetylation at lysine 101 (K101), which impairs its catalytic activity and promotes ubiquitination and degradation (Zhang2017EnoylCoA). This acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase GCN5 and counteracted by the deacetylase SIRT3 (Zhang2017EnoylCoA).

## Function
The ECHS1 gene encodes the enzyme short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, which is crucial for mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, a key energy production pathway in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the hydration of enoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, facilitating the breakdown of short-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids, including valine, leucine, and isoleucine (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial; Yamada2015Clinical). ECHS1 exhibits the highest substrate specificity for crotonyl-CoA and plays a significant role in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (Peters2014ECHS1; Yamada2015Clinical).

In healthy cells, ECHS1 is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it forms a homohexamer structure essential for its function (Yamada2015Clinical). The enzyme is involved in maintaining the stability and function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein complexes, particularly complexes I and IV, which are critical for ATP production (Burgin2022Loss). ECHS1's activity prevents the accumulation of toxic intermediates, such as methacrylyl-CoA, which can disrupt cellular processes (Peters2014ECHS1). Its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (Ferdinandusse2015Clinical; Burgin2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ECHS1 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, most notably short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH) deficiency and Leigh syndrome. SCEH deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including developmental delay, lactic acidosis, and basal ganglia lesions similar to those seen in Leigh syndrome (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial; Muntean2022Pathogenic). Patients with ECHS1 mutations may also experience severe neurological impairments, movement disorders, and cardiac myopathy (Muntean2022Pathogenic).

Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder, is linked to ECHS1 mutations that disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to symptoms such as developmental regression, dystonia, and elevated plasma lactate levels (Kishita2023Strategic; Sun2020Novel). The severity of ECHS1-related disorders can vary, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, and may include early-onset symptoms and premature death (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial; Muntean2022Pathogenic).

ECHS1 deficiency can also result in the accumulation of toxic intermediates like methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA, impairing ATP production and causing metabolic acidosis (Sharpe2018Mitochondrial; Peters2014ECHS1). These metabolic disruptions are often accompanied by specific metabolite profiles, aiding in the diagnosis of ECHS1-related conditions (Yamada2015Clinical).

## Interactions
ECHS1, or enoyl-CoA hydratase short chain 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. ECHS1 interacts with STAT3, a signal transducer and activator of transcription, and negatively regulates STAT3 signaling by inhibiting its phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 residue. This interaction affects the expression of STAT3 target genes involved in tumor development (Chang2013ECHS1).

In mitochondrial function, ECHS1 interacts with subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I, specifically NDUFB11 and NDUFV3. The loss of ECHS1 disrupts these interactions, affecting the stability and assembly of complex I, which is crucial for mitochondrial respiratory function (Burgin2022Loss).

ECHS1 also interacts with LASP1 in colorectal cancer cells, influencing sphingolipid metabolism. This interaction prevents ECHS1 degradation and promotes ceramide glycosylation, contributing to cancer progression and drug resistance (Li2021ECHS1).

Additionally, ECHS1 interacts with the small hepatitis B surface antigen (SHBs), which modulates ECHS1 expression and is implicated in lipid metabolism alterations during hepatitis B virus infection (Gong2012Small).
