# CIMIP4

## Overview
CIMIP4 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule inner protein 4, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMIP4 is categorized as a structural protein, specifically associated with the microtubules within cilia. These microtubules are essential for maintaining the stability and proper functioning of cilia, which are critical for various cellular processes, including signal transduction and fluid movement across epithelial surfaces. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMIP4 can potentially lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by defects in cilia structure or function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
