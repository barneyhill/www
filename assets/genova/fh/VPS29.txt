# VPS29

## Overview
VPS29 is a gene that encodes the VPS29 retromer complex component, a protein integral to the retromer complex involved in endosomal protein sorting and trafficking. The VPS29 protein is characterized by a metallophosphoesterase fold, although it primarily serves a structural role rather than an enzymatic one due to its low affinity for metal ions (Swarbrick2011VPS29). As a scaffold protein, VPS29 is crucial for the assembly and stability of the retromer complex, which includes VPS26 and VPS35, facilitating the recycling of transmembrane proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or plasma membrane (BañosMateos2019VPS29; CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism). VPS29 interacts with various regulatory proteins, such as TBC1D5 and VARP, influencing the dynamics of endosomal trafficking and maintaining cellular homeostasis (BañosMateos2019VPS29; CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism). The gene's significance extends to clinical contexts, where its dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2019Retromer).

## Structure
The VPS29 protein is a component of the retromer complex, characterized by a metallophosphoesterase fold, which is crucial for its structural role rather than enzymatic activity (Swarbrick2011VPS29). Despite its structural similarity to metal-dependent phosphatases, VPS29 does not exhibit significant phosphatase activity due to its low affinity for metal ions like Mn2+ and Zn2+ (Swarbrick2011VPS29). The protein's tertiary structure includes a central β-sandwich and a prominent a3 helix, which is rigid and interacts with VPS35, another retromer component (Swarbrick2011VPS29).

VPS29 features a conserved hydrophobic surface that is essential for binding with sorting nexins (SNX) and other regulatory proteins, such as TBC1D5 and VARP (CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism; Swarbrick2011VPS29). This hydrophobic surface is distinct from the metal-binding pocket and is critical for protein-protein interactions (Swarbrick2011VPS29). The interaction with VARP involves a Zn-fingernail motif, highlighting the importance of zinc coordination in stabilizing the complex (CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism).

VPS29's quaternary structure involves forming a stable heterotrimer with VPS26 and VPS35, contributing to the retromer complex's overall stability and function (Swarbrick2011VPS29). The protein's structural rigidity and specific interaction sites are vital for its role as a scaffold within the retromer complex.

## Function
VPS29 is a critical component of the retromer complex, which is essential for endosomal protein sorting and trafficking in human cells. The retromer complex, composed of VPS26, VPS29, and VPS35, plays a pivotal role in the recycling of transmembrane proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (BañosMateos2019VPS29; CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism).

VPS29 functions as a scaffold protein within the retromer complex, coordinating the assembly of retrieval complexes and interacting with various regulatory components. It is involved in the recruitment of accessory proteins such as TBC1D5 and VARP, which regulate Rab GTPases and other effectors of membrane trafficking (BañosMateos2019VPS29; Reitz2018Retromer). The interactions of VPS29 with these proteins suggest its central role in balancing different retrieval pathways, contributing to the functional plasticity in cargo recycling (BañosMateos2019VPS29).

VPS29 is also part of the retriever complex, which shares structural similarities with the retromer but interacts with different sorting nexins, supporting independent retrieval pathways (BañosMateos2019VPS29). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of the abundance of transmembrane proteins at the cell surface, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (BañosMateos2019VPS29).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VPS29 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The retromer complex, of which VPS29 is a part, is crucial for endosomal protein sorting and trafficking. Dysfunction in this complex can lead to synaptic and lysosomal dysfunction, which are early pathological features in these diseases (Ye2019Retromer). In particular, VPS29 is involved in lysosomal hydrolase trafficking, and its dysfunction can result in lysosomal pathology similar to lysosomal storage disorders, characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and substrate accumulation (Ye2019Retromer).

In Drosophila models, the absence of VPS29 leads to age-dependent synaptic and lysosomal dysfunction, which may be relevant to human neurodegenerative conditions (Ye2019Retromer). Additionally, mutations in VPS29 that disrupt its interaction with regulatory proteins like VARP can impair endosomal trafficking, further contributing to cellular dysfunction (CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism). These disruptions in normal cellular processes underscore the potential of targeting the retromer complex, including VPS29, for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases (Ye2019Retromer).

## Interactions
VPS29 is a key component of the retromer complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal sorting and trafficking. It forms a stable core complex with VPS26 and VPS35, facilitating the retrieval of cargo from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. VPS29 interacts with various proteins, including sorting nexins (SNX), which are involved in membrane curvature and cargo selection. Specifically, VPS29 interacts with SNX1 and SNX2, contributing to the assembly of large multimeric complexes essential for retrograde transport (Haft2000Human).

VPS29 also interacts with accessory proteins such as VARP and TBC1D5. VARP binds to VPS29 through a Zn-fingernail motif, which is crucial for its interaction and subsequent endosomal trafficking. This interaction is characterized by a high binding affinity, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range (CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism). TBC1D5, a GTPase-activating protein, also binds to VPS29, competing with VARP for the same binding site. This competition influences the dynamics of endosomal recycling and the generation of retromer-based carriers (BañosMateos2019VPS29; CrawleySnowdon2020Mechanism).

These interactions highlight VPS29's role as a central scaffold in coordinating the assembly of retrieval complexes and regulatory components, influencing the balance between different retrieval pathways (BañosMateos2019VPS29).
