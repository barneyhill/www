# SYNGR4

## Overview
SYNGR4 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptogyrin 4, which is a member of the synaptogyrin family involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. Synaptogyrin 4 is a transmembrane protein predominantly located in the presynaptic membrane of neurons, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and communication between neurons. The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including synaptic vesicle cycles and neurotransmission, and has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain cancers, including breast cancer. Research into SYNGR4 continues to uncover its potential roles in disease progression and cellular stress responses, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Iwakawa2008Expression; Marques2020Motor; Ma2024Unveiling).

## Function
SYNGR4, or synaptogyrin 4, is a protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release in neurons. It is part of the synaptogyrin family, which plays a role in synaptic plasticity and communication between neurons. SYNGR4 is typically located in the presynaptic membrane, contributing to efficient synaptic transmission and overall neural function (Marques2020Motor).

In healthy human cells, SYNGR4 is believed to function similarly to other members of the synaptogyrin family, such as SYNGR2, which is involved in synaptic-like microvesicle (SLMV) formation and intracellular vesicular protein transport. The upregulation of SYNGR4 has been associated with the onset of motor symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models, suggesting its involvement in critical phases of synaptic function (Marques2020Motor).

The protein's role in synaptic vesicle cycles and neurotransmission is not fully understood, but it is thought to impact motor neuronal function by affecting SLMVs. This potential role in synaptic vesicle dynamics highlights SYNGR4 as a candidate for further research into its functional role in synaptic transmission and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases (Marques2020Motor).

## Clinical Significance
SYNGR4 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, SYNGR4 is upregulated and associated with poorer prognosis, including reduced overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval. Its overexpression correlates with increased Th2 cell infiltration and decreased infiltration of Tcm, macrophages, and CD8-positive T cells, suggesting a role in modulating the immune environment of tumors. Knockdown of SYNGR4 in breast cancer cell lines reduces malignant behavior and promotes a pro-inflammatory environment, indicating its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Ma2024Unveiling).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), SYNGR4 is upregulated in motor neurons of mouse models with TDP-43 mutations, which are associated with the onset of motor symptoms. This upregulation suggests that SYNGR4 may contribute to the progression of ALS, making it a candidate for further research into its role in neurodegenerative diseases (Marques2020Motor).

Additionally, SYNGR4 expression is downregulated in normal human fibroblasts following carbon ion irradiation, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses (Iwakawa2008Expression). These findings highlight the diverse roles of SYNGR4 in disease contexts, particularly in cancer and neurodegeneration.

## Interactions
SYNGR4 (synaptogyrin 4) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the context of spermatogenesis, SYNGR4 has been identified as a hub gene within a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associated with spermatogenesis, suggesting its potential role in this biological process (Zheng2018Identification). This indicates that SYNGR4 may interact with other proteins involved in the development of male gametes and sperm motility.

In the realm of cancer research, SYNGR4 has been associated with vesicle transport and is potentially linked to the metastatic capabilities of breast cancer cells, as identified in studies focusing on differential gene expression in breast cancer (Mellick2002Differential). This suggests that SYNGR4 might participate in interactions that influence cancer cell behavior, although specific protein partners in this context are not detailed.

In studies involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the male reproductive tract, SYNGR4 was found to be significantly enriched in the vesicular population compared to whole seminal plasma, indicating its involvement in vesicle formation, trafficking, and fusion processes (Leahy2020Quantitative). This enrichment suggests interactions with other proteins involved in these vesicular processes.
