# ABHD3

## Overview
The ABHD3 gene encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 3, which functions as a phospholipase. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is involved in the regulation of medium-chain phospholipids within the cell. ABHD3 plays a significant role in lipid metabolism by preferentially targeting C14-phosphatidylcholines and oxidatively truncated phospholipids, which are linked to oxidative stress responses. Its activity is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and membrane remodeling, as it modulates the levels of specific phospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholines, in the cytoplasm. The physiological importance of ABHD3 is underscored by studies in knockout mice, which demonstrate altered phospholipid profiles, highlighting its role in cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Long2011Metabolomics).

## Function
The ABHD3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a phospholipase, specifically involved in the regulation of medium-chain phospholipids (PLs) in vivo. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the catabolism of these lipids, with a particular preference for C14-phosphatidylcholines (C14-PCs) and oxidatively truncated phospholipids (oxPCs), which are associated with cellular oxidative stress (Long2011Metabolomics). ABHD3's activity is distinct from other phospholipases, as it selectively cleaves medium-chain and oxidatively-truncated phospholipids, impacting lipid metabolism and cellular stress responses (Long2011Metabolomics).

In healthy human cells, ABHD3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to lipid homeostasis and membrane remodeling. The enzyme's activity leads to an increase in lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and a decrease in C14-PCs, indicating its role in phospholipid metabolism and cellular signaling (Long2011Metabolomics). The physiological relevance of ABHD3's function is highlighted by studies in Abhd3 knockout mice, which exhibit elevated levels of myristoyl-phospholipids, including the bioactive lipid C14-lysophosphatidylcholine, suggesting its significant role in regulating specific phospholipid levels and influencing membrane dynamics (Long2011Metabolomics).
