# MYL9

## Overview
MYL9, or myosin light chain 9, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein integral to the myosin complex, specifically categorized as a myosin light chain. This protein plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction and cell motility, particularly within smooth muscle tissues. The myosin light chain 9 protein is essential for the initial and sustained contraction phases in smooth muscle cells, contributing significantly to the contractile function of tissues such as the jejunum and aorta (Sun2020Distinct). Beyond its role in muscle tissues, MYL9 is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining cellular integrity and stability of myosin II, as well as platelet activation and function (Park2011Myosin; Jalagadugula2010Regulation). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as CD69 and cytoskeletal proteins, underscore its importance in regulating inflammation and cytoskeletal dynamics (Nevitt2018Nterminal; Hayashizaki2016Myosin). Alterations in MYL9 expression or function have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including thrombocytopenia, megacystis–microcolon–intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2014MYLK; Moreno2018Homozygous).

## Function
MYL9, or myosin light chain 9, encodes a protein that is integral to the myosin complex, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction and cell motility. In smooth muscle cells, MYL9 is essential for the initial and sustained contraction phases, particularly in tissues like the jejunum and aorta. Its deficiency leads to significantly reduced contraction forces, highlighting its importance in smooth muscle function (Sun2020Distinct). In the bladder, while MYL9 is critical for the initial contraction phase, the sustained contraction can occur independently, suggesting alternative pathways involving non-muscle myosin II (Sun2020Distinct).

MYL9 is also involved in maintaining the stability of myosin II and cellular integrity. It interacts with myosin heavy chain II (MHC II) in actomyosin units, which is vital for cellular processes such as maintaining cell shape and motility (Park2011Myosin). In non-muscle cells, MYL9, along with other regulatory light chains, stabilizes MHCs, ensuring the proper function of myosin complexes (Park2011Myosin).

In platelets, MYL9 is crucial for myosin light chain phosphorylation, a process important for platelet activation, shape change, and secretion. Its expression is regulated by the transcription factor RUNX1, and decreased MYL9 levels are associated with impaired platelet function (Jalagadugula2010Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MYL9 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of platelet function, MYL9 is a direct transcriptional target of the transcription factor RUNX1. Mutations in RUNX1 can lead to decreased MYL9 expression, resulting in thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. This is due to impaired phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, which is crucial for platelet activation and function (Sun2007Decreased; Jalagadugula2010Regulation).

MYL9 mutations are also associated with megacystis–microcolon–intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), a severe disorder characterized by gastrointestinal and urinary tract dysmotility. Homozygous deletions in MYL9 disrupt smooth muscle contraction, leading to the symptoms observed in MMIHS (Kandler2020Compound; Moreno2018Homozygous).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MYL9 expression is significantly decreased, which may contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. The downregulation of MYL9, along with MYLK, is linked to advanced stages of NSCLC and lymphatic metastasis, suggesting a role in tumor biology (Tan2014MYLK).

## Interactions
MYL9, or myosin light chain 9, participates in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It acts as a functional ligand for CD69, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on activated leukocytes, particularly T cells. This interaction is significant in regulating airway inflammation, as MYL9, along with MYL12, is involved in recruiting CD69-expressing T cells into inflamed tissues, such as the lungs during airway inflammation (Hayashizaki2016Myosin).

MYL9 also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins, playing a role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. N-terminal acetylation of MYL9 enhances its cytoplasmic functions, promoting interactions with proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation. In contrast, N-terminal methylation of MYL9 reduces its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, favoring its nuclear role and DNA binding (Nevitt2018Nterminal).

Additionally, MYL9 is regulated by the transcription factor RUNX1, which binds to specific sites on the MYL9 promoter, influencing its expression. This regulation is important for platelet function and cytoskeletal reorganization, affecting cell spreading on collagen and fibrinogen (Jalagadugula2010Regulation). These interactions highlight MYL9's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.
