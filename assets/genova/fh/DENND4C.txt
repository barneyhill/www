# DENND4C

## Overview
DENND4C is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 4C, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases. This protein plays a critical role in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking, particularly in the regulation of vesicle transport processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis. The DENN domain within the protein is essential for activating Rab GTPases, which are pivotal in various cellular transport mechanisms. DENND4C is notably involved in endothelial cell function, where it is upregulated by Notch signaling to facilitate the transport of lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) to collagen IV-containing vesicles, crucial for collagen IV secretion and vascular integrity (Gross2021Notch). Additionally, DENND4C interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing processes such as blood-tumor barrier permeability and cancer cell metabolism, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Wu2019KHDRBS3; Borner2012Multivariate).

## Function
DENND4C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking, primarily through its role as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases. The protein contains a DENN domain, which is crucial for the activation of Rab GTPases, key regulators of vesicle transport processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis. In endothelial cells, DENND4C is upregulated in response to Notch signaling, which is essential for the transport of lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) to collagen IV-containing vesicles (CIVC). This transport is critical for collagen IV secretion, a process vital for maintaining vascular integrity and basement membrane composition (Gross2021Notch).

DENND4C's role in modulating Rab10 activity is particularly significant in the context of blood vessel development and angiogenesis. It facilitates the trafficking of LH3, thereby influencing collagen IV bioavailability and secretion. This function is crucial for the maturation of blood vessels and the establishment of a high-to-low collagen IV secretion gradient, which is regulated by Notch signaling in endothelial cells (Gross2021Notch).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DENND4C gene have been implicated in various cancer types, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioma. In breast cancer, circDENND4C, a circular RNA derived from DENND4C, is associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) and promotes cancer cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic strategies in hypoxic tumors (Unknownauthors2017HIF1αassociatedcircDENND4CPromotesProliferationofBreastCancerCellsinHypoxicEnvironment).

In colorectal cancer, circDENND4C facilitates cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-760, which regulates GLUT1, a key glucose transporter. This regulatory axis highlights circDENND4C's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (zhang2020circular).

In glioma, circDENND4C is involved in regulating the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) through the cDENND4C/miR-577 axis. It acts as a sponge for miR-577, affecting the expression of tight junction proteins and thereby influencing BTB permeability. This mechanism could be leveraged to enhance drug delivery in brain tumor treatments (Wu2019KHDRBS3).

## Interactions
DENND4C is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It has been identified as a novel component associated with the retromer complex, suggesting a role in retromer-mediated trafficking. DENND4C acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the endosomal GTPase Rab10, indicating its involvement in regulating vesicle transport processes (Borner2012Multivariate).

In the context of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB), DENND4C interacts with the RNA-binding protein KHDRBS3. KHDRBS3 binds to cDENND4C, a circular RNA form of DENND4C, enhancing its stability. This interaction affects the permeability of the BTB by modulating the expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. cDENND4C acts as a molecular sponge for miR-577, a microRNA that negatively regulates these tight junction proteins, thereby influencing BTB integrity (Wu2019KHDRBS3).

In colorectal cancer cells, circDENND4C interacts with miR-760 and GLUT1. circDENND4C sponges miR-760, which in turn regulates GLUT1, a glucose transporter. This interaction promotes cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis, highlighting the role of circDENND4C in cancer cell metabolism (zhang2020circular).
