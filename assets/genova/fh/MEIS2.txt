# MEIS2

## Overview
MEIS2 is a gene that encodes the Meis homeobox 2 protein, a member of the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) homeodomain transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics. MEIS2 is involved in various developmental processes, including hematopoiesis, organogenesis, and cellular differentiation, by forming complexes with other proteins such as PBX1 and PDX1. These interactions are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. The gene's expression is critical during the early stages of hematopoietic differentiation and is implicated in the development of multiple organs, including the heart, brain, and limbs. Mutations in MEIS2 are associated with developmental disorders and have been linked to certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Schulte2019MEIS; Giliberti2020MEIS2; Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

## Structure
The MEIS2 protein is a member of the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) homeodomain transcription factors, characterized by a conserved 60-residue-long helix-loop-helix homeodomain with a three-amino-acid extension (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). This homeodomain is crucial for DNA binding and is fully conserved among MEIS proteins (OuladAbdelghani1997Meis2). MEIS2 contains two protein-protein interaction domains, MEIS-A and MEIS-B, located towards the amino terminus, which are essential for interactions with other proteins such as PBX1 (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). 

The MEIS2 protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with at least four murine isoforms identified: MEIS2a, MEIS2b, MEIS2c, and MEIS2d. These isoforms differ in the presence or absence of internal sequences, resulting in proteins of varying lengths (Liu2001DNA; OuladAbdelghani1997Meis2). MEIS2b, in particular, plays a role in forming a trimeric complex with PBX1b and PDX1, which is involved in transcriptional activation (Liu2001DNA). The MEIS2b isoform is crucial for the activity of this complex in pancreatic acinar cells (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate MEIS2's interactions and functions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

## Function
The MEIS2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics in healthy human cells. MEIS2 is part of the MEIS family of homeodomain transcription factors, which are involved in various developmental processes. In the nucleus, MEIS2 forms complexes with PBX proteins, which are essential for its function. These complexes can bind to DNA either directly or indirectly, influencing the transcription of target genes (Schulte2019MEIS).

MEIS2 is particularly important in the early stages of hematopoietic differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It regulates the endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) by targeting the TAL1 gene, which is crucial for the generation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Wang2018MEIS2). MEIS2 expression increases significantly during the transition from mesoderm to hemogenic endothelium progenitors and further to hematopoietic cells, indicating its role in the genetic program for hematopoiesis (Wang2018MEIS2).

In addition to its role in hematopoiesis, MEIS2 is involved in the development of multiple organs, including the heart, brain, and limbs. It interacts with various signaling pathways and transcription factors to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Schulte2019MEIS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEIS2 gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders, including intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, and craniofacial anomalies such as cleft palate. These mutations can manifest as single nucleotide variants, indels, or microdeletions, often occurring de novo (Giliberti2020MEIS2; Verheije2018Heterozygous). Clinical features linked to MEIS2 mutations include cardiac defects like septal defects, coarctation of the aorta, and tetralogy of Fallot (Giliberti2020MEIS2). Orofacial clefts, while common, are not universally present among affected individuals (Giliberti2020MEIS2).

The phenotypic expression of MEIS2 mutations can vary significantly, with some individuals exhibiting mild symptoms such as developmental delays and bifid uvula, while others present with more severe intellectual disabilities and physical anomalies (Fujita2016De; Zhang2021MEIS2). The presence of mosaicism in unaffected parents suggests that the level of mosaicism and tissue-specific expression can influence the severity of the phenotype (Zhang2021MEIS2).

MEIS2 mutations have also been implicated in tumorigenesis, particularly in myeloid leukemia and solid tumors like neuroblastoma and prostate cancer (Giliberti2020MEIS2). The gene's role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation during development underscores its clinical significance in various congenital and acquired conditions (Zhang2021MEIS2).

## Interactions
MEIS2 (Meis homeobox 2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. MEIS2 forms a trimeric complex with PDX1 and PBX1b, which binds to specific DNA sites in pancreatic acinar cells, enhancing transcriptional activation compared to PDX1 alone. This complex requires the intact PDX1 half-site for its formation and transcriptional activity, with MEIS2 being recruited through interactions with PBX1b (Liu2001DNA).

In the context of transcriptional activation, MEIS2 interacts with PBX1 and KLF4. MEIS2d and PBX1a cooperate with KLF4 to activate gene expression, particularly at the p15 promoter. This interaction is facilitated by the MEIS2d activation domain and suggests a mechanism where KLF4 recruits MEIS2/PBX1 to modulate transcriptional regulation (Bjerke2011Cooperative).

MEIS2 also interacts with Pax3 and Pax7 during dorsal midbrain development, forming heteromeric complexes that are important for gene regulation in this context. The MEINOX domain and homeodomain of MEIS2 are crucial for these interactions, as demonstrated by experiments showing reduced interaction when these domains are absent (Agoston2012Genetic).
