# APOBEC3F

## Overview
APOBEC3F is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3F, which is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. This protein plays a critical role in the innate immune system by editing viral and endogenous DNA, primarily through the deamination of cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA. This activity can lead to G-to-A hypermutations, which inhibit viral replication, particularly in retroviruses such as HIV-1 (Harris2015APOBECs; Zheng2004Human). APOBEC3F is characterized by its catalytically active C-terminal domain and is involved in both deaminase-dependent and independent mechanisms, including RNA-binding activities that restrict the transposition of endogenous retroelements (Harris2015APOBECs). The protein's interaction with the HIV-1 Vif protein, which targets it for degradation, underscores its significance in antiviral defense and its potential impact on HIV-1 disease progression (Smith2010Identification; Russell2009Distinct).

## Structure
The APOBEC3F protein is characterized by a catalytically active C-terminal domain (A3F-CTD) that exhibits a canonical DNA cytosine deaminase fold. This structure includes five beta strands and six alpha helices, with a catalytic zinc-binding site coordinated by histidine and cysteine residues, specifically H249, C280, C283, and indirectly by a water molecule with E251 (Bohn2013Crystal). The A3F-CTD forms high molecular mass complexes in solution, mediated by specific motifs in the b1-b2 loop (Bohn2013Crystal). 

The A3F protein contains two conserved Zn-coordinated domains, CD1 and CD2, with the CD2 domain responsible for catalytic activity (Cheng2018Crystal). The structure of A3F-CTD reveals a predominantly negatively charged region on its surface, which is critical for interactions with the HIV-1 Vif protein (Bohn2013Crystal). The Vif-binding interface includes a conserved sequence motif, 305-RLYYFWD-311, which is part of the Z2 domain specific fingerprint (Bohn2013Crystal). 

The A3F protein shares structural motifs with other APOBEC family members, such as APOBEC3G-CTD, APOBEC3C, and APOBEC2, and has about 50% amino acid sequence similarity to A3G (Cheng2018Crystal). The presence of the CD1 domain enhances its deaminase activity, although it is catalytically inactive (Cheng2018Crystal).

## Function
APOBEC3F is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, which play a crucial role in the innate immune system by editing viral and endogenous DNA. This protein is involved in the deamination of cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA, a process that can lead to G-to-A hypermutations in viral genomes, thereby inhibiting viral replication. APOBEC3F is particularly effective against retroviruses such as HIV-1, where it can induce mutations that restrict viral replication (Harris2015APOBECs; Zheng2004Human).

In healthy human cells, APOBEC3F is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, contributing to antiviral defense and maintaining genomic stability. It is suggested that APOBEC3F, along with other APOBEC3 proteins, suppresses the mobilization of endogenous retroelements like LINE-1 and Alu transposons, which can cause genomic instability if not properly controlled (Harris2015APOBECs). The protein's activity is not limited to deaminase-dependent mechanisms; it may also involve RNA-binding activities that restrict the transposition of these elements (Harris2015APOBECs). APOBEC3F's role in restricting foreign DNA transfer has been demonstrated using systems like the Sleeping Beauty transposon, highlighting its importance in cellular defense mechanisms (Stenglein2010APOBEC3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the APOBEC3F gene have been associated with the progression of HIV-1 disease. A specific haplotype tagged by the p.231V variant is linked to slower progression to AIDS and a lower viral load set-point, suggesting a protective role in HIV-1 disease progression (An2016Role). This haplotype is particularly associated with delayed development of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a common AIDS-defining illness (An2016Role). The protective effect of the A3F 231V haplotype is observed in European Americans and shows similar trends in African Americans (An2016Role).

APOBEC3F's role in HIV-1 pathogenesis is partly due to its ability to induce G-to-A hypermutations in the viral genome, although its antiviral activity is not solely dependent on this mechanism (Kobayashi2014Quantification). The presence of the viral infectivity factor (Vif) can counteract APOBEC3F's effects by mediating its degradation, but APOBEC3F is partially resistant to this degradation compared to other APOBEC3 proteins (Albin2010LongTerm). These interactions highlight the gene's significance in influencing HIV-1 replication and disease progression.

## Interactions
APOBEC3F (A3F) is a member of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in antiviral defense. A3F interacts with the HIV-1 Vif protein, which targets A3F for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction involves specific regions within A3F, particularly the amino acids 283 to 300, with the sequence 289 EFLARH 294 being critical for binding to Vif (Smith2010Identification; Russell2009Distinct). The Vif protein forms a complex with the cellular cofactor CBFβ, creating a platform that recruits A3F, highlighting the role of CBFβ in stabilizing Vif and facilitating A3F degradation (Hu2019Structural).

A3F is also involved in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, associating with RNA-rich microdomains such as mRNA processing bodies and stress granules. It interacts with various RNA-binding proteins, including components of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) like YB-1, Ago1, and Ago2, in an RNase-insensitive manner, suggesting potential direct protein-protein interactions (GalloisMontbrun2008Comparison). A3F RNPs contain Alu RNA and are involved in inhibiting Alu element retrotransposition, indicating a role in regulating RNA function and localization (GalloisMontbrun2008Comparison).
