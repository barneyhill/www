# MED14

## Overview
MED14 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 14, a critical component of the Mediator complex, which is a transcriptional co-regulator in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the general transcription machinery, particularly RNA polymerase II, thereby facilitating the transcription of most protein-coding genes (Hentges2011Mediator). The MED14 protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including metabolic regulation and transcriptional activation, through its interactions with nuclear receptors such as PPARγ and HNF4α (Ranjan2018Therapeutic). Structurally, MED14 is integral to the stability and conformation of the Mediator complex, interacting with multiple subunits and playing a pivotal role in the formation of the pre-initiation complex necessary for transcriptional activation (Zhao2020Structure; Baris2022MediatorRNA). Mutations in the MED14 gene have been linked to immunodeficiency disorders and craniofacial developmental issues, underscoring its clinical significance (Sertori2022Investigation; Lou2015Med14).

## Structure
The MED14 protein is a central component of the human Mediator complex, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. The primary structure of MED14 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MED14 gene. Its secondary structure includes an alternating pattern of alpha-helical and beta-sheet domains, which are conserved across species, including yeast and mammals (Zhao2020Structure). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of MED14 is particularly important for its interaction with RNA Polymerase II, specifically through the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit, facilitating transcriptional activation (Baris2022MediatorRNA).

In terms of tertiary structure, MED14 extends nearly across the entire Mediator complex, with its N-terminus forming part of the hook at the top of the Middle module and its C-terminus located at the interface between the upper and lower portions of the Tail module (Zhao2020Structure). The quaternary structure of MED14 involves its integration into the larger Mediator complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as MED15, MED27, MED28, and MED29, contributing to the stability and conformation of the complex (Zhao2020Structure).

## Function
MED14 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a crucial transcriptional coregulatory complex in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex acts as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the general RNA polymerase II transcription machinery, facilitating the transcription of most protein-coding genes (Hentges2011Mediator). MED14 interacts with nuclear receptors such as PPARγ and HNF4α, which are involved in metabolic pathways and lipid metabolism, respectively. These interactions suggest that MED14 plays a role in gene-specific transcription regulation, particularly in metabolic processes (Ranjan2018Therapeutic).

In the context of cellular metabolism, MED14's interaction with PPARγ indicates its involvement in regulating metabolic gene expression, potentially influencing processes like lipid biosynthesis and adipogenesis (Ranjan2018Therapeutic). Although the specific role of MED14 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, its participation in these interactions highlights its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. MED14 is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of transcription by conveying signals from transcription factors to RNA polymerase II, thus playing a vital role in cell growth and differentiation (Hentges2011Mediator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED14 gene have been implicated in various immunodeficiency disorders. A study identified a missense mutation, V763A, in the MED14 gene in a patient with T-B+NK+ immunodeficiency. This mutation was associated with impaired T-cell development, as demonstrated in zebrafish and mouse models. The mutation alone was insufficient to fully explain the immunodeficiency, suggesting that additional genetic factors might contribute to the disease (Sertori2022Investigation).

MED14 is also involved in the differentiation of neural crest cells, which are crucial for craniofacial development. Mutations in MED14, along with Brg1, have been shown to disrupt the differentiation of these cells, potentially leading to craniofacial abnormalities. This suggests a role for MED14 in conditions such as CHARGE syndrome, which involves craniofacial defects (Lou2015Med14).

Additionally, MED14 is essential for the transcriptional activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) target genes, which are important for adipogenesis. Alterations in MED14 could impact processes like fatty acid metabolism, potentially contributing to metabolic disorders (Grøntved2010MED14).

## Interactions
MED14, a subunit of the Mediator complex, plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is essential for the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to core promoters, a process facilitated by the interaction between the N-terminal domain (NTD) of MED14 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of Pol II. This interaction is vital for both basal and activator-driven transcription, as it helps form the pre-initiation complex (PIC) necessary for transcriptional activation (Baris2022MediatorRNA).

MED14 also interacts with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), specifically binding to its N-terminal domain in a ligand-independent manner. This interaction is crucial for the full transcriptional activity of PPARγ target genes involved in adipogenesis and fatty acid storage. MED14's role in this context includes facilitating the recruitment of the Mediator complex to PPARγ-responsive promoters, which is necessary for the assembly of the Mediator complex and the recruitment of Pol II (Grøntved2010MED14).

These interactions underscore MED14's importance in transcriptional regulation, highlighting its role in both general transcriptional processes and specific gene activation pathways.
