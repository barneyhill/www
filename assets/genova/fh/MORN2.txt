# MORN2

## Overview
MORN2 is a gene that encodes the protein MORN repeat containing 2, which plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) within macrophages. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the regulation of membrane trafficking and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, essential for the maturation and degradation of phagosomes. MORN2 functions as a rate-limiting factor by enhancing the activity of SNAP-23, a SNARE protein, thereby facilitating the recruitment of SNAP-23 onto phagosomes and promoting ROS production via the NOX2 complex. The protein is localized in the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with γ-tubulin at the centrosome, suggesting a role in proteasomal regulation. The stability and function of MORN2 are modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Morita2020Characterization).

## Function
MORN2 (MORN repeat containing 2) is a protein involved in LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) in macrophages, a process that is part of the immune response. MORN2 acts as a rate-limiting factor for LAP by promoting the function of SNAP-23, a SNARE protein crucial for membrane trafficking and phagosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This activity is essential for the maturation and degradation of phagosomes, which are cellular structures that engulf and digest pathogens and debris (Morita2020Characterization).

MORN2 enhances the recruitment of SNAP-23 onto phagosomes, facilitating the production of ROS by the NOX2 complex, which is necessary for effective phagosome maturation. The protein is localized throughout the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with γ-tubulin at the centrosome, an active site of the proteasome, indicating its involvement in proteasomal regulation (Morita2020Characterization).

The stability of MORN2 is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, specifically the centrosome-associated proteasome, which partially cleaves the protein. This regulation is crucial for maintaining its function in steady-state macrophages (Morita2020Characterization). MORN2's activity is closely linked to phagosomes, where it modulates SNAP-23 and ROS production, enhancing LAP efficiency (Morita2020Characterization).
