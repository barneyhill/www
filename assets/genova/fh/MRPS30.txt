# MRPS30

## Overview
The MRPS30 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30, which is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by aiding in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Smits2007Reconstructing). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPS30 is integral to the assembly and stability of the mitoribosome, contributing to cellular energy metabolism (Smits2007Reconstructing). Additionally, MRPS30 is implicated in apoptosis, suggesting a dual role in both mitochondrial function and programmed cell death (Smits2007Reconstructing). The evolutionary significance of MRPS30 is underscored by its presence in metazoans, following a duplication event at the base of the metazoan radiation, highlighting its importance in the development of complex organisms (Smits2007Reconstructing).

## Function
MRPS30 encodes a protein that is part of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the small 28S subunit. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells (Smits2007Reconstructing). The MRPS30 protein is involved in mitochondrial translation and is implicated in apoptosis, suggesting a potential dual role in both mitochondrial function and programmed cell death (Smits2007Reconstructing). The protein is active within the mitochondria, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of the mitoribosome, which is necessary for the efficient synthesis of proteins required for cellular energy metabolism (Smits2007Reconstructing). The presence of MRPS30 in metazoans, following a duplication event at the base of the metazoan radiation, indicates its evolutionary significance in the development of complex organisms (Smits2007Reconstructing). While its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in mitochondrial translation and potential role in apoptosis highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production.

## Clinical Significance
MRPS30, also known as programmed cell death protein 9 (PDCD9), has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, MRPS30 is upregulated and associated with increased risk, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) tumors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MRPS30 genomic region have been linked to increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk, with the risk genotype associated with decreased promoter methylation in ER-positive breast tumors (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). MRPS30 is also upregulated in leukemia and downregulated in lymphoma, suggesting its expression changes are cancer-type specific (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

MRPS30-DT, a long non-coding RNA associated with MRPS30, is significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues and correlates with poor prognosis. Its knockdown in breast cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing apoptosis. MRPS30-DT is thought to facilitate breast cancer progression by targeting the Jab1/COPS5 pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2019MRPS30DT).

In lung cancer, MRPS30-DT may act as a tumor suppressor, with specific genetic polymorphisms influencing lung cancer susceptibility. The TA genotype of rs16901963 in MRPS30-DT is associated with reduced lung cancer risk, while the TT genotype increases risk (Yan2023Genetic).

## Interactions
MRPS30, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's small 28S subunit, is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins to form the ribosome complex, which is essential for translating mitochondrial mRNA. MRPS30 is part of a heterogeneous population of mitoribosomes, with each mitoribosome containing only one copy of MRPS18, another mitochondrial ribosomal protein (Smits2007Reconstructing). This interaction suggests a specific assembly pattern within the mitoribosome, highlighting MRPS30's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the mitochondrial ribosome.

MRPS30 is also implicated in apoptosis, as it is known as programmed cell death protein 9 (PDCD9 or p52), indicating a dual role in mitochondrial translation and apoptotic pathways (Smits2007Reconstructing). This dual functionality suggests that MRPS30 may interact with other proteins involved in apoptosis, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed in the provided sources.

The protein is part of the mitochondrial nucleoid interacting proteins, supporting mitochondrial protein synthesis, which implies interactions with mitochondrial RNA and other components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus (He2012Mitochondrial). However, specific interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond its role in the ribosome are not extensively detailed in the available context.
