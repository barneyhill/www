# OR7E24

## Overview
The OR7E24 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily E member 24, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odorant molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR7E24, are responsible for the initial molecular interactions that lead to the perception of smell. These receptors are located in the olfactory epithelium and are crucial for the transduction of olfactory signals, which are then processed by the brain to identify and differentiate between various odors. The OR7E24 gene, like other olfactory receptor genes, is part of a large gene family that exhibits significant diversity, allowing for the detection of a wide range of odorant molecules.
