# MYLIP

## Overview
The MYLIP gene encodes the myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein, commonly referred to as IDOL (Inducible Degrader of the Low-density lipoprotein receptor). This protein is a cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and other members of the LDLR family, such as VLDLR and ApoER2. MYLIP/IDOL is characterized by its FERM and RING domains, which are essential for substrate recognition and ubiquitination activity, respectively (Martinelli2020Structural; Zhang2012Feedback). The gene's expression is regulated by liver X receptors, which respond to oxysterols, thereby influencing cholesterol uptake in cells (Chen2017Xanthohumol; Zhang2012Feedback). Variations in the MYLIP gene have been linked to differences in cholesterol levels and responses to lipid-lowering therapies, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular health (Santos2014The; WeissglasVolkov2011The).

## Structure
The MYLIP protein, also known as IDOL (Inducible Degrader of the LDL Receptor), is a cytosolic protein with a molecular weight of 50 kDa, consisting of 445 amino acids. It features two major domains: an N-terminal FERM domain and a C-terminal RING domain. The FERM domain is responsible for substrate recognition and is crucial for interactions with the intracellular tail of the LDL receptor (LDLR). It has a tri-lobed structure, with the F3c subdomain potentially obscuring the target binding site, which may explain the low in vitro ubiquitination activity observed (Martinelli2020Structural). The RING domain is unique among human FERM proteins and is responsible for the E3 ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination of the LDLR (van2019The).

The FERM domain's structure includes a cloverleaf arrangement typical of FERM domains, with subdomains such as F1 adopting a ubiquitin-like fold and F2 forming a 4-helix bundle (Martinelli2020Structural). The protein's quaternary structure involves oligomerization states, which have been analyzed using size-exclusion chromatography (Martinelli2020Structural). The FERM domain's flexibility might require activation for effective LDLR recognition, suggesting potential post-translational modifications or additional interactions for full activity (Martinelli2020Structural).

## Function
The MYLIP gene encodes a protein known as IDOL (Inducible Degrader of the Low-density lipoprotein receptor), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in human cells. MYLIP/IDOL mediates the ubiquitination of LDLR, targeting it for degradation via the lysosomal pathway, thereby controlling the uptake of cholesterol into cells (Chen2017Xanthohumol; Zhang2012Feedback).

MYLIP/IDOL is activated by liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ), which are nuclear receptors that respond to oxysterols. Upon activation, these receptors induce the expression of MYLIP, leading to increased degradation of LDLR and reduced cholesterol uptake (Chen2017Xanthohumol; Zhang2012Feedback). The protein contains a FERM domain and a RING ubiquitin ligase domain, which are essential for its function in binding and ubiquitinating LDLR (Chen2017Xanthohumol; Zhang2012Feedback).

MYLIP/IDOL also targets other members of the LDLR family, such as VLDLR and ApoER2, which may have implications in lipid metabolism and neuronal development (Zhang2012Feedback). The regulation of MYLIP expression and activity is tissue-specific and can vary between species (Zhang2012Feedback).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MYLIP gene, also known as IDOL, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular diseases. The N342S polymorphism in MYLIP is associated with variations in cholesterol levels. Specifically, the S342 variant is linked to reduced degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), resulting in increased LDL uptake and lower total cholesterol levels. This polymorphism is considered a functional variant that influences lipid metabolism and may contribute to dyslipidemia (WeissglasVolkov2011The).

The MYLIP gene's role in cholesterol regulation is further highlighted by its interaction with fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), which reduces MYLIP expression, thereby increasing LDLR levels and enhancing lipoprotein uptake. This suggests potential therapeutic strategies for managing cholesterol levels and cardiovascular diseases by targeting MYLIP (Do2012Fibroblast).

Additionally, the MYLIP rs9370867 polymorphism affects the response to lipid-lowering therapies in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients with certain genotypes of this polymorphism show a greater reduction in LDL-C levels when treated with statins, indicating its potential as a pharmacogenetic marker for predicting treatment efficacy (Santos2014The).

## Interactions
MYLIP, also known as IDOL, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), where MYLIP promotes the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of LDLR, thereby regulating cholesterol uptake in cells (Martinelli2020Structural). This interaction involves the FERM domain of MYLIP, which recognizes the intracellular tail of LDLR (Martinelli2020Structural).

MYLIP also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. It ubiquitinates AR at specific lysine residues, which are crucial for AR's transcriptional activation and degradation. This interaction is inhibited by CNPY2, which decreases MYLIP levels and inhibits its activity, thereby suppressing MYLIP-mediated AR degradation (Ito2018CNPY2).

Additionally, MYLIP is involved in the regulation of LDLR levels through its interaction with CNPY2/MSAP. CNPY2 acts as a natural inhibitor of MYLIP, counteracting its activity and potentially increasing LDLR levels, which is significant in lipid metabolism (Do2012Fibroblast). The interaction between MYLIP and CNPY2/MSAP is crucial for the regulation of LDLR stability and cellular lipid uptake (Do2012Fibroblast).
