# YAF2

## Overview
YAF2 (YY1 associated factor 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The YAF2 protein is characterized by its role as a bridging factor between the transcription factor YY1 and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), facilitating the recruitment of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins to chromatin. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional repression of target genes through histone modifications, such as the ubiquitination of histone H2A and the trimethylation of histone H3, which are essential for gene silencing (Basu2013YY1). YAF2 is active in the nucleus and is involved in maintaining cellular identity and function by regulating gene expression. It also plays a role in anti-apoptotic processes and is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Wilkinson2009PcG; Zhang2021YAF2).

## Structure
The YAF2 protein is characterized by a primary structure that includes 179 amino acids, with a notable C2C2-type zinc finger motif located between residues 25-42, which is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation (Wilkinson2009PcG; Kaneko2003The). The protein's C-terminal region, spanning residues 102-179, is essential for interactions with the REPO domain of the transcription factor YY1 and RING proteins, which are components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (Wilkinson2009PcG; Basu2013YY1). This region is also critical for the protein's role in gene repression and PcG recruitment (Basu2013YY1).

YAF2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine 166, which is important for its function in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (Zhao2018The). The protein exists in two splice variant isoforms, mYAF2-a and mYAF2-b, generated through alternative splicing. The mYAF2-a isoform closely resembles the human YAF2 protein, while mYAF2-b is a shorter variant due to a premature stop codon (Kaneko2003The). These structural features and modifications enable YAF2 to act as a bridge between YY1 and PRC1, facilitating transcriptional repression and chromatin modification (Basu2013YY1).

## Function
YAF2 (YY1 associated factor 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in gene regulation through its interaction with the transcription factor YY1. In healthy human cells, YAF2 is involved in the recruitment of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are essential for transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. YAF2 acts as a bridging protein between YY1 and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), facilitating the assembly of PcG complexes on chromatin. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination of histone H2A and the trimethylation of histone H3, key modifications for gene silencing (Basu2013YY1).

YAF2 is active in the nucleus, where it enhances YY1 DNA binding and contributes to the regulation of gene expression. It is involved in maintaining cellular functions and identity by regulating Polycomb target genes. Knockdown studies in HeLa cells have shown that YAF2 is essential for the recruitment of PcG proteins and the maintenance of gene repression, highlighting its role in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation (Basu2013YY1). YAF2's function in these processes underscores its importance in cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Wilkinson2009PcG).

## Interactions
YAF2 (YY1 associated factor 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the FANK1 protein, where YAF2's phosphorylation at serine 167 stabilizes FANK1 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, thus playing a role in anti-apoptotic processes in human tumor cells (Zhang2021YAF2). YAF2 also interacts with the MYCN protein, specifically binding to its central region, which enhances MYCN-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction is significant in neuroblastoma cells, where both proteins are localized in the nucleus (Bannasch2001Functional).

YAF2 is a part of the non-canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (nc-PRC1) and interacts with the transcription factor YY1. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins to DNA, facilitating transcriptional repression. YAF2 acts as a bridge between YY1 and PcG proteins, enhancing YY1's DNA binding and PcG recruitment (Basu2013YY1). These interactions highlight YAF2's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on tumor cell apoptosis and gene expression.
