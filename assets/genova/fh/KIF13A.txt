# KIF13A

## Overview
KIF13A is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 13A, a member of the kinesin-3 family of motor proteins. This protein is characterized by its ATP-dependent motor function, which facilitates intracellular transport along microtubule tracks. Kinesin family member 13A is involved in the dynamics of recycling endosomes and plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, division, and neuronal function. It interacts with Rab GTPases and other proteins to mediate the transport of vesicles and receptors to the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein's structure includes distinct domains for motor activity, dimerization, and cargo attachment, allowing it to perform its functions effectively (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A).

## Structure
KIF13A is a member of the kinesin-3 family, characterized by its ATP-dependent motor function. The protein is structured into three main domains: the head or motor domain, the stalk domain, and the tail domain. The motor domain, located near the N-terminus, binds to microtubules and ATP, facilitating movement along microtubule tracks (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). The stalk domain is complex, comprising a neck coil (NC) domain, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, five non-continuous coiled-coil (CC) domains, and two low complexity regions. A unique proline residue between the NC and CC regions is crucial for regulating motor function by restricting dimerization and processivity (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A).

KIF13A forms homodimers in vivo, and its monomeric form is inactive. It can also form heterodimers with its homolog KIF13B (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). The tail domain is responsible for cargo attachment, interacting with various proteins, including Rab GTPases, which are essential for endosomal dynamics (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). KIF13A exists in five different isoforms in humans, with isoform-a being the longest at 1805 amino acids (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). The protein's activity and interactions may be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
KIF13A is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of recycling endosomes (REs) in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transport of various proteins and vesicles to the plasma membrane, influencing several cellular processes such as cell migration, division, and neuronal function (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). KIF13A interacts with Rab GTPases like Rab11A, Rab10, and Rab22A, which are essential for endosomal maturation and recycling endosome formation (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). The protein facilitates the recycling of transferrin receptors and other cargoes from early/sorting endosomes back to the cell surface, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A).

In neuronal cells, KIF13A is involved in the transport of serotonin receptors, which is important for anxiety control (Hirokawa2015Kinesin). It also plays a role in the trafficking of ATP7A and other proteins, indicating its involvement in multiple recycling pathways (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). KIF13A's function is regulated by its interaction with Rab22A, which facilitates its motor activation and dimerization, necessary for efficient cargo transport (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF13A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, KIF13A is associated with several types, including lung adenocarcinoma, where a fusion with RET sequences encoding tyrosine kinase (KIF13-RET) has been reported (Chang2024A; Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). This fusion is a significant oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and patients with this mutation have shown favorable responses to targeted therapies like pralsetinib (Chang2024A). KIF13A is also linked to retinoblastomas and ovarian tumors, where increased expression and splice site mutations have been observed, respectively (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, a heterozygous de novo frameshift variant in KIF13A has been identified in a patient with a novel mosaic neuroectodermal syndrome, characterized by skin hypopigmentation and developmental delay, suggesting KIF13A haploinsufficiency as a contributing factor (Lam2021Postzygotic). In the context of psychiatric disorders, KIF13A dysfunction is linked to anxiety-related behaviors due to its role in the transport of the serotonin type 1A receptor, with knockout mice exhibiting elevated anxiety levels (Zhou2013A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KIF13A in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
KIF13A interacts with several proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in intracellular transport and recycling endosome dynamics. It is regulated by Rab proteins, particularly Rab10, Rab22A, and Rab11A, which are involved in recruiting KIF13A to endosomal membranes. Rab22A binds to KIF13A, relieving inhibition and enabling its activation, while Rab11A is crucial for endosomal maturation and recycling endosome formation (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). KIF13A also interacts with the AP-1 complex, specifically binding to the β1-adaptin subunit, which is essential for the transport of cargo vesicles, such as the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, to the plasma membrane (Nakagawa2000A).

KIF13A forms complexes with multi-subunit structures like BLOC-1, retromer, and retriever, which are involved in cargo sorting and recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). It also interacts with the WASH complex, which is involved in actin-dependent endosomal membrane scission, although WASH does not affect KIF13A-RE biogenesis (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A). In neurons, KIF13A is involved in the trafficking of glutamate receptors to synapses and associates with vesicles during neuronal transport (Thankachan2022KIF13A—A).
