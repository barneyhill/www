# GPR146

## Overview
GPR146 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 146, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and immune responses. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and adipose tissues, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining normal blood cholesterol levels by influencing cell signaling pathways, particularly those involving cyclic AMP (cAMP) (Han2020Hypercholesterolemia). GPR146 has also been implicated in interactions with proinsulin C-peptide, although the exact nature of this interaction remains under investigation (Yosten2013Evidence). Clinically, alterations in GPR146 expression are associated with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at managing cholesterol-related disorders (Yu2019GPR146). Additionally, GPR146 is involved in immune regulation, suggesting its broader role in inflammatory processes (Huang2017Elimination).

## Function
GPR146 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in regulating blood cholesterol levels. It is highly expressed in the liver and adipose tissues, particularly in hepatocytes, where it is involved in cell signaling processes. GPR146 contains seven transmembrane domains and is located on the plasma membrane of cultured cells. It responds to serum stimulation by activating the transcriptional activity of the cAMP response element (CRE), a process that can be inhibited by the PKA inhibitor H89, suggesting that GPR146 signals through pathways involving cAMP (Han2020Hypercholesterolemia).

In vivo studies using gpr146 knockout mice have demonstrated that the absence of GPR146, especially in the liver, results in significantly decreased blood cholesterol levels and protection from diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. This indicates that GPR146 is crucial for maintaining normal cholesterol levels in the bloodstream, primarily through its action in the liver (Han2020Hypercholesterolemia).

Additionally, GPR146 has been implicated in immune regulation, as its expression is increased by interferons in macrophages, suggesting a role in antiviral defense mechanisms. However, its exact function in healthy human cells outside of this context remains less clear (Huang2017Elimination).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR146 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those related to cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular health. GPR146 is associated with plasma cholesterol levels, and its increased expression is linked to hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. A specific variant, rs1997243-G, located upstream of GPR146, is associated with increased plasma cholesterol levels and higher expression of GPR146 in human blood (Yu2019GPR146). 

Research indicates that GPR146 promotes cholesterol levels through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, affecting SREBP2 activity and VLDL secretion. In mouse models, the absence of GPR146 leads to reduced LDL-C levels and protection against atherosclerosis, suggesting that targeting GPR146 could be a strategy for treating hypercholesterolemia, especially in cases of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) where conventional therapies are less effective (Yu2019GPR146).

GPR146 also plays a role in non-specific orbital inflammation (NSOI), where it is highlighted as a key gene among 15 hub genes associated with the disease's pathophysiology. Its involvement in inflammation and immune responses suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for NSOI (Wu2024Elucidating).

## Interactions
GPR146, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in interactions with proinsulin C-peptide. Studies suggest that GPR146 acts as a receptor for C-peptide, facilitating its internalization and signaling. Knockdown experiments in KATOIII cells have shown that silencing GPR146 blocks C-peptide-induced cFos expression, indicating a specific interaction between C-peptide and GPR146 (Yosten2013Evidence). Immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that GPR146 is present on cell membranes and that exposure to C-peptide induces its internalization, suggesting a direct interaction (Yosten2013Evidence).

However, some studies have questioned the direct activation of GPR146 by C-peptide. Experiments using the PathHunter GPCR β-Arrestin assay showed no significant recruitment of arrestin in CHO-K1 cells overexpressing GPR146, suggesting that C-peptide does not activate GPR146 in this system (Lindfors2020Is). Despite these findings, the role of GPR146 in C-peptide uptake and signaling remains a topic of interest, with evidence supporting its involvement in C-peptide internalization in mouse oocytes (Martin2019Investigation). The complexity of GPR146 interactions, including potential involvement in receptor complexes, highlights the need for further research to elucidate its precise role in cellular signaling.
