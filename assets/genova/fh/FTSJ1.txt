# FTSJ1

## Overview
FTSJ1 is a gene that encodes the protein FtsJ RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase 1, a crucial enzyme involved in the methylation of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. This enzyme is categorized as a 2'-O-methyltransferase and plays a significant role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically at positions 32 and 34 in the anticodon loop, which is essential for proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Brazane2023The). The activity of FtsJ RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase 1 is vital for maintaining neuron morphology and function, impacting learning and cognitive performance. The gene's function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in biological processes (Brazane2023The). Mutations in FTSJ1 are linked to X-linked intellectual disability and other neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Jensen2019A; Jensen2006Xlinked).

## Function
FTSJ1 is a conserved human 2'-O-methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in neuron morphology and learning performance. In healthy human cells, FTSJ1 is involved in the methylation of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, specifically at positions 32 and 34 in the anticodon loop. This methylation is essential for the proper functioning of tRNA, which in turn is critical for protein synthesis (Brazane2023The). The enzyme's activity is necessary for maintaining healthy physiological functions, including proper neuronal development and activity. Its function is conserved across species, including humans and Drosophila, indicating its fundamental role in maintaining neuron morphology and function (Brazane2023The).

FTSJ1's activity is crucial for the stability, interactions, and functions of RNA, affecting RNA stability and interactions (Brazane2021The). The enzyme is active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), impacting protein synthesis and overall cellular function (Brazane2023The). The proper methylation of tRNA by FTSJ1 is necessary for efficient conversion of certain nucleotides, which is vital for maintaining normal neuron morphology and function (Brazane2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FTSJ1 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), a condition characterized by significant cognitive impairments. These mutations often result in loss of function, leading to truncated proteins that disrupt normal RNA methylation processes, which are crucial for proper brain function (Jensen2019A; Jensen2006Xlinked). In addition to intellectual disability, FTSJ1 mutations have been linked to various neurological and developmental conditions, including changes in neuron morphology and learning deficits. These morphological changes, such as dendritic spine overgrowth, are observed in both human patients and animal models, indicating a conserved role across species (Brazane2023The).

Alterations in FTSJ1 expression can also affect the miRNA population, leading to deregulation of genes involved in brain diseases and cancers. For instance, the up-regulation of miR-181a-5p in FTSJ1 mutants affects the silencing of the BTBD3 gene, which is implicated in neuron morphology and learning performance (Brazane2023The). Furthermore, FTSJ1 mutations have been associated with broader physiological effects, such as altered metabolism and hormone levels, as observed in mouse models (Jensen2019A). These findings suggest that FTSJ1 mutations may contribute to a range of neurological disorders and potentially other systemic conditions.

## Interactions
FTSJ1, a human 2'-O-methyltransferase, is involved in the methylation of specific tRNAs at positions 32 and 34 in the anticodon loop. This enzyme interacts with tRNA molecules as part of its function, modifying nucleotides within the tRNA structure (von2022Deficiency; Brazane2021The). In yeast, the homologous enzyme Trm7 forms a complex with proteins Trm732 and Trm734, which are essential for the methylation of specific tRNA targets. This interaction is necessary for the efficient conversion of m1G37 to wybutosine (yW37) by other proteins, suggesting a conserved mechanism across species, including humans (Brazane2021The).

In Drosophila, the orthologs of FTSJ1, CG7009, and CG5220, are involved in similar tRNA modifications, indicating that FTSJ1 may participate in a complex with other proteins for its methylation activity (Angelova2020tRNA). The study of FTSJ1's interactions with small molecule inhibitors has shown that it binds to specific residues, such as Gly53, Trp55, and Asp116, which are crucial for its function. These interactions have been explored using molecular dynamics simulations to understand the binding free energy and the potential for therapeutic interventions (Carollo2023Investigating).
