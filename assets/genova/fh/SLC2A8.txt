# SLC2A8

## Overview
The SLC2A8 gene encodes the solute carrier family 2 member 8 (GLUT8), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the glucose transporter family, specifically the major facilitator superfamily. GLUT8 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in the intracellular transport of hexoses, playing a significant role in cellular respiration and energy metabolism. It is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, brain, and placenta, where it facilitates the transport of glucose across intracellular membranes such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria (Mueckler2013The; Lipka2024The). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may influence its regulatory and signaling functions (Alexander2021Alternative). Alterations in SLC2A8 expression have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Mayer2018Enhanced; Lai2020The).

## Structure
The SLC2A8 gene encodes the GLUT8 protein, a member of the glucose transporter family characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, typical of the major facilitator superfamily (Augustin2010The). The protein is organized into 10 exons, with exon boundaries embedded within sequences encoding highly conserved transmembrane domains (Alexander2021Alternative). A key feature of GLUT8 is the canonical dileucine motif in the N-terminal domain, which directs the protein to late endosomes and lysosomes (Alexander2021Alternative). 

GLUT8 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may alter the N- and C-termini, affecting regulatory and signaling domains (Alexander2021Alternative). Three splice variants have been identified: v1 (full-length), v2 (missing exon 9 and part of the C-terminus), and v3 (missing exons 2 and 3) (Alexander2021Alternative). The v3 variant is prevalent in breast cancer cell lines but does not produce a stable protein (Alexander2021Alternative).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of a glycosylation site, and complex glycosylation patterns have been observed (Alexander2021Alternative). The protein is cleaved at the transmembrane domain 10, a highly conserved site, resulting in a carboxy-terminal peptide that traffics independently (Alexander2021Alternative).

## Function
The SLC2A8 gene encodes the GLUT8 protein, which functions primarily as an intracellular glucose transporter in human cells. GLUT8 is involved in the transport of hexoses across intracellular membranes, such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria, playing a crucial role in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Lipka2024The). In the placenta, GLUT8 is associated with glucose transport, although it is not the primary transporter for placental glucose uptake. Its deficiency can impact mitochondrial function, potentially affecting energy metabolism and leading to pregnancy disorders (Lipka2024The).

GLUT8 is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, brain, and placenta, and is thought to facilitate intracellular hexose transport rather than glucose uptake across the plasma membrane (Mueckler2013The; Lipka2024The). In the testis, it is found in differentiating spermatocytes and mature spermatozoa, where it may contribute to maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP availability (Mueckler2013The; Lipka2024The). The protein's role in intracellular transport is highlighted by its involvement in mitochondrial function, as evidenced by its impact on processes like oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis (Lipka2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC2A8 gene, also known as GLUT8, have been linked to various clinical conditions. Dysregulation of SLC2A8 expression in the placenta is associated with pregnancy disorders such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small for gestational age (SGA) pregnancies, potentially due to its role in glucose transport and mitochondrial function (Lipka2024The). In the context of metabolic diseases, SLC2A8 deficiency has been shown to affect hepatic lipid metabolism and fasting responses, suggesting its involvement in conditions like diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Mayer2018Enhanced).

In cancer, high expression levels of SLC2A8 have been associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Lai2020The). Additionally, alternative splicing of SLC2A8 in tumors, particularly breast cancer, suggests a complex role in cancer biology, with certain splice variants being more prevalent in cancerous tissues (Alexander2021Alternative). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in both metabolic and oncological conditions, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
