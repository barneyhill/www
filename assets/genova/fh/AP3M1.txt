# AP3M1

## Overview
The AP3M1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit mu 1, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3). This protein complex is integral to intracellular vesicle formation and protein sorting, particularly in the transport of proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. The AP-3 complex, which includes AP3M1, is active in the cytoplasm, especially within the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, where it facilitates the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and recognizes sorting signals in transmembrane cargo molecules. The AP3M1 protein plays a vital role in various cellular processes, including pigmentation, immune response, and neurotransmission, by ensuring the proper trafficking and localization of proteins. Dysfunctions in AP3M1 have been linked to several diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Hashimoto2009Association; Ward2017Interaction; Zheng2019AP3M).

## Structure


## Function
The AP3M1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is crucial for vesicle formation and protein sorting within cells. The AP-3 complex consists of four subunits and is involved in the transport of proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles, playing a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions. This complex is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, where it mediates the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and recognizes sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (Hashimoto2009Association).

The AP-3 complex is essential for the formation of lysosome-related organelles and a subset of synaptic vesicles by sorting specific cargo proteins, including tyrosinase-related protein 1, melanosomal membrane protein, lysosomal-associated membrane proteins, and zinc transporter 3. These processes are vital for various cellular activities, such as pigmentation, immune response, and neurotransmission in synapses (Hashimoto2009Association). The proper functioning of the AP-3 complex is critical for cellular homeostasis and organismal health, as it ensures the correct trafficking and localization of proteins within cells.

## Clinical Significance
AP3M1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In endometriosis, AP3M1 is identified as a key diagnostic biomarker. Its expression is significantly decreased in endometriosis samples compared to healthy samples, suggesting an inverse relationship with the disease. This downregulation is associated with the pathophysiology of endometriosis, where aberrant apoptotic phenomena in ectopic endometrial tissue contribute to disease development (Xie2024Identification).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), AP3M1 is one of the lysosome-related genes identified as a predictor of the disease. It is considered a risk factor, with its expression levels correlating with tumor progression and prognosis. The study highlights the potential involvement of AP3M1 in the progression of LIHC, suggesting its role in the classification of molecular subgroups with different clinical outcomes (He2023System).

While AP3M1 is part of the AP-3 complex, which is associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), the specific role of AP3M1 in this syndrome is not directly mentioned in the context provided. However, the AP-3 complex is known to be involved in the pathology of HPS (de2017HermanskyPudlak).

## Interactions
The AP3M1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is involved in the trafficking of proteins to lysosomes and related organelles. AP3M1 interacts with the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) matrix protein (M) through the AP-3Mu3A subunit. This interaction is crucial for the trafficking of the M protein, which is essential for the virus's pathogenesis. The interaction is mediated by a conserved tyrosine-based sorting signal motif, 197-YXXL-200, in the M protein. Mutations in this motif impair the proper trafficking of the M protein, leading to reduced viral titers (Ward2017Interaction).

AP3M1 is also associated with the dysbindin protein, a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Dysbindin interacts directly with the AP-3 complex via its mu subunit, encoded by AP3M1. This interaction is part of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), which is essential for the formation of lysosome-related organelles and a subset of synaptic vesicles (Hashimoto2009Association).

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AP3M protein, a homolog of AP3M1, binds directly to F-actin, indicating a conserved function across species. This interaction is important for vacuole morphology and stomatal closure (Zheng2019AP3M).
