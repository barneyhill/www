# ZNF597

## Overview
ZNF597 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 597, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger motifs, which typically facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. However, ZNF597 appears to deviate from this norm, as it may not engage in typical DNA-binding interactions (Helleboid2019The). Instead, it is implicated in chromosomal organization through interactions with components of the chromosome-organizing SMC complexes (Helleboid2019The). The protein's role in growth and development is suggested by its association with conditions such as Silver-Russell syndrome and hemimegalencephaly, where its overexpression has been linked to significant phenotypic outcomes (Griffin2017Somatic; Yamazawa2020Loss). Additionally, ZNF597 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in osteosarcoma, where its expression levels correlate with patient survival outcomes (Sun2022Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF597 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. Overexpression of ZNF597 has been associated with hemimegalencephaly (HME), a condition characterized by malformations of cortical development. In a study, a patient with HME exhibited somatic uniparental disomy of the p-arm of Chromosome 16, leading to hypomethylation and overexpression of ZNF597. This overexpression was linked to increased mTOR signaling, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of HME through modulation of this pathway (Griffin2017Somatic).

ZNF597 is also involved in imprinting disorders. Loss of imprinting of ZNF597 has been linked to prenatal growth retardation and dysmorphic features, with phenotypic overlap with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). A case study reported isolated hypomethylation of the ZNF597:TSS-DMR, leading to overexpression of ZNF597 and contributing to SRS-like phenotypes (Yamazawa2020Loss).

In osteosarcoma, lower expression levels of ZNF597 have been associated with worse overall survival, suggesting that ZNF597 may act as a protective factor in this type of cancer. The gene's expression is part of a prognostic signature that helps stratify patients into risk groups (Sun2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
ZNF597 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its association with components of the chromosome-organizing SMC complexes. This suggests a role in chromosomal organization (Helleboid2019The). The study by Helleboid et al. highlights the importance of KAP1 as a central interactor in the KRAB zinc finger protein network, although specific interactions involving ZNF597 and KAP1 are not detailed (Helleboid2019The). 

The research also explores the role of specific domains, such as SCAN and DUF3669, in mediating protein-protein interactions among KRAB zinc finger proteins, which may include ZNF597 (Helleboid2019The). However, the study notes that few or no ChIP-seq peaks were detected for ZNF597, indicating different modalities or absence of DNA binding, which suggests that ZNF597 might not engage in typical DNA-binding interactions seen with other zinc finger proteins (Helleboid2019The).

The biological functions and interactions of ZNF597 remain somewhat unclear, but its overexpression has been linked to phenotypes associated with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16, including features of Silver-Russell syndrome, suggesting a potential regulatory role in growth and development (Yamazawa2020Loss).
