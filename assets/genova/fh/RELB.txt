# RELB

## Overview
The RELB gene encodes the RELB proto-oncogene, a member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors, which plays a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. The RELB protein is characterized by a Rel homology domain (RHD) that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization with other NF-κB subunits, such as p50 and p52, forming heterodimers essential for its function (Ryseck1992RelB; Baud2016PostTranslational). Unlike other NF-κB family members, RELB is primarily involved in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for lymphoid organ development and immune cell differentiation (Lernbecher1994Two). The protein's activity is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, which influence its stability and transcriptional activity (Baud2016PostTranslational). Mutations in the RELB gene are linked to immune-related disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential involvement in immunological diseases (Merico2015RelB; Haynes2016Heterozygous).

## Structure
The RELB protein is a member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors and is characterized by a Rel homology domain (RHD) that spans approximately 300 amino acids. This domain is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing RELB to form heterodimers with other NF-κB subunits such as p50 and p52 (Ryseck1992RelB; Baud2016PostTranslational). The protein consists of 558 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 60.3 kDa (Ryseck1992RelB).

The N-terminal region of RELB contains a leucine zipper-like motif, which is essential for its transcriptional activity and dimerization capabilities (Dobrzanski1993Both). The C-terminal domain is rich in acidic amino acids and is suggested to function as a transcriptional activation domain (Ryseck1992RelB). This domain is particularly active in yeast cells but requires the presence of the N-terminal domain for full activity in mammalian cells (Dobrzanski1993Both).

Post-translational modifications of RELB include phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and SUMOylation, which regulate its stability, dimerization, and transcriptional activity (Leidner2008Identification; Baud2016PostTranslational). These modifications are critical for the regulation of NF-κB activity and influence the initiation and specificity of NF-κB responses (Baud2016PostTranslational).

## Function
RELB is a member of the NF-kB family of transcription factors, which are crucial for regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. In healthy human cells, RELB primarily functions by forming heterodimers with other NF-kB proteins, such as p50 and p52, to modulate gene expression. These heterodimers bind to kB sites on DNA, influencing the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Ryseck1992RelB; Lernbecher1994Two).

RELB is involved in non-canonical NF-kB signaling pathways, which are distinct from the classical pathways that involve RELA/p65. This non-canonical pathway is important for the development of lymphoid organs and the differentiation of immune cells (Lernbecher1994Two). RELB-containing complexes are predominantly nuclear in certain cell types, such as lymphoid cells, where they are less susceptible to inhibition by IKB-a, allowing for constitutive activation of target genes (Lernbecher1994Two).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, RELB influences the expression of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-17A, IL-22, and CCL20, which are critical for immune cell recruitment and function (Ishihara2019Role). This regulatory activity underscores RELB's importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to external stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RELB gene are associated with several immune-related disorders and conditions. Heterozygous mutations in RELB can lead to immune dysregulation and are linked to the development of lymphoma. Patients with these mutations often exhibit impaired immune responses, such as reduced responses to mitogens and antigens, and may develop lymphoma (Haynes2016Heterozygous). Homozygous mutations in RELB, which result in a premature stop codon and absence of RelB expression, are associated with combined immunodeficiency (CID). This condition is characterized by repeated infections despite the presence of circulating T and B cells, indicating a significant impairment in immune function (Merico2015RelB).

RelB deficiency also affects lymphocyte development and function, leading to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and autoimmune features. Patients with RelB deficiency may experience failure to thrive, susceptibility to infections, and autoimmune manifestations such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent infections (Sharfe2015The). In mice, targeted disruption of the relB gene results in multiorgan inflammation, hematopoietic abnormalities, and impaired immune responses, further highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Weih1995Multiorgan). These findings underscore the importance of RelB in immune regulation and its potential involvement in various immunological disorders.

## Interactions
RELB, a member of the NF-κB family, primarily forms heterodimers with other NF-κB subunits such as p50 and p52, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. These heterodimers bind to κB sites on DNA, enhancing transcriptional activation, unlike p50-NF-κB homodimers, which do not transactivate effectively (Ryseck1992RelB). RELB cannot form stable homodimers and requires pairing with p50 or p52 for transcriptional activity (Yang2019Biological; Baud2016PostTranslational).

The N- and C-terminal domains of RELB are essential for its full transcriptional activation potential. These domains cooperate in transactivation, and alterations in the leucine zipper-like motif in the N terminus significantly reduce its transcriptional capacity (Dobrzanski1993Both). RELB also interacts with SMAD proteins in the nucleus, binding to SMAD-binding promoters and influencing TGFβ transcriptional output, which suggests a novel role in gene expression regulation (Newman2017Autophagy).

RELB's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as polyubiquitination, which affects its interaction with transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors without necessarily leading to its degradation (Leidner2008Identification). These interactions and modifications highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing RELB's role in transcriptional regulation.
