# CDK16

## Overview
CDK16, or cyclin-dependent kinase 16, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase belonging to the cyclin-dependent kinase family, which is characterized by its role in regulating various cellular processes through phosphorylation. The protein product of CDK16, also known as PCTAIRE1, is involved in critical functions such as neuronal signaling, spermatogenesis, and autophagy. It interacts with regulatory proteins like cyclin Y and 14-3-3 proteins, which modulate its activity and facilitate its involvement in cellular energy regulation and homeostasis (Karimbayli2024Insights; Dohmen2020AMPKdependent). CDK16's structural features, including a conserved catalytic domain and a unique PCTAIRE box, enable it to participate in complex formation and protein interactions essential for its diverse roles (Endicott2013Structural). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology and male fertility, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Li2022CDK16; Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent).

## Structure
CDK16, also known as PCTAIRE1, is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family with a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of CDK16 includes a sequence of approximately 500 amino acids, sharing significant sequence homology with other CDKs such as CDK5 (Karimbayli2024Insights). The secondary structure features a classical bilobal architecture typical of CDKs, with a five-stranded β-sheet and an αC helix in the N-lobe, and a predominantly α-helical C-lobe (DixonClarke2017Structure).

The tertiary structure of CDK16 is characterized by a well-conserved catalytic domain, similar to CDK2 and CDK5, and includes a unique PCTAIRE box, which is crucial for protein interactions and complex formation with cyclins like cyclin Y (Endicott2013Structural). The kinase domain exhibits conformational plasticity, with the DFG motif adopting different conformations depending on the inhibitor bound (DixonClarke2017Structure).

CDK16 can form quaternary structures through interactions with regulatory subunits such as cyclin Y and 14-3-3 proteins, which are important for its activation (Wood2018Structural). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation at specific serine residues, play a crucial role in regulating CDK16's activity and interactions (Karimbayli2024Insights). CDK16 also has several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in function and regulation (Karimbayli2024Insights).

## Function
CDK16, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in neuronal function by targeting presynaptic components to the axon, indicating its importance in neuronal signaling and development (Karimbayli2024Insights). CDK16 is also essential for spermatogenesis, as it interacts with cyclin Y (CCNY) and cyclin Y-like 1 (CCNYL1), and its absence leads to infertility in male mice due to structural abnormalities and impaired motility of spermatozoa (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent; Dohmen2020AMPKdependent).

In addition to its role in reproduction and neuronal activity, CDK16 is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, a process crucial for cellular degradation and recycling. The Cyclin Y/CDK16 complex, activated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), accelerates autophagic flux, highlighting its role in cellular energy regulation and homeostasis (Dohmen2020AMPKdependent). CDK16 is also involved in myogenic differentiation, where its overexpression increases the expression of myogenesis markers such as Myosin Light Chain and Troponin C (Karimbayli2024Insights). These diverse functions underscore CDK16's significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
CDK16 is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CDK16 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis, lower 5-year survival rates, and higher recurrence rates. Its expression is associated with clinical features such as Edmondson grade and portal vein tumor thrombus. Knockdown of CDK16 in hepatoma cells suppresses proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Wang2017RETRACTED).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CDK16 promotes progression and metastasis by phosphorylating PRC1. High CDK16 expression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival. Pharmacological inhibition of CDK16 with Rebastinib has shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022CDK16).

CDK16 is also essential for spermatogenesis. Deficiency in CDK16 leads to asthenozoospermia, characterized by defects in sperm motility and structure, resulting in male infertility. This condition is due to improper cytoplasm removal during spermiation and structural abnormalities in sperm (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent).

## Interactions
CDK16, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 16, interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity and function. It forms a complex with cyclin Y (CCNY), which is crucial for its activation and role in various cellular processes, including spermatogenesis and cancer cell proliferation (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent; HernándezOrtega2019Phosphoregulation). The interaction between CDK16 and CCNY is regulated by phosphorylation at serine 153, which inhibits their binding (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent). 

CDK16 also interacts with CCNYL1, which stabilizes the CDK16 protein and influences its phosphorylation status, affecting its kinase activity (Zi2015CCNYL1). In the brain, CDK16 interacts with proteins such as p11 and 14-3-3, although the functional implications of these interactions are not fully understood (Karimbayli2024Insights). 

The CDK16/CCNY complex is involved in cytoskeletal regulation, with PRC1 identified as a substrate. CDK16 phosphorylates PRC1, affecting its localization and function in cell division (HernándezOrtega2019Phosphoregulation). These interactions highlight CDK16's role in linking cell cycle progression with cytoskeletal changes and its potential implications in cancer biology.
