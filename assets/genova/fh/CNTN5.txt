# CNTN5

## Overview
Contactin 5 (CNTN5) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, specifically known as contactin 5. This protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes six immunoglobulin-like domains and four fibronectin type III domains, and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) link (Kleijer2015Contactin-5; OguroAndo2017A). Contactin 5 plays a crucial role in the development and organization of neuronal networks, particularly in the brain, where it is involved in processes such as neuritogenesis and synapse formation (Mercati2013Contactin). The protein interacts with various other molecules, including amyloid precursor protein and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G, to facilitate these functions (Nikolaienko2016Structural; OguroAndo2017A). Alterations in the CNTN5 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Kleijer2015Contactin-5; OguroAndo2017A).

## Structure
The CNTN5 protein, also known as Contactin-5, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is characterized by six immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, which contribute to its structural conformation and function (Kleijer2015Contactin-5; OguroAndo2017A). The protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) link, which is a common post-translational modification for this family of proteins (Kleijer2015Contactin-5).

Structurally, CNTN5 exhibits a bent conformation in its FN1-FN3 regions, stabilized by conserved hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. This conformation is consistent across the contactin family, suggesting a conserved structural feature (Nikolaienko2016Structural). The Ig domains of CNTN5, particularly Ig1-4, have been modeled using homology with mouse Cntn4, revealing an insertion of two amino acids that results in a V loop with conformational flexibility (Mercati2013Contactin).

CNTN5 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) through its Ig domains, with the interaction sites being conserved across contactin family members (Nikolaienko2016Structural). Despite structural differences, the binding sites for PTPRG are identical among CNTN4, CNTN5, and CNTN6, indicating similar binding interactions (Mercati2013Contactin).

## Function
CNTN5, or contactin 5, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of neural cell-adhesion molecules (Ig-CAMs) that plays a significant role in neuronal development and synapse formation. It is involved in neuritogenesis, the process of neurite outgrowth and branching, which is crucial for the development of neuronal circuits. CNTN5 promotes neurite branching and elongation, particularly in cerebral cortical neurons, by increasing the number of roots and segments during early growth stages (Mercati2013Contactin).

CNTN5 is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, and is particularly active in the auditory pathway, which is characterized by complex neuronal organizations and dendritic morphologies (Mercati2013Contactin; OguroAndo2017A). It interacts with other proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, and forms a cis-complex with APLP1 at the presynapse, potentially influencing synaptogenesis (OguroAndo2017A).

CNTN5 also plays a role in sensory processing and synapse organization, as evidenced by its expression on proprioceptive sensory neurons and its interaction with Cntnap4, which directs the formation of GABApre bouton synapses (OguroAndo2017A). These molecular interactions and processes contribute to the establishment and maintenance of neuronal networks, impacting cognitive and motor functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CNTN5 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. CNTN5 is considered a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with copy number variations (CNVs) in CNTN5 being associated with the condition. A paternally transmitted loss of CNTN5 has been found to be sufficient to cause ASD (Kleijer2015Contactin-5). Additionally, mutations in CNTN5 have been linked to hypersensitivity to sounds (hyperacusis) and changes in wave latency within the auditory pathway in ASD patients (OguroAndo2017A).

Beyond ASD, CNTN5 has been associated with other neuropsychiatric traits, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa, and substance abuse (Kleijer2015Contactin-5). Variants in CNTN5 have also been implicated in anorexia nervosa, with a significant association found in a study involving 340 patients (OguroAndo2017A). In transgenic mice, alterations in CNTN5 expression have been linked to changes in body weight, fat metabolism, and cardiovascular function, suggesting potential impacts on internal organs and physiological systems (Smirnov2017Morphophysiological). These findings highlight the gene's broad clinical significance in various disorders.

## Interactions
CNTN5, a member of the contactin family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for neurodevelopmental processes. It forms a cis-complex with amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) at the presynapse, potentially preventing APLP1 from forming homodimers that are involved in synaptogenesis (OguroAndo2017A). CNTN5 also interacts with CNTNAP4 on proprioceptive sensory neurons in the spinal cord, which is essential for the formation of GABApre bouton synapses. The absence of CNTNAP4 leads to reduced bouton-packing on sensory neurons, highlighting the importance of this interaction (OguroAndo2017A).

CNTN5 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (PTPRG), which is involved in signaling events through its tyrosine-specific phosphatase activity. The binding sites for PTPRG are located in the CA domain of CNTN5, specifically at the second and third immunoglobulin domains (Mercati2013Contactin). CNTN5 also interacts with NrCAM and Chl1 on GABApre interneurons, organizing GABApre synapses. Mice deficient in both NrCAM and CNTN5 show a significant reduction in GABApre boutons, suggesting a ligand-receptor relationship between NrCAM and CNTN5 (OguroAndo2017A). These interactions underscore CNTN5's role in synaptic organization and neurodevelopment.
