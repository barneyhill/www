# TBC1D3L

## Overview
TBC1D3L is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3L, which is part of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family. This family is characterized by its role in regulating intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics through its function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases. The TBC1D3L protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and vesicle transport, by modulating the activity of Rab proteins. Its precise biological functions and mechanisms of action are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in cellular growth and proliferation. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in human health and disease, particularly in the context of cancer and other proliferative disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
