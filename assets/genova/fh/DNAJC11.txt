# DNAJC11

## Overview
DNAJC11 is a gene that encodes the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C11, a mitochondrial protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. The protein is categorized as a co-chaperone and is part of the J protein family, which interacts with Hsp70 proteins to regulate ATP hydrolysis and facilitate protein folding and translocation across organelle membranes (Ioakeimidis2014A). DNAJC11 is peripherally associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane and is a component of the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial cristae morphology and integrity (Violitzi2019Mapping; Ioakeimidis2014A). The gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental importance in cellular processes, including energy production and stress response (Ioakeimidis2014A). Mutations in DNAJC11 have been linked to motor neuron pathology and lymphoid abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Ioakeimidis2014A). Additionally, alterations in circDNAJC11, a circular RNA derived from the gene, have been implicated in breast cancer progression, suggesting potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2023CircDNAJC11).

## Structure
DNAJC11 is a mitochondrial protein encoded by a nuclear gene and is part of the J protein family, which interacts with Hsp70 proteins. The human DNAJC11 protein is primarily expressed as a 63 kDa isoform and is peripherally associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (Violitzi2019Mapping; Ioakeimidis2014A). The protein contains a J domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its mitochondrial localization, and a DUF3395 domain at the C-terminus, involved in protein-protein interactions (Violitzi2019Mapping).

The J domain spans the first 79 amino acids and is essential for the protein's localization to mitochondria, as its deletion results in a ubiquitous distribution (Violitzi2019Mapping). The DUF3395 domain, located between amino acids 410 and 559, is important for mediating interactions with other proteins, although it is not necessary for mitochondrial localization (Violitzi2019Mapping).

DNAJC11 is part of a high molecular weight complex similar to mitofilin and interacts with the MICOS complex, which is involved in mitochondrial cristae formation (Xie2007The; Ioakeimidis2014A). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function.

## Function
The DNAJC11 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is part of the J protein family, also known as the Hsp40 class of co-chaperones. These proteins are involved in regulating ATP hydrolysis and facilitating various cellular processes, including protein folding, complex assembly, and translocation across organelle membranes (Ioakeimidis2014A). DNAJC11 is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental importance for cellular function (Ioakeimidis2014A). In healthy cells, DNAJC11 localizes to the periphery of the mitochondrial outer membrane and is assembled in a high molecular weight complex similar to mitofilin (Ioakeimidis2014A). It is associated with the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial cristae morphology and overall mitochondrial integrity (Ioakeimidis2014A).

The protein's role in healthy human cells involves maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, which is essential for normal cellular processes (Ioakeimidis2014A). Although the exact function of DNAJC11 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, it is suggested that the human ortholog can compensate for the depletion of the mouse gene, indicating functional redundancy between species (Ioakeimidis2014A). DNAJC11's involvement in mitochondrial processes underscores its importance in cellular energy production and stress response.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC11 gene have been linked to significant motor neuron pathology and lymphoid abnormalities. A splicing mutation in DNAJC11, identified in mice, leads to an autosomal recessive phenotype characterized by motor dysfunction and blood/lymphoid abnormalities. This mutation causes severe vacuolation of motor neurons, similar to that observed in mouse models of familial ALS with mutant SOD1 alleles, suggesting a potential common mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction (Ioakeimidis2014A). The mutation results in cristae disorganization within mitochondria, contributing to motor neuron degeneration and associated symptoms such as muscle weakness, spasticity, and early lethality (Ioakeimidis2014A).

In breast cancer, alterations in the expression of circDNAJC11, a circular RNA derived from the DNAJC11 gene, have been implicated in disease progression. Overexpression of circDNAJC11 enhances breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by interacting with TAF15 to stabilize MAPK6 mRNA, thereby activating the MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction promotes tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that circDNAJC11 could serve as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer (Wang2023CircDNAJC11).

## Interactions
DNAJC11 is involved in several interactions within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, particularly as part of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex. It interacts with key components of the MICOS complex, such as mitofilin, CHCHD3, CHCHD6, and SAM50, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Ioakeimidis2014A). Despite its interactions, DNAJC11 does not directly affect the levels of mitofilin and CHCHD3, although SAM50 depletion leads to a mild reduction in DNAJC11 levels, indicating a more direct role of SAM50 in maintaining DNAJC11 protein levels (Ioakeimidis2014A).

DNAJC11 is also part of a large complex with mitofilin and SAM50, resembling the MIB complex, suggesting its presence in the same mitochondrial complex with these proteins (Ioakeimidis2014A). The protein is speculated to function as a recruitment or stability factor for other MICOS proteins, although its depletion does not alter the levels of mitofilin or CHCHD3, leaving the functional relationship with the MICOS complex somewhat unclear (Ioakeimidis2014A). DNAJC11's interactions are further complicated by the presence of multiple isoforms, which may interact with different protein complexes (Ioakeimidis2014A).
