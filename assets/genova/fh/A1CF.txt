# A1CF

## Overview
The A1CF gene encodes the APOBEC1 complementation factor, a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing and metabolism. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a unique C-terminal auxiliary domain, which are essential for its function in RNA binding and mRNA editing (Zhou2016EIYMNVPV). A1CF is primarily expressed in metabolically active tissues, such as the liver, where it influences the splicing of key metabolic enzymes, thereby regulating fructose and glycerol metabolism (Nikolaou2019The). Although initially thought to be essential for APOBEC1-mediated RNA editing, recent studies suggest that A1CF's primary functions may lie in other aspects of RNA regulation, such as mRNA stability and subcellular localization (Snyder2017APOBEC1). The protein's dynamic subcellular localization, shifting between the nucleus and cytosol, underscores its role in mediating hepatic responses to nutritional and hormonal stimuli (Nikolaou2019The).

## Structure
The A1CF (APOBEC1 complementation factor) protein is involved in RNA editing and mRNA stabilization. It contains three non-identical RNA recognition motifs (RRM) in its N-terminus, which are essential for its RNA binding and mRNA editing functions (Zhou2016EIYMNVPV). The protein also features a unique C-terminal auxiliary domain, contributing to its functional capabilities (Zhou2016EIYMNVPV).

A1CF has two transcriptional variants, A1CF64 and A1CF65, which differ by the presence of an eight-amino acid motif, EIYMNVPV. This motif is part of a nuclear localization signal termed the A1CF-specific nuclear signal (ASN), spanning the 331-402 amino acid region, and is crucial for the nuclear translocation of A1CF (Zhou2016EIYMNVPV). The absence of this motif results in the A1CF (-8aa) isoform, which is distributed in the cytoplasm and can promote cell proliferation by upregulating IL-6 mRNA (Zhou2016EIYMNVPV).

The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Zhou2016EIYMNVPV). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of A1CF, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The A1CF (APOBEC1 complementation factor) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing and metabolism in human cells. A1CF is primarily expressed in metabolically active tissues, with the highest levels in the liver, where it regulates hepatic fructose and glycerol metabolism through alternative RNA splicing (Nikolaou2019The). It acts as a hepatocyte-specific alternative splicing factor, influencing the splicing of key metabolic enzymes such as ketohexokinase (KHK) and glycerol kinase (GK), which are crucial for fructose and glycerol metabolism, respectively (Nikolaou2019The).

A1CF's subcellular localization is dynamic, shifting between the nucleus and cytosol in response to metabolic and hormonal conditions, such as fasting and feeding. This suggests its role in mediating hepatic responses to nutritional and hormonal stimuli (Nikolaou2019The). Although A1CF was initially thought to be essential for APOBEC1-mediated C-to-U RNA editing, recent studies have shown that it is not required for this process in vivo, indicating that its primary functions may lie in other aspects of RNA regulation, such as mRNA stability and subcellular localization (Snyder2017APOBEC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the A1CF gene, particularly the G398S missense variant, have been associated with increased levels of blood triglycerides and total cholesterol, contributing to a heightened risk of coronary artery disease (Xu2020Interactomics). This mutation leads to enhanced secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver, which is a key factor in the development of hyperlipidemia in carriers (Xu2020Interactomics). The G398S mutation is considered a gain-of-function variant in lipid metabolism regulation, similar to other mutations like the D374Y mutation in PCSK9, which is linked to hypercholesterolemia (Xu2020Interactomics).

Alterations in A1CF expression levels also impact cellular lipid metabolism. Increased expression of wild-type A1CF up-regulates genes involved in sterol, steroid, and cholesterol biosynthesis, while down-regulating genes in TNF and NF-kappa B signaling pathways (Xu2020Interactomics). In contrast, the mutant A1CF up-regulates pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, enhancing cellular transport activities, including VLDL secretion (Xu2020Interactomics). These changes in gene expression and protein interactions due to A1CF mutations or altered expression levels can lead to metabolic disorders and conditions involving lipid dysregulation (Xu2020Interactomics).

## Interactions
A1CF (APOBEC1 complementation factor) is known for its role in RNA editing, particularly in the C-to-U conversion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) RNA. It interacts with APOBEC1, a cytidine deaminase, to form a multicomponent holoenzyme complex essential for RNA editing. A1CF contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that are crucial for binding apoB RNA and interacting with APOBEC1, with the NH2-terminal 380 residues being particularly important for these interactions (Blanc2001Mutagenesis).

A1CF also interacts with the NF-κB-repressing factor (NKRF) in renal carcinoma cells. This interaction is independent of RNA and DNA and involves the RRM1 domain of A1CF and the p65 binding motif of NKRF. A1CF's binding to NKRF affects the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 and the expression of IFN-β, influencing the NF-κB signaling pathway (Liu2024A1CF).

In addition to its role in RNA editing, A1CF is involved in pre-mRNA processing and translation, interacting with both nuclear and cytosolic translation machineries. It shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitated by transport proteins like transportin 2 and CRM1 (Xu2020Interactomics).
