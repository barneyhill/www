# RPP25

## Overview
RPP25 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease P and MRP subunit p25, a protein integral to the function of the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes. These complexes are crucial for RNA processing, with RNase P involved in the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules and RNase MRP participating in precursor rRNA processing and mitochondrial DNA replication. The RPP25 protein is characterized by its Alba domain, which facilitates nucleic acid binding, and it forms a heterodimer with RPP20, enhancing the stability and function of these complexes. This interaction is essential for the proper localization and activity of the RNase P and MRP complexes within the nucleolus. Clinically, alterations in RPP25 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Reiner2011RNA; Tian2021Prognostic; Welting2006Heterodimerization).

## Structure
The RPP25 protein is a component of the ribonuclease P and MRP complexes, characterized by its Alba domain, which is a DNA/RNA-binding domain prevalent across various species (Jaiganesh2024Sequence). The primary structure of RPP25 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the Alba domain, which is known for its ability to bind nucleic acids through cationic amino acid residues interacting with the sugar phosphates in the DNA or RNA backbone (Jaiganesh2024Sequence).

The secondary structure of RPP25 is defined by the classic Alba fold, consisting of a short N-terminal β-sheet followed by an α-helix, a second β-sheet, another α-helix, and two elongated β-sheets at the C-terminus joined by a flexible loop (Jaiganesh2024Sequence). The tertiary structure of RPP25 involves a highly electropositive pocket likely corresponding to the nucleic acid binding site (Jaiganesh2024Sequence).

In terms of quaternary structure, RPP25 forms a heterodimer with RPP20, adopting a dimeric conformation similar to that seen in archaeal Alba proteins (Yin2021Crystal). This dimerization is crucial for its function in the RNase P and MRP complexes, facilitating interactions with the P3 domain of the RMRP RNA (Yin2021Crystal).

## Function
RPP25 is a protein subunit of the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes, which are essential for RNA processing in human cells. RNase P is involved in the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules, while RNase MRP participates in the processing of precursor rRNA and mitochondrial DNA replication (Welting2006Heterodimerization). RPP25 forms a heterodimer with Rpp20, which is crucial for the stability and function of these complexes. This heterodimerization enhances the interaction with the P3 domain of RNase MRP RNA, facilitating RNA-binding activity and subcellular localization, particularly in the nucleolus (Welting2006Heterodimerization).

The Rpp20-Rpp25 heterodimer is essential for the proper localization of these proteins within the nucleolus, where they contribute to the late processing of pre-rRNA and ribosome assembly (Welting2006Heterodimerization). RPP25 also plays a role in the structural and functional integrity of RNase P by interacting with H1 RNA, a component of the complex, and potentially influencing RNA folding and processing (Reiner2011RNA). The interaction of RPP25 with RNase P and RNase MRP is crucial for the endonucleolytic activities of these enzymes, impacting RNA cleavage and processing in healthy human cells (Welting2006Heterodimerization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the RPP25 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung carcinoids, RPP25 is significantly upregulated in cases with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Swarts2013An). In cutaneous melanoma, RPP25 is part of a prognostic signature based on RNA-binding proteins, which can classify patients into different risk subgroups with distinct prognoses. This signature indicates that high expression levels of RPP25 are associated with lower overall survival (Tian2021Prognostic). RPP25 is also upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, where it may promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, further implicating its role in cancer progression (Tian2021Prognostic).

The interaction between RPP25 and its paralog RPP25L is crucial, as the loss of RPP25L is correlated with low expression of RPP25. This interaction suggests functional redundancy, which could be exploited in therapeutic strategies for cancers where one paralog is lost, making tumor cells dependent on the other (Köferle2021Interrogation). The study of these interactions and expression patterns highlights the potential clinical significance of RPP25 in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
RPP25 is a protein subunit involved in the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes, which are essential for RNA processing. It forms a heterodimer with RPP20, another protein subunit, and this interaction is crucial for its function. The RPP20-RPP25 heterodimer binds to the P3 domain of RNase MRP RNA, enhancing the binding affinity and stability of the complex. This interaction is resistant to high salt concentrations and nonionic detergents, indicating a strong and stable association (Yin2021Crystal; Welting2006Heterodimerization).

The heterodimerization of RPP25 with RPP20 is essential for their proper localization within the cell, particularly in the nucleoli, and for their codependent expression levels. This interaction regulates their RNA-binding activity and subcellular localization, suggesting a significant role in the function of RNase MRP and RNase P (Welting2006Heterodimerization).

RPP25 also interacts with the RNA subunit of RNase P, known as H1 RNA. The presence of RPP20 enhances RPP25's binding affinity to H1 RNA, forming functional complexes that are crucial for the catalytic activity of RNase P (Reiner2011RNA; GUERRIERTAKADA2002Purification).
