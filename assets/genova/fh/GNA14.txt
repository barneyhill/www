# GNA14

## Overview
GNA14 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha 14, a member of the Gαq/11 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in intracellular signaling by acting as a molecular switch in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways. Upon activation, G protein subunit alpha 14 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP, triggering downstream signaling cascades such as the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, which is vital for calcium mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation (Hubbard2006Cell; Wettschureck2005Mammalian). The protein is characterized by its structural flexibility, attributed to intrinsically disordered regions, which contribute to its multifunctionality (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). GNA14 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, lung, and liver, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Hubbard2006Cell). Mutations in GNA14 have been linked to vascular tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis and potential as a diagnostic marker (Lim2016GNA14; Jansen2021GNA14).

## Structure
The GNA14 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha 14, which is part of the Gq family involved in intracellular signaling. The protein consists of 355 amino acids and has a predicted disorder rate of 23.1%, indicating the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs) within its sequence (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). These disordered regions are primarily located at the N-terminal and are characteristic of the Gα q family, contributing to the protein's structural flexibility and multifunctionality (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNA14 shares high sequence homology with other members of the Gq family, such as GNA11 and GNAQ, particularly in the GTPase domain, which is crucial for its function (Lim2016GNA14). This domain is involved in the exchange of GDP for GTP, a key step in activating downstream signaling pathways like MAPK. Mutations in GNA14, such as p.Gln205Leu and p.Arg179Cys, affect residues important for stabilizing the interaction with GTP, leading to constitutive activation of the protein (Lim2016GNA14).

The protein's structure allows it to form a heterotrimer with Gβ and Gγ subunits, which is essential for its role in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Lim2016GNA14). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
GNA14 encodes the G protein subunit alpha 14, a member of the Gαq/11 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins. This protein is involved in signal transduction processes initiated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), linking them to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms. This activation stimulates inositol lipid signaling pathways, which are crucial for calcium mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation (Hubbard2006Cell; Wettschureck2005Mammalian).

GNA14 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver, testis, and bone marrow adherent stromal cells, suggesting tissue-specific signaling functions (Hubbard2006Cell). In endothelial cells, GNA14 modulates responses to growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), affecting cell migration, proliferation, and barrier function (Zou2018G).

The protein also plays a role in regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In vascular smooth muscle cells, activated GNA14 is associated with caspase activation and apoptosis, indicating its involvement in cell death pathways (Hubbard2006Cell). These diverse roles highlight the complexity and specificity of GNA14's function in cellular signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNA14 gene have been implicated in various vascular tumors. Somatic mutations, particularly the c.614A>T (p.Gln205Leu) mutation, are associated with benign vascular tumors such as cherry hemangiomas, tufted angiomas, and lobular capillary hemangiomas. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, contributing to tumor development (Lim2016GNA14; Liau2019High). GNA14 mutations are frequent in benign cutaneous vascular tumors but are absent in malignant forms like angiosarcomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, suggesting their potential diagnostic value in distinguishing between benign and malignant vascular tumors (Jansen2021GNA14).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GNA14 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often downregulated in HCC, particularly in cases related to hepatitis B virus infection. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation and metastasis. The hypermethylation of the GNA14 promoter, influenced by the HBV-encoded X protein, is a key mechanism for its reduced expression. GNA14's interaction with proteins like RACK1 and JMJD6 further elucidates its role in inhibiting cancer progression by modulating signaling pathways such as MAPK/JNK and PI3K/AKT (Song2021Hypermethylation; Xu2021GNA14’s).

## Interactions
GNA14, a member of the Gαq subfamily, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GNA14 interacts with the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1). This interaction inhibits the proliferation of liver cancer cells by modulating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/JNK signaling pathways. GNA14 competes with protein kinase C (PKC) for binding to RACK1, which leads to the inhibition of PKC activity and its subsequent degradation in certain cell lines (Xu2021GNA14’s).

In the context of melanopsin signaling in retinal ganglion cells, GNA14 can couple with melanopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor, alongside other G protein subunits like Gnaq and Gna11. This interaction is part of the signaling cascade that activates phospholipase C (PLC) and downstream TRP ion channels, contributing to non-image forming responses to light (Hughes2014Using).

GNA14 also plays a role in endothelial cell responses to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). It mediates cellular responses by influencing the phosphorylation of phospholipase C-β3 (PLCβ3) at specific sites, affecting cell migration and monolayer integrity (Zou2018G).
