# ACSL1

## Overview
The ACSL1 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1, which is a critical component of lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the acyl-CoA synthetase family and is responsible for the activation of long-chain fatty acids by converting them into fatty acyl-CoA esters, a necessary step for their subsequent metabolic processing within cells (Phillips2010Genenutrient; Mashek2007LongChain). The ACSL1 protein is characterized by its ATP/AMP-binding and long-chain fatty acid-binding domains, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Soupene2008Mammalian). It is predominantly expressed in energy-demanding tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, where it plays a significant role in fatty acid uptake, triacylglycerol synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation (Goldenberg2016Acyl; Roelands2019LongChain). The regulation of ACSL1 is influenced by various transcription factors and hormonal changes, reflecting its involvement in diverse metabolic pathways and its potential impact on metabolic disorders and cancer (Phillips2010Genenutrient; Mashek2007LongChain).

## Structure
The ACSL1 protein in humans is composed of 698 amino acids and is involved in the conversion of free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters. The protein structure includes an ATP/AMP-binding domain and a long-chain fatty acid-binding domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Soupene2008Mammalian). ACSL1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that affect its function and substrate interaction. In humans, three spliced isoforms have been identified, which include variations in the 'fatty acid Gate-domain' (Soupene2008Mammalian). This domain is essential for controlling the access of fatty acid substrates to the enzyme's catalytic site and determining substrate specificity.

The protein is predicted to have a single transmembrane segment at the N-terminus, suggesting its integration into the membrane (Dykstra2021Mouse). The structural understanding of ACSL1 is largely derived from bacterial homologues, which show a two-domain structure with a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain (Dykstra2021Mouse). The catalytic mechanism involves the formation of an acyl-AMP intermediate and subsequent binding of CoA (Dykstra2021Mouse). The protein is active as a monomer, which is significant for its function in fatty acid metabolism (Dykstra2021Mouse).

## Function
The ACSL1 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters. This conversion is essential for the activation of fatty acids, enabling their subsequent metabolism within cells (Phillips2010Genenutrient; Mashek2007LongChain). ACSL1 is highly expressed in energy-metabolizing tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, where it facilitates the uptake and intracellular trafficking of long-chain fatty acids (Goldenberg2016Acyl; Phillips2010Genenutrient).

In the liver, ACSL1 is involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, while in adipose tissue, it is associated with increased lipid content and insulin sensitivity (Roelands2019LongChain). The enzyme is also implicated in the regulation of fatty acid uptake through a mechanism known as "metabolic trapping," which involves the esterification of fatty acids to acyl-CoA, thereby reducing free fatty acid concentrations and enhancing uptake (Goldenberg2016Acyl).

ACSL1's activity is regulated by transcription factors such as PPAR-α in the liver and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, indicating its role in different metabolic pathways depending on the tissue type (Phillips2010Genenutrient). The enzyme's function is also influenced by hormonal changes, such as insulin in adipose tissue, which affects lipid metabolism and storage (Mashek2007LongChain).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACSL1 gene are associated with various metabolic and cancer-related conditions. In cancer, ACSL1 expression is upregulated in colorectal and breast cancers, where it acts as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and migration. High ACSL1 expression in these cancers correlates with poor survival outcomes (Chen2016Systematic; Tang2018Fatty). Conversely, in lung cancer, ACSL1 functions as a tumor suppressor, with higher expression linked to better survival rates (Chen2016Systematic; Ma2024The).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ACSL1 expression is downregulated, and this reduction is associated with higher clinical stages and poorer prognosis. DNA methylation and m6A modifications are implicated in the downregulation of ACSL1 in ccRCC, suggesting a role in tumor progression and as a potential prognostic biomarker (Yang2023The).

In breast cancer, the hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) upregulates ACSL1 expression through the transcription factor Sp1, contributing to cancer development (Wang2017HBXIP). These findings highlight the complex role of ACSL1 in cancer, where its expression and function can vary significantly across different cancer types.

## Interactions
ACSL1 (acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism. It interacts with ER-peroxisomal tethering proteins such as ACBD5 and VAPB, which facilitate lipid exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes (Young2018Longchain). ACSL1 also forms a complex with the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2, which is involved in the oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids like phytanic acid (Young2018Longchain). 

In adipocytes, ACSL1 interacts with fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), forming an oligomeric complex that is crucial for the efficient uptake and esterification of long-chain fatty acids. This interaction is constitutive and remains stable even under conditions that alter fatty acid uptake, such as insulin or isoproterenol treatment (Richards2006Fatty). 

ACSL1 also interacts with ceramide synthase isoforms CerS2 and CerS5, which are involved in ceramide synthesis, and with SNARE proteins like SNAP23 and VAMP4, suggesting a role in lipid droplet fusion and membrane docking dynamics (Young2018Longchain). These interactions highlight ACSL1's involvement in directing fatty acids into specific metabolic pathways and maintaining lipid homeostasis.
