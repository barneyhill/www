# BTD

## Overview
The BTD gene encodes the enzyme biotinidase, a crucial component in the recycling of biotin, a water-soluble B-vitamin essential for various metabolic processes. Biotinidase is a monomeric sialylated glycoprotein that functions primarily by cleaving biotin from biocytin and protein-bound sources, thereby releasing free biotin necessary for the activity of several carboxylases involved in key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid catabolism (Borsatto2019Effect; Hymes2001Mutations). The enzyme is predominantly found in serum, kidney, liver, and certain brain regions, and is characterized by its high glycosylation, which influences its molecular mass and localization (Kannan2022A). Mutations in the BTD gene can lead to biotinidase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder with significant clinical implications, including neurological and cutaneous symptoms (Canda2018Single; Wiltink2016Neonatal). Early diagnosis and treatment with biotin supplementation are critical for managing the condition and preventing irreversible complications (Geng2021Two).

## Structure
The BTD gene encodes the biotinidase enzyme, which consists of 543 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 56,771 Da (Hymes2001Mutations; Pindolia2010Analysis). The primary structure includes a sequence of 13 cysteine residues, one of which is located in the active site and is crucial for binding the biotinyl-carboxyl group through a thiol ester (Hymes2001Mutations; Pindolia2010Analysis). The enzyme is highly glycosylated, which increases its molecular mass to between 70 and 80 kDa (Hymes2001Mutations; Pindolia2010Analysis).

The BTD protein contains two main domains: Domain A, a nitrilase/amidase homologous domain that includes the catalytic triad of glutamate, lysine, and cysteine, and Domain B, a vanin/fhit homologous domain potentially involved in biotin binding (Pindolia2010Analysis). The structure also features a flexible region connecting these domains, which is suggested to facilitate their interaction (Pindolia2010Analysis). The enzyme's tertiary structure has been modeled based on homologous crystallized nitrilases/amidases, providing insights into its structure-function relationships (Pindolia2010Analysis). The BTD gene is known to have alternatively spliced variants, which may influence the enzyme's subcellular localization and tissue specificity (Karaca2015Detection).

## Function
The BTD gene encodes the enzyme biotinidase, which plays a crucial role in recycling biotin, a water-soluble B-vitamin essential for various metabolic processes. Biotinidase is responsible for cleaving biotin from biocytin and protein-bound sources, facilitating the release of free biotin necessary for the function of several carboxylases. These carboxylases include acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and β-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, which are involved in critical metabolic pathways such as fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid catabolism (Borsatto2019Effect; Hymes2001Mutations; Kannan2022A).

Biotinidase is a monomeric sialylated glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 68-76 kDa and is predicted to have mitochondrial and microsomal/secretory localization (Borsatto2019Effect). It is primarily found in serum, kidney, and liver, and is also present in brain regions such as the red nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cells (Kannan2022A). The enzyme's activity ensures the availability of free biotin, supporting the metabolic processes that rely on carboxylase activity, thereby maintaining normal cellular function and energy metabolism (Geng2021Two; Küry2015Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BTD gene, which encodes the enzyme biotinidase, lead to biotinidase deficiency (BD), an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the body's inability to recycle biotin, a crucial B vitamin, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms. BD is classified into two types based on enzyme activity: profound deficiency, with less than 10% of normal activity, and partial deficiency, with 10-30% activity (Canda2018Single; Wiltink2016Neonatal).

Profound biotinidase deficiency can cause severe neurological and cutaneous symptoms, including seizures, developmental delay, hearing loss, optic atrophy, hypotonia, and skin rashes. If untreated, it may lead to irreversible complications such as sensorineural hearing loss and optic atrophy (Kannan2024Biallelic; Geng2021Two). Partial deficiency generally results in milder symptoms, which may become apparent during periods of stress (Wiltink2016Neonatal).

The BTD gene is located on chromosome 3p25 and has over 300 reported pathogenic variants, with specific mutations often correlating with the severity of the phenotype (Kannan2024Biallelic). Common mutations include p.Asp444His and p.Arg157His, which are associated with varying levels of enzyme activity deficiency (Sürücü2023A). Early diagnosis and treatment with oral biotin can effectively manage symptoms, although some complications, like hearing loss, may be irreversible (Wiltink2016Neonatal; Geng2021Two).

## Interactions
Biotinidase (BTD) is primarily known for its role in recycling biotin by cleaving biocytin, but it also participates in other interactions. BTD has been suggested to act as a biotin-carrier protein and a biotinyl-transferase, capable of biotinylating specific proteins such as histones, myelin basic protein, and polylysines. This indicates a potential regulatory role in chromatin and DNA function (Wolf2005Biotinidase:). The enzyme can catalyze the covalent binding of biotin to histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, with biotinylation increasing during cell proliferation, suggesting involvement in transcription, replication, or DNA repair (Stanley2001Biotinylation).

BTD's ability to bind biotin noncovalently suggests it may transport biotin into cells, potentially through interactions with cell membrane receptors. Its high sialylation might facilitate interaction with galactose receptors, leading to internalization and subsequent biotin release or transfer within the cell (Wolf2005Biotinidase:). Despite these interactions, the exact physiological functions and specific interactions of BTD with other proteins or nucleic acids remain unclear, as studies have not detailed direct interactions beyond its role in histone biotinylation (Gravel2005Molecular; Peters2002Exposure).
