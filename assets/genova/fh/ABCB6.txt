# ABCB6

## Overview
ABCB6 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 6 (Langereis blood group) protein, which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein functions as a transmembrane transporter, primarily involved in the ATP-dependent transport of porphyrins, which are precursors in heme biosynthesis, across cellular membranes (Ulrich2012ATPdependent). ABCB6 is predominantly localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane but is also found in other cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane and endolysosomal system (BoswellCasteel2017ABCB6). The protein plays a significant role in cellular processes including oxidative stress protection, detoxification, and drug resistance, and is implicated in various clinical conditions such as familial pseudohyperkalemia and ocular coloboma (Andolfo2012Missense; Szakács2015Inborn). Additionally, alterations in ABCB6 expression have been associated with certain cancers, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression (BoswellCasteel2017ABCB6).

## Structure
The human ABCB6 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically the B subfamily. It functions as a half-transporter, requiring homodimerization to be active. The primary structure of ABCB6 consists of 842 amino acids, forming a single pair of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Song2021Molecular; Wang2020Cryo‐electron). The TMDs typically include 11 transmembrane helices, with the TMD0 domain predicted to be formed by TMs 1-5, flanking the core region symmetrically (Wang2020Cryo‐electron).

The secondary structure of ABCB6 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the NBDs containing characteristic motifs, Walker A and Walker B, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Song2021Molecular). The tertiary structure reveals an inward-facing conformation in the apo-state, with a unique substrate-binding cavity divided into two parts by a 'plug' sequence, crucial for maintaining the apo-form conformation (Song2021Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, ABCB6 forms a homodimer, with each subunit contributing to the overall transporter function. The protein's structure is characterized by an elongated shape with the NBDs separated by approximately 35 Å (Song2021Molecular). The TMD features a domain-swapped conformation between two monomers, a characteristic of B-family exporters (Song2021Molecular). The TMD0 domains are more flexible compared to those in the ABCC subfamily, due to the absence of a lasso motif (Wang2020Cryo‐electron).

## Function
The ABCB6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, which plays a crucial role in the transport of porphyrins, essential precursors in heme biosynthesis, into mitochondria. This transport is ATP-dependent and is vital for maintaining heme production, particularly under stress conditions (Ulrich2012ATPdependent). ABCB6 is primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, but it can also be found in the plasma membrane, Golgi, ER, and endolysosomal system (BoswellCasteel2017ABCB6). In mitochondria, ABCB6 facilitates the import of coproporphyrinogen III, a critical step in heme synthesis, by coupling ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport (Chavan2013Efficient).

ABCB6 also plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by promoting increased intracellular heme concentrations, which support catalase activity, an enzyme that reduces reactive oxygen species (BoswellCasteel2017ABCB6). The protein's function extends to influencing cellular processes like detoxification and drug resistance, impacting organismal outcomes such as blood group antigen expression and cellular metabolism (Paterson2007Human). Its expression is linked to increased drug resistance in various cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in multidrug resistance (Paterson2007Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCB6 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. One notable condition is familial pseudohyperkalemia, a disorder characterized by increased serum potassium levels in stored blood. This condition is linked to specific missense mutations in the ABCB6 gene, such as those at residue 375, which affect the protein's structure and function, leading to altered cation permeability in red blood cells (Andolfo2016Functional; Andolfo2012Missense).

ABCB6 mutations are also implicated in ocular coloboma, a developmental defect of the eye. These mutations are found in retinal pigment epithelial cells and are associated with microphthalmia with coloboma, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Szakács2015Inborn). Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria, a pigmentary disorder, is another condition linked to ABCB6 mutations, which result in abnormal melanosome patterns (Szakács2015Inborn).

Alterations in ABCB6 expression levels have been observed in certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma, where increased expression may contribute to tumor survival and progression (BoswellCasteel2017ABCB6). The gene's dysfunction can also exacerbate porphyria, a group of disorders affecting heme biosynthesis, by increasing porphyrin accumulation and liver damage (BoswellCasteel2017ABCB6).

## Interactions
ABCB6 is known to form homodimers, which are crucial for its function. This dimerization has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization assays, indicating that ABCB6 can interact with itself to form functional complexes (Kim2018NTerminal). The N-terminal extension (NTE) and C-terminal domains of ABCB6 are essential for these protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal region, particularly a 43 amino acid segment beyond the Walker A ATPase motif, is critical for the protein's ability to interact with itself and confer cadmium resistance (Kim2018NTerminal).

In human cells, ABCB6 has been shown to form dimers, as verified by co-immunoprecipitation of tagged ABCB6 variants in HeLa cells. This suggests that the N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD 0) is not required for dimerization (Kiss2015Role). The protein's ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP is not dependent on the first 205 amino acids, indicating that these regions are not essential for its basic functional interactions (Kiss2015Role).

These interactions are significant for ABCB6's role in cellular processes, including its involvement in cadmium detoxification and its localization to specific cellular compartments, such as endo-lysosomal compartments and the plasma membrane (Kiss2015Role; Kim2018NTerminal).
