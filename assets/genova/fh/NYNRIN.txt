# NYNRIN

## Overview
NYNRIN is a gene that encodes the NYN domain and retroviral integrase containing protein, which is characterized by its involvement in RNA processing and potential viral repression. The protein is notable for its complex structure, which includes a PIN-like domain, RNase H and integrase domains, and a zinc finger motif, suggesting roles in transcriptional repression and DNA recognition (Keightley2017The; Gobert2019Involvement). Functionally, NYNRIN is implicated in critical biological processes such as trophoblast invasion during placental development and has been associated with various cancer types, where it may act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Plianchaisuk2022Origination; Leonard2021Comprehensive). Despite its significant roles, the precise molecular mechanisms of NYNRIN remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its broader biological implications (Plianchaisuk2022Origination).

## Structure
The NYNRIN protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a PIN-like domain fused to retroviral RNase H and integrase domains, which are integral to its function in RNA processing and potential viral repression (Gobert2019Involvement). Upstream of the RNase domain, there is a domain with similarities to atrophin or UL36 of herpes viruses, which may be involved in de-ubiquitinylation processes (Gobert2019Involvement). The protein also harbors KH domains and an RNase domain similar to Regnase-1, along with an RNase H-like domain and an integrase zinc-binding domain, suggesting a role in the degradation of viral RNAs (Mino2021Regnase‐1–related).

The NYNRIN protein shares a zinc finger motif similar to that found in Zbtb11, which is crucial for transcriptional repression and DNA recognition, potentially including viral DNA (Keightley2017The). This motif is part of the integrase-like HHCC zinc finger domain, which is conserved across vertebrate species, indicating its importance in cellular functions (Keightley2017The). The precise molecular function of NYNRIN remains not fully elucidated, but its structural components suggest significant roles in RNA and DNA interactions.

## Function
The NYNRIN gene, derived from LTR retroelements, plays a significant role in trophoblast invasion, a process crucial for placental development in therian mammals. This gene is involved in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix remodeling, both essential for cell invasion. Knockdown studies in HTR8/SVneo cells have shown that NYNRIN knockdown significantly reduces the proportion of invasive cells, indicating its role in promoting trophoblast invasion (Plianchaisuk2022Origination). 

NYNRIN is expressed in trophoblast-lineage cells within human placental tissues, such as cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and extravillous trophoblasts, but not in the mesenchymal core of placental villi or decidual stromal cells. This specific localization supports its involvement in placental development (Plianchaisuk2022Origination). The gene's function may be linked to its unique domain architecture, which includes RNase H and integrase (INT) domains, potentially interacting with host proteins to influence ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Plianchaisuk2022Origination).

Despite its significant role in placental development, the exact molecular mechanisms by which NYNRIN functions in healthy human cells remain unclear, necessitating further research to elucidate its broader biological roles (Plianchaisuk2022Origination).

## Clinical Significance
NYNRIN has been implicated in various cancers, with its role differing depending on the type of cancer. In melanoma, NYNRIN is associated with metastasis suppression. Studies have shown that higher expression levels of NYNRIN correlate with increased survival rates in melanoma patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and a marker of survival. Knockdown of NYNRIN in melanoma cells leads to increased cell invasion, indicating its role in suppressing metastasis (Leonard2021Comprehensive).

In contrast, NYNRIN has been linked to poor survival in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) as part of a 10-gene expression signature, suggesting a tumor-promoting function in this context (Leonard2021Comprehensive). 

In Wilms tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, NYNRIN-inactivating mutations are enriched, indicating a potential tumor suppressor activity. Germline variants of NYNRIN have been identified in patients with bilateral Wilms tumor, suggesting a predisposition to this cancer when biallelic truncating variants are present (Murphy2023Genetic; Stoltze2023Germline). These findings highlight the complex role of NYNRIN in cancer, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
NYNRIN is a protein that contains a NYN domain and a retroviral integrase domain, suggesting its involvement in interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins. Although the precise molecular interactions of NYNRIN are not fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to play a role in the repression of viral expression and response to mechanical stress in tissues (Gobert2019Involvement). 

In the context of viral interactions, NYNRIN has been identified to bind to the Ubl1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 protein. This interaction involves a specific peptide sequence from NYNRIN, which adopts an alpha helical conformation upon binding. The binding affinity of this interaction was confirmed through mutational analysis, highlighting the potential of targeting these interactions for antiviral strategies (Mihalič2023Identification).

NYNRIN is also associated with metastasis suppression in melanoma, where its knockdown increases cell invasion, suggesting it may interact with other proteins to suppress metastatic processes (Leonard2021Comprehensive). However, specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed. The protein's involvement in RNA processing and potential interactions with viral RNAs are suggested by its structural similarity to other RNases involved in immune regulation (Mino2021Regnase‐1–related).
