# LSM4

## Overview
LSM4 is a gene that encodes the LSM4 protein, a member of the Lsm (Like Sm) protein family, which is integral to RNA processing and metabolism. The LSM4 protein is characterized by its Sm-like domain, which facilitates its role in RNA binding and processing. It is a crucial component of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes, which are involved in mRNA degradation and pre-mRNA splicing, respectively. These complexes form ring structures that are essential for RNA metabolism, highlighting the protein's significance in maintaining RNA stability and turnover. LSM4 is involved in the formation of the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, playing a vital role in pre-mRNA splicing and ensuring the production of functional mRNA molecules. Additionally, LSM4's interactions with other proteins and its post-translational modifications, such as arginine methylation, underscore its importance in cellular processes and its potential implications in various cancers (Wu2012Crystal; Sun2022Expression; Lyons2013The).

## Structure
The LSM4 protein is characterized by a conserved Sm fold, which includes an N-terminal alpha helix followed by a twisted five-stranded beta sheet (Wu2012Crystal). The primary structure of LSM4 includes a sequence of amino acids that form this Sm-like domain, crucial for its role in RNA binding and processing (Wu2012Crystal). The secondary structure of LSM4, particularly the N-terminal region, consists of a twisted beta-sheet formed by five anti-parallel strands, although the N-terminal alpha helix is often disordered (Wu2012Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, LSM4 is part of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes, forming ring structures essential for RNA metabolism. These complexes are involved in mRNA decay and pre-mRNA splicing, respectively (Wu2012Crystal; Lyons2013The). The C-terminal region of LSM4 contains GRG repeats, which are sites for arginine methylation, a common post-translational modification that influences protein interactions (BRAHMS2001Symmetrical; Lyons2013The). This methylation is crucial for interactions with proteins such as the SMN protein, impacting RNA processing functions (BRAHMS2001Symmetrical).

## Function
LSM4 is a component of the LSM protein complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing, particularly in the splicing of U6 small nuclear RNA and the degradation of mRNA. This protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to RNA stability and turnover, essential processes for gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis (Liu2023Identification; Sun2022Expression).

In healthy human cells, LSM4 is involved in the formation of the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is critical for pre-mRNA splicing. This process is vital for the accurate removal of introns from pre-mRNA, ensuring the production of functional mRNA molecules that can be translated into proteins (Ta2021Potential). LSM4's role in RNA splicing and degradation highlights its importance in maintaining the integrity of gene expression and cellular function.

The protein's involvement in RNA metabolic processes and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis further underscores its significance in cellular biology. LSM4's activity in these processes is linked to its localization in mitochondrial structures, where it may also play a role in mitochondrial RNA processing (Ta2021Potential).

## Clinical Significance
LSM4 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, LSM4 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival. Its expression correlates with tumor cell proliferation markers and is linked to higher tumor stages and lymph node metastasis (Yin2021CENPL; Ta2021Potential). LSM4 is also hypomethylated in breast cancer tissues, contributing to its upregulation (Yin2021CENPL).

In ovarian cancer, LSM4 expression is elevated and contributes to tumor progression. It interacts with circ_0025033 and miR-184, influencing cell migration, invasion, and glycolysis metabolism (Hou2021Circ0025033). This interaction suggests a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer treatment.

LSM4 is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and skin cutaneous melanoma, where it is associated with poor overall survival (Sun2022Expression; Hou2021Circ0025033). Its role in these cancers highlights its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention. The gene's involvement in various cancer-related pathways underscores its clinical significance in oncology (Ta2021Potential).

## Interactions
The LSM4 protein is a component of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes, which are involved in mRNA degradation and RNA splicing, respectively. LSM4 interacts with other Lsm proteins, such as Lsm1, Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm5, Lsm6, Lsm7, and Lsm8, forming heptameric ring structures similar to the Sm protein complexes (Eystathioy2002Autoantibody; FromontRacine2000GenomeWide). These complexes are implicated in mRNA decapping and degradation, with LSM4 playing a crucial role in the degradation of histone mRNA by interacting with the 3′ end of the histone mRNP (Lyons2013The).

LSM4 also interacts with proteins involved in splicing, such as SmD2, Prp11, and Prp24, suggesting its involvement in the spliceosome assembly and function (FromontRacine2000GenomeWide). The protein's C-terminal extension is important for binding to the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and 3′ hExo, which are necessary for histone mRNA degradation (Lyons2013The).

Additionally, LSM4 undergoes symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues, which enhances its interaction with the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein, a process important for UsnRNP assembly and potentially linked to spinal muscular atrophy (BRAHMS2001Symmetrical).
