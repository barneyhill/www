# DPYSL3

## Overview
The DPYSL3 gene encodes the protein dihydropyrimidinase-like 3, commonly referred to as CRMP-4, which is a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family. This cytosolic phosphoprotein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a pivotal role in neurogenesis, including neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and axonal guidance. CRMP-4 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule assembly, which are essential for cell migration, neurite branching, and axonal development. Structurally, CRMP-4 forms homotetramers and heterotetramers, and its function is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The protein's interactions with cytoskeletal elements are crucial for synaptic physiology, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity. Beyond its neurological roles, alterations in DPYSL3 expression have been implicated in various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Desprez2023Contribution; Liang2023Upregulation; Chicco2023Signature).

## Structure
The DPYSL3 gene encodes the protein CRMP-4, which is part of the collapsin response mediator protein family. The primary structure of CRMP-4 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the DPYSL3 gene. Its secondary structure includes several alpha helices, such as -helix 8 and -helix 11, which are involved in forming hydrogen bonds and interactions that influence oligomerization (Ponnusamy2014Crystal). The tertiary structure of CRMP-4 forms a globular shape characterized by a typical triosephosphate isomerase-like barrel fold, a common feature of the amidohydrolase domain. This domain is capped by a smaller beta-sandwich domain composed of residues from both the N-terminus and the C-terminus (Ponnusamy2014Crystal).

CRMP-4 can form homotetramers and heterotetramers as its quaternary structure, with two dimers related by crystallographic twofold symmetry (Ponnusamy2014Crystal). The C-terminal domain is crucial for its function, as it is the target of numerous post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity and interactions with cytoskeletal proteins (Desprez2023Contribution). CRMP-4 has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, including CRMP4a and a longer isoform CRMP4b (Blasco2013A).

## Function
DPYSL3, also known as collapsing response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4), is a cytosolic phosphoprotein highly expressed in the nervous system, playing a crucial role in neurogenesis, including neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and axonal guidance (Liang2023Upregulation; Blasco2013A). It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell migration and neurite branching, by bundling with F-actin filaments (Chicco2023Signature; Liang2023Upregulation). DPYSL3 interacts with tubulin to promote microtubule assembly, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and axonal development (Matsunuma2018DPYSL3).

In hippocampal neurons, DPYSL3 is part of a heterotetramer complex with DPYSL2, coordinating cytoskeleton dynamics and axonal elongation by linking microtubules and actin (Desprez2023Contribution). This protein is also involved in synaptic physiology, enhancing calcium current density and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which are crucial for neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission (Desprez2023Contribution). DPYSL3's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is vital for dendritic spine formation and maturation, impacting synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DPYSL3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DPYSL3 is upregulated and associated with metastasis, suggesting its role in cancer cell adhesion and migration by stabilizing the focal adhesion complex (Kawahara2013Quantitative). Similarly, in urothelial carcinoma (UC), high DPYSL3 expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor survival outcomes, making it a potential prognostic marker (Liang2023Upregulation). Knockdown studies in UC cell lines have shown that reducing DPYSL3 expression decreases cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in tumor aggressiveness (Liang2023Upregulation).

In neuroblastoma, DPYSL3 expression is inversely related to MYCN expression, with higher DPYSL3 levels associated with better prognosis in advanced-stage patients. This suggests a protective role against tumor progression (Chicco2023Signature). In neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD), DPYSL3 deficiency is linked to altered dendritic morphology and ASD-like phenotypes in mice, highlighting its importance in neuronal development (Desprez2023Contribution). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DPYSL3 in both cancer and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
DPYSL3, also known as CRMP4, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for neurodevelopmental processes. It forms a heterotetramer complex with DPYSL2, which is essential for regulating growth cone development and axonal elongation in vivo. This complex coordinates cytoskeleton dynamics by linking microtubules and actin, with DPYSL3 binding to actin and DPYSL2 binding to tubulin. This interaction is vital for axonal development in hippocampal neurons (Desprez2023Contribution).

DPYSL3 also plays a significant role in synaptic physiology. It interacts with the actin cytoskeleton via its C-terminal region, which is critical for spine formation and maturation in cultured hippocampal neurons. This interaction enhances the number of functional synapses and influences synaptic transmission, as evidenced by increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) upon overexpression of DPYSL3 or constructs with actin-binding domains (Desprez2023Contribution).

While DPYSL3 is involved in various cellular processes, specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's interactions are primarily with cytoskeletal and synaptic scaffolding proteins, playing a key role in synapse architecture and activity (Desprez2023Contribution).
