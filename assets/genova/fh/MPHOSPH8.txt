# MPHOSPH8

## Overview
MPHOSPH8 is a gene that encodes the M-phase phosphoprotein 8 (MPP8), a nuclear protein involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. MPP8 is a key component of the HUSH complex, which plays a significant role in transcriptional silencing, particularly of transposable elements such as LINE1, thereby maintaining genomic stability and stem cell identity (Müller2021MPP8). The protein is characterized by its chromodomain, which specifically recognizes dimethylated lysine residues, facilitating interactions with histone and DNA methyltransferases to establish repressive chromatin structures (Chang2011MPP8). MPP8's interactions with other proteins, such as DNMT3A and GLP/G9a, underscore its importance in gene silencing and cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation (Chang2011MPP8). The dysregulation of MPHOSPH8 expression has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2024miR‑576‑3pM‑phase).

## Function
MPHOSPH8, also known as M-phase phosphoprotein 8, plays a crucial role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. It is a component of the HUSH complex, which is essential for transcriptional silencing, particularly in the context of transposable elements like LINE1. In mouse embryonic stem cells, MPHOSPH8 is vital for maintaining self-renewal by repressing LINE1 elements, which is crucial for preserving stem cell identity and preventing cell cycle arrest (Müller2021MPP8). The protein's C-terminal region is critical for its function, mediating the repression of LINE1 expression and ensuring the stability of the HUSH complex (Müller2021MPP8).

MPHOSPH8 interacts with DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and histone methyltransferases GLP/G9a, facilitating the formation of a repressive chromatin structure through DNA CpG methylation and H3K9 methylation. This interaction is crucial for transcriptional repression and maintaining genomic stability (Chang2011MPP8). The chromodomain of MPHOSPH8 acts as a reader domain for dimethylated lysine residues, specifically recognizing the dimethylated lysine 47 on DNMT3A, which is essential for the methylation process and the regulation of gene expression (Chang2011MPP8). MPHOSPH8 is active in the nucleus, contributing to processes like DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, impacting cellular proliferation and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MPHOSPH8 gene, which encodes the M-phase phosphoprotein 8 (MPP8), have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MPP8 is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The miR-576-3p/MPP8 axis is crucial in this process, as miR-576-3p negatively regulates MPP8 expression, and its overexpression can inhibit the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells (Zhang2024miR‑576‑3pM‑phase).

In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), MPHOSPH8 is identified as a potential biomarker due to its elevated expression. Silencing MPHOSPH8 in MTC cells results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression (LI2016Lentivirusmediated).

MPP8 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with methylated histone H3K9. In various carcinomas, MPP8 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor cell motility and invasion by repressing E-cadherin expression, a key factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Kokura2010MethylH3K9binding).

Additionally, a missense mutation in MPHOSPH8 has been recurrently identified in individuals with Ménière's disease, suggesting a potential link to auditory function, although its clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Fisch2024The).

## Interactions
MPP8, also known as MPHOSPH8, is involved in several critical protein interactions that contribute to its role in gene silencing and chromatin organization. MPP8 interacts with histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferases GLP and ESET, as well as DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. These interactions are essential for the repression of the E-cadherin gene, which is significant in tumor cell motility and invasion (Kokura2010MethylH3K9binding; Li2011Structural). MPP8 recruits DNMT3A to the E-cadherin promoter, facilitating DNA methylation, a key mechanism in gene silencing (Kokura2010MethylH3K9binding).

MPP8 also plays a role in the HUSH complex, interacting with TASOR and PPHLN1. The C-terminal region of MPP8 is crucial for its interaction with TASOR, while the N-terminal region is necessary for binding to SETDB1. These interactions are vital for the proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells in ground-state conditions (Müller2021MPP8). MPP8's chromodomain binds specifically to methylated H3K9, forming a homodimer through domain swapping interactions, which is crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and transcription repression (Li2011Structural).
