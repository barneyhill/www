# C1QTNF3

## Overview
C1QTNF3, also known as CTRP3, is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 3, a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a globular C1q domain, allowing it to form trimeric and higher-order oligomeric complexes (Wong2008Molecular). C1q and TNF related 3 is primarily expressed in adipocytes and monocytes, playing a crucial role in modulating inflammatory responses and metabolic processes (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated). It functions as an endogenous antagonist to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine release and maintaining insulin sensitivity (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated). The protein's involvement in various signaling pathways, such as MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, underscores its significance in cellular metabolism and immune regulation (Micallef2022C1QTNF3). Alterations in C1QTNF3 expression have been linked to metabolic and inflammatory conditions, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Micallef2022C1QTNF3; Li2017C1q/TNF‐Related).

## Structure
C1QTNF3, also known as CTRP3, is a protein that belongs to the C1q/TNF-related protein family. It is characterized by a modular structure that includes a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal globular C1q domain (Wong2008Molecular). The protein forms trimeric structures as its basic unit, which can further assemble into higher-order oligomeric complexes such as hexamers and high-molecular-weight oligomers through intermolecular disulfide bonding mediated by N-terminal cysteine residues (Wong2008Molecular).

CTRP3 exists in two splice variants, CTRP3A and CTRP3B, which differ in their N-terminal regions. CTRP3B has an extended N terminus due to the retention of intron 1, resulting in an additional 73 amino acids and a conserved N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-70 (Peterson2010C1q/TNF-related). This glycosylation is crucial for the protein's structure, as mutation of Asn-70 to Ala results in the absence of glycosylation (Peterson2010C1q/TNF-related). The two isoforms can form hetero-oligomeric complexes, with CTRP3A protecting CTRP3B from proteolytic cleavage (Peterson2010C1q/TNF-related).

The globular C1q domain of C1QTNF3 shares structural similarities with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homology domain, suggesting a common evolutionary origin (Ghai2007C1q). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and potentially involves post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Wong2008Molecular).

## Function
C1QTNF3, also known as C1q/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP-3), is a protein that plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses and metabolic processes in human cells. It is primarily expressed in adipocytes, monocytes, and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle tissues during development (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated; Otani2015A). CTRP-3 functions as an endogenous antagonist to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), inhibiting its binding to the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex, which is crucial in the inflammatory response to bacterial infections (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated). This inhibition reduces the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF, highlighting its anti-inflammatory properties (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated).

In adipose tissue, CTRP-3 acts as a negative regulator of the TLR4-mediated proinflammatory response, maintaining insulin sensitivity and promoting adipocyte differentiation (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated). It also influences the release of adipokines, including the induction of adiponectin and resistin, which are involved in energy metabolism and immune regulation (Kopp2010C1qTNFRelated). In skeletal muscle, CTRP-3 regulates myoblast proliferation and differentiation through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, promoting proliferation while inhibiting differentiation into myotubes (Otani2015A). These functions underscore CTRP-3's role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and modulating immune responses in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the C1QTNF3 gene, also known as CTRP3, have been implicated in various metabolic and inflammatory conditions. CTRP3 acts as an anti-inflammatory mediator and is negatively associated with proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and C-reactive protein. In animal models, CTRP3 levels decrease with diet-induced obesity, while its overexpression can reduce cytokine levels, suggesting its potential role in managing inflammation associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome (Li2017C1q/TNF‐Related).

CTRP3 is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, where it is shown to be protective in heart attack and stroke models by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and vascular relaxation. However, human studies have shown mixed results regarding CTRP3 levels and cardiovascular disease, with some indicating lower levels in patients with coronary issues (Li2017C1q/TNF‐Related).

In the context of cancer, CTRP3 is highly expressed in certain cancer cell lines, such as osteosarcoma and chondroblastoma, suggesting a potential role as a biomarker for these cancers (Li2017C1q/TNF‐Related). Its expression is upregulated in tumor-associated adipose tissue, particularly in the presence of obesity, indicating a role in the tumor microenvironment and immune response modulation (Micallef2022C1QTNF3).

## Interactions
C1QTNF3, also known as CTRP3, is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family and is involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and metabolism. The protein is known to form higher-order oligomeric complexes, such as trimers and hexamers, through intermolecular disulfide bonding involving cysteine residues (Wong2008Molecular). These oligomeric structures are crucial for its function and stability.

C1QTNF3 has the potential to form hetero-oligomers with other C1q/TNF family proteins, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature (Wong2008Molecular). The protein is also involved in activating several signaling pathways, including the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which are associated with its metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects (Micallef2022C1QTNF3). These pathways are activated in a context-dependent manner, indicating that C1QTNF3's interactions may vary based on the cellular environment and physiological state.

Potential receptors for C1QTNF3 include lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, lysosome membrane protein 2, and adiponectin receptor 2, though their significance in mediating C1QTNF3's effects remains largely unknown (Micallef2022C1QTNF3).
