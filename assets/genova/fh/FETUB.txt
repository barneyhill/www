# FETUB

## Overview
FETUB is a gene that encodes the protein fetuin B, a member of the cystatin superfamily, which is primarily expressed in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. Fetuin B is characterized as a selective inhibitor of certain metalloproteinases, playing a crucial role in reproductive biology by preventing premature hardening of the zona pellucida, thus facilitating fertilization (Cuppari2019Structure; Dietzel2013FetuinB). The protein's structure includes two cystatin-like domains and a third domain with proline-rich and C-terminal subdomains, which are essential for its inhibitory function (OLIVIER2000FetuinB). Beyond its reproductive role, fetuin B is involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cell signaling, and has been implicated in conditions such as insulin resistance, cancer, and nephrotoxicity (Liu2024Delineation; Zhang2024FetuinB; Karmilin2019Mammalian).

## Structure
Fetuin-B is a member of the fetuin family, part of the cystatin superfamily, and is encoded by the FETUB gene. The protein structure of fetuin-B includes a three-domain arrangement: two cystatin-like domains (D1 and D2) and a third domain (D3) that is divided into proline-rich D3a and C-terminal D3b subdomains (OLIVIER2000FetuinB). These domains are homologous to those found in fetuin-A, although fetuin-B lacks the DPTP tetrapeptide present in fetuin-A (OLIVIER2000FetuinB).

The primary structure of fetuin-B consists of a polypeptide chain of 378 amino acids in rats, with human and mouse fetuin-Bs having similar lengths of 382 and 388 residues, respectively (OLIVIER2000FetuinB). The protein is characterized by conserved cysteine residues and a specific LETXCHXL motif, which is part of a larger fetuin signature (OLIVIER2000FetuinB).

Fetuin-B undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which does not affect its inhibitory potency against specific metalloproteinases (Karmilin2019Mammalian). The protein's cystatin-like domains are crucial for its function as a selective inhibitor of certain metalloproteinases, such as ovastacin and meprin (Karmilin2019Mammalian). The tertiary structure is compact and globular, typical of cystatin superfamily proteins, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not well-defined.

## Function
Fetuin B (FETUB) is a liver-derived plasma protein that plays a crucial role in reproductive biology, particularly in the process of fertilization. It functions as a selective inhibitor of metallopeptidases, specifically targeting ovastacin, a protease involved in the hardening of the zona pellucida (ZP), a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the oocyte. By inhibiting ovastacin, fetuin B prevents premature ZP hardening, which is essential for allowing sperm to penetrate the oocyte and achieve fertilization (Cuppari2019Structure; Dietzel2013FetuinB).

Fetuin B achieves this inhibition through a unique mechanism involving its cystatin-type modules, which form a bipartite wedge that blocks the active site of the metallopeptidase, thereby preventing its catalytic activity (Cuppari2019Structure). This function is critical for maintaining the fertilization competence of oocytes and ensuring successful reproduction (Dietzel2013FetuinB).

Beyond its role in fertility, fetuin B is involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cell signaling. It is active in extracellular spaces, where it influences cellular homeostasis and proteolytic networks, potentially impacting angiogenesis, immune defense, and extracellular matrix assembly (Karmilin2019Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FETUB gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In pediatric primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), increased levels of FETUB are linked to glucocorticoid resistance, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy (Cao2023Predicting). In the context of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), elevated serum levels of fetuin B have been observed, correlating with insulin resistance markers, indicating its potential role as a pharmacological target for treating insulin resistance and as a predictor for GDM or type 2 diabetes (Kralisch2017Regulation).

FETUB expression is also implicated in cancer. In prostate cancer, its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Ploypetch2023Comparative). In smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma, FETUB is one of the mRNAs associated with overall survival, serving as a potential prognostic marker (Zhou2019Bioinformatics). Additionally, FETUB has been identified as a significantly mutated gene in colorectal cancer, suggesting its potential role as a driver gene (Zaidi2020Landscape).

In nephrotoxicity induced by aristolochic acid I, FETUB expression changes are associated with kidney damage, highlighting its potential role in renal pathology (Liu2024Delineation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FETUB in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Fetuin B (FETUB) is known for its selective inhibitory interactions with certain metalloproteinases, particularly those of the astacin family, such as ovastacin and meprins (meprin α and meprin β). This inhibition is crucial for processes like female fertility, where FETUB prevents premature hardening of the zona pellucida by inhibiting ovastacin (Cuppari2019Structure; Karmilin2019Mammalian). The inhibition mechanism involves a 'raised-elephant-trunk' structure, where the CPDCP-trunk and hairpin I of the CY2 domain of FETUB form a wedge that blocks the active site of these metalloproteinases (Cuppari2019Structure).

FETUB also interacts with the insulin receptor-β (IRβ) in retinal cells, promoting insulin resistance. This interaction is enhanced under high-glucose conditions, typical in diabetic environments, and is more pronounced in Müller cells compared to other retinal cells (Zhang2024FetuinB). FETUB's interaction with IRβ affects the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, contributing to insulin resistance in these cells (Zhang2024FetuinB).

In KGN cells, FETUB interacts with the TGF-beta Receptor 2 (TGFR2), activating the SMAD3 signaling pathway. This interaction helps alleviate oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting FETUB's role in cellular homeostasis and protection against apoptosis (Gao2022Fetuin).
