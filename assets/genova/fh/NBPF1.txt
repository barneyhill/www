# NBPF1

## Overview
NBPF1 (Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family Member 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. The protein, NBPF member 1, is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of squamous stratified epithelia, such as the skin and cervix, where it plays a crucial role in inhibiting cell proliferation. Functioning as a tumor suppressor, NBPF member 1 induces G1 cell cycle arrest through a p53-dependent mechanism, involving the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1. This regulatory function is significant in maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, particularly in the context of neuroblastoma and other cancers where the gene's expression is often reduced (Andries2015NBPF1). The protein's interactions with key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/mTOR pathway, further underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Qin2016TumorSuppressor).

## Function
NBPF1 (Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family Member 1) is a gene implicated in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. In healthy human cells, NBPF1 is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of squamous stratified epithelia, such as the skin and cervix, where it plays a role in inhibiting cell proliferation. This expression pattern suggests that NBPF1 functions to maintain non-proliferative states in these tissues (Andries2015NBPF1).

NBPF1 exerts its effects by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest, which is mediated through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 in a p53-dependent manner. This mechanism is supported by evidence showing increased levels of p21 and nuclear accumulation of p53 in cells overexpressing NBPF1 (Andries2015NBPF1). The gene's expression is cell cycle-dependent, occurring mainly in the G1 phase and diminishing during mitosis, indicating its role in regulating cell cycle dynamics (Andries2015NBPF1).

NBPF1's function as a tumor suppressor is further suggested by its decreased expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with loss of heterozygosity for the 1p36 region, a common deletion site in various cancers (Andries2015NBPF1). This highlights its potential role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell growth.

## Clinical Significance
The NBPF1 gene has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression and genetic alterations playing significant roles in disease progression and prognosis. In neuroblastoma, NBPF1 is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is significantly lower in high-risk neuroblastoma patients, and this reduced expression is associated with poor outcomes. The gene's expression is negatively correlated with MYCN, a known biomarker for high-risk neuroblastoma, and positively correlated with overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2020NBPF1).

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), higher NBPF1 expression is linked to poorer overall survival and disease-specific survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker. The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, affecting prognosis and potentially influencing the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Li2022Oncogene).

NBPF1's role varies across different cancers. In colorectal cancer, lower NBPF1 levels are associated with worse survival, suggesting a protective role, while in liver cancer, NBPF1 promotes tumor characteristics such as colony formation and invasion (Li2022Oncogene). These findings highlight the complex and context-dependent role of NBPF1 in cancer.

## Interactions
NBPF1, a member of the Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role as a tumor suppressor. One significant interaction is with the p53 protein, where NBPF1 overexpression leads to increased nuclear accumulation of p53, which is associated with the induction of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This interaction results in G1 cell cycle arrest, highlighting NBPF1's role in cell cycle regulation through a p53-dependent mechanism (Andries2015NBPF1).

NBPF1 is also suggested to interact with MDM2, a cytoplasmic inhibitor of p53, potentially preventing MDM2's negative effects on p53, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Andries2015NBPF1). In addition, NBPF1's role in the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been noted, where its expression affects the levels of phosphorylated mTOR, PI3K, and P70, proteins involved in cell growth and survival pathways. This suggests that NBPF1 may interact with components of this pathway, influencing cell migration and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells (Qin2016TumorSuppressor).

These interactions underscore NBPF1's multifaceted role in tumor suppression and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
