# GDPD1

## Overview
GDPD1, or glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism. The protein, categorized as a glycerophosphodiesterase, plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters, contributing to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol. This enzymatic activity is essential for phospholipid remodeling and signal transduction, impacting cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and energy homeostasis. GDPD1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain the balance of lipid components crucial for cellular function and structure. Notably, alterations in GDPD1 expression have been linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder affecting vision, through mechanisms involving structural genomic variants and misexpression (de2020Structural).

## Structure


## Function
GDPD1 (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 1) is an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters to produce glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol. This enzymatic activity plays a crucial role in phospholipid remodeling and signal transduction, contributing to cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and energy homeostasis. GDPD1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in maintaining the balance of lipid components within the cell, which is essential for proper cellular function and structure.

In the context of retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder affecting the retina, GDPD1 has been implicated in disease mechanisms due to its misexpression caused by structural variants. These variants create new topologically associating domains (neo-TADs) that lead to ectopic interactions between retinal enhancers and GDPD1, resulting in its increased expression in the retina. This misexpression is suggested to contribute to retinal degeneration through a dominant gain-of-function mechanism, highlighting the importance of GDPD1's regulation in maintaining retinal health (de2020Structural). However, the specific function of GDPD1 in healthy human cells remains less well-defined in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GDPD1 gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a genetic disorder that leads to progressive vision loss and blindness. Structural variants (SVs) at the RP17 locus on chromosome 17q22 have been identified as a cause of adRP in multiple families. These SVs result in the formation of new topologically associating domains (neo-TADs) and ectopic interactions between retinal enhancers and the GDPD1 gene, leading to its misexpression. This misexpression is suggested to be a dominant gain-of-function mechanism contributing to the disease (de2020Structural).

The study highlights that GDPD1 encodes a glycerophosphodiesterase involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid. The increased expression of GDPD1 in photoreceptors is considered a convergent mechanism of adRP, with significant upregulation observed in affected individuals compared to controls (de2020Structural). These findings underscore the role of GDPD1 misexpression in the pathogenesis of adRP, emphasizing the impact of structural genomic alterations on gene expression and disease development.
