# ZMYM4

## Overview
ZMYM4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYM-type containing 4 protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by the presence of multiple MYM-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, primarily functioning within the nucleus (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4). ZMYM4 is implicated in the DNA damage response and interacts with various transcriptional regulators, including the B-MYB transcription factor, although it does not play a major role in B-MYB-dependent cell cycle control (Cibis2020Characterization). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation, which influences its interactions and stability (Cibis2020Characterization). Clinically, mutations in the ZMYM4 gene have been associated with several health conditions, including obesity, schizophrenia, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4).

## Structure
The ZMYM4 protein is characterized by the presence of nine zinc finger MYM-containing domains, which are involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4). These domains are highly conserved across species, including humans and Xenopus, and contribute to the protein's structural integrity (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4). ZMYM4 also contains a glucocorticoid-like DNA binding domain and a C-terminal DUF3504 domain, which is related to the tyrosine recombinase element of Crypton DNA transposon elements, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4).

The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, notably SUMOylation, which occurs at least at two sites within amino acids 33 to 1077. This modification affects its interaction with other proteins, such as B-MYB, particularly after DNA damage (Cibis2020Characterization). ZMYM4 is also known to interact with other zinc finger proteins like ZMYM2, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving protein complexes (Cibis2020Characterization). The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
ZMYM4 is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It contains MYM-type zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, primarily functioning within the nucleus. ZMYM4 interacts with the B-MYB transcription factor, although it does not appear to play a major role in B-MYB-dependent cell cycle control (Cibis2020Characterization). The protein is implicated in the DNA damage response, with its binding to B-MYB being enhanced following DNA damage, suggesting a role in transcription regulation during such events (Cibis2020Characterization).

ZMYM4 is also SUMOylated, a post-translational modification that may regulate its function during the cell cycle. This modification affects its molecular weight and stability, and it appears to interfere with ZMYM4's binding to B-MYB (Cibis2020Characterization). The protein interacts with other transcriptional regulators, such as RCOR1 and KDM1A, which are components of transcriptional repressor complexes, indicating its involvement in transcriptional repression (Cibis2020Characterization). Despite these interactions, the exact function of ZMYM4 in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated, as its role in cell cycle transitions and other cellular processes is not yet clearly defined (Cibis2020Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZMYM4 gene have been implicated in several human health conditions. ZMYM4 is associated with severe childhood obesity, schizophrenia, heritable substance use disorders, heritable sleep disorders, and certain cancers (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4). The gene is overexpressed in some human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a potential role in cancer development (Cibis2020Characterization). Despite its involvement in these conditions, the role of ZMYM4 in early developmental processes is not well understood, although it is abundantly expressed in craniofacial anlagen during embryogenesis (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4).

In terms of developmental impact, ZMYM4 is crucial for regulating the expression of embryonic cranial genes necessary for normal craniofacial development. Knockdown of ZMYM4 in embryos leads to altered expression of genes in the neural border, neural plate, neural crest, and preplacodal ectoderm, resulting in aberrant craniofacial cartilage morphology (Jourdeuil2023Zmym4). In mice, homozygous mutations in ZMYM4 result in pre-weaning lethality, indicating its critical role in development (Marenne2020Exome). These findings highlight the importance of ZMYM4 in both developmental and pathological contexts, with its disruption potentially leading to significant health issues.

## Interactions
ZMYM4, a MYM-type zinc finger protein, interacts with the B-MYB transcription factor. This interaction is mediated by the central domains of both proteins and is enhanced following UV-induced DNA damage, although it is not due to phosphorylation of serine residues (Cibis2020Characterization). The interaction is disrupted by specific mutations in B-MYB, indicating a precise binding mechanism (Cibis2020Characterization). ZMYM4 is also SUMOylated, which affects its binding to B-MYB, as the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an inhibitor of SUMO-specific proteases, disrupts this interaction (Cibis2020Characterization).

ZMYM4 interacts with ZMYM2, another zinc finger protein, and this interaction may be influenced by SUMOylation (Cibis2020Characterization). Mass spectrometric analysis has identified several potential ZMYM4 interaction partners, including PRR12, UBQLN4, and UBQLIN1, which are involved in various cellular processes such as neuronal development and protein degradation pathways (Cibis2020Characterization). ZMYM4 also interacts with components of transcriptional repressor complexes, such as RCOR1 (CoREST) and KDM1A (LSD1), suggesting a role in transcription regulation (Cibis2020Characterization). These interactions highlight ZMYM4's involvement in complex cellular processes, including DNA damage response and transcriptional regulation.
