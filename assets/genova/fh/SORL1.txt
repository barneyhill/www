# SORL1

## Overview
SORL1 is a gene that encodes the sortilin-related receptor 1 (SorLA), a transmembrane receptor involved in intracellular trafficking and protein sorting. SorLA is characterized by its complex mosaic structure, which includes a Vps10p domain, LDLR class A repeats, and fibronectin type III domains, among others (RoveletLecrux2021Impaired; Jacobsen2001Activation). This receptor plays a pivotal role in the endocytic and lysosomal pathways, particularly in neurons, where it regulates the trafficking of key proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor TRKB (Mishra2022The; Schmidt2016Sorting). SorLA's function is crucial for maintaining synaptic activity and neuronal health, and its dysregulation is implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology due to its influence on amyloid-beta peptide production (RoveletLecrux2021Impaired; Schmidt2016Sorting). Variants in the SORL1 gene have been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Korpioja2021Novel; Vardarajan2015Coding).

## Structure
The SORL1 gene encodes the Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SorLA), a transmembrane protein with a complex mosaic structure. SorLA is approximately 250 kDa in size and features several functional domains, including a Vps10p domain, LDLR class A repeats, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and fibronectin type III domains (RoveletLecrux2021Impaired; Jacobsen2001Activation). The Vps10p domain is a 700 amino acid module that folds into a ten-bladed β-propeller, which is a common motif among VPS10P domain receptors (Andersen2016Risk). This domain is involved in binding interactions with peptide ligands and is crucial for the protein's role in intracellular sorting processes (Jacobsen2001Activation).

SorLA undergoes post-translational modifications, including N- and O-glycosylation, which are essential for its maturation and function (RoveletLecrux2021Impaired). The protein can be subject to proteolytic shedding at the cell surface, releasing its soluble ectodomain (RoveletLecrux2021Impaired). SorLA exists as both a monomer and a dimer, with its dimerization influenced by pH conditions (Salasova2022Finding). An alternatively spliced variant, SORL1-38b, lacks several domains, resulting in a truncated and soluble receptor predominantly found in dendrites (Salasova2022Finding).

## Function
The SORL1 gene encodes the sorting receptor SORLA, which is integral to various cellular processes in healthy human cells. SORLA is involved in intracellular trafficking and sorting of proteins, particularly within the endocytic and lysosomal pathways. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of endosomal traffic and recycling, especially in neurons, where it helps maintain synaptic activity and neuronal health by trafficking neuronal cargo such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor TRKB and the glutamate receptor subunit AMPA1 (GLUA1) to synaptic plasma membranes (Mishra2022The).

SORLA also acts as an adaptor protein for the retromer complex, which is essential for the proper localization and trafficking of neuronal proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP). By shuttling APP from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network, SORLA reduces the production of amyloid-beta peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Mishra2022The; Schmidt2016Sorting). In the kidneys, SORLA regulates sodium and chloride reabsorption by controlling the phospho-regulation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) (Schmidt2016Sorting). Additionally, SORLA influences vascular health by modulating lipid metabolism and smooth muscle cell migration (Schmidt2016Sorting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SORL1 gene are significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). SORL1 encodes the SorLA protein, which is involved in the intracellular trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Variants in SORL1 can lead to impaired maturation and trafficking of SorLA, contributing to increased production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of AD pathology (RoveletLecrux2021Impaired). 

Rare SORL1 variants have been linked to both early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These variants can include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and splice variants, which may disrupt normal protein function and increase AD risk (Korpioja2021Novel; Thonberg2017Identification). For instance, the nonsense variant p.Gln290* is classified as pathogenic and is associated with EOAD in Finnish patients (Korpioja2021Novel).

The presence of SORL1 variants is associated with altered APP processing, leading to increased Aβ secretion and accumulation, which are critical factors in AD pathogenesis (Vardarajan2015Coding). Additionally, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SORL1, such as rs3824968, have been linked to changes in brain structure and increased AD risk (Huang2016Effect).

## Interactions
SORL1, or sortilin-related receptor 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence its function in intracellular trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). SORL1 interacts with the retromer complex, a key player in endosomal trafficking, to regulate the recycling of APP out of the endosome. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal function and is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (Mishra2022Pharmacologic; Mishra2022The). 

SORL1 also interacts with adaptor proteins such as GGA and PACS-1, which are involved in protein transport to and from the trans-Golgi network. These interactions help SORL1 function as a retention factor for APP, preventing its entry into amyloidogenic processing pathways (Schmidt2007SorLALR11). 

In addition to APP, SORL1 interacts with other proteins like the BDNF receptor TRKB and the glutamate receptor subunit GLUA1, affecting their trafficking and localization within neurons. These interactions are essential for synaptic function and are altered in SORL1-deficient neurons, leading to synaptic impairment (Mishra2022The). 

SORL1's interactions with these proteins underscore its role in regulating endosomal and lysosomal trafficking, with significant implications for Alzheimer's disease pathology.
