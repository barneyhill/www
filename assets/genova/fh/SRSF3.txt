# SRSF3

## Overview
SRSF3, or serine and arginine rich splicing factor 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, specifically a splicing factor known as SRp20. This protein plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, RNA export, and translation. As the smallest member of the SRSF family, SRp20 is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, which are essential for its function in recognizing splicing sites and facilitating protein-protein interactions, respectively. The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it regulates alternative splicing and is involved in various cellular processes such as transcription termination, RNA stability, and miRNA expression. SRSF3 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in preventing cellular senescence, influencing autophagy, and participating in DNA repair processes. Its dynamic phosphorylation and ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm underscore its role in mRNA export and stability, making it a significant factor in normal cellular processes and stress responses (Zhou2020Emerging; Jia2023Oncogenic).

## Structure
SRSF3, also known as SRp20, is a member of the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSFs) family and is the smallest member of this group. The protein structure of SRSF3 includes an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain. The RRM is crucial for recognizing splicing sites, while the RS domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is highly phosphorylated, facilitating the binding of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) to splicing sites (Xiong2021Biological; Schwich2021SRSF3).

The RS domain of SRSF3 is shorter than that of closely related proteins like SRSF7 and is involved in regulating splicing activity, nuclear import, subnuclear localization, and mRNA export. Phosphorylation of serine residues within the RS domain is a common post-translational modification that affects these functions (Schwich2021SRSF3). Specific serine residues, such as those at positions 108, 115, and around 124-130, are key phosphorylation sites, and mutations at these sites alter the phosphorylation pattern (Tatsuno2022Multiple).

SRSF3 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function in splicing regulation (Xiong2021Biological). The interaction of SRSF3 with other proteins, such as YTHDC1, is influenced by its phosphorylation status, although the exact relationship between phosphorylation and binding affinity is complex (Tatsuno2022Multiple).

## Function
The SRSF3 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, playing a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, RNA export, and translation. In healthy human cells, SRSF3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it participates in RNA splicing at active sites of RNA polymerase II transcription. It regulates alternative splicing by interacting with chromatin modifications and is involved in transcription termination, alternative polyadenylation, RNA export, RNA stability, and miRNA expression (Jia2023Oncogenic).

SRSF3 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, such as preventing cellular senescence, influencing autophagy, and participating in DNA repair processes, particularly homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair (More2020SRSF3:; Jia2023Oncogenic). It also plays a role in energy metabolism by affecting the splicing of the PKM gene, promoting the expression of the M2 isoform associated with glycolysis (Jia2023Oncogenic).

SRSF3's dynamic phosphorylation and ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm underscore its role in mRNA export and stability, contributing to its function in maintaining normal cellular processes and responding to stress conditions (Zhou2020Emerging; Jia2023Oncogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF3 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. SRSF3 is frequently upregulated in various tumors, including those of the thyroid, ovary, lung, colon, breast, stomach, skin, and bladder, where it acts as an oncogene. This upregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, contributing to poor prognosis and survival rates in patients (Che2020Aberrant; Zhou2020Emerging). In some cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia and renal cancer, SRSF3 is downregulated, indicating its complex role in tumorigenesis (Zhou2020Emerging).

SRSF3 also plays a role in drug resistance, as seen in ovarian tumors where its overexpression increases MRP1 mRNA splice variants, contributing to chemotherapy resistance (Zhou2020Emerging). In liver diseases, SRSF3 expression is reduced, linked to metabolic changes, hepatic fibrosis, and increased liver inflammation, which are features of early liver disease. This reduction is associated with alterations in RNA splicing of SRSF3 target genes (Kumar2019Degradation).

The gene's involvement in alternative splicing affects various cancer-related processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Che2020Aberrant).

## Interactions
SRSF3, also known as SRp20, is a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA biogenesis and processing. It primarily resides in the nucleus, where it participates in RNA splicing at active sites of RNA polymerase II transcription. SRSF3 binds to chromatin, associating with interphase chromatin through histone H3, and interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to regulate alternative splicing (Jia2023Oncogenic).

SRSF3 forms complexes with several proteins, including NXF1, the major export receptor of mRNAs, facilitating mRNA export to the cytoplasm. This interaction is mediated by an arginine-rich peptide near the RRM domain of SRSF3 (Jia2023Oncogenic). It also interacts with YTHDC1, an m6A modified RNA binding protein, to regulate exon alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (Tatsuno2022Multiple).

SRSF3 is involved in the nuclear degradation of intronless mRNAs by recruiting the RNA exosome via the NEXT complex, which includes components such as RBM7 and ZCCHC8 (Mure2018The). It also interacts with viral RNA, destabilizing it through interaction with the RNA exosome and its adaptor complex NEXT (Xiong2021Biological).
