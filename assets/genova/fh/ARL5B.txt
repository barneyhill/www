# ARL5B

## Overview
ARL5B is a gene that encodes the ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 5B, a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular trafficking processes. This protein is primarily associated with the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and lysosomes, where it plays a critical role in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking. As a member of the GTPase family, ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 5B is involved in the regulation of retrograde transport and cellular nutrient sensing, particularly in response to amino acid availability (RosaFerreira2015The; Shi2018Amino). The protein interacts with various complexes, including the Ragulator and GARP complexes, to facilitate its functions in cellular homeostasis and protein transport. Its involvement in key cellular pathways highlights its significance in maintaining intracellular trafficking and its potential implications in diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer (Shi2018Aminoa; Xu2020The).

## Function
The ARL5B gene encodes a small GTPase protein that plays a crucial role in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking in human cells. This protein is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and lysosomes, where it is involved in retrograde transport processes (RosaFerreira2015The; Shi2018Amino). ARL5B interacts with the Ragulator complex through Lamtor1, a subunit of Ragulator, which is essential for the trafficking process. This interaction is modulated by amino acid availability, particularly glutamine, which can disrupt the ARL5B-Ragulator binding (Shi2018Aminoa; Shi2018Amino).

ARL5B functions as a sensor or mediator of amino acid levels, influencing cellular nutrient sensing and trafficking processes. It is activated by the Ragulator complex, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, facilitating its transition from GDP-bound to GTP-bound form (Shi2018Aminoa; Shi2018Amino). The protein also interacts with the GARP complex, a tethering factor essential for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking, and is involved in the recruitment of the GARP complex to the Golgi (RosaFerreira2015The). These processes are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, protein transport, and the regulation of intracellular trafficking pathways in response to nutrient availability (Shi2018Aminoa).

## Clinical Significance
ARL5B is implicated in several diseases due to its role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. In Alzheimer's disease, ARL5B is crucial for the trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (APP) from the Golgi to early endosomes. This process influences the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. Disruption of the ARL5B/AP4 pathway can lead to increased Aβ production, highlighting its significance in Alzheimer's disease (Toh2017Amyloid).

In the context of cancer, ARL5B plays an oncogenic role in breast cancer, particularly in HER2-positive cases. The FTO/miR-181b-3p/ARL5B signaling pathway is involved in cell migration and invasion, with high expression of ARL5B associated with poor clinical outcomes. FTO promotes ARL5B expression by down-regulating miR-181b-3p, facilitating lysosome dispersion and accumulation at the cell periphery, which is crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion (Xu2020The).

These findings suggest that alterations in ARL5B expression or function can contribute to the pathogenesis of both neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
ARL5B interacts with the Ragulator complex through Lamtor1, a connection that is specific and confirmed by pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is stronger in the GDP-bound form of ARL5B compared to the GTP-bound form. Both the N- and C-termini of Lamtor1 are necessary for this interaction. ARL5B also interacts with the Lamtor2-Lamtor3 and Lamtor4-Lamtor5 sub-complexes of Ragulator, but only in the presence of Lamtor1. This interaction is crucial for ARL5B's role in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking (Shi2018Amino).

ARL5B is involved in the trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and interacts with the AP4 protein complex. It recruits AP4 to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes, which is essential for the anterograde transport of APP. This interaction helps segregate APP from BACE1, minimizing amyloid-beta production in the TGN (Toh2017Amyloid).

ARL5B does not interact with nucleic acids but is known to interact with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1α) in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction involves specific regions of HP1α and is influenced by the MIR-like motif in ARL5 (Lin2002A).
