# OR1K1

## Overview
The OR1K1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily K member 1, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, facilitating the detection and transduction of odorant signals through their characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure (Yin2020Functional). The OR1K1 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odor molecules, triggering a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in the perception of smell (Green2010A). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR1K1 and similar receptors are also found in non-olfactory tissues, where they may participate in diverse physiological processes (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). The evolutionary conservation of OR1K1, evidenced by its presence in both modern and archaic human genomes, underscores its potential significance in human evolutionary biology (PaixãoCôrtes2012Homo).

## Structure
The OR1K1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors typically have a seven-transmembrane domain structure, characteristic of GPCRs, which allows them to traverse the cell membrane and interact with odorant molecules (Yin2020Functional). The primary structure of OR1K1 consists of amino acid sequences that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor (Green2010A).

The secondary structure of OR1K1 likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains. These helices are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the receptor (cvicek2015structure). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, which is essential for the receptor's ability to bind to specific odorant molecules and initiate signal transduction.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's stability, localization, and function. However, specific details on these modifications for OR1K1 are not provided in the available context. There is no information on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms for OR1K1 in the provided sources.

## Function
The OR1K1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). The process involves the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to the generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which opens cation-selective channels and results in neuronal depolarization and action potential firing (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR1K1 are also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, where they may be involved in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and other cellular functions (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). The evolutionary significance of OR1K1 is highlighted by its ancestral allele being present in both archaic humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, suggesting its importance in the evolutionary history of hominins (PaixãoCôrtes2012Homo).
