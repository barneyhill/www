# ZHX1

## Overview
ZHX1 (zinc fingers and homeoboxes 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and homeobox domains, which are integral to its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The ZHX1 protein is a member of the zinc-finger class of the homeobox protein superfamily and is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. It plays a significant role in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes and interacts with other proteins such as DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to modulate gene expression. ZHX1 is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues and is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels and interactions can influence disease progression and prognosis (Kim2007Zincfingers; Chen2023Cooperative; Yamada1999Human).

## Structure
The ZHX1 protein is composed of 873 amino acids and features two Cys2-His2-type zinc-finger motifs and five homeodomains, classifying it within the zinc-finger class of the homeobox protein superfamily (Hirano2002Rat; Yamada2002Functional). The zinc-finger regions, ZNF1 and ZNF2, adopt a canonical ββR-fold, with a zinc ion coordinated by two cysteine and two histidine residues. The ZNF2 region includes a C-terminal extension that forms a single domain with the zinc-fingers, contributing to a unique structural organization (Wienk2009The).

The protein's dimerization domain is located within the homeodomain 1 (HD1), spanning amino acids 272 to 432, which is essential for dimer formation (Yamada2002Functional). ZHX1 can form both homodimers and heterodimers, influencing its quaternary structure (Hirano2002Rat). The nuclear localization signal is found in an arginine-rich region between amino acids 734 and 768 (Yamada2002Functional).

ZHX1's transcriptional repressor activity is linked to an acidic region between amino acids 831 and 873, with dimerization being necessary for full repressor function (Yamada2002Functional). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with its structure and interactions playing a role in transcription regulation (Hirano2002Rat).

## Function
The ZHX1 gene encodes a protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in human cells. It contains zinc finger motifs and homeobox domains, which are typical features of transcription factors, facilitating DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Yamada1999Human). ZHX1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression. It binds directly to DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B), enhancing DNMT3B-mediated transcriptional repression, which suggests a role in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Kim2007Zincfingers).

ZHX1 is also involved in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes, where it plays a crucial role in the specification of cardiac progenitor cells. It interacts with hnRNPA1 to coactivate the transcription of genes necessary for cardiomyocyte differentiation, highlighting its importance in cardiac development (Chen2023Cooperative). Additionally, ZHX1 undergoes post-translational modification through SUMOylation, which affects its stability and transcriptional repression activity. This modification regulates its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism for its function in transcriptional repression (Chen2013The).

## Clinical Significance
ZHX1 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In node-negative breast cancer, ZHX1 is often overexpressed, particularly in tumors with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and those from patients who experience early recurrence. This overexpression suggests that ZHX1 may serve as a prognostic marker and could be associated with early recurrence in breast cancer (Louis2011Abstract). The gene is located in a region frequently amplified in breast cancer, although amplification is not the primary mechanism for its overexpression (Louis2011Abstract).

In glioblastoma, ZHX1 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It is involved in the MALAT1-miR-199a-ZHX1 axis, where MALAT1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate ZHX1 expression. This axis promotes glioblastoma cell proliferation and progression, suggesting that targeting this pathway could be a therapeutic strategy (Liao2019Blocking).

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), ZHX1 is regulated by transcription factors FOXN2 and FOXN3. Its knockdown affects the expression of genes in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, indicating a tumor suppressor role (Nagel2017Identification).

## Interactions
ZHX1 (zinc fingers and homeoboxes 1) is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions that play a role in transcriptional regulation. It interacts specifically with the NF-YA subunit of the nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) transcription factor, both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays (Yamada1999Human). This interaction suggests a role for ZHX1 in modulating NF-Y-mediated transcriptional activity.

ZHX1 also forms heterodimers with ZHX3, another member of the ZHX family, through specific amino acid regions. This interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid systems, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation assays (YAMADA2003Analysis). The interaction domains of ZHX1 and ZHX3 overlap with regions that interact with the activation domain of NF-YA, indicating a multifunctional role in transcriptional repression (YAMADA2003Analysis).

Additionally, ZHX1 interacts with DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) through its homeobox domains, particularly the region containing amino acids 733-873. This interaction is crucial for DNMT3B-mediated transcriptional repression and involves the PWWP domain of DNMT3B, which is important for chromatin remodeling (Kim2007Zincfingers). These interactions highlight the role of ZHX1 in complex regulatory networks influencing gene expression.
