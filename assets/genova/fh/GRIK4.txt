# GRIK4

## Overview
The GRIK4 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 4, a critical component of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system by facilitating ion flow across neuronal membranes. The GRIK4 protein, also known as GluK4, is predominantly expressed in brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, where it plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, including processes like long-term potentiation (LTP) that are essential for learning and memory (Knight2011GRIK4KA1; Pickard2006Cytogenetic). Alterations in the expression or function of GRIK4 have been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cognitive and emotional functions (Lerma2013Kainate; Lowry2013The).

## Structure
The GRIK4 gene encodes a subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor, which plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The primary structure of the GRIK4 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of the GRIK4 protein forms a ligand-binding domain and a transmembrane domain, which are critical for its role as a receptor. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the protein into a tetrameric receptor complex, allowing it to function effectively in synaptic transmission (Hu2024Transcriptomic).

Common post-translational modifications of the GRIK4 protein include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect the protein's activity and interactions. Glycosylation, in particular, may be involved in the protein's dimerization, as suggested by the presence of immunoreactive bands at approximately 105 and 210 kDa, indicating possible glycosylation or dimerization (Knight2011GRIK4KA1). These structural features and modifications are essential for the proper functioning of the GRIK4 protein in the brain.

## Function
The GRIK4 gene encodes the GluK4 subunit of kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. These receptors are involved in excitatory neurotransmission by allowing ion flow across the cell membrane, influencing neuronal communication, learning, and memory (Pickard2006Cytogenetic). In healthy human cells, GRIK4 is primarily expressed in brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, where it plays a role in synaptic signaling and plasticity, particularly long-term potentiation (LTP), a molecular model for learning and memory (Pickard2006Cytogenetic).

GluK4 is involved in regulating memory and mood, with its expression linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Alterations in GRIK4 expression can affect glutamatergic neurotransmission, which is associated with these conditions (Lerma2013Kainate; Lowry2013The). The protein is active in the synaptic membranes of neurons, where it contributes to maintaining normal synaptic activity and influences susceptibility to certain mental health disorders (Hu2024Transcriptomic). The presence of GRIK4 in specific neuronal populations suggests its role in modulating synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, potentially affecting cognitive and emotional functions (Knight2011GRIK4KA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GRIK4 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The GRIK4 gene encodes a subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor, which plays a crucial role in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Disruptions in this gene, such as chromosomal breakpoints, have been associated with psychiatric symptoms, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of GRIK4 may contribute to these conditions (Pickard2006Cytogenetic).

A Scottish case-control study identified significant associations between GRIK4 haplotypes and both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indicating distinct risk and protective regions within the gene. The schizophrenia risk region is linked to the N-terminal extracellular domain, while the bipolar disorder protective region is associated with the cytoplasmic C-terminus (Pickard2006Cytogenetic). Additionally, a variant in the 3'UTR of GRIK4 has been suggested to result in higher transcript levels, potentially conferring a protective effect against bipolar disorder (Yuan2015Ionotropic).

Research using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of GRIK4 in human neuroblastoma cells has shown that alterations in GRIK4 expression can affect synaptic membrane pathways, which are involved in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Hu2024Transcriptomic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GRIK4 in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
The GRIK4 gene encodes a subunit of the kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity. GRIK4 interacts with the synapse-associated protein PSD95, a key scaffolding protein involved in synapse maturation. This interaction is crucial for synaptic function and is preserved even in the presence of certain mutations, such as the GRIK4 p.Gln342Ter mutation, which does not significantly affect the interaction (Hu2022Ultrarare). The interaction between GRIK4 and PSD95 is important for maintaining synaptic integrity and function, and disruptions in this interaction have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Hu2022Ultrarare).

In addition to its interaction with PSD95, GRIK4 is part of the glutamate receptor family, which plays a role in neurotransmitter actions and is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders. The gene has been associated with treatment outcomes in depression, where variations in GRIK4 may influence the response to antidepressants (Paddock2007Association). These interactions highlight the significance of GRIK4 in neuronal communication and its potential impact on mental health disorders.
