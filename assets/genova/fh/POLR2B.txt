# POLR2B

## Overview
POLR2B is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit B, a critical component of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is responsible for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit, also known as RPB2, plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, contributing to the transcription of protein-coding genes and small nuclear RNAs. As a part of the catalytic core, POLR2B is essential for the transcriptional machinery, facilitating the transcription process by interacting with various transcription and elongation factors. The protein encoded by POLR2B is active in the cell nucleus and is involved in regulating gene expression and cellular function. Its significance extends to clinical implications, where mutations and alterations in POLR2B have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders (Muste2023Deregulations; Michiels2007Polymorphism; James2012Genomic).

## Structure


## Function
POLR2B encodes the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit, also known as RPB2, is integral to the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, facilitating the transcription of protein-coding genes. POLR2B, along with POLR2A, forms the catalytic site of the polymerase, playing a vital role in the transcriptional machinery (Muste2023Deregulations).

In healthy human cells, POLR2B is involved in the transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, particularly during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It is recruited to snRNA promoters, such as the RNU1 and RNU2 loci, where its occupancy peaks after 6 hours post-mitosis release, indicating its role in transcription activation during this phase (James2012Genomic). POLR2B is not enriched on RNA polymerase III promoters, suggesting its specific involvement with RNA polymerase II promoters (James2012Genomic).

The protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and cellular function. Its activity is essential for the transcription of messenger RNA, long non-coding RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs, which are critical for various cellular processes (Muste2023Deregulations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the POLR2B gene, which encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, POLR2B mutations have been linked to sensitivity to JQ1, a bromodomain inhibitor, in breast cancer cell lines. These mutations are predictors of JQ1 sensitivity, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Muste2023Deregulations). Additionally, POLR2B downregulation has been associated with resistance to 5-Azacytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, in acute myeloid leukemia, indicating its role in drug resistance (Muste2023Deregulations). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma, POLR2B is upregulated, with high mRNA levels correlating with reduced patient survival rates and tumor staging, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker, particularly in virus-related cases (Muste2023Deregulations). 

Furthermore, polymorphisms in POLR2B have been associated with increased risks for head and neck cancers, highlighting its role in cancer susceptibility (Michiels2007Polymorphism). 

In the context of developmental disorders, copy number variations involving POLR2B have been identified in patients with idiopathic short stature, although specific diseases directly linked to these variations are not well-documented (Hu2016Copy).

## Interactions
POLR2B, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in various interactions essential for transcription. It participates in the formation of the RNA polymerase II complex, interacting with other subunits such as RPB1 and RPB3, which are crucial for the assembly and function of the polymerase (Acker1997Interactions). POLR2B is also involved in interactions with transcription factors and elongation factors. For instance, it interacts with TFIIS, a transcription factor that rescues arrested RNA polymerase II by inducing RNA cleavage, allowing transcription to resume (Cramer2004RNA).

The interactions of POLR2B extend to the binding of nucleic acids within the elongation complex. The structure of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex reveals that POLR2B, along with other subunits, helps stabilize the DNA-RNA hybrid and maintain the integrity of the transcription bubble (Kettenberger2004Complete). Additionally, POLR2B is involved in the interactions with the PAF complex and SPT6, which are important for transcription elongation and chromatin remodeling (Schier2020Structure).

These interactions highlight the central role of POLR2B in coordinating the complex processes of transcription initiation, elongation, and regulation, ensuring efficient gene expression.
