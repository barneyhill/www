# C18orf32

## Overview
C18orf32 is a gene located on chromosome 18 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 18 open reading frame 32. This protein is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a significant role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It is involved in lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and trafficking, moving between the ER membrane and LDs. The protein's stability and degradation are regulated through ubiquitin conjugation, involving the AAA ATPase VCP and the proteasome, with the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78 being crucial for its degradation. C18orf32 interacts with ERAD components such as erlin-1 and derlin-1, and its regulation is essential for maintaining proper protein levels on LDs (Bersuker2018A).

## Structure


## Interactions
C18orf32 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that interacts with several components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It is involved in lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and traffics between the ER membrane and LDs. The protein's degradation is mediated by ubiquitin conjugation and requires the involvement of the AAA ATPase VCP and the proteasome. C18orf32 interacts with erlin-1 and derlin-1, which are components of the ERAD pathway, and its degradation is dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78. The deletion of gp78 impairs the degradation of C18orf32, highlighting its role in this process (Bersuker2018A).

C18orf32-S, a tagged version of the protein, co-purifies with ubiquitin, VCP, derlin-1, and gp78, indicating these are physical interactors. Inhibition of VCP traps C18orf32 in a complex with an ERAD dislocation apparatus containing gp78 and derlin-1, suggesting that C18orf32 is regulated by ERAD and its levels on LDs are controlled by this pathway (Bersuker2018A). The protein also colocalizes with the LD protein PLIN2, suggesting a potential interaction or association with LD proteins (Bersuker2018A).
