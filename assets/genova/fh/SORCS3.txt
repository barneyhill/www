# SORCS3

## Overview
SORCS3 is a gene that encodes the sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 3, a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the VPS10P domain receptor family. This protein is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues and plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. As a sorting receptor, it is involved in directing proteins to their appropriate cellular destinations, influencing synaptic structure and function, and regulating neurotrophin signaling. SORCS3 is characterized by its large extracellular domain containing a VPS10 domain, which is crucial for its role in protein sorting and trafficking (Kamran2023Independent). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as PSD95 and PICK1, are essential for synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Salasova2022Finding; Breiderhoff2013SortilinRelated). SORCS3 has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma multiforme, highlighting its clinical significance (Salasova2022Finding; Zhang2022SorCS3).

## Structure
SORCS3 is a member of the VPS10 domain receptor family, characterized by a large extracellular domain containing a VPS10 domain, which is involved in protein sorting and trafficking. The primary structure of SORCS3 includes a signal peptide and multiple conserved domains, similar to other members of the VPS10p-domain receptor family (Kamran2023Independent). The protein is synthesized as a precursor molecule with a classical sequence-motif for furin-mediated cleavage, which occurs in the late Golgi compartments, converting the pro-form to the mature form (Kamran2023Independent).

SORCS3 shares structural features with other SorCS family members, such as SorCS2, which includes a cross-braced homodimer architecture. Although specific details about the molecular structure of SORCS3 are not provided, it is implied that SORCS3 may have a similar domain composition and dimerization properties (Leloup2018Structural). The protein does not require propeptide cleavage for ligand binding, indicating that its structural conformation is maintained without this modification (Kamran2023Independent).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in membrane proteins like SORCS3, although specific modifications for SORCS3 are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variants may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions.

## Function
SORCS3 is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed in neuronal tissues, where it functions as a sorting receptor involved in intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. It is part of the Vps10p-domain receptor family, which plays a crucial role in sorting and directing proteins to their appropriate cellular destinations. In healthy human cells, SORCS3 is synthesized as a proprotein and matures through N-terminal propeptide cleavage in the Golgi compartments, although this cleavage is not necessary for its ligand-binding function (Kamran2023Independent).

SORCS3 is predominantly located on the plasma membrane and exhibits slow internalization, distinguishing it from its relatives Sortilin and SorLA, which are involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking (Kamran2023Independent). It binds neurotrophic factors like nerve growth factor (NGF) with high affinity, playing a role in neurotrophin signaling and synaptic transmission (Salasova2022Finding; Kamran2023Independent). SORCS3 is involved in controlling synaptic structure and function by binding scaffold proteins and regulating glutamate receptor trafficking, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Salasova2022Finding).

## Clinical Significance
SORCS3 is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In Alzheimer's disease, SORCS3 is associated with the regulation of the amyloidogenic pathway, influencing γ-secretase activity and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Mutations in SORCS3, along with those in SORCS1 and SORCS2, have been linked to AD, with decreased expression observed in affected brain regions such as the frontal cortex. This suggests a region-specific impairment in AD pathogenesis (Salasova2022Finding).

In glioblastoma multiforme, SORCS3 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in glioma tissues, and low levels are correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Overexpression of SORCS3 in glioma cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in inhibiting GBM progression. SORCS3 promotes the internalization and degradation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is associated with cancer cell invasion and proliferation, thereby limiting GBM progression (Zhang2022SorCS3).

SORCS3 is also identified as a top-risk gene across multiple psychiatric disorders, suggesting a pleiotropic function that may contribute to various brain-related conditions (Salasova2022Finding).

## Interactions
SORCS3, a member of the VPS10P domain receptor family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence neuronal function and development. It is expressed in the postsynaptic density of hippocampal neurons, particularly in the CA1 region, where it interacts with proteins such as PSD93 and PSD95. The interaction with PSD95 is mediated by a PDZ domain binding motif in the cytosolic part of SORCS3, specifically the tetrapeptide CTSV, which is crucial for this interaction (Breiderhoff2013SortilinRelated).

SORCS3 also interacts with PICK1, a sorting adaptor involved in the removal of AMPA receptors during long-term depression. This interaction affects the localization of PICK1 at the postsynaptic density, which is significant for synaptic plasticity (Breiderhoff2013SortilinRelated).

In glioblastoma multiforme cells, SORCS3 interacts with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), promoting its internalization and degradation. This interaction is enhanced by nerve growth factor (NGF) and involves the fusion of membrane-bound vesicles with early endosomes (Zhang2022SorCS3). The interaction between SORCS3 and p75NTR is suggested to inhibit glioma progression by limiting signal transduction pathways associated with tumor aggressiveness (Zhang2021SorCS3).
