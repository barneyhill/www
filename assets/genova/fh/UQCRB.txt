# UQCRB

## Overview
UQCRB is a gene that encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein, a crucial component of mitochondrial Complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This protein plays a significant role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Jung2013Exploring). As a subunit of Complex III, UQCRB is involved in the stabilization of the ubisemiquinone radical and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are critical for cellular energy metabolism and hypoxia-induced pathways (Jung2013Exploring; Cho2013Functional). The protein's interactions with other subunits and small molecules, such as terpestacin and oxymatrine, underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in angiogenesis-related diseases (Jung2010Terpestacin; Sun2016Identification). Mutations in the UQCRB gene have been linked to mitochondrial complex III deficiency and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Koç2021A; Kim2017Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The UQCRB protein is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, specifically part of Complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that contribute to its function in electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. The secondary structure of UQCRB is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical structural motifs that help stabilize the protein's conformation.

In terms of tertiary structure, UQCRB forms a compact three-dimensional shape that allows it to interact effectively with other subunits within Complex III. This interaction is crucial for its role in facilitating electron transfer. The quaternary structure of UQCRB involves its integration into the larger cytochrome bc1 complex, where it interacts with other protein subunits to form a functional electron transport unit.

UQCRB may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the electron transport chain. The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in mitochondrial function and energy production. Specific domains or prominent folds within UQCRB have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The UQCRB gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of mitochondrial Complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This complex is a critical component of the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Jung2013Exploring). UQCRB is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism by contributing to the generation of an electrochemical proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis (Cho2013Functional).

In healthy human cells, UQCRB is involved in the stabilization of the ubisemiquinone radical through hydrophobic interactions with ubiquinone, which is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of Complex III (Jung2013Exploring). It also regulates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at Complex III, which is important for the hypoxia-induced stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a), a transcription factor involved in cellular responses to low oxygen levels (Jung2013Exploring). This regulation of ROS and HIF-mediated pathways is essential for processes such as angiogenesis, highlighting UQCRB's role as a critical mediator of oxygen sensing and energy metabolism in healthy cells (Jung2013Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UQCRB gene, which encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex III, have been implicated in several diseases. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial complex III deficiency, characterized by symptoms such as hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and metabolic crises. A case study of a 10-year-old male with a novel homozygous pathogenic variant of UQCRB presented with recurrent severe hypoglycemic attacks and lactic acidosis, highlighting the gene's role in metabolic disorders (Koç2021A). Another case involved a Turkish girl with a UQCRB deletion, who experienced hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis during metabolic crises (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear).

Alterations in UQCRB expression have been linked to various cancers, including colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In colorectal cancer, UQCRB expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its methylation status is associated with tumorigenesis (Kim2017Mitochondrial). The gene's involvement in angiogenesis through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated pathways has also been noted, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Chang2014A).

The downregulation of hsa-miR-10a-5p in mutant UQCRB-expressing cells promotes the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, which may contribute to tumorigenesis and serve as a potential biomarker for UQCRB-related diseases (Kim2018HsamiR10a5p).

## Interactions
UQCRB, a component of mitochondrial Complex III, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in the electron transport chain and angiogenesis. It interacts with other subunits within Complex III, such as cytochrome b, facilitating electron transfer and influencing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Jung2010Terpestacin). UQCRB's role extends to cellular oxygen sensing, where it modulates ROS production in response to hypoxia, a process important for tumor progression and angiogenesis (Jung2010Terpestacin).

UQCRB also interacts with small molecules like terpestacin and oxymatrine. Terpestacin binds to UQCRB, inhibiting hypoxia-induced ROS production and affecting the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), thereby suppressing angiogenesis (Jung2010Terpestacin). This interaction involves a hydrophobic pocket in UQCRB, with key residues such as Leu 32 and Ile 63 playing a significant role (Jung2010Terpestacin). Oxymatrine, another small molecule, binds to UQCRB with a binding affinity constant of approximately 4 mM, involving several amino acid residues like Tyr21 and Arg33, and is driven by strong enthalpy forces (Sun2016Identification). These interactions highlight UQCRB's potential as a therapeutic target in angiogenesis-related diseases.
