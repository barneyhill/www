# PIP5KL1

## Overview
PIP5KL1 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-like 1, which is part of the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIPKs) type I family. This protein functions primarily as a scaffold that facilitates the localization and activation of PIPKs, contributing to the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], a pivotal molecule in phosphoinositide signaling pathways. These pathways are integral to various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and motility, as well as cytoskeletal regulation and intracellular vesicle trafficking (Shi2009Overexpression). Although PIP5KL1 itself exhibits low intrinsic kinase activity, it plays a significant role in enhancing the activity of other PIPKs, thereby influencing PI(4,5)P2 levels. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, with a primary localization in the perinuclear region of cells, suggesting potential involvement in nuclear signaling or transport processes (Shi2010Overexpression). Despite its recognized role in cancer studies, the specific physiological functions of PIP5KL1 in normal human cells remain largely unexplored.

## Function
Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-like 1 (PIP5KL1) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIPKs) type I family, which plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide signaling networks. These networks are essential for regulating various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, motility, cytoskeletal regulation, and intracellular vesicle trafficking (Shi2009Overexpression). PIP5KL1 acts as a scaffold for the localization and activation of PIPKs, which are involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], a key component in phosphoinositide signaling. Although PIP5KL1 has low intrinsic phosphoinositide kinase activity, it enhances PIPK activity, thereby increasing PI(4,5)P2 levels (Shi2009Overexpression).

PIP5KL1 is highly expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting a role in these tissues, but its specific physiological functions in healthy human cells remain underexplored (Shi2009Overexpression). The protein is primarily localized in the perinuclear area of cells, which may indicate its involvement in processes related to nuclear signaling or transport (Shi2010Overexpression). While the focus of existing studies has been on its role in cancer, the molecular activities of PIP5KL1 in healthy cells are not well-documented in the available literature.
