# LYZL4

## Overview
LYZL4 is a gene that encodes the protein lysozyme-like 4, which belongs to the c-type lysozyme family. This protein is characterized by its structural similarity to other lysozymes, including conserved disulfide bridges and a predominantly α-helical secondary structure. Despite these similarities, LYZL4 lacks the enzymatic activity typical of lysozymes, suggesting a non-enzymatic role in human biology. It is primarily expressed in the male reproductive system, particularly in the testes and epididymis, where it is implicated in sperm maturation and fertilization processes. The protein is also found on the surface of human embryonic stem cells and within the sperm tail proteome, indicating its involvement in reproductive cellular processes. While the exact function of LYZL4 remains to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to play a role in tissue-specific contexts, potentially contributing to reproductive health (Narmadha2016In; Hansen2020A; Omolaoye2022Using).

## Structure
LYZL4 is a lysozyme-like protein with a molecular weight ranging from 16-18 kDa and a pI value between 4 to 8. It is characterized by its hydrophilic nature and the presence of a signal peptide. The protein structure includes conserved disulfide bridges formed by eight cysteine residues, typical of lysozymes, which contribute to its stability (Narmadha2016In; Irwin2011Evolution). 

The primary structure of LYZL4 includes a sequence of approximately 140-150 amino acids, similar to lysozyme c and lactalbumin, with highly conserved residues (Irwin2011Evolution). The secondary structure is predominantly α-helical, with a significant portion also forming random coils (Narmadha2016In). 

LYZL4's tertiary structure is similar to other LYZL proteins, characterized by the presence of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil, with α-helix being predominant (Narmadha2016In). The protein does not exhibit muramidase or isopeptidase activity, which may be due to the absence of an active site, despite having a LYZL domain responsible for binding to cell wall components (Narmadha2016In). 

LYZL4 is expressed in the testes and epididymis and is involved in fertilization, being localized on the sperm surface (Narmadha2016In).

## Function
The LYZL4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the c-type lysozyme family, which is known for its role in breaking down bacterial cell walls. LYZL4 is expressed in the human reproductive system, particularly in the testes and epididymis, suggesting a role in male reproduction (Wang2021Transcriptome; Omolaoye2022Using). Although the specific function of LYZL4 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is associated with sperm-related processes, potentially involved in sperm maturation and fertilization (Trovero2019Revealing).

LYZL4 has been identified on the surface of human embryonic stem cells and is expressed in the human sperm tail proteome, indicating its involvement in cellular processes related to reproduction (Omolaoye2022Using). The gene is part of a group of glycoside hydrolase-like proteins that have lost their catalytic activity and are targeted to the extracellular space, which may suggest a new, non-enzymatic function in tissue-specific contexts (Hansen2020A). Despite these insights, the precise molecular activities and cellular localization of LYZL4 remain under investigation, and further research is needed to elucidate its exact role in human biology.
