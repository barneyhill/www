# ATP8B1

## Overview
ATP8B1 is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B1 protein, a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane, a process essential for various cellular activities such as vesicle formation, membrane trafficking, and cell signaling. ATP8B1 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it is crucial for maintaining bile composition and preventing cholestasis. The protein's activity is dependent on its interaction with CDC50 proteins, particularly CDC50A, which facilitates its proper localization and function. Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene are linked to several liver diseases, including Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), as well as other extrahepatic conditions (Paulusma2007ATP8B1; Folmer2009Differential; Xie2023Genetic).

## Structure
The ATP8B1 protein is a member of the P4-ATPase family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cell membranes by flipping lipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet (Dieudonné2021Autoinhibition). The molecular structure of ATP8B1 includes a transmembrane domain with ten α-helical segments and three cytosolic domains: the actuator (A), nucleotide-binding (N), and phosphorylation (P) domains (Dieudonné2021Autoinhibition). These domains are essential for its ATPase activity and lipid transport function.

ATP8B1 forms a complex with CDC50A, which is necessary for its transport activity and proper targeting within the cell (Dieudonné2021Autoinhibition). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, transitioning between E1 and E2 states, which are driven by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions (Dieudonné2023Activation). The structure of ATP8B1 also includes specific residues that are critical for substrate recognition, such as the sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids (Dieudonné2023Activation).

Autoinhibition of ATP8B1 is mediated by its N- and C-terminal tails, which interact with the catalytic sites and domain interfaces, preventing conformational changes necessary for lipid transport (Dieudonné2021Autoinhibition). Phosphoinositides, particularly PI(3,4,5)P3, are important activators of ATP8B1, binding within a positively charged cavity formed by transmembrane segments (Dieudonné2023Activation).

## Function
The ATP8B1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a phospholipid flippase, primarily involved in maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane. This activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicle formation, membrane trafficking, and cell signaling. ATP8B1 is predominantly active in the liver, where it helps maintain bile composition, preventing cholestasis and supporting normal liver function.

The ATP8B1 protein is part of the P4 ATPase family and is involved in the translocation of phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) across the cytoplasmic membrane, a process coupled with ATP hydrolysis (Korneenko2015P4ATPase). In hepatocytes, ATP8B1 maintains phospholipid asymmetry in the canalicular membrane, which is essential for protecting the membrane from the toxic effects of bile acids and ensuring proper bile flow (Sebastian2012Phospholipid; Korneenko2015P4ATPase). This function is vital for the enterohepatic cycle, which involves the synthesis, secretion, and reabsorption of bile acids, ensuring efficient lipid emulsification and solubilization in the intestine (Korneenko2015P4ATPase).

ATP8B1 also plays a role in the formation and stabilization of microvillar structures in polarized epithelial cells, independent of its aminophospholipid translocase activity. It is involved in apical protein expression and microvillus formation, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the apical membrane (Verhulst2010A). The protein may act as a molecular scaffold, recruiting structural components or modulators of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for microvilli formation (Verhulst2010A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene are associated with several cholestatic liver diseases, including Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1). PFIC1 is a severe condition characterized by progressive liver disease that often leads to end-stage liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation. This condition is linked to mutations that result in reduced protein stability and impaired interaction with CDC50A, leading to a lack of ATP8B1 in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (Folmer2009Differential). BRIC1, on the other hand, is a milder form of the disease characterized by episodic cholestasis that resolves spontaneously. Mutations associated with BRIC1 generally maintain protein stability and interaction with CDC50A, allowing for proper localization of ATP8B1 (Xie2023Genetic; Folmer2009Differential).

ATP8B1 mutations are also implicated in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), which affects pregnant women and resolves after delivery (Folmer2009Differential). Beyond liver-related issues, ATP8B1 dysfunction can lead to extrahepatic conditions such as hypothyroidism, hearing impairment, pancreatitis, and pulmonary fibrosis (Xie2023Genetic; Li2015Hypothyroidism).

## Interactions
ATP8B1 interacts with CDC50 proteins, specifically CDC50A and CDC50B, which are essential for its function and proper localization. These interactions facilitate ATP8B1's exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and its localization to the plasma membrane, where it functions as a lipid flippase. Coexpression with CDC50A results in ATP8B1 localization to the plasma membrane, while coexpression with CDC50B leads to localization at both the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicular structures, such as lysosomes and late endosomes. These interactions enhance the stability of ATP8B1 and the CDC50 proteins (Paulusma2007ATP8B1).

The ATP8B1-CDC50A complex is crucial for ATP8B1's activity, with CDC50A acting as an accessory protein that promotes ATP8B1's trafficking to the plasma membrane. This interaction is necessary for ATP8B1's lipid flippase activity, which is vital for maintaining membrane asymmetry and integrity (Dieudonné2023Activation; Dieudonné2021Autoinhibition).

ATP8B1 is also regulated by phosphoinositides, particularly PI(3,4,5)P3, which bind to a positively charged cavity in ATP8B1, stabilizing the protein and potentially relieving autoinhibition (Dieudonné2023Activation).
