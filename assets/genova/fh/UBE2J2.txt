# UBE2J2

## Overview
UBE2J2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J2, a critical component of the ubiquitination pathway, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its transmembrane domain, which aids in its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, although it is not essential for its enzymatic function (Wang2009Ube2j2). UBE2J2 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, thus contributing to cellular quality control and stress response (dickson2020regulation). The enzyme's interactions with various E3 ligases, such as MARCH6 and mK3, underscore its versatility and importance in the regulation of protein levels within cells (Wang2009Ube2j2; dickson2020regulation). Alterations in UBE2J2 expression and function have been linked to several diseases, including certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kumari2023Identification; Vriend2022Ubiquitin).

## Structure
UBE2J2 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The protein contains a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Sheng2012A). UBE2J2 is characterized by a transmembrane domain (TMD), which, while not necessary for its function in non-lysine ubiquitination, may assist in its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Wang2009Ube2j2). 

The enzyme is involved in forming both ester and isopeptide bonds, indicating its versatility in ubiquitination processes (Wang2009Ube2j2). UBE2J2 is known to interact with viral ligases such as mK3, facilitating the ubiquitination of hydroxylated amino acids like serine and threonine, and forming K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (Wang2009Ube2j2). 

The protein's surface charge characteristics, including a net positive charge, are associated with its ubiquitin chain-building processivity (Sheng2012A). While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of UBE2J2 are not provided, its functional interactions and structural features, such as the UBC domain and TMD, are critical for its role in ubiquitination.

## Function
UBE2J2 encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J2, which plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This enzyme is predominantly localized to the ER membrane, where it functions as a key E2 enzyme in conjunction with the E3 ligase MARCH6. Together, they facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of specific substrates, such as squalene monooxygenase, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis, and the cytosolic degron CL1 (dickson2020regulation).

UBE2J2 is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting misfolded or damaged proteins for degradation, thus contributing to cellular quality control and stress response. The enzyme's activity is crucial for the regulation of protein levels in cells, as demonstrated by the stabilization of certain proteins upon UBE2J2 depletion (Stefanovic‐Barrett2018MARCH6). UBE2J2's function is also linked to the ER membrane complex (EMC), which may regulate its insertion into the ER membrane, ensuring its proper localization and function under basal conditions (dickson2020regulation).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2J2 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and mutations. In ependymoma, a type of brain tumor, UBE2J2 is overexpressed in the ST_EPN_RELA subtype, and this overexpression is associated with shorter patient survival, indicating its potential role in prognosis (Vriend2022Ubiquitin). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), UBE2J2 is also overexpressed, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Kumari2023Identification). 

Mutations in UBE2J2, particularly at acetylation sites such as K64 and K88, have been associated with increased disease susceptibility. These mutations can lead to changes in protein structure and function, potentially contributing to pathogenic outcomes (Kumari2023Identification). 

UBE2J2's role in the ubiquitination process, especially in ER-associated degradation (ERAD), is crucial for protein regulation. Abnormalities in this process, potentially involving UBE2J2, could contribute to various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers (Wang2009Ube2j2). The enzyme's interaction with the mK3 ligase and its preference for ubiquitinating hydroxylated residues highlight its unique role in protein degradation pathways (Wang2009Ube2j2).

## Interactions
UBE2J2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, interacts with several proteins, primarily within the context of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It is known to interact with the E3 ligase mK3, facilitating the ubiquitination of substrates by forming ester bonds with hydroxylated amino acids such as serine and threonine, as well as the more conventional isopeptide bonds with lysine residues (Wang2009Ube2j2). This interaction is crucial for the degradation of heavy chain substrates, as UBE2J2 is responsible for the initial ubiquitination and assembly of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (Wang2009Ube2j2).

UBE2J2 also interacts with the E3 ligase TRC8, where it plays a role in regulating the degradation of immunoreceptors mediated by the human cytomegalovirus protein US2. This interaction is part of a complex regulatory pathway that involves the turnover of TRC8, influencing the rate of HLA-I degradation (van2017Multiple).

Additionally, UBE2J2 is involved in the degradation of proteins at the ER in relation to the E3 ligase MARCH6, where it is identified as a predominant E2 enzyme for MARCH6-mediated degradation processes (dickson2020regulation).
