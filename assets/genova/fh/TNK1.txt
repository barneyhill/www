# TNK1

## Overview
TNK1, or Thirty-eight-negative kinase-1, is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine kinase non-receptor 1, a member of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase family. This protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including a C-terminal ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain, which is pivotal for its interaction with ubiquitinated proteins and regulation of kinase activity (Chan2021TNK1). TNK1 plays a significant role in various cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and immune response regulation. It functions as a negative regulator of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Hong2019miR663b). The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins and ubiquitin, toggling between inactive and active states, which is crucial for its role in signal transduction and oncogenic activity (Chan2021TNK1). TNK1 has been implicated in several diseases, including certain cancers, acute kidney injury, Alzheimer's disease, and atherosclerosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Bao2020A; Zeman2020Polymorphism; Halbgebauer2020ThirtyEightNegative).

## Structure
TNK1, or Thirty-eight-negative kinase-1, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase characterized by a unique domain arrangement. It features a C-terminal ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain, which is unusual for kinases and mediates noncovalent interactions with poly-ubiquitin chains (Chan2021TNK1). The UBA domain is crucial for TNK1's activity and cell proliferation, allowing it to bind ubiquitinated species. This domain interacts with various ubiquitin linkages, indicating broad specificity (Chan2021TNK1). Structural modeling suggests potential ubiquitin-binding interfaces within helices 1 and 3 of the UBA domain (Chan2021TNK1).

TNK1 also contains a proline-rich domain, which includes a phosphorylation site at S502. This site is essential for binding to 14-3-3 proteins, a key regulatory interaction that influences TNK1's localization and function (Chan2021TNK1). The phosphorylation of S502 is mediated by microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) (Chan2021TNK1).

The protein lacks several domains present in its counterpart TNK2, such as the clathrin-binding domain, Cdc42/Rac-interacting domain, and Mig6-homology domain, resulting in a shorter sequence and suggesting functional divergence (Chan2021TNK1). TNK1's structure and interactions are integral to its role in signal transduction and oncogenic activity.

## Function
TNK1 (tyrosine kinase non-receptor 1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and innate immunity activation. It is part of the ACK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and is characterized by a unique domain arrangement, including a C-terminal ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain. This domain mediates noncovalent interactions with poly-ubiquitin chains, which are crucial for TNK1's activity and interaction with ubiquitinated proteins, essential for TNK1-driven cell proliferation (Chan2021TNK1).

TNK1 toggles between inactive and active states through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins and ubiquitin. The 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated TNK1, inhibiting its activity by preventing its movement to ubiquitin clusters. When released from 14-3-3, TNK1 becomes active, promoting cell proliferation (Chan2021TNK1). The phosphorylation of TNK1 at serine 502 (S502) by microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) is crucial for its binding to 14-3-3 proteins, affecting its cellular localization and function (Chan2021TNK1).

In healthy human cells, TNK1 is involved in regulating kinase activity and possibly in immune responses. It acts as a negative regulator of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway, preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Hong2019miR663b). The exact function of TNK1 in healthy cells remains unclear, but it is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune responses (Chan2021TNK1).

## Clinical Significance
TNK1 (tyrosine kinase non-receptor 1) has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In the context of acute kidney injury (AKI) following traumatic hemorrhagic shock, TNK1 expression is upregulated in the kidneys, potentially mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6). This upregulation is associated with systemic inflammation and apoptosis, suggesting TNK1 as a potential therapeutic target for AKI (Halbgebauer2020ThirtyEightNegative).

In hematological cancers, TNK1 is identified as a dependency in certain acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. High TNK1 expression correlates with decreased overall survival in ALL patients, indicating its role in poor clinical outcomes. The interaction between TNK1 and 14-3-3 proteins, which is phosphorylation-dependent, is crucial for its function in these cancers (Chan2021TNK1).

TNK1 is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the rs11867353 polymorphism. The CC genotype of this polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of AD, suggesting TNK1's involvement in the genetic predisposition to the disease (Zeman2020Polymorphism).

In atherosclerosis, TNK1 is involved in inflammation through the TYK2/STAT1 pathway, with higher expression levels observed in atherosclerotic plaques. Targeting TNK1 could potentially reduce inflammation in this condition (Bao2020A).

## Interactions
TNK1 (tyrosine kinase non-receptor 1) is a ubiquitin-binding and 14-3-3-regulated kinase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function and regulation. TNK1 interacts with ubiquitin through its unique ubiquitin-association domain (UBA), showing high affinity for K63-linked ubiquitin and lower affinity for K48-linked ubiquitin. This interaction is essential for TNK1's kinase activity and its role in cell transformation, as mutations disrupting ubiquitin binding reduce TNK1 activity (Chan2021TNK1).

TNK1 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Phosphorylation at serine 502 (S502) within TNK1's proline-rich domain is crucial for binding to 14-3-3 proteins, which sequesters TNK1 and inhibits its kinase activity. This interaction is mediated by microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) and is necessary for restraining TNK1's movement into ubiquitin-rich clusters (Chan2021TNK1).

The interaction between TNK1 and 14-3-3 is inversely related to its interaction with ubiquitin. Loss of 14-3-3 binding enhances TNK1's interaction with ubiquitin, promoting its activity and leading to growth factor-independent proliferation of lymphoid cells (Chan2021TNK1). These interactions highlight TNK1's regulatory mechanism, toggling between inactive (14-3-3-bound) and active (ubiquitin-bound) states, and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Chan2021TNK1).
