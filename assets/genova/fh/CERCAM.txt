# CERCAM

## Overview
CERCAM, or cerebral endothelial cell adhesion molecule, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion processes. The protein, also referred to as CERCAM, is a transmembrane molecule that plays a critical role in the adhesion of cerebral endothelial cells, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. This protein is implicated in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and migration. Alterations in the expression of CERCAM have been associated with the progression of certain cancers, where it acts as an oncogene, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Zuo2021The; Yang2023CERCAM).

## Clinical Significance
CERCAM (cerebral endothelial cell adhesion molecule) has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In bladder cancer, CERCAM is overexpressed, which correlates with increased cell viability, DNA synthesis, and invasion, contributing to a worse prognosis for patients. This overexpression activates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, enhancing cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Silencing CERCAM in bladder cancer cells results in decreased AKT phosphorylation and reduced tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zuo2021The).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high CERCAM expression is associated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval. It is considered an independent risk factor for these outcomes. CERCAM expression in HNSCC is linked to increased malignancy and poorer prognosis, particularly in patients with advanced tumor stages and those with TP53 mutations. The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophage M2 polarization, which is known to promote tumor progression and immune evasion (Yang2023CERCAM). These findings highlight CERCAM's role as an oncogene and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.
