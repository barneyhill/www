# KHK

## Overview
The KHK gene encodes the enzyme ketohexokinase, a member of the ribokinase family, which plays a pivotal role in fructose metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, marking the first and rate-limiting step in the fructose metabolic pathway. Ketohexokinase exists in two isoforms, KHK-A and KHK-C, resulting from alternative splicing, with each isoform exhibiting distinct functional and structural characteristics. KHK-C, the high-activity isoform, is predominantly expressed in the liver and is integral to energy production and lipid synthesis. In contrast, KHK-A, the low-activity isoform, is expressed in various tissues and has additional roles as a protein kinase, particularly in cancer progression. The enzyme's activity is crucial in tissues such as the liver, kidney, and small intestine, where it facilitates the rapid metabolism of dietary fructose. The regulation of KHK expression and isoform production is influenced by various factors, including RNA-binding proteins and hypoxic signaling pathways, underscoring its significance in both metabolic and pathological contexts (Nikolaou2019The; Bae2023Mode; Bonthron1994Molecular).

## Structure
Ketohexokinase (KHK) is an enzyme involved in fructose metabolism, existing in two isoforms, KHK-A and KHK-C, due to alternative splicing of exon 3. This exon encodes 45 out of the 298 amino acids, leading to structural differences between the isoforms (Bae2023Mode). KHK typically forms a homodimer, a quaternary structure, consisting of α and β domains that interlock at the β-clasp domain. This structural feature is common among the ribokinase family, characterized by a central eight-stranded alpha/beta sandwich with an eight-stranded sheet flanked by five and three conserved helices (Bae2023Mode).

The β-clasp domain is significant for substrate binding, where a conformational change moves a critical Asp-27 into the active site, suggesting an induced-fit mechanism (Bae2023Mode). KHK-C is primarily responsible for fructose catabolism, while KHK-A, although less active, may have additional functions as a protein kinase (Bae2023Mode). The structure of mouse KHK-A has been solved, revealing that it crystallizes in space group C 2221 and does not undergo significant conformational changes upon substrate binding, unlike KHK-C (Bae2023Mode). Understanding these structural nuances is crucial for therapeutic development targeting metabolic syndromes and cancer metastasis (Bae2023Mode).

## Function
The KHK gene encodes the enzyme ketohexokinase, which plays a crucial role in fructose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. This reaction is the first and rate-limiting step in the specialized fructose metabolic pathway, distinct from glucose metabolism (Eberhart2020PeroxisomeDeficiency; Bonthron1994Molecular). Ketohexokinase exists in two isoforms, KHK-C and KHK-A, produced through alternative splicing. KHK-C is the high-activity isoform predominantly expressed in the liver, where it efficiently metabolizes fructose, contributing to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway (Nikolaou2019The; Li2016A). This isoform is crucial for energy production and lipid synthesis, as it rapidly converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, bypassing key regulatory steps in glycolysis (Li2016A).

KHK-A, the low-activity isoform, is expressed at lower levels across various tissues and supports the pentose phosphate pathway for nucleotide biosynthesis (Nikolaou2019The). The enzyme's activity is primarily located in the liver, kidney, and small intestine, where it facilitates the rapid metabolism of dietary fructose (Bonthron1994Molecular). The regulation of KHK expression and isoform production is influenced by factors such as RNA-binding proteins and hypoxic signaling pathways (Nikolaou2019The; Eberhart2020PeroxisomeDeficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KHK gene, which encodes ketohexokinase, have significant clinical implications. The KHK gene produces two isoforms, KHK-C and KHK-A, each associated with different pathologies. KHK-C is primarily expressed in the liver and is linked to metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and cancer (Jiang2021Fructose). In contrast, KHK-A is expressed at lower levels across various tissues and is notably associated with cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In HCC, KHK-A acts as a protein kinase, phosphorylating PRPS1, which promotes nucleotide synthesis and tumor growth (Jiang2021Fructose; Li2016A).

In breast cancer, KHK-A is implicated in fructose-induced tumor cell invasion and metastasis. It functions as a nuclear protein kinase, mediating fructose-induced metastasis by phosphorylating YWHAH, which interacts with SLUG to suppress CDH1, a key event in cancer cell invasion (Kim2020KetohexokinaseA). The clinical significance of KHK is further highlighted by the development of KHK inhibitors, such as PF-06835919, which are being explored as potential therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders driven by fructose overconsumption (Futatsugi2020Discovery).

## Interactions
Ketohexokinase (KHK) interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in cancer progression and metabolic regulation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KHK-A, an isoform of KHK, acts as a protein kinase that phosphorylates p62 at serine 28. This phosphorylation is crucial for the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, enhancing antioxidative responses and promoting tumor cell survival (Xu2019The). KHK-A's interaction with p62 is regulated by AMPK, which phosphorylates KHK-A at serine 80, facilitating its binding to p62 under oxidative stress conditions (Xu2019The).

In breast cancer, KHK-A interacts with the protein YWHAH (14-3-3η), phosphorylating it at serine 25. This interaction is essential for fructose-induced metastasis, as it promotes cancer cell invasion (Kim2020KetohexokinaseA). KHK-A also forms a ternary complex with ATP and YWHAH, facilitating phosphorylation (Kim2020KetohexokinaseA).

KHK-A's interaction with PRPS1 in HCC involves phosphorylation at threonine 225, promoting nucleic acid synthesis and cancer cell growth. This interaction is specific to KHK-A and is not influenced by fructose concentration (Li2016A). These interactions highlight KHK's role in cancer cell metabolism and survival.
