# PIGO

## Overview
The PIGO gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class O protein, which is integral to the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are crucial for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and protein sorting. The PIGO protein, characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a catalytic component of GPI-EtNP transferase III. It specifically facilitates the transfer of ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose in the GPI anchor, a critical step in the maturation of GPI-anchored proteins (Wu2020The; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). Mutations in the PIGO gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation Syndrome 2 (HPMRS2), underscoring its essential role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Wu2020The).

## Function
The PIGO gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane. The PIGO protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a catalytic component of GPI-EtNP transferase III. It is specifically responsible for transferring ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) to the third mannose (Man3) in the GPI anchor, a crucial step in the maturation of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) (Wu2020The; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

This process is vital for the proper localization and function of proteins on the cell surface, impacting various cellular functions such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and protein sorting (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). The PIGO protein is a 1,101-amino-acid endoplasmic reticulum protein with multiple transmembrane domains, indicating its integral role in the membrane-associated processes of GPI anchor biosynthesis (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

Mutations in the PIGO gene can lead to a reduction in GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, which is associated with clinical conditions such as Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation Syndrome 2 (HPMRS2) (Wu2020The). This highlights the importance of PIGO in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGO gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. These mutations can lead to GPI-anchor deficiencies, resulting in disorders such as hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), also known as Mabry syndrome. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (Holtz2020Expanding; Nakamura2014PIGO).

Individuals with PIGO mutations often present with severe neurological impairments, including developmental delays and epilepsy. In some cases, these seizures are resistant to standard treatments, complicating management (Holtz2020Expanding). The phenotypic spectrum of PIGO-related disorders is broad, with some patients exhibiting additional symptoms such as dysmorphic features, gastrointestinal anomalies, and complex congenital malformations (Morren2017PIGO; Holtz2020Expanding).

Specific mutations, such as compound heterozygous variants, have been identified in patients with severe developmental delays and epileptic encephalopathy, expanding the known clinical manifestations of PIGO mutations beyond typical HPMRS features (Nakamura2014PIGO). These findings underscore the diverse and complex nature of disorders associated with PIGO gene mutations.

## Interactions
PIGO is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for attaching proteins to cell membranes. It interacts with PIGF, forming a complex that is essential for the transfer of ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose in the GPI anchor precursor. This interaction is critical for the stability and function of PIGO, as PIGF stabilizes PIGO within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Hong2000Requirement; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

PIGO also interacts with PIGG, another protein involved in GPI biosynthesis. PIGF forms heterodimers with both PIGO and PIGG, stabilizing these transferases and facilitating their function in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (Stokes2014New). The interaction between PIGO and PIGF is specific, as demonstrated by co-precipitation experiments where FLAG-tagged PIGF was coprecipitated with GST-tagged PIGO, but not with other proteins like ALDH or Pig-n (Hong2000Requirement).

These interactions highlight the role of PIGO in the complex network of protein interactions necessary for the proper assembly and function of GPI anchors, which are vital for anchoring proteins to cell membranes (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).
