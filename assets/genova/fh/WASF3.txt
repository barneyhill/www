# WASF3

## Overview
WASF3, or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and movement. The protein, also known as WAVE3, is a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family and functions as a nucleation-promoting factor within the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). This complex is essential for actin polymerization, facilitating processes such as cell migration, invasion, and morphogenesis. WASF3 is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where it is implicated in the promotion of metastasis and tumor progression across various cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung cancers (Loveless2021Targeting; Teng2010Inactivation). The protein's activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its role in cellular dynamics and cancer cell behavior (Teng2016Targeting; Loveless2021Targeting).

## Structure
WASF3, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, is involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. The protein contains several key domains, including a WH2 domain, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal VCA domain, which are essential for its interaction with actin and other proteins (CorralSerrano2020PCARE). The VCA domain is crucial for binding to the Arp2/3 complex and monomeric actin, facilitating actin polymerization and the formation of cellular structures like lamellipodia and invadopodia (Loveless2021Targeting).

WASF3 is part of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which includes subunits such as CYFIP1, NCKAP1, ABI2, and HSPC300. This complex maintains WASF3 in an inactive conformation, preventing actin polymerization by regulating the VCA domain (Teng2016Targeting; Loveless2021Targeting). Activation of WASF3 involves binding with Rac proteins and phosphorylation, leading to increased cell migration and invasion (Teng2016Targeting).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating WASF3 activity. Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues is critical for its activation and function in cell migration (Loveless2021Targeting). The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions with proteins like HSP70, which protect it from proteasome degradation (Teng2012HSP90).

## Function
WASF3, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, particularly within the nervous system, WASF3 is involved in the transduction of signals that lead to changes in cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. This process is mediated through the activation of the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex, facilitated by the WASF regulatory complex (WRC) downstream of the GTPase Rho family member Rac (Loveless2021Targeting).

WASF3 is a critical component of the WAVE complex, which acts as a nucleation-promoting factor for actin polymerization. This activity is essential for the formation of photoreceptor outer segment discs, which are crucial for vision. WASF3's role in actin polymerization is specific to the morphogenesis of these discs, as its absence leads to disorganized membrane structures and photoreceptor degeneration (Spencer2022The).

In photoreceptor cells, WASF3 interacts with PCARE to regulate ciliary F-actin assembly, necessary for the initiation of outer segment disk formation. This interaction recruits WASF3 to the cilium, where it activates actin network formation, driving membrane expansion (CorralSerrano2020PCARE).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the WASF3 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer progression and metastasis. WASF3 is frequently upregulated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression correlates with increased invasive potential and poorer prognosis (Teng2016The; Loveless2021Targeting; Teng2010Inactivation). In breast cancer, WASF3 is associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is enriched in triple-negative breast cancer stem cells, contributing to chemoresistance (Teng2013WASF3; Loveless2021Targeting). 

In prostate cancer, inactivation or knockdown of WASF3 leads to reduced tumorigenicity and metastasis, highlighting its role in promoting aggressive cancer behavior (Teng2010Inactivation). WASF3 also plays a crucial role in the invasion and metastasis of colon cancer cells, particularly those with KRAS mutations, by influencing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Teng2017Promotion). 

In non-small cell lung cancer, high WASF3 expression is linked to a lower five-year survival rate, and its mutations may contribute to drug resistance (Yu2023Drug). These findings suggest that targeting WASF3 could be a promising strategy for metastasis suppression and cancer treatment.

## Interactions
WASF3, also known as WAVE3, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cancer cell invasion. WASF3 forms a complex with proteins such as CYFIP1, NCKAP1, ABI1, and BRK1, collectively known as the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). This complex is essential for actin polymerization and cell movement, which are crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Teng2016The).

WASF3 interacts with CYFIP1, which acts as a conformational restraint, keeping WASF3 inactive until activation occurs through binding with Rac proteins and phosphorylation. This interaction is critical for maintaining WASF3 stability, as knockdown of CYFIP1 leads to reduced WASF3 protein levels and decreased invasion potential in cancer cells (Teng2016Targeting).

WASF3 also interacts with heat shock proteins HSP70 and HSP90. HSP70 is crucial for the stabilization of WASF3, protecting it from proteasome degradation, while HSP90 is involved in the phosphoactivation of WASF3 by stabilizing ABL kinase, a known activator of WASF3 (Teng2012HSP90). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that control WASF3 activity and its role in cancer progression.
