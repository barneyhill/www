# LAMC2

## Overview
The LAMC2 gene encodes the laminin subunit gamma 2, a critical component of the laminin-5 complex, also known as laminin-332, which is integral to the structure and function of the basement membrane in epithelial tissues. The laminin γ2 chain is a non-receptor protein that plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue integrity. It is particularly significant in processes such as wound healing and tissue regeneration, where it facilitates the movement of epithelial cells by interacting with extracellular matrix proteins. Mutations in LAMC2 are associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a group of skin disorders characterized by blistering and skin fragility. Additionally, LAMC2 is implicated in cancer progression, where its altered expression can influence cell migration and adhesion, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Garg2014LAMC2; Salo1999Laminin5).

## Structure
The LAMC2 gene encodes the laminin subunit gamma 2, which is a component of the laminin-5 complex, also known as laminin-332. This protein plays a crucial role in the structure of the basement membrane. The primary structure of the laminin γ2 chain includes a sequence of 606 amino acid residues, featuring a signal peptide of 21 residues (Sasaki2001Short). The γ2 chain contains several domains, including laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) modules and a laminin-type IV (L4) module. These modules are characterized by specific disulfide bridges that form peptide loops, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Sasaki2001Short).

The secondary structure of the γ2 chain includes α-helical domains, which are important for the assembly of laminin-5 (Sasaki2001Short). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable three-dimensional form, with the L4 module folding into a globular domain (Sasaki2001Short). The quaternary structure of laminin-5 involves the assembly of the γ2 chain with other laminin subunits, forming a heterotrimeric complex (Capt2003Cloning).

Post-translational modifications of the γ2 chain may include glycosylation, although some fragments lack these modifications despite having potential glycosylation sites (Sasaki2001Short). The LAMC2 gene also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, such as the γ2* transcript, which lacks a C-terminal cysteine residue (Airenne2000Differential).

## Function
The LAMC2 gene encodes the laminin γ2 chain, a crucial component of laminin-5, also known as laminin-332, which is integral to the structure and function of the basement membrane in epithelial tissues. Laminin-5 is composed of α3, β3, and γ2 chains and plays a significant role in epithelial cell adhesion and migration. The γ2 chain is particularly important for cell migration, as it interacts with extracellular matrix proteins, facilitating the movement of epithelial cells. This function is critical during processes such as wound healing and tissue regeneration, where the γ2 chain is upregulated in migrating keratinocytes (Salo1999Laminin5).

The γ2 chain is involved in the migratory process of epithelial cells, with its short arm being essential for interaction with extracellular matrix proteins. Antibodies targeting the short arm of the γ2 chain have been shown to significantly inhibit the migration of squamous carcinoma cells, underscoring its role in cell migration (Salo1999Laminin5). Although the γ2 chain does not promote cell adhesion on its own, it is crucial for the adhesive function of laminin-5, anchoring epithelial cells to the basement membrane (Salo1999Laminin5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAMC2 gene are associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), a group of heritable skin disorders characterized by blistering and ulceration of the skin and mucous membranes. Herlitz type JEB (H-JEB) is a severe form caused by homozygous mutations in LAMC2, leading to fragile skin, widespread blisters, and often neonatal death due to impaired epidermal anchorage and detachment (Garg2014LAMC2). Non-Herlitz JEB, a milder form, can also result from LAMC2 mutations, such as splice site mutations leading to in-frame exon skipping or frameshift mutations causing premature termination codons. These mutations result in decreased levels of the g2 chain and reduced secretion of laminin-5, affecting skin integrity (Castiglia2001Novel).

In addition to its role in skin disorders, altered expression of LAMC2 is linked to cancer progression. The gene is upregulated in various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancers, due to its involvement in cell adhesion and migration, making it a potential therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker (Garg2014LAMC2). The LAMC2 gene's role in maintaining basement membrane structure is crucial, and its disruption can lead to significant health issues.

## Interactions
LAMC2, the laminin subunit gamma 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cancer progression and cellular functions. In lung cancer, LAMC2 interacts directly with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting its membrane localization and stability. This interaction is significant for EGFR's transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its prevention from degradation through ubiquitination (Tong2023LAMC2a). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the direct binding of LAMC2 to EGFR, with protein docking analysis suggesting that the binding occurs at the N-terminal region of EGFR (Tong2023LAMC2a).

LAMC2 also forms complexes with MYH9 and MYH10, which are involved in ER-mitochondria interactions. These interactions are enhanced under ER stress conditions, suggesting a role for LAMC2 in mitigating ER stress and supporting mitochondrial function (Tong2023LAMC2). In cholangiocarcinoma, LAMC2 interacts with the EGFR signaling pathway, influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis, which are critical for cancer progression (Pei2019Silencing). These interactions highlight LAMC2's involvement in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
