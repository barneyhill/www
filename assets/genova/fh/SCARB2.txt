# SCARB2

## Overview
SCARB2 is a gene that encodes the protein scavenger receptor class B member 2, also known as lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2). This protein is a member of the CD36 superfamily of scavenger receptors and is primarily involved in lipid transport and cellular homeostasis. LIMP-2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the transport of cholesterol and the delivery of the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes, which is essential for lysosomal function and the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (Heybrock2019Lysosomal; Atasu2022Genotype–Phenotype). The protein's structure includes a single transmembrane domain, a large luminal domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its function in various cellular processes, including viral entry and mitochondrial metabolism (Heybrock2019Lysosomal; Zou2022The). Mutations in the SCARB2 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, such as action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome and progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 4, underscoring its significance in neurological and renal health (He2018Identification; Hopfner2011Novel).

## Structure
SCARB2, also known as lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2), is a glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. The protein features a single transmembrane domain, a large luminal/extracellular domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Heybrock2019Lysosomal). The luminal domain of SCARB2 is characterized by a large cavity that traverses the molecule, resembling the cavity in SR-B1, which is involved in lipid transfer (Heybrock2019Lysosomal). This structure suggests a role in cholesterol transport within lysosomes.

SCARB2 consists of three domains arranged in a 'Kidney' shape, with a long tunnel traversing the protein. Domain I forms a twisted β-barrel, Domain II completes the β-barrel and contains glycosylation sites and disulfide bridges, and Domain III includes helices that cap the tunnel (Dang2014Molecular). The protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation, a common post-translational modification, which is crucial for its function, particularly in viral attachment (Dang2014Molecular).

SCARB2 is known to form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Heybrock2019Lysosomal). The protein plays a role in the transport of β-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes, with binding mediated by a helical loop in its luminal domain (Heybrock2019Lysosomal).

## Function
The SCARB2 gene encodes the lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport within lysosomes. LIMP-2 facilitates the export of cholesterol from lysosomes to lipid droplets, helping maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis. This process is essential for preventing cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes, which can lead to cellular dysfunction (Heybrock2019Lysosomal). LIMP-2 operates alongside Niemann-Pick proteins, providing a slower mode of lysosomal cholesterol export and affecting cholesterol regulation mediated by SREBP-2 (Heybrock2019Lysosomal).

LIMP-2 is also involved in the delivery of the acid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes, a process critical for lysosomal function and the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (Atasu2022Genotype–Phenotype). The protein is a member of the CD36 superfamily of scavenger receptors, which are involved in lipid uptake and transport (Heybrock2019Lysosomal). In addition to its role in cholesterol transport, SCARB2 is implicated in mitochondrial function and metabolism, with its deficiency leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and altered metabolic pathways (Zou2022The). SCARB2 is active in various cellular locations, including lysosomes and endosomes, where it supports the proper functioning of lysosomal enzymes (Zou2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCARB2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. AMRF is characterized by progressive neurological symptoms such as myoclonus, ataxia, generalized seizures, dysarthria, and renal impairment. These symptoms are linked to loss-of-function mutations in SCARB2, which encodes the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) (Atasu2022Genotype–Phenotype; Hopfner2011Novel).

SCARB2 mutations have also been implicated in progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 4 (EPM4), which shares overlapping symptoms with AMRF, including action myoclonus, generalized seizures, and ataxia. Some patients with EPM4 also experience renal failure, hearing loss, and cognitive decline (He2018Identification). Additionally, SCARB2 mutations can act as modifiers in Gaucher disease, contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity and impacting neurological and renal conditions (Velayati2011A).

The clinical presentation of SCARB2-related disorders can vary depending on the specific mutation and its localization within the gene. Some variants are associated with additional conditions such as Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting the gene's broad impact on neurological health (Atasu2022Genotype–Phenotype).

## Interactions
SCARB2, also known as lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2), is involved in several key interactions with other proteins. It serves as a receptor for the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (bGC), facilitating its transport to lysosomes independently of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor pathway. This interaction involves a coiled-coil domain within the lumenal domain of SCARB2, and is crucial for the proper lysosomal targeting of bGC, which is defective in Gaucher disease (Reczek2007LIMP2).

SCARB2 also plays a significant role in the entry and uncoating of the Enterovirus 71 (EV71) virus. It acts as a receptor that facilitates the attachment and uncoating of EV71 by interacting with the virus under acidic conditions. This interaction involves the expulsion of a hydrophobic pocket factor from the virion, a necessary step for viral uncoating and entry into host cells (Dang2014Molecular; Lin2012Human).

Additionally, SCARB2 interacts with TMEM106A, a protein that can block the attachment of the EV-A71 virus by associating with the SCARB2 lumenal loop. This interaction is thought to create a steric hindrance that prevents the virus from binding effectively, thereby inhibiting infection (Guo2022Type).
