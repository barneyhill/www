# PTPRB

## Overview
PTPRB, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type B, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, commonly referred to as vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with 17 fibronectin type III-like (FN3) domains, a transmembrane segment, and a single intracellular phosphatase domain (Drexler2019Vascular; hay2021structure). As a receptor-type phosphatase, PTPRB plays a crucial role in cell signaling by dephosphorylating specific tyrosine residues on target proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes. It is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, where it is involved in vascular development, maintenance, and remodeling (Luo2019miR6245p). PTPRB's interactions with proteins such as VE-cadherin and Tie-2 are essential for maintaining endothelial junction integrity and vascular permeability (El2024Analysis). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways, such as the Hippo pathway, underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease, including cancer progression and ocular health (Thomson2019Targeting; Luo2019miR6245p).

## Structure
PTPRB, also known as vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, and a single intracellular phosphatase domain. The extracellular region is notably large, comprising 17 fibronectin type III-like (FN3) domains, which contribute to its size of approximately 1500 residues (Drexler2019Vascular; hay2021structure). These FN3 domains are subject to N-linked glycosylation, a common post-translational modification that may influence protein folding and stability (El2024Analysis).

The extracellular domain of PTPRB is involved in interactions with key proteins such as VE-cadherin and Tie-2, playing a crucial role in regulating endothelial tight junctions and vascular permeability (El2024Analysis; Drexler2019Vascular). The interaction with VE-cadherin specifically involves the 17th FN3 domain, highlighting the functional significance of these domains (El2024Analysis).

While detailed structural information about the tertiary and quaternary structures of PTPRB is limited, the protein's extracellular domain is described as a 'rigid rod', which may facilitate its interactions with other cellular components (El2024Analysis). The intracellular phosphatase domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity, dephosphorylating substrates to regulate their function (Drexler2019Vascular).

## Function
PTPRB (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type B) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a significant role in cell signaling by dephosphorylating specific tyrosine residues on target proteins. In healthy human cells, PTPRB is primarily active in endothelial cells, where it influences vascular development and maintenance. It is involved in the formation, maintenance, and remodeling of blood vessels, acting as a vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (Luo2019miR6245p).

PTPRB negatively regulates branching morphogenesis in the mammary epithelium by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) activation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. This regulation is crucial for proper tubular organ development (Weng2019PTPRB). Additionally, PTPRB dephosphorylates the insulin receptor, thereby suppressing insulin-induced activation of the receptor and Akt, a key signaling protein involved in glucose metabolism and cell survival (Weng2019PTPRB).

PTPRB's role in cell biology extends to its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is critical for controlling organ size and inhibiting tissue overgrowth. This pathway is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Luo2019miR6245p).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRB gene have been implicated in various diseases. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), PTPRB is associated with promoting metastasis through the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). High expression levels of PTPRB in CRC tissues correlate with increased cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Weng2019PTPRB). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), decreased levels of PTPRB in plasma are linked to poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Sahni2020PSMD11).

PTPRB also plays a role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where a specific SNP, rs2252784, may be associated with tumor formation. This SNP results in a missense mutation that could affect protein interactions and contribute to oncogenic processes (NALKIRAN2023Investigation). In the context of glaucoma, PTPRB is involved in maintaining intraocular pressure homeostasis and protecting against retinal ganglion cell loss, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Thomson2019Targeting).

Overall, PTPRB's involvement in these conditions highlights its significance in cancer progression and other diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PTPRB, also known as Vascular Endothelial Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (VE-PTP), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for endothelial cell signaling and vascular development. It dephosphorylates key substrates such as the angiopoietin receptor TIE2, the endothelial adherens junction protein VE-cadherin, and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR2. These interactions are essential for regulating endothelial junctions and blood vessel development (Drexler2019Vascular).

PTPRB forms a ternary complex with TIE2 and EPHB4, a protein that becomes prominently phosphorylated upon VE-PTP inhibition. This complex plays a significant role in junctional signaling, maintaining endothelial cell-cell contact stability (Drexler2019Vascular). PTPRB also interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction and cell junctions, such as catenins, tight junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2, and the junctional scaffold protein MAGI1. It is associated with kinases like ROCK2, PECAM-1, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK/Ptk2), indicating its involvement in regulating endothelial junctions (Drexler2019Vascular).

In the context of ocular health, PTPRB modulates TEK signaling, which is crucial for the development and maintenance of Schlemm's canal, a key component of the aqueous humor outflow pathway. Inhibition of PTPRB leads to increased TEK phosphorylation, suggesting a regulatory role in TEK activation (Thomson2019Targeting).
