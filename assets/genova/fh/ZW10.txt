# ZW10

## Overview
ZW10 is a gene that encodes the zw10 kinetochore protein, a crucial component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. The zw10 protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in mitotic processes (Starr1997Conservation). Functionally, zw10 is integral to the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation by recruiting the Mad1-Mad2 complex to kinetochores (Kops2005ZW10). Additionally, zw10 is involved in membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular dynamics (Hirose2004Implication). Clinically, alterations in ZW10 expression are associated with cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, where its expression levels may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis (Dang2020Comprehensive). The gene's involvement in maintaining chromosomal stability further emphasizes its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Kops2005ZW10).

## Structure
The ZW10 protein is a component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which plays a crucial role in chromosome segregation during cell division. The primary structure of ZW10 is conserved across species, with significant sequence identity observed between Drosophila melanogaster and human ZW10 proteins, particularly in the carboxyl-terminal region (Starr1997Conservation). This conservation suggests the importance of the entire protein structure for its function.

ZW10 interacts with other proteins within the RZZ complex, contributing to its quaternary structure. It forms a complex with Rod and Zwilch, which is essential for recruiting the Mad1-Mad2 complex and the dynein-dynactin motor to kinetochores, facilitating spindle assembly checkpoint function (Gama2017Molecular; Altenfeld2015Complex). The interaction between ZW10 and Zwint-1 is also significant, as Zwint-1 is involved in recruiting ZW10 to kinetochores (Kops2005ZW10).

Post-translational modifications of ZW10 have been suggested, as indicated by the presence of a doublet in Western blots, although phosphorylation is unlikely to be responsible for this modification (Starr1997Conservation). The protein's localization and function are consistent across different species, highlighting its evolutionary conservation and critical role in mitotic processes (Starr1997Conservation).

## Function
ZW10 is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. ZW10 is part of a complex with Rod and Zwilch, which is essential for recruiting the Mad1-Mad2 complex to unattached kinetochores. This recruitment is crucial for the activation of the mitotic checkpoint, preventing premature anaphase onset and ensuring proper chromosome alignment (Kops2005ZW10).

Beyond its role in mitosis, ZW10 is involved in membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It forms a subcomplex with RINT-1 and p31, associating with syntaxin 18, a t-SNARE located in the ER. This complex is implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking, a vital process for protein and lipid transport within the cell (Hirose2004Implication).

ZW10 also recruits cytoplasmic dynein to kinetochores and subcellular membranes, such as the Golgi apparatus and ER, through the dynactin complex. This recruitment is essential for the proper functioning of dynein motor proteins in vesicular transport and cell migration (Vallee2006ZW10).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ZW10 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZW10 is notably upregulated in both adenoma and CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is more pronounced in early-stage CRC, where high ZW10 levels are associated with better overall survival. The gene's expression is linked to the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, influencing CRC progression. These findings suggest that ZW10 expression and its 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels could serve as potential biomarkers for early CRC diagnosis and prognosis (Dang2020Comprehensive).

Mutations in ZW10 and its associated complex components, such as Rod and Zwilch, have been identified in human colorectal cancers, contributing to chromosome instability, a condition often linked to tumorigenesis. This instability is a hallmark of aneuploidy, which is prevalent in highly aneuploid colorectal cancers (Kops2005ZW10).

In mouse oocytes, ZW10 is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during meiotic maturation. Knockdown of ZW10 leads to chromosome misalignment and increased aneuploidy, suggesting its role in preventing age-related fertility issues and aneuploidy (Park2019Zw10).

## Interactions
ZW10 is a component of the RZZ complex, which includes Rod and Zwilch proteins. This complex is essential for mitotic checkpoint signaling and chromosome segregation. ZW10 interacts with the Rod protein, forming a complex that is crucial for the mitotic checkpoint, as it helps maintain high levels of Cdk1 kinase activity necessary for this process (Kops2005ZW10). The ZW10-Rod-Zwilch complex is involved in recruiting the Mad1-Mad2 complex to unattached kinetochores, which is vital for the mitotic checkpoint's function (Kops2005ZW10).

ZW10 also interacts with Zwint-1, which is necessary for its recruitment to kinetochores. This interaction is crucial for the localization of ZW10 to unattached kinetochores (Kops2005ZW10). ZW10's interaction with the dynamitin subunit of the dynactin complex suggests its role in anchoring dynactin and dynein to the kinetochore, which is important for chromosome movement during cell division (Vallee2006ZW10).

ZW10 is also implicated in membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It forms a complex with syntaxin 18, RINT-1, and p31, indicating a role in vesicular transport processes (Hirose2004Implication). This interaction suggests a potential link between membrane trafficking and cell cycle regulation (Hirose2004Implication).
