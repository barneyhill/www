# SMARCC1

## Overview
SMARCC1 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily c member 1, commonly referred to as BAF155. This protein is a pivotal component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is essential for modulating chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. As a scaffold protein, BAF155 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the BAF complex, facilitating various cellular processes such as DNA repair, replication, and transcription (Chen2020A). The protein is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions, forming dimers with its paralog SMARCC2 and interacting with other core subunits, which underscores its importance in chromatin remodeling activities (Mashtalir2018Modular). Mutations and alterations in SMARCC1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Singh2023A; Xiao2021SMARCC1).

## Structure
The SMARCC1 protein, also known as BAF155, is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains. The N-terminus of SMARCC1 contains a MarR-like domain, a chromodomain, and a BRCT domain, which form a module interconnected by a hydrogen-bond network. Notably, the chromodomain in this structure has lost its canonical function of binding to methylated lysines (Allen2021SWI/SNF).

SMARCC1 is part of the core module of the BAF complex, which forms a triangular lower lobe abutting the nucleosome. This core module's base is formed by a helical bundle that includes the coiled-coil domains of SMARCC1/2, SMARCD, and SMARCE1. The SANT and SWIRM domains of SMARCC1 form one side of the V-shaped core module, ending in the SMARCB1 subunit, which interacts with the nucleosome (Mashtalir2020A).

Post-translational modifications of SMARCC1 include lysine methylation, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of SWI/SNF complex assembly. Methylated SMARCC1 is targeted for proteolysis, a process essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the complexes (Guo2022The).

## Function
SMARCC1, also known as BAF155, is a key component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. This complex is involved in mobilizing nucleosomes, thereby regulating DNA accessibility, which is essential for various cellular processes such as DNA repair, replication, and transcription (Chen2020A). SMARCC1 functions as a scaffold protein, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the BAF complex, and is critical for chromatin remodeling activities that facilitate transcriptional regulation (Chen2020A).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, SMARCC1 is involved in the repression of self-renewal genes like Nanog and Oct4 during differentiation. It is necessary for proper gene repression and lineage-specific gene induction, indicating its role in chromatin structure changes essential for differentiation (Schaniel2009Smarcc1Baf155). SMARCC1 is also implicated in the deposition of histone marks associated with gene repression, such as H3K27me3, at key promoter regions, further highlighting its role in chromatin compaction and heterochromatin formation during differentiation (Schaniel2009Smarcc1Baf155). These activities underscore SMARCC1's importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its involvement in developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SMARCC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, SMARCC1 is often downregulated, particularly in cases with a Gleason score greater than 7, which is associated with poor prognosis. The loss of SMARCC1 expression leads to increased cell proliferation, metastasis, and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in this context (Xiao2021SMARCC1).

In pancreatic cancer, SMARCC1 is targeted by miR-320c, which reduces its expression and contributes to gemcitabine resistance. This interaction highlights the role of SMARCC1 in drug resistance mechanisms, where its downregulation is linked to poorer treatment outcomes (Iwagami2013miR320c).

SMARCC1 mutations are also associated with a novel syndrome termed 'SMARCC1-associated Developmental Dysgenesis Syndrome (SaDDS),' characterized by developmental delay, cerebral ventriculomegaly, and structural brain and cardiac defects. These mutations disrupt the function of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, leading to epigenetic dysregulation in neural progenitors and contributing to conditions such as congenital hydrocephalus (Singh2023A).

## Interactions
SMARCC1, also known as BAF155, is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and participates in various protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and function of this complex. SMARCC1 forms dimers with its paralog SMARCC2, serving as a platform for the assembly of the mSWI/SNF complex. These dimers can be either homo- or heterodimers, depending on the cellular context (Mashtalir2018Modular). SMARCC1 interacts with other core subunits such as SMARCE1, SMARCD, and ARID1 subunits, playing a crucial role in bridging the BAF core module to other complex components (Mashtalir2018Modular).

The interaction of SMARCC1 with LSD1 and L3MBTL3 is critical for its stability within the mSWI/SNF complex. LSD1 silencing leads to the proteolysis of SMARCC1, which can be mitigated by co-silencing L3MBTL3, indicating that L3MBTL3 mediates SMARCC1 degradation (Guo2022The). SMARCC1 also interacts with SOX2, a transcription factor important for maintaining pluripotency, and mutations in SMARCC1 can affect SOX2 stability (Guo2022The). These interactions highlight the role of SMARCC1 in maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the SWI/SNF complex.
