# FGR

## Overview
The FGR gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the Src family of kinases, which are integral to various cellular signaling pathways. The protein product, FGR proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase, also known as p55c-fgr, is characterized by its SH2 and SH3 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its role in cellular signaling and localization (Liu1994Oncogenes). FGR is primarily expressed in specific cell types, including Epstein-Barr virus-infected B lymphocytes and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where it plays a significant role in regulating cell migration, immune responses, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Katamine1988Primary). The kinase activity of FGR is essential for the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in cell motility and signal transduction, such as the p85 subunit of PI3K and focal adhesion kinase (Continolo2005The). Additionally, FGR's interactions with integrins and other proteins underscore its involvement in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in hematopoietic cells (Thomas1997CELLULAR). The gene's expression and activity have clinical implications, particularly in the context of leukemic cell differentiation and potential therapeutic applications (Kazim2024FGR).

## Structure
The FGR proto-oncogene encodes a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which are involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The FGR protein, known as p55c-fgr, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich sequences, and an SH2 domain, which interacts with phosphotyrosine-containing sequences (Liu1994Oncogenes). These domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization.

The primary structure of p55c-fgr includes a unique 75-residue polypeptide specified by exon 2, distinguishing it from other Src family kinases like Src, Yes, and Fyn (Katamine1988Primary). The protein shares sequence similarity with other Src family members from amino acid position 76 to nearly the C-terminus, but the first 75 amino acids show reduced relatedness (Katamine1988Primary).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating FGR's activity. The protein is subject to serine/threonine phosphorylation, although the functional significance of these modifications is not fully understood (Superti‐Furga1995Structure‐function). The expression of c-fgr is limited to specific cell types, including Epstein-Barr virus-infected B lymphocytes and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Katamine1988Primary).

## Function
The FGR proto-oncogene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the Src family of kinases, playing a crucial role in regulating cell migration and signal transduction pathways. In healthy human cells, FGR is involved in the phosphorylation of several proteins, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), cortactin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which are essential for cell motility and cytoskeletal dynamics (Continolo2005The). FGR's localization to the plasma membrane is critical for its function, as it facilitates the activation of Rac, a small GTPase involved in cell migration, and the phosphorylation of the Rho inhibitor p190RhoGAP (Continolo2005The).

FGR's kinase activity, while not entirely essential, is required for optimal cell migration, indicating its role in phosphorylating specific substrates involved in the migration process (Continolo2005The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, influencing immune cell function and contributing to cellular responses to external stimuli (Lowell1994Functional). FGR's involvement in these pathways is crucial for normal cellular functions, including immune responses and the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics (Continolo2005The).

## Clinical Significance
The FGR gene, a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways that can influence cell differentiation and proliferation. Alterations in FGR expression have been implicated in the differentiation of leukemic cells, particularly in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). FGR expression in myeloid progenitor leukemia cells can mimic retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in differentiation therapy for certain leukemias (Kazim2024FGR). 

FGR has been shown to enhance the expression of key signaling components such as RAF, LYN, SLP-76, and CBL, which are involved in RA-induced differentiation (Kazim2024FGR). This suggests that FGR may serve as a single triggering event for differentiation, challenging its traditional view as primarily promoting tumorigenesis (Kazim2024FGR). However, in RA-resistant cells, FGR expression alone is insufficient to overcome resistance, indicating that other signaling defects or collaborators are involved (Kazim2024FGR). 

The dual role of FGR in promoting differentiation versus tumorigenesis may depend on the availability of target/binding sites and stoichiometry, highlighting its complex role in oncogenesis and potential clinical significance in diseases where RA-induced differentiation is relevant (Kazim2024FGR).

## Interactions
FGR, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. FGR interacts with integrins, particularly β2 integrins, in neutrophils. This interaction is enhanced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and is necessary for signaling processes such as neutrophil spreading and respiratory burst. In neutrophils from patients lacking β2 integrins, FGR activation does not occur, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Thomas1997CELLULAR).

FGR also participates in interactions with GPI-linked receptors and TM4 proteins, such as GPIV and caveolin. These interactions suggest a role for FGR in integrin-mediated signaling and other cellular processes (Thomas1997CELLULAR). The SH2 and SH3 domains of FGR are involved in mediating specific protein interactions. The SH2 domain of FGR recognizes distinct proteins, while the SH3 domain shows less specificity. In HL60 cells, a doublet of 95 kDa proteins binds to both FYN and FGR SH2 domains, indicating shared binding partners (RiveroLezcano1994Specificity).

These interactions are critical for the regulation of FGR's activity and its involvement in various signaling pathways, particularly in hematopoietic cells.
