# ST6GAL2

## Overview
ST6GAL2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST6 beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 2, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is part of the sialyltransferase family and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to galactose residues in an alpha-2,6 linkage. This biochemical modification is essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins. ST6GAL2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, indicating a specialized role in neural development and function, and its expression is regulated by alternative promoters and transcription factors. The enzyme's activity is also implicated in inflammatory processes, as it responds to cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (Krzewinski‐Recchi2003Identification; Anne2010Comprehensive; Lehoux2009Transcriptional).

## Structure
The ST6GAL2 protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, characterized by a conserved architecture typical of sialyltransferases. It features a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain rich in leucine and phenylalanine residues, and a variable stem domain that extends the catalytic domain into the Golgi lumen (Anne2010Comprehensive). The catalytic domain contains conserved peptide motifs known as sialylmotifs (L, S, III, and VS), which are crucial for enzyme function, including donor and acceptor binding and catalysis (Anne2010Comprehensive). These motifs are conserved across vertebrate species, indicating their evolutionary significance (Anne2010Comprehensive).

The ST6GAL2 enzyme is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process important for cell-cell interactions and signaling. It catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to the terminal galactose residue of type II disaccharides through an α2,6-linkage (Anne2010Comprehensive). The enzyme's structure is adapted for its localization in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as part of the sialylation pathway (Teppa2016PhylogeneticDerived). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability. Variants of ST6GAL2 can arise from alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms (Ohmi2020Majority).

## Function
ST6GAL2 encodes a sialyltransferase enzyme that is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, specifically adding sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage to galactose residues. This modification is crucial for cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins. The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the biosynthesis of sialylated oligosaccharides, which are important for various cellular processes, including cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions, as well as bacterial and virus adhesion (Krzewinski‐Recchi2003Identification).

ST6GAL2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, suggesting a specialized role in neural development and function. It is involved in the synthesis of specific α2,6-sialylated glycoconjugates, which may compensate for the low expression of ST6GAL1 in the brain (Lehoux2009Transcriptional). The enzyme's activity is regulated by alternative promoters and transcription factors, indicating a complex regulation of its expression in neuronal cells (Lehoux2009Transcriptional). The expression of ST6GAL2 in response to cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8 also suggests a potential role in inflammation processes (Lehoux2009Transcriptional).
