# FREM1

## Overview
FREM1, or FRAS1 related extracellular matrix 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the extracellular matrix (ECM), specifically involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. The FREM1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple functional domains such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) repeats and a calcium-binding Calx-β domain, facilitating its role in cell adhesion and signaling. It forms a ternary complex with FRAS1 and FREM2, crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM and is implicated in various developmental processes, including cranial suture development and tissue integrity. Mutations in FREM1 are associated with several clinical conditions, such as Fraser syndrome, isolated metopic craniosynostosis, and Manitoba oculotrichoanal syndrome, underscoring its significance in craniofacial development and other congenital anomalies (Chen2023Two; Kashem2021The; Vissers2011Heterozygous).

## Structure
The FREM1 protein is composed of several functional domains, including a conserved signal sequence, a CALXb calcium-binding loop typically found in Na+-Ca+ exchange proteins, 12 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) elements, and a C-terminal lectin Type C domain (Vissers2011Heterozygous). These domains suggest a complex structure that facilitates its role in the extracellular matrix, particularly in cell adhesion and signaling. The CSPG repeats are highly homologous with each other and are evolutionarily conserved, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Vissers2011Heterozygous).

FREM1 forms a ternary complex with FRAS1 and FREM2, although the exact topology and stoichiometry of these interactions are not fully understood (Vissers2011Heterozygous). The protein's structure is likely influenced by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which is common in extracellular matrix proteins. These modifications may affect the protein's stability and interactions with other molecules.

The presence of splice variants of FREM1 suggests that different isoforms may exist, potentially with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the available context (Vissers2011Heterozygous). The structural complexity of FREM1 underlies its critical role in embryonic development and tissue integrity.

## Function
The FREM1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a significant role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. It is primarily secreted by mesenchymal cells and is involved in forming stable complexes with other Fras/FREM-related proteins, such as FRAS1 and FREM2, at the basement membrane. This complex is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM and is involved in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Vissers2011Heterozygous; Kashem2021The).

FREM1 is expressed in various tissues, including the dermal layer of the skin, eyelids, head, limbs, diaphragm, intestine, lung, kidney, and craniofacial structures. In humans, high levels of FREM1 expression are observed in cervical tissues, the small intestine, and kidneys (Kashem2021The). The protein contains multiple functional domains, such as an N-terminal signal sequence, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) tandem repeats, a calcium-binding Calx-β domain, and a C-terminal LecC domain, which facilitate interactions with extracellular matrix molecules, contributing to cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration (Kashem2021The).

FREM1 is also involved in cranial suture development, particularly in the regulation of suture patency, which is crucial for normal craniofacial development (Vissers2011Heterozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FREM1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting craniofacial development. Heterozygous mutations in FREM1 have been linked to isolated metopic craniosynostosis (MC), a condition characterized by the premature fusion of the metopic suture in the skull, leading to trigonocephaly. This association is supported by studies in both humans and mouse models, where FREM1 mutations result in variable sutural anomalies and craniofacial abnormalities (Vissers2011Heterozygous).

FREM1 mutations are also implicated in bifid nose with or without anorectal and renal anomalies syndrome (BNAR) and Manitoba oculotrichoanal syndrome (MOTA), both of which involve craniofacial dysmorphism. Novel mutations in FREM1 have been identified in patients with bifid nose, suggesting a potential correlation between these mutations and nasal deformities (Chen2023Two).

Additionally, FREM1 is part of a complex with FREM2 and FRAS1, and its deficiency has been linked to congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Mouse models deficient in FREM1 exhibit morphogenetic and vascular abnormalities in the diaphragm, indicating a role in the development of CDH (Jordan2018The). These findings highlight the gene's significance in developmental processes and its involvement in various syndromes.

## Interactions
FREM1 is known to form a ternary complex with FRAS1 and FREM2, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial-mesenchymal integrity. This complex is involved in the basement membrane, where it undergoes reciprocal stabilization, and its deficiency can lead to developmental defects such as epidermal blistering and Fraser syndrome (Wang2022Comprehensive; Beck2013Novel).

FREM1 also interacts with platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC). This interaction occurs in the basement membrane and dermal extracellular matrix, where FREM1 binds to PDGFC, influencing PDGFRα signaling. This interaction is important for the regulation of TIMP1 expression and extracellular matrix remodeling, including collagen I deposition. FREM1's role in this signaling pathway is crucial for maintaining the normal duration and amplitude of PI3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and MAPK activation following PDGFC stimulation (Wiradjaja2013Regulation).

Mutations in FREM1 can lead to a frame shift and premature stop codon, affecting its structure and interactions. These mutations can disrupt the protein's ability to interact with other proteins, potentially leading to conditions like Fraser syndrome (Wiradjaja2013Regulation).
