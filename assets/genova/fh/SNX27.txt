# SNX27

## Overview
SNX27 (sorting nexin 27) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the endosomal recycling of transmembrane receptors, playing a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis and signaling. The protein, sorting nexin 27, is categorized as a cargo adaptor and is characterized by its PDZ, PX, and FERM domains, which facilitate interactions with various cellular components, including the retromer complex and ESCPE-1 (Simonetti2022SNX27–Retromer; Chandra2021Toward). SNX27 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is essential for neuronal functions such as synaptic plasticity and cognitive development, by regulating the trafficking of receptors like AMPA and NMDA (Loo2014A; Chandra2021Toward). Dysregulation of SNX27 has been linked to several neurological disorders, including Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Chandra2021Toward; Deb2022Endosomal).

## Structure
SNX27 (sorting nexin 27) is a protein characterized by three distinct domains: an N-terminal PDZ domain, a central PX domain, and a C-terminal FERM domain, which is further divided into F1, F2, and F3 subdomains (Chandra2021Toward; Deb2022Endosomal). The PDZ domain is crucial for recognizing and binding to specific receptors containing PDZ-binding motifs, such as GPCRs, ion channels, and neuronal proteins (Chandra2021Toward). This domain is also involved in interactions with the retromer VPS26 subunit, enhancing cargo binding affinity (Chandra2021Toward).

The PX domain of SNX27 adopts a globular fold and contains conserved regions, including a 'PPK loop' and a positively charged surface pocket for binding negatively charged phosphoinositides, such as PI3P, which is essential for directing SNX27 to endosomes (Rincón2011Translocation; Chandra2021Toward).

The FERM domain, particularly the F3 subdomain, is involved in binding Ras GTPases and cargo receptors using NPxY motifs (Chandra2021Toward). It also interacts with SNX1 and SNX2 through tandem aDLF motifs, which are crucial for endosomal recycling (Simonetti2022SNX27–Retromer). The FERM domain's unique basic surface, composed of specific positively charged residues, is essential for binding to ESCPE-1 (Simonetti2022SNX27–Retromer).

SNX27 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its function and interactions (Deb2022Endosomal).

## Function
Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is a crucial protein involved in the endosomal recycling of transmembrane receptors, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It functions as a 'cargo adaptor' in conjunction with the retromer complex, facilitating the sorting of transmembrane proteins from endosomes back to the plasma membrane, thus preventing their degradation in lysosomes (Chandra2021Toward; Lauffer2010SNX27). SNX27 is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in neuronal functions, including synaptic plasticity and cognitive development, by regulating the trafficking of receptors such as AMPA and NMDA receptors (Loo2014A; Chandra2021Toward).

SNX27 contains a PDZ domain that binds to PDZ-binding motifs on target proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, facilitating their recycling to the plasma membrane (Chandra2021Toward; Lauffer2010SNX27). This interaction is critical for processes like neuronal excitability and synaptic communication (Chandra2021Toward). SNX27 also interacts with the retromer complex, enhancing the affinity for PDZ-binding motifs and coordinating cargo sorting (Chandra2021Toward).

In addition to its role in receptor recycling, SNX27 is involved in regulating signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, and is implicated in autophagy, which is essential for degrading damaged organelles and proteins (Chandra2021Toward). Disruption of SNX27 function is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Chandra2021Toward).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SNX27 gene have been implicated in several neurological and degenerative diseases. In Down syndrome, SNX27 expression is downregulated due to the overexpression of miR-155, leading to cognitive and synaptic impairments. This downregulation can be reversed by overexpressing SNX27, highlighting its potential therapeutic role (Deb2022Endosomal). SNX27 is also associated with Alzheimer's disease, where its dysfunction affects the recycling of the amyloid precursor protein, potentially enhancing amyloid peptide production (Chandra2021Toward).

In cancer, SNX27 is highly expressed in several types, including invasive breast cancer, where it influences tumor growth and cell aggressiveness. Loss of SNX27 reduces tumor growth and proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chandra2021Toward; Deb2022Endosomal). In acute myeloid leukemia, SNX27 promotes tumorigenesis, and its absence significantly reduces tumor cell growth and viability (Deb2022Endosomal).

SNX27 also plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease and is involved in synaptic dysfunctions linked to cognitive impairments (Chandra2021Toward). Its role in recycling glutamate receptors is crucial for maintaining synaptic function, and disruptions can lead to learning and memory disabilities (Huo2020Overexpression).

## Interactions
SNX27 (sorting nexin 27) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate endosomal recycling. It forms a complex with the Retromer, which includes VPS26A/B, VPS35, and VPS29, and directly binds to ESCPE-1, a heterodimeric assembly of SNX1 or SNX2 with SNX5 or SNX6. This interaction is mediated by the FERM domain of SNX27, which associates with SNX1 and SNX2 through tandem acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs (Simonetti2022SNX27–Retromer).

The FERM domain of SNX27 is crucial for binding ESCPE-1, with specific residues (R437, R438, K495, K496, R498, and K501) playing a key role. Mutagenesis studies have shown that altering these residues affects SNX27's ability to bind ESCPE-1, although it retains the ability to associate with the Retromer complex (Simonetti2022SNX27–Retromer).

SNX27 also interacts with the WASH complex, particularly with FAM21, which is important for endosome-to-cell surface recycling. This interaction is crucial for the SNX27/retromer coat assembly (Chandra2021Toward). Additionally, SNX27 binds to the small GTPase Ras through its FERM domain, suggesting a link between Ras signaling and SNX27-mediated cargo sorting (Chandra2021Toward).
