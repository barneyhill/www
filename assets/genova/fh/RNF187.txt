# RNF187

## Overview
RNF187 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 187, a member of the RING finger protein family characterized by the presence of a RING domain. This domain is integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The protein plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and signal transduction pathways, by modulating protein stability and interactions. RNF187 is particularly significant in cancer biology, where it has been implicated in the regulation of key signaling pathways such as the Hippo/YAP and Notch1 pathways, influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis in cancers like breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Li2022Regulation; Wang2020Regulation; Zhang2019An).

## Structure
RNF187, also known as ring finger protein 187, is characterized by the presence of a RING domain, which spans amino acids 1-72. This domain is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination process by mediating protein-protein interactions (Li2022Regulation; Wang2020Regulation). The protein also contains a protein interaction domain located between amino acids 163-235, which is essential for its interaction with substrates such as P53 (Li2022Regulation). 

RNF187 is involved in various cellular processes through its post-translational modifications, primarily ubiquitination, which influences its stability and function (Li2022Regulation). The protein's structure allows it to interact with different signaling pathways, such as the Hippo/YAP axis in triple-negative breast cancer and the Notch1 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (Wang2020Regulation; Zhang2019An). 

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RNF187 are not provided, its functional domains and post-translational modifications highlight its role in modulating protein interactions and signaling pathways in various cancer types.

## Function
RNF187, or ring finger protein 187, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for tagging proteins for degradation. This protein contains a RING finger domain, a specialized motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity. Through its ubiquitin ligase function, RNF187 plays a significant role in regulating protein turnover, ensuring that damaged or unneeded proteins are efficiently degraded, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis.

In healthy human cells, RNF187 is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis. By regulating the degradation of specific proteins, RNF187 influences cell signaling pathways that control these processes. This regulation is essential for normal cell function and survival, as it helps to prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful proteins that could disrupt cellular activities.

The activity of RNF187 is primarily localized within the cell, where it interacts with other proteins to execute its functions. Its role in ubiquitination and protein turnover underscores its importance in maintaining the balance of protein synthesis and degradation, which is vital for the proper functioning of cells and the organism as a whole.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF187 gene have been implicated in various cancers, affecting tumor progression and patient prognosis. In breast cancer, RNF187 facilitates the degradation of the p53 protein, promoting cell invasion and proliferation, particularly in luminal-type breast cancers where it is necessary for cell growth and resistance to apoptosis. High RNF187 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with wild-type p53 (Li2022Regulation). In contrast, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RNF187 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, correlating with a better prognosis (Wang2020Regulation).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RNF187 is overexpressed, enhancing cell viability, migration, and invasion, and is linked to poor patient outcomes. Its overexpression promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to apoptosis, suggesting its role as a driver of NSCLC progression (Fu2019Overexpression). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF187 is a direct target of Notch1 signaling, contributing to aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. High RNF187 expression in HCC is associated with larger tumor size and advanced disease stages, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2019An).

## Interactions
RNF187, a RING finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the YAP protein, a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where RNF187 negatively regulates YAP, thereby inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion (Wang2020Regulation).

RNF187 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein P53, promoting its degradation through K48-linked polyubiquitination. This interaction is independent of MDM2, another protein known to regulate P53. RNF187's interaction with P53 involves the DNA binding domain of P53 and the C-terminal domain of RNF187. This interaction leads to decreased P53 stability and function, affecting cell growth and apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Li2022Regulation).

These interactions highlight RNF187's role in modulating key signaling pathways, such as Hippo/YAP and P53, which are critical in cancer progression and treatment. The dual role of RNF187 in different breast cancer subtypes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022Regulation; Wang2020Regulation).
