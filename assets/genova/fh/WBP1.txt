# WBP1

## Overview
WBP1 (WW domain binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly through its interactions with WW domain-containing proteins. The protein encoded by WBP1 is a type I ER transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) complex, essential for N-glycosylation, a critical process for protein folding and stability (Li2003A). Additionally, WBP1 is a key player in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it acts as a signaling adaptor by binding to the WW domains of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation (McDonald2011Biophysical). Through its interactions with proteins such as YAP and the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4, WBP1 is implicated in cellular signaling pathways that regulate organ size, tumor suppression, and ubiquitination processes (JOLLIFFE2000Identification).

## Function
WBP1 (WW domain binding protein 1) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with WW domains, which are protein-protein interaction modules. In healthy human cells, WBP1 plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of organ size and tumor suppression. This pathway involves the interaction of WBP1 with the YAP2 transcriptional regulator, where WBP1 acts as a signaling adaptor by binding to the WW domains of YAP2 through its PPXY motifs. These interactions are essential for the transcriptional activity of certain receptors, highlighting WBP1's role in cellular signaling and regulation (McDonald2011Biophysical).

WBP1 is also implicated in the oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) complex, where it functions as a type I ER transmembrane protein. Its transmembrane domain is crucial for its incorporation into the OT complex, which is essential for N-glycosylation of proteins, a process vital for protein folding and stability (Li2003A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell growth and differentiation by modulating pathways like the Hippo signaling pathway, thereby influencing cellular and organismal outcomes (Ortega2017Characteristics).

## Interactions
WBP1 (WW domain binding protein 1) is known for its interactions with proteins containing WW domains, which are critical for various cellular processes. WBP1 interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional regulator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction is mediated through the PPXY motifs in WBP1, which bind to the WW domains of YAP, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation (McDonald2011Biophysical; Chen1995The).

The binding of WBP1 to YAP is characterized by specific interactions with the WW domains, where the integrity of the PPXY sequence is essential for high-affinity binding. The interaction is primarily driven by favorable enthalpic forces, suggesting specific intermolecular contacts such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions (McDonald2011Biophysical).

WBP1 also interacts with the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4, which contains multiple WW domains. The PY motifs in WBP1 bind to these domains, although not all PY motifs are essential for binding. This interaction suggests a role for WBP1 in cellular processes mediated by Nedd4, potentially involving ubiquitination pathways (JOLLIFFE2000Identification). These interactions highlight the role of WBP1 in modulating protein-protein interactions critical for cellular signaling and development.
