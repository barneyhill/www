# UNC13D

## Overview
The UNC13D gene encodes the protein unc-13 homolog D, commonly referred to as Munc13-4, which is a critical component in the regulation of exocytosis in immune cells. Munc13-4 is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein involved in vesicle trafficking and is essential for the fusion of cytotoxic granules with the plasma membrane in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. This process is vital for the immune response, as it facilitates the release of cytotoxic molecules that induce apoptosis in target cells (Galgano2020Alternative; Elstak2011A). Beyond its role in immune cells, Munc13-4 is also involved in the secretion of platelet dense core granules and neutrophil granules, highlighting its broader significance in exocytosis across various cell types (Galgano2020Alternative). Mutations in the UNC13D gene are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3 (FHL3), a severe immunological disorder characterized by impaired cytotoxic function due to defective granule exocytosis (Sieni2011Genotypephenotype; Santoro2008Mutations).

## Structure


## Function
The UNC13D gene encodes the Munc13-4 protein, which plays a critical role in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in immune cells, such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Munc13-4 is essential for the final step of cytotoxic granule fusion with the plasma membrane at the immunological synapse, facilitating the release of cytotoxic molecules like perforin and granzymes that induce target cell death (Galgano2020Alternative; Elstak2011A). This protein is involved in the formation of the SNARE complex, which is crucial for vesicle fusion processes (Galgano2020Alternative).

Munc13-4 is also important for platelet dense core granule secretion and neutrophil granule release, indicating its role as a rate-limiting factor in exocytosis across different cell types (Galgano2020Alternative). The protein interacts with Rab27a and Rab11+ recycling endosomes, contributing to the formation of cytotoxic granule precursors and their subsequent priming and fusion with the plasma membrane (Galgano2020Alternative). Munc13-4 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the priming of secretory lysosomes, enabling effective immune responses (Galgano2020Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNC13D gene are primarily associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3 (FHL3), a severe hyperinflammatory disorder. FHL3 is characterized by symptoms such as fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and often central nervous system involvement. These symptoms result from impaired cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes due to defective exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, which is crucial for immune regulation (Sieni2011Genotypephenotype; Santoro2008Mutations; Takushi2020Lentiviral).

Mutations in UNC13D can include missense, nonsense, deletions, splicing errors, and inversions, leading to reduced or absent activity of the Munc13-4 protein. This protein is essential for the priming of secretory granules in immune cells, and its deficiency results in a failure to deliver effector proteins like perforin and granzymes, causing a hyper-inflammatory state (Meeths2011Familial; Amirifar2020Clinical).

UNC13D mutations are also implicated in other conditions, such as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), where variations in the gene may contribute to disease pathogenesis by affecting granule exocytosis and immune cell function (Aricò2013Variations).

## Interactions
UNC13D, also known as Munc13-4, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) through its FERM domain in a calcium-dependent manner, influencing FAK phosphorylation and playing a role in the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. This interaction is part of the RAB11-UNC13D-FAK axis, which is crucial for integrin recycling and focal adhesion turnover (Duong2024Recycling).

UNC13D also interacts with RAB11, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and exosome release. This interaction is essential for the docking of Rab11-positive vesicles to the plasma membrane, acting as an effector molecule in the recycling of integrins (Johnson2016Munc134; Duong2024Recycling).

In immune cells, UNC13D functions as a RAB27A-effector, coordinating lytic granule secretion in T cells and neutrophils. It also interacts with SNARE proteins such as STX7 and VAMP8, which are involved in endosomal tethering and fusion processes, crucial for endolysosomal trafficking and autophagy regulation (Zhang2019Crossregulation). These interactions highlight UNC13D's role in both cancer cell migration and immune cell function.
