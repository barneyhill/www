# KYNU

## Overview
The KYNU gene encodes the enzyme kynureninase, a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This pathway is crucial for the degradation of tryptophan, leading to the production of several biologically significant metabolites, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is essential for cellular redox reactions. Kynureninase specifically catalyzes the conversion of L-kynurenine to anthranilic acid, a key step in this metabolic route. The enzyme is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, and is involved in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular redox balance. Genetic variations in KYNU, such as the rs2304705 polymorphism, have been associated with conditions like essential hypertension and xanthurenic aciduria, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2011A; Chen2009Kynurenine; Boros2018Genetic).

## Structure
The KYNU gene encodes the kynureninase enzyme, which is involved in the kynurenine pathway. The protein is composed of 465 amino acids and has a molecular weight of over 52 kDa (Boros2018Genetic). It functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits associate to form the active enzyme. Kynureninase requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor, suggesting the presence of a PLP-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Boros2018Genetic).

The primary structure of kynureninase includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its function. Notably, genetic polymorphisms can lead to amino acid changes that affect enzyme activity. For example, the rs2304705 polymorphism results in an Arg to Gln switch at position 188, reducing enzyme activity by 50% (Boros2018Genetic). This variant, Arg188Gln, is associated with essential hypertension and is more prevalent in certain populations, such as the Han Chinese (Zhang2011A).

The enzyme's secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the provided context, but the presence of conserved residues like Arg188 suggests functional importance across mammalian species (Zhang2011A). The context does not provide information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The KYNU gene encodes the enzyme kynureninase, which plays a crucial role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This pathway is the primary route for the degradation of tryptophan, an essential amino acid, and is involved in the production of several metabolites with significant biological functions. Kynureninase specifically catalyzes the conversion of L-kynurenine into anthranilic acid, a step that is essential for the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a vital cofactor in cellular redox reactions (Zhang2011A; Boros2018Genetic).

In healthy human cells, kynureninase is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, bone marrow, immune system organs, kidney, urinary bladder, lung, and brain, with the highest expression observed in the liver (Boros2018Genetic). The enzyme requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor for its activity. Kynureninase activity is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and modulating immune responses, as it influences the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites, which have neuroactive and immunomodulatory properties (Chen2009Kynurenine; Boros2018Genetic). The enzyme's activity can be modulated by inflammatory signals, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Asp2011Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KYNU gene, which encodes the enzyme kynureninase, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Genetic alterations in KYNU, such as polymorphisms, are associated with essential hypertension. The SNP rs2304705, which results in an Arg to Gln switch at the 188th amino acid position, is more frequent in hypertensive patients and is linked to higher blood pressure and reduced enzyme activity (Boros2018Genetic).

KYNU mutations can also lead to xanthurenic aciduria, a metabolic disorder characterized by excessive urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid and 3-hydroxykynurenine. This condition is caused by mutations like c.593A>G, which results in a threonine-to-alanine substitution, disrupting tryptophan metabolism (Christensen2007Xanthurenic).

In addition, biallelic variants in KYNU are associated with a multisystemic syndrome featuring hand hyperphalangism, heart defects, and developmental delays. These variants can cause kynureninase deficiency, leading to metabolic blocks in the tryptophan catabolic pathway (Ehmke2020Biallelic).

KYNU expression is also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, where it is upregulated in lesional skin, correlating with disease severity. This upregulation is linked to increased inflammation, contrasting with the immune-suppressive role of other enzymes in the pathway (Harden2016The).
