# RBL2

## Overview
The RBL2 gene encodes the RB transcriptional corepressor like 2 protein, commonly referred to as p130, which is a member of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional corepressor, playing a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting E2F transcription factors, thereby controlling the transition from the G1 to S phase. As a component of the mammalian DREAM complex, p130 is instrumental in maintaining cellular quiescence and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is vital for tumor suppression. Additionally, p130 is involved in multiciliogenesis, where it modulates the activity of the transcription factor Multicilin. The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and functional roles in various cellular processes (Quiroz2024RBL2; Henley2012The).

## Structure
The RBL2 gene encodes the protein p130, a member of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family, which functions as a transcriptional corepressor. The primary structure of p130 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the RBL2 gene. The protein's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, crucial for its interaction with E2F transcription factors.

A significant feature of p130 is the pocket domain, which is important for binding to E2F and other regulatory proteins. This domain is characterized by an A-box portion, a spacer domain, and a B-box portion, which are essential for its role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional repression (Brunet2020Biallelic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate the activity of p130, influencing its ability to control the cell cycle and gene expression (Fiorentino2009Senescence).

Splice variants of RBL2 may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and modifications enable it to play a critical role in cellular processes such as senescence and multiciliogenesis (Quiroz2024RBL2).

## Function
The RBL2 gene encodes the Retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (p130), a member of the retinoblastoma (RB) family of proteins, which are crucial regulators of the cell cycle. In healthy human cells, RBL2/p130 functions as a transcriptional corepressor, primarily inhibiting the activity of E2F transcription factors to control the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Henley2012The). This repression is essential for maintaining cellular quiescence and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Enrico2021Cyclin).

RBL2/p130 is a component of the mammalian DREAM complex, which assembles during quiescence to inhibit the transcription of numerous cell cycle genes regulated by E2F, B-MYB, and FoxM1 transcription factors (Enrico2021Cyclin). This complex plays a critical role in maintaining a state of growth arrest, thereby suppressing tumorigenesis (Henley2012The).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, RBL2 is involved in multiciliogenesis, where it represses the transcriptional activity of Multicilin, a transcription factor crucial for this process. This repression is modulated by phosphorylation, which allows Multicilin to drive multiciliogenesis under specific conditions (Quiroz2024RBL2). RBL2's activity is primarily nuclear, where it interacts with chromatin to modulate gene expression (Henley2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RBL2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting neurological and oncological health. Bi-allelic truncating variants in RBL2 have been linked to severe motor and cognitive impairments, including symptoms such as speech and motor delays, microcephaly, and seizures. These mutations result in a loss of RBL2 protein function, leading to significant developmental disorders without affecting DNA methylation or telomere maintenance (Samra2021RBL2).

In oncology, RBL2 mutations have been implicated in breast cancer. Mutations in acetylation hotspots, particularly at lysine 1083, disrupt the protein's acetylation and phosphorylation potential, affecting cell cycle regulation. These mutations are associated with increased breast cancer risk and poor survival outcomes, as they impair RBL2's interaction with the Cyc-D1/CDK4 complex, crucial for cell cycle progression (Ullah2022Mutations).

RBL2 also plays a role in lung cancer, where its deletion, alongside other genetic alterations, accelerates tumor development. In small cell lung cancer, RBL2 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss leads to distinct tumor phenotypes, suggesting its context-dependent role in tumor suppression (Flores2022Retinoblastoma).

## Interactions
RBL2, also known as p130, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cell cycle progression and other cellular processes. It interacts with cyclin F, which targets RBL2 for degradation through the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex) pathway. Cyclin F recognizes specific Cy motifs in RBL2, particularly the RxL/I sequence, which is crucial for its degradation. Mutations in these motifs can render RBL2 resistant to degradation by cyclin F (Enrico2021Cyclin).

RBL2 also interacts with E2F transcription factors, such as E2F4 and E2F5, forming complexes that regulate gene expression during the cell cycle. These interactions are significant in the context of JC virus T-antigen in mouse medulloblastoma-like cells, where RBL2's interaction with E2F factors influences cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis (Caracciolo2007Interplay).

In multiciliogenesis, RBL2 acts as a repressor of Multicilin's transcriptional activity. It forms a complex with Multicilin and E2F4, inhibiting the transcription of genes necessary for multiciliogenesis. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which can disrupt the RBL2-Multicilin complex, allowing multiciliogenesis to proceed (Quiroz2024RBL2).
