# KRAS

## Overview
The KRAS gene encodes the KRAS proto-oncogene, a small GTPase that is a pivotal component of the RAS family of proteins. This protein functions as a molecular switch in various cell signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Tebar2020Pleiotropic; Kano2019Tyrosyl). Structurally, KRAS is characterized by a G domain crucial for GTP binding and hydrolysis, and a hypervariable region that facilitates membrane association (Pantsar2020The). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as farnesylation and phosphorylation, which influence its interactions with other proteins and its role in signal transduction (Kano2019Tyrosyl; Dharmaiah2019Structures). Mutations in the KRAS gene are frequently associated with various cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer, where they contribute to oncogenesis by promoting constitutive activation of signaling pathways (Jančík2010Clinical; Roberts2013KRAS).

## Structure
The KRAS protein is a member of the RAS family of GTPases, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with significant regions including the G domain, which is essential for GTP binding and hydrolysis (Pantsar2020The). The secondary structure of KRAS includes six beta-strands and five alpha-helices, contributing to its overall stability and function (Pantsar2020The).

The tertiary structure of KRAS is characterized by a compact, globular form, which is crucial for its function as a molecular switch cycling between active and inactive states (Menyhárd2020Structural). The protein also contains a flexible C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) that anchors it to the membrane, with a polybasic region important for membrane association (Pantsar2020The).

KRAS undergoes several post-translational modifications, including farnesylation and N-terminal acetylation, which are critical for its membrane localization and structural stability (Dharmaiah2019Structures; Pantsar2020The). These modifications influence the protein's conformation and interaction with other molecules, such as effector proteins and regulators (Dharmaiah2019Structures). The protein's structure also includes switch regions (switch-I and switch-II) that form binding interfaces for these interactions (Pantsar2020The).

## Function
KRAS is a proto-oncogene encoding a small GTPase that plays a critical role in cell signaling pathways, particularly in regulating cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, KRAS functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. This cycle is facilitated by guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and terminated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (Kano2019Tyrosyl). 

KRAS is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it influences key signaling pathways such as the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are vital for normal cellular functions and organismal development (Tebar2020Pleiotropic). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Src kinase, which can alter its conformation and affect its interactions with downstream effectors like RAF (Kano2019Tyrosyl). 

In its active form, KRAS interacts with and activates downstream effectors, leading to the propagation of mitogenic signals essential for cell proliferation and survival (Kano2019Tyrosyl). The regulation of KRAS activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers (Tebar2020Pleiotropic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRAS gene are implicated in several cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and pancreatic cancer. In NSCLC, KRAS mutations are prevalent in lung adenocarcinoma, particularly among smokers, and are associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, complicating treatment strategies (Tímár2014The; Riely2009KRAS). These mutations often occur at codons 12 and 13, leading to constitutive activation of the KRAS protein, which drives oncogenesis by stimulating downstream signaling pathways independent of upstream growth factor receptor activity (Jančík2010Clinical; Roberts2013KRAS).

In colorectal cancer, KRAS mutations are linked to chemotherapeutic resistance and poorer overall survival, particularly with mutations in codon 12 (Abubaker2009Prognostic). These mutations also affect the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, with patients harboring wild-type KRAS showing better treatment outcomes (Jančík2010Clinical).

KRAS mutations are also a common feature in pancreatic cancer, where they are strongly associated with tobacco exposure and contribute to the progression from benign adenomas to invasive carcinomas (Jančík2010Clinical). The presence of KRAS mutations in these cancers underscores their role as a critical driver of tumorigenesis and a significant factor in determining therapeutic responses.

## Interactions
KRAS, a member of the RAS family of GTPases, is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell signaling. KRAS interacts with RAF kinases, forming complexes such as KRAS-RAF-14-3-3, which are essential for MAPK signaling. This interaction is facilitated by KRAS dimerization on membrane domains enriched with phosphatidylserine (PS), which promotes the activation of autoinhibited BRAF by KRAS dimers (Lee2024MembraneDriven).

KRAS also interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like SOS1 and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which regulate its GTPase cycling. The orientation and structure of KRAS dimers affect their accessibility to these regulators (Lee2024MembraneDriven). Additionally, KRAS forms nanoclusters in the membrane, which are necessary for activating pathways such as the ERK pathway. These nanoclusters, consisting of 6-10 RAS molecules, provide a regulatory mechanism for ERK activation (Kiel2021The).

KRAS interactions are also modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its binding affinity to effectors like RAF and RAS-GAPs (Kiel2021The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which KRAS operates, influencing various signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation and survival.
