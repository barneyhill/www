# OR2M5

## Overview
OR2M5 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily M member 5, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2M5 is predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants to trigger neuronal responses. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR2M5 and other olfactory receptors have been implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, suggesting potential roles in broader biological processes (Yan2011Identification; Pecorelli2013Genes). However, the full extent of OR2M5's functions, particularly outside the olfactory system, remains an area of active research.

## Function
OR2M5 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR2M5 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Yan2011Identification; Pecorelli2013Genes).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2M5 has been implicated in various cellular processes. Studies have shown that olfactory receptors, including OR2M5, may be involved in broader biological functions beyond smell, such as cellular signaling pathways. For instance, OR2M5 has been identified in studies examining signaling pathways affected by compounds like genistein, which influences phosphorylation events in cells (Yan2011Identification). This suggests that OR2M5 might have roles in cellular processes related to signal transduction and possibly in other tissues beyond the olfactory system. However, the specific functions of OR2M5 in healthy human cells outside of olfaction remain to be fully elucidated.
