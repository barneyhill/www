# ZNF415

## Overview
ZNF415 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 415, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 415 is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcriptional activities of key regulatory proteins, including AP-1 and P53, which are critical for cell cycle control and programmed cell death (Liu2022ZNF384:; Kobayashi2012Functional). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have distinct roles in cellular pathways, underscoring its functional diversity (Liu2022ZNF384:).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF415 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcription of target genes. ZNF415 is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Kobayashi2012Functional).

ZNF415 has been implicated in the regulation of transcriptional activities of AP-1 and P53, which are essential for cell cycle progression and cell death. AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor that includes proteins such as c-Jun and JunB, which have roles in inflammatory responses and cellular protection, respectively (Liu2022ZNF384:). The differential splicing of ZNF415 results in five isoforms, each potentially binding to different DNA-binding sites and regulating various molecular pathways, suggesting diverse roles in transcription activities (Liu2022ZNF384:).

In healthy human cells, ZNF415 is involved in maintaining normal cellular functions through its role in transcription regulation, although specific details about its function in non-disease states are less documented in the available literature.
