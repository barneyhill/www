# PARP14

## Overview
PARP14 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 14, which is part of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification that influences various cellular processes. PARP14 is a multifunctional protein with roles in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and cell morphology. It is particularly noted for its involvement in homologous recombination and replication fork stability, contributing to genomic stability (Nicolae2015A). Additionally, PARP14 acts as a transcriptional regulator in Stat6-dependent gene activation and is implicated in cell migration and morphology (Mehrotra2011PARP14; Vyas2013A). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as tristetraprolin and the MRE11 nuclease, further underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Dhoonmoon2022The; Iqbal2014PARP14). Given its diverse functions, PARP14 is also a subject of interest in cancer research, where it has been linked to genomic instability and chemoresistance in various cancer types (Dhoonmoon2022The; Barbarulo2012Poly(ADPribose) page 3 of 5).

## Structure
PARP14 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure comprising multiple domains. It contains three macro domains (macro1, macro2, macro3), which are involved in ADP-ribose binding and are structurally similar, featuring several β-sheets and 2-3 α-helices. These domains specifically recognize mono-ADP-ribose rather than poly-ADP-ribose (Qin2019Research). The protein also includes two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and a catalytic domain responsible for mono-ADP-ribosylation modification of target proteins, including PARP14 itself (Qin2019Research).

PARP14 has a WWE domain, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, although in PARP14, it appears to have diverged in sequence and lacks the PAR-binding function (Suskiewicz2023Updated). The protein also contains six KH domains arranged in-line upstream of a split domain, making a total of eight KH domains, which are capped by two tandem RRM domains and an additional N-terminal RRM connected by a flexible linker (Suskiewicz2023Updated). These KH domains are predicted to recognize long nucleic acid fragments, potentially allowing PARP14 to track along a long RNA or single-stranded DNA molecule (Suskiewicz2023Updated). The catalytic domain of PARP14 has been crystallized, providing insights into its structure and interactions (Wahlberg2012Familywide).

## Function
PARP14, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in DNA repair, particularly promoting homologous recombination (HR) and protecting against replication stress. PARP14 facilitates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and replication fork stability, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability. Its knockdown leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and reduced HR efficiency, highlighting its protective role against DNA damage (Nicolae2015A).

PARP14 also functions as a transcriptional regulator, particularly in the context of Stat6-dependent gene activation. It acts as a transcriptional switch, modulating the association of histone deacetylases (HDACs) with Stat6-responsive promoters. Upon stimulation by interleukin-4 (IL-4), PARP14's enzymatic activity leads to the dissociation of HDACs, allowing transcriptional activation of Stat6 target genes (Mehrotra2011PARP14).

In addition, PARP14 is involved in the regulation of cell morphology and movement. It localizes to focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, playing a role in cell migration and maintaining normal cell shape (Vyas2013A). These diverse functions underscore PARP14's importance in cellular homeostasis and response to stress.

## Clinical Significance
PARP14 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in genomic instability and chemoresistance. In BRCA-deficient breast cancer cells, loss of PARP14 restores fork protection, reducing genomic instability and chemoresistance to agents like cisplatin and olaparib. Low PARP14 expression is associated with reduced survival in breast cancer patients with BRCA2 mutations, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for patient stratification and treatment response (Dhoonmoon2022The; Dhoonmoon2023Abstract).

In multiple myeloma, PARP14 interacts with JNK1, inhibiting its pro-apoptotic activity and promoting cell survival. High PARP14 expression correlates with shorter survival, and its inhibition enhances the cytotoxic effects of anti-myeloma drugs (Barbarulo2012Poly(ADPribose) page 3 of 5). In hepatocellular carcinoma, PARP14 promotes the Warburg effect by inhibiting JNK1-dependent PKM2 phosphorylation, contributing to cancer cell growth and survival (Iansante2015PARP14).

PARP14 is also upregulated in STAT6 mutant follicular lymphoma, where it is a target gene of mutant STAT6. Targeting PARP14 could block the gain-of-function phenotype of STAT6 mutations in this cancer type (Mentz2022PARP14). In cervical cancer, PARP14 mutations and expression alterations have been linked to prognosis, with upregulation observed in cancerous tissues (Wang2023Exploration).

## Interactions
PARP14, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with tristetraprolin (TTP) to regulate the stability of tissue factor (TF) mRNA in macrophages. This interaction is dependent on a conserved AU-rich element (ARE) within the TF mRNA 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), and both PARP14 and TTP are required for binding to this region. The interaction is specific to TF mRNA, as PARP14 does not affect TTP's regulation of TNFα mRNA (Iqbal2014PARP14).

PARP14 also interacts with the DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) and colocalizes with PARP13 in subcellular puncta, suggesting a role in RNA regulatory machinery (CarterO’Connell2018Combining). In the context of DNA repair, PARP14 binds to nascent DNA and interacts with the MRE11 nuclease, promoting its recruitment to stalled replication forks. This interaction is crucial for DNA resection processes, particularly in BRCA-deficient cells, where PARP14's catalytic activity is necessary for MRE11-mediated genomic instability (Dhoonmoon2022The). The KU complex, including KU70 and KU80, is another interacting partner of PARP14, facilitating its role in DNA repair at stalled replication forks (Dhoonmoon2022The).
