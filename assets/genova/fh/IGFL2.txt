# IGFL2

## Overview
IGFL2, or Insulin Growth Factor Like Family Member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family. This family is known for its involvement in growth and development processes, as well as its role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. The protein encoded by IGFL2 is categorized as a growth factor, which suggests its involvement in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of IGFL2 in various pathological conditions, particularly in oncology, where its expression levels and genetic alterations have been linked to cancer progression and prognosis (Wang2023Pancancer). Additionally, IGFL2 has been associated with immune modulation, indicating its potential role in tumor immune evasion and as a biomarker for inflammatory diseases (Lai2024Bulk).

## Clinical Significance
IGFL2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In a pan-cancer analysis, IGFL2 expression was found to be significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with a worse prognosis in several cancer types, including kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) (Wang2023Pancancer). The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune-related genes, suggesting a role in tumor immune evasion (Wang2023Pancancer).

IGFL2 methylation levels are generally lower in cancers such as bladder cancer (BLCA) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), which correlates with poorer survival outcomes (Wang2023Pancancer). Genetic alterations, particularly gene amplifications, are prevalent in uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) and are associated with poor prognosis (Wang2023Pancancer).

In Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), a chronic inflammatory skin disease, IGFL2 expression is notably downregulated, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this condition (Lai2024Bulk). These findings highlight IGFL2's potential as a target for cancer prognosis and immunotherapy, as well as its role in other diseases.
