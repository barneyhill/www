# BLVRA

## Overview
The BLVRA gene encodes biliverdin reductase A, an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the heme catabolism pathway by catalyzing the conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin. This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and is integral to maintaining cellular redox homeostasis due to bilirubin's potent antioxidant properties (Nytofte2011A; Barañano2002Biliverdin). Biliverdin reductase A is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, brain, and kidney, underscoring its widespread physiological significance (Nytofte2011A). Beyond its enzymatic function, biliverdin reductase A is involved in cellular signaling pathways, interacting with kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity and cancer cell dynamics (Vasavda2022Biliverdin; Mao2020&lt). Mutations in the BLVRA gene can lead to clinical conditions such as green jaundice and contribute to cardiovascular disorders through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Klóska2019Biliverdin; Nytofte2011A).

## Function
The BLVRA gene encodes biliverdin reductase A, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the heme catabolism pathway by converting biliverdin to bilirubin. This conversion is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance, as bilirubin acts as a potent antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress (Nytofte2011A; Barañano2002Biliverdin). Biliverdin reductase A is involved in a redox cycle where bilirubin is oxidized back to biliverdin and then reduced again, providing continuous cytoprotection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Barañano2002Biliverdin).

In healthy human cells, BLVRA is expressed in various organs, including the liver, brain, lung, pancreas, kidney, spleen, and placenta, indicating its widespread importance in physiological processes (Nytofte2011A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing oxidative damage, as demonstrated by studies showing that depletion of BLVRA leads to increased ROS levels and reduced cell viability (Barañano2002Biliverdin). BLVRA also plays a role in modulating cellular responses to oxidative stress, influencing processes such as cellular senescence and apoptosis prevention (Kim2011Biliverdin; Wegiel2012Go).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BLVRA gene, which encodes biliverdin reductase A, are associated with several clinical conditions. A homozygous nonsense mutation (c.214C>A) in BLVRA leads to the accumulation of biliverdin during episodes of cholestasis, resulting in green jaundice. This mutation causes a truncated protein lacking the NADPH-binding site and catalytic active site, rendering the enzyme inactive. Patients with this mutation experience green discoloration of the skin, urine, and plasma, particularly during cholestasis, but do not show abnormal phenotypes in its absence (Nytofte2011A).

BLVRA deficiency can also trigger an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in human endothelial cells, which is relevant to cardiovascular disorders such as aortic aneurysm formation. This transition is characterized by increased oxidative stress and altered cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the loss of endothelial phenotype and increased migratory capacity (Klóska2019Biliverdin).

In mice, BLVRA deficiency leads to increased systemic oxidative stress and changes in erythrocyte turnover, although it does not cause significant hematological abnormalities. The deficiency is associated with increased oxidation of peroxiredoxin-2 in erythrocytes, indicating enhanced oxidative stress (Bortolussi2021LongTerm).

## Interactions
Biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In the context of synaptic signaling, BLVRA interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Pyk2, and Src, acting as a bridge between these kinases. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is essential for synaptic plasticity (Vasavda2022Biliverdin). BLVRA's role in these interactions is independent of its enzymatic activity, as demonstrated by the ability of a catalytically inactive mutant to still engage with these kinases (Vasavda2022Biliverdin).

In colorectal cancer cells, BLVRA interacts with components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including β-catenin, and influences the expression of proteins such as cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin. These interactions promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (p&gt; Biliverdin; Mao2020&lt).

In the bovine epididymis, BLVRA interacts with epididymal sperm binding protein 1 (ELSPBP1), a process facilitated by zinc ions. This interaction is thought to play a role in protecting spermatozoa from oxidative stress (D’Amours2015Evidences).
