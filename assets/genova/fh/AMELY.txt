# AMELY

## Overview
The AMELY gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the amelogenin Y-linked protein, which is a critical component in the development of tooth enamel. Amelogenin is categorized as a structural protein, playing a significant role in the biomineralization process during enamel formation. Although AMELY is expressed at a much lower level compared to its X chromosome counterpart, AMELX, it contributes to the regulation of enamel mineralization and the formation of enamel matrix proteins. Despite its involvement in enamel development, AMELY is not essential for normal tooth formation in humans, as evidenced by individuals with AMELY deletions who exhibit normal dental development. This is attributed to the compensatory function of AMELX. Beyond its biological role, AMELY serves as a valuable marker in forensic DNA typing and prenatal diagnosis due to its Y chromosome location (Jobling2006Structural; Lattanzi2005A).

## Function
The AMELY gene encodes the amelogenin protein, which is involved in the development of tooth enamel. Amelogenin is a major component of the enamel matrix and plays a crucial role in the biomineralization process during enamel formation. It is primarily expressed in developing tooth buds, where it contributes to the regulation of enamel mineralization and the formation of enamel matrix proteins (Jobling2006Structural; Lattanzi2005A). Despite its role in enamel development, the expression level of AMELY is significantly lower than its X chromosome counterpart, AMELX, with AMELY being expressed at only 10% of the level of AMELX (Jobling2006Structural). 

Studies have shown that individuals with deletions of the AMELY gene exhibit normal tooth development, suggesting that AMELY is not critical for enamel formation in humans. This is likely due to the compensatory function of AMELX, which is more abundantly expressed and can fulfill the role of amelogenin in enamel development (Jobling2006Structural). The AMELY gene is also used as a marker in forensic DNA typing and prenatal diagnosis due to its location on the Y chromosome (Lattanzi2005A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AMELY gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of gender determination and reproductive health. Deletions or mutations in the AMELY gene can result in amplification failure during genetic testing, leading to the misidentification of male samples as female. This is particularly relevant in forensic casework and prenatal diagnosis, where accurate gender determination is crucial (Borovko2015Amelogenin; Mitchell2006An).

AMELY gene deletions are often associated with the Yp11.2 region, which can also affect adjacent loci such as DYS458. These deletions are linked to reproductive issues, including azoospermia and hypogonadism, as they may disrupt spermatogenesis (Borovko2015Amelogenin; PATHAK2015Mutational). In some cases, structural rearrangements involving the AMELY gene have been observed, which could contribute to male infertility (PATHAK2015Mutational).

The presence of AMELY null alleles has been documented in various populations, with varying frequencies. These deletions are often inherited and can be associated with specific haplotypes, indicating a potential founder effect or genetic drift in certain ethnic groups (Yong2007Molecular; Mitchell2006An).
