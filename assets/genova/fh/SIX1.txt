# SIX1

## Overview
SIX1 is a gene that encodes the SIX homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor integral to various developmental processes and cellular functions. The SIX1 protein is characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding, and the SIX domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Kochhar2008SIX1mutation). As a transcription factor, SIX1 plays a pivotal role in organogenesis and cell cycle regulation, influencing the proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells in tissues such as muscle, kidney, and the inner ear (Christensen2006Cell). Dysregulation of SIX1, through mutations or altered expression, is implicated in several congenital disorders, including branchio-oto-renal syndrome, and is associated with the progression of various cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental biology and disease pathology (Lee2023Phenotypic; Critelli2022Upregulation).

## Structure
The SIX1 protein is a transcription factor involved in various developmental processes. It contains two conserved domains: the SIX domain (SD) and the homeodomain (HD). The SIX domain is responsible for protein-protein interactions, while the homeodomain is essential for protein-DNA binding (Kochhar2008SIX1mutation). The homeodomain includes a helix-turn-helix motif, which is typical of homeodomain proteins and crucial for DNA binding. 

Mutations in the SIX1 gene, particularly missense mutations within these domains, can disrupt the interaction between SIX1 and other proteins, such as EYA1, leading to branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome (Kochhar2008SIX1mutation). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions. 

SIX1 also has splice variant isoforms that may differ in function and localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The structural integrity of the SIX1 protein is crucial for its role in development, and mutations affecting conserved amino acids can lead to significant structural changes, impacting its function (Kochhar2008SIX1mutation).

## Function
The SIX1 (SIX homeobox 1) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and organogenesis in healthy human cells. SIX1 is involved in the proliferation of precursor cell populations that contribute to the formation of various organs, including muscle, kidney, and the inner ear (Christensen2006Cell). It regulates the cell cycle by influencing the transition into and progression through the S phase and the G2 cell cycle checkpoint (Christensen2006Cell).

SIX1 is active primarily in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the expression of target genes, thereby influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Christensen2006Cell). The protein's activity is tightly regulated through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in conjunction with Cdh1, confining its activity to specific stages of the cell cycle, such as the G1/S boundary through early mitosis (Christensen2006Cell). This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which could lead to cancer (Christensen2006Cell). The degradation of SIX1 involves novel motifs in its N- and C-terminal regions, which are essential for its interaction with Cdh1 and subsequent proteolysis (Christensen2006Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SIX1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. SIX1 mutations are linked to branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome and its variants, such as branchio-otic (BO) syndrome. These conditions are characterized by ear malformations, hearing loss, and sometimes kidney anomalies. Specific mutations, like p.Arg110Trp and p.Leu103Profs*51, disrupt interactions with the EYA1 protein, affecting nuclear translocation and DNA-binding affinity, which are crucial for normal development (Lee2023Phenotypic; Mehdizadeh2021Mutations).

SIX1 variants are also implicated in non-syndromic deafness (DFNA23) and atypical BO syndrome, with mutations leading to reduced DNA binding and transcriptional activity, correlating with the severity of clinical phenotypes (Lee2023Phenotypic). In craniosynostosis, SIX1 variants have been identified, particularly affecting sagittal suture fusion, suggesting a role in cranial suture homeostasis (Calpena2021Unexpected).

Altered SIX1 expression is linked to various cancers. In papillary thyroid carcinoma, high SIX1 expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics (Khalil2024SIX1). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SIX1 upregulation is associated with faster tumor growth and decreased survival, particularly in HCV-positive women (Critelli2022Upregulation). In lung adenocarcinoma, SIX1, along with Notch2, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributing to a more aggressive cancer phenotype (Mimae2012Upregulation).

## Interactions
SIX1, a homeoprotein transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in development and cancer. SIX1 physically interacts with the protein Eya1, forming a complex that is essential for the activation of Atoh1 expression in cochlear hair cell development. This interaction is facilitated by the binding of SIX1 and Eya1 to conserved sites in the Atoh1 enhancer, in cooperation with Sox2 (Ahmed2012Eya1Six1).

In cancer, SIX1 interacts with Ezrin, a protein that is a direct transcriptional target of SIX1. This interaction is critical for promoting metastasis in rhabdomyosarcoma, as Ezrin is necessary for the metastatic effects of SIX1. SIX1 enhances the expression of protumorigenic genes, including those involved in cell proliferation and survival, through its interaction with Ezrin (Yu2006The).

SIX1 also interacts with the APC Cdh1 complex, which mediates its degradation through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. This interaction involves novel motifs in the N-terminus of SIX1, which binds directly to Cdh1, and the C-terminus, which contributes to its degradation (Christensen2006Cell). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SIX1 in regulating gene expression and cellular processes.
