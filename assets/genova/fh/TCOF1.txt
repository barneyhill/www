# TCOF1

## Overview
The TCOF1 gene encodes the treacle ribosome biogenesis factor 1, a nucleolar phosphoprotein that plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular processes such as DNA damage response and mitosis. Treacle is characterized by its complex structure, including motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and nucleolar localization, which are essential for its function in the nucleolus (He2011Structure; Wise1997TCOF1). As a scaffold protein, treacle is involved in the transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA, as well as in maintaining nucleolar integrity and responding to DNA damage (Grzanka2021The). Mutations in TCOF1 are linked to Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, highlighting the gene's critical role in embryonic development (Conte2011Novel; Grzanka2021The).

## Structure
The TCOF1 gene encodes the treacle protein, a nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in ribosome biogenesis. Treacle is composed of 1,411 amino acids and is characterized by low complexity and repeated motifs that align with its exon organization (Wise1997TCOF1). The protein structure includes a highly conserved amino terminus containing a LisH motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (He2011Structure). The central region of treacle features 11 repeating units with acidic motifs rich in serine, which are potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (CKII) and protein kinase C (PKC), and basic motifs rich in lysine, alanine, and proline (He2011Structure). These motifs are similar to those found in nucleolar trafficking proteins, suggesting a role in nucleolar function (Wise1997TCOF1).

The carboxy terminus of treacle contains several nuclear localization signals, with the last 41 residues necessary for nucleolar retention (He2011Structure). Treacle is highly phosphorylated, which is crucial for its function, as phosphorylation enhances the binding of nuclear localization signals (Wise1997TCOF1). The protein has multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the predominant isoform being 1,488 amino acids long (He2011Structure).

## Function
The TCOF1 gene encodes the treacle protein, which plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, a process essential for cell proliferation and survival. Treacle is involved in the transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) into pre-rRNA and the subsequent processing and assembly of ribosomes within the nucleolus (Grzanka2021The). It facilitates the recruitment of the pre-initiation complex to the rDNA promoter, enabling the transcription of 47S pre-rRNA and regulating post-transcriptional modifications such as methylation, which are crucial for RNA stability and function (Grzanka2021The).

Treacle also plays a significant role in the DNA damage response by recruiting key proteins like NBS1 and TOPBP1 to sites of rDNA damage, which activate ATR kinase necessary for transcriptional repression and repair processes (Grzanka2021The). Additionally, treacle acts as a scaffold for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) during mitosis, essential for mitotic spindle formation and proper chromosome alignment (Grzanka2021The).

In terms of cellular localization, treacle is predominantly active in the nucleolus, where it maintains nucleolar structure and mediates its activities, including ribosome biogenesis and the DNA damage response (Grzanka2021The). Its function is vital for normal embryonic development, particularly in the formation of craniofacial structures (Grzanka2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCOF1 gene are primarily associated with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities such as facial bone hypoplasia, cleft palate, and external ear deformities. These mutations often result in premature termination codons, leading to truncated proteins or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which disrupts ribosome biogenesis and affects neural crest cell development (Conte2011Novel; Grzanka2021The). The most common mutations include small deletions and insertions, particularly in exons 23 and 24, which are considered mutation hotspots (Conte2011Novel; Splendore2005TCOF1).

The clinical manifestations of TCS are highly variable, with significant inter- and intrafamilial variability. This variability is not explained by the type or location of the mutations, suggesting potential genetic heterogeneity or other contributing mechanisms (Splendore2000High). In some cases, synonymous mutations can also lead to TCS by affecting splicing, as seen with a mutation causing exon skipping (Macaya2009A).

Reduced transcription of TCOF1 in adult cells of TCS patients has been observed, which may contribute to the clinical features of the syndrome, including reduced regenerative capacity and impaired surgical outcomes (Masotti2009Reduced).

## Interactions
TCOF1, also known as treacle, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It acts as a single-component scaffold in the nucleolar fibrillar center (FC), where it self-assembles through homotypic interactions of its Serine/Glutamate-rich low-complexity regions (LCRs). This self-assembly is crucial for the formation and maintenance of the FC structure (JaberiLashkari2022TCOF1).

TCOF1 interacts with TRF2, a component of the shelterin complex, during the S phase of the cell cycle. This interaction is essential for recruiting TCOF1 to telomeres, where it suppresses telomere transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase II, thereby maintaining low levels of TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA) (Nie2020TRF2). TCOF1 also binds to RNA polymerase II, influencing its activity at telomeres and suppressing Pol II elongation activity (Nie2020TRF2).

In the nucleolus, TCOF1 is part of a complex with NOLC1 and FGF12, where it interacts in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the nucleolar localization of the complex, although FGF12's presence is not required for TCOF1's nucleolar localization (Sochacka2022FGF12). These interactions highlight TCOF1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance.
