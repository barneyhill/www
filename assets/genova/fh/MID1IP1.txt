# MID1IP1

## Overview
The MID1IP1 gene encodes the MID1 interacting protein 1, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and microtubule stabilization. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in modulating the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an enzyme pivotal for fatty acid synthesis and energy homeostasis (Guo2013Molecular). MID1IP1 is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in liver cancer, where it interacts with oncogenes like c-Myc to influence cell proliferation and apoptosis (Jung2020Colocalization). The protein's interactions extend to ribosomal proteins and transcription complexes, underscoring its involvement in diverse cellular functions. Given its significant roles in both metabolic and oncogenic pathways, MID1IP1 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders and cancer (Kim2019Hypolipogenic; Jung2020Colocalization).

## Structure
The MID1IP1 protein, encoded by the MID1IP1 gene, is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and cancer growth. The protein is known to interact with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) through its leucine-zipper domain located in the C-terminal region, which is crucial for its function in stimulating ACC polymerization (Izumi2021MIG12). This interaction is essential for the regulation of lipogenesis via liver X receptors (LXR) activation.

The primary structure of the porcine MID1IP1 protein consists of 182 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 20,186.6 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.51 (Guo2013Molecular). The secondary structure is predicted to include three alpha-helices, one beta-sheet, and random coils, as analyzed by SABLE software (Guo2013Molecular).

In the context of liver cancer, MID1IP1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and is involved in the regulation of c-Myc stability, affecting cell viability and apoptosis (Jung2020Colocalization). The protein's interaction with c-Myc and ribosomal proteins L5 and L11 suggests a role in ribosome biogenesis and cell-cycle progression (Jung2020Colocalization). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of MID1IP1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
MID1IP1, also known as MID1 interacting protein 1, plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. It is involved in the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an enzyme critical for fatty acid synthesis, which is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic pathways in cells (Guo2013Molecular). MID1IP1 is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it influences these metabolic processes. The protein's activity in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in energy regulation and lipid biosynthesis, contributing to overall cellular function and organismal health (Guo2013Molecular).

In addition to its metabolic roles, MID1IP1 is implicated in the stabilization of microtubules through its interaction with MID1, a microtubule-binding protein. This interaction is crucial for maintaining microtubule stability, which is vital for various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular transport (Baldini2020The). The protein's involvement in these fundamental cellular activities highlights its multifaceted role in cell biology, impacting both structural and metabolic functions within the cell.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MID1IP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly liver cancer and metabolic disorders. In liver cancer, MID1IP1 is highly expressed and plays a critical role in promoting cancer cell proliferation. Its interaction with the oncogene c-Myc is crucial for liver cancer growth, as it regulates ribosomal proteins L5 and L11, which are essential for c-Myc stability. Depletion of MID1IP1 in liver cancer cells leads to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Jung2020Colocalization).

In metabolic disorders, MID1IP1 is involved in lipid metabolism and is linked to conditions such as fatty liver and hyperlipidemia. It regulates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, and its expression is modulated by compounds like shikimic acid, which can reduce triglyceride accumulation in the liver. This suggests that targeting MID1IP1 could be beneficial in managing lipid-related disorders (Kim2019Hypolipogenic).

Overall, MID1IP1's role in both cancer and metabolic pathways highlights its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
MID1IP1, also known as MID1 interacting protein 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes. In the context of liver cancer, MID1IP1 interacts with the oncogene c-Myc. This interaction is crucial for liver cancer growth, as MID1IP1 and c-Myc are coexpressed and colocalized in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. The colocalization is demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies showing a yellowish color when the fluorescence of MID1IP1 and c-Myc is merged (Jung2020Colocalization).

MID1IP1 also interacts with ribosomal proteins L5 and L11. The depletion of MID1IP1 activates these ribosomal proteins, leading to a reduction in c-Myc levels. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of MID1IP1 in modulating c-Myc stability and expression through ribosomal proteins (Jung2020Colocalization).

Additionally, MID1IP1 is involved in interactions with the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 2 (CNOT2). The knockdown of CNOT2 enhances the inhibitory effect of MID1IP1 depletion on c-Myc, pro-PARP, and pro-caspase 3, indicating a complex interplay between these proteins in cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation (Jung2020Colocalization).
