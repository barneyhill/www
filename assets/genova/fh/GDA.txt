# GDA

## Overview
GDA, or guanine deaminase, is a gene that encodes the enzyme guanine deaminase, a metalloenzyme involved in purine metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of guanine to xanthine, a critical step in nucleotide turnover and recycling. Guanine deaminase is characterized by its zinc-binding domain and TIM barrel fold, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Fernández2008Structural). The protein also contains a PDZ-binding domain, implicating it in neuronal development and synaptic signaling (Fernández2008Structural). In mammals, the enzyme is known as cypin and plays a role in dendrite branching by interacting with postsynaptic density proteins and promoting microtubule polymerization (Fernández2008Structural). Beyond its metabolic functions, guanine deaminase is involved in skin pigmentation and inflammatory responses, with its expression modulated by factors such as UVB irradiation and cytokines (Jung2020Guanine). The gene's expression and regulation have clinical significance, particularly in skin pigmentation disorders and pregnancy-related immunological processes (Jung2020Guanine; Löb2021Pregnancy).

## Structure
The human guanine deaminase (GDA) protein is a metalloenzyme involved in purine metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of guanine to xanthine. Its structure includes a zinc-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain involves the coordination of a zinc ion by specific histidine and aspartate residues, which are crucial for the deamination mechanism (Fernández2008Structural). The GDA protein is characterized by a TIM barrel fold, a common structural motif in the amidohydrolase family, which supports its catalytic function (Fernández2008Structural).

In terms of domain architecture, GDA contains a PDZ-binding domain, which is involved in neuronal development and synaptic signaling (Fernández2008Structural). The protein's primary structure is conserved across species, with significant homology observed in the zinc-binding domain, although variations exist in other regions such as the CRMP homology domain (Slater2019Characterization).

GDA also exists in different splice variant isoforms, with cypin being the most abundant in mammals. Cypin interacts with postsynaptic density proteins and regulates microtubule polymerization, contributing to dendrite branching (Fernández2008Structural). This multifunctional role highlights the structural and functional complexity of GDA in human physiology.

## Function
Guanine deaminase (GDA) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in purine metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of guanine to xanthine, which is essential for nucleotide turnover and recycling (Shek2019Structural). This enzymatic activity is important for maintaining cellular nucleotide balance, impacting processes such as DNA and RNA synthesis and cellular energy homeostasis (Shek2019Structural).

In human epidermal keratinocytes, GDA is involved in skin pigmentation. It is upregulated by UVB irradiation, which increases the expression of melanogenic growth factors like stem cell factor (SCF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in keratinocytes. These factors enhance melanogenesis by acting on melanocytes, leading to increased melanin production (Jung2020Guanine). GDA expression is significantly higher in hyperpigmented lesions, suggesting its role in skin hyperpigmentation (Jung2020Guanine).

GDA is also influenced by inflammatory stimuli, with its expression increasing in response to cytokines such as interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), indicating a potential role in inflammation-related pigmentation processes (Jung2020Guanine). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular nucleotide balance (Shek2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the guanine deaminase (GDA) gene have been implicated in various skin pigmentation disorders. In conditions such as Riehl's melanosis and melasma, GDA expression is significantly increased in hyperpigmented lesions compared to non-lesional tissue. This upregulation is associated with enhanced melanogenesis, as GDA promotes the production of melanogenic factors like stem cell factor (SCF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in keratinocytes. Knockdown of GDA has been shown to reduce melanin content, while its overexpression promotes melanogenesis, suggesting a regulatory role in skin pigmentation (Jung2020Guanine).

GDA expression is also influenced by inflammatory cytokines, with increased levels observed in response to interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). This suggests that GDA may be involved in inflammation-related hyperpigmentation (Jung2020Guanine).

In the context of pregnancy, GDA, referred to as Glycodelin A (GdA), is involved in immunological processes. Alterations in GdA expression have been linked to recurrent and spontaneous miscarriages, where its levels are significantly lower compared to normal pregnancies. This imbalance, along with the upregulation of Pregnancy Zone Protein (PZP), may contribute to pregnancy complications (Löb2021Pregnancy).

## Interactions
Guanine deaminase (GDA), also known as cypin in mammals, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In neurons, GDA interacts with postsynaptic density protein PSD-95, playing a role in synaptic function and dendrite branching. This interaction is facilitated by the zinc-binding domain of GDA, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and its ability to promote dendrite formation (Fernández2008Structural). 

GDA also binds to tubulin heterodimers, promoting microtubule assembly, which is essential for dendrite outgrowth. This interaction is mediated by the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) homology domain, although this domain is not fully conserved across species, leading to functional differences in microtubule dynamics between human GDA and its Xenopus counterpart (Fernández2008Structural; Slater2019Characterization).

In the context of skin pigmentation, GDA in human epidermal keratinocytes influences melanogenesis by modulating the expression of melanogenic mediators such as stem cell factor (SCF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). These factors enhance melanin production, suggesting that GDA may participate in regulatory interactions affecting skin pigmentation (Jung2020Guanine).
