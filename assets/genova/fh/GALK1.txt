# GALK1

## Overview
The GALK1 gene encodes the enzyme galactokinase 1, a member of the GHMP kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, a critical step in converting galactose into glucose-1-phosphate for energy production and cellular homeostasis (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase; Bergsma1996Fine). Galactokinase 1 is characterized by its compact, globular structure featuring a Rossmann fold, which is typical of nucleotide-binding proteins, and includes conserved motifs for ATP binding (Tang2010Molecular; Huang2013Role). The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites like galactitol, which can lead to cataracts and other complications if not properly metabolized (Sangiuolo2004Biochemical; Bergsma1996Fine). Beyond its metabolic role, GALK1 has been implicated in broader biological processes, including cancer progression and immune response, highlighting its potential as a biomarker in certain cancers (Chen2023Integrated; Davalieva2023Proteomics).

## Structure
The GALK1 gene encodes the enzyme galactokinase, which is involved in the metabolism of galactose. The primary structure of GALK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the functional protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are organized into N- and C-terminal domains arranged in a V-shape, creating a central cleft where the active site is located (Huang2013Role). The tertiary structure of GALK1 forms a compact, globular shape, often featuring a Rossmann fold, which is common in nucleotide-binding proteins (Tang2010Molecular).

The active site of GALK1 includes conserved motifs for ATP binding, which are characteristic of the GHMP kinase family, to which GALK1 belongs (Huang2013Role). Specific residues such as Arg37, Arg105, Glu174, Asp186, and Arg228 play crucial roles in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and stability (Huang2013Role). The enzyme's structure is further characterized by the presence of a Mg2+ ion, which is essential for its function (Huang2013Role).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting the enzyme's activity and stability. There are also known splice variant isoforms of GALK1 that can influence its function and stability (Tang2010Molecular).

## Function
The GALK1 gene encodes the enzyme galactokinase, which plays a crucial role in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. In healthy human cells, galactokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) using ATP. This reaction is the first step in converting galactose into glucose-1-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis or glycogen synthesis, facilitating energy production and cellular homeostasis (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase; Bergsma1996Fine).

Galactokinase is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is part of the GHMP kinase superfamily, which includes other small molecule kinase enzymes. The enzyme follows an ordered ternary complex mechanism, with ATP binding first, and is intolerant to many single amino acid substitutions, highlighting its specificity and importance in maintaining normal metabolic function (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase).

The GALK1 gene is constitutively expressed, as indicated by its promoter region, which features high GC content and multiple Sp1-binding motifs typical of housekeeping genes. This expression pattern ensures the continuous availability of galactokinase to process dietary galactose, preventing its accumulation and the formation of toxic metabolites like galactitol, which can lead to conditions such as cataracts if not properly metabolized (Sangiuolo2004Biochemical; Bergsma1996Fine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALK1 gene lead to galactokinase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting galactose metabolism. This condition is primarily characterized by the development of cataracts due to the accumulation of galactitol in the lens, which causes osmotic imbalance and lens swelling (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase; Sangiuolo2004Biochemical). More than 30 variants of the GALK1 gene have been identified, with some mutations being more prevalent in specific populations, such as the Roma and Japanese/Korean populations (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase; Hennermann2011Features).

In addition to cataracts, GALK1 deficiency can lead to neonatal complications like hepatosplenomegaly, hypoglycemia, and pseudotumor cerebri, which is linked to galactitol accumulation in the brain (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase). Intellectual disability and developmental delay have also been reported, though their direct connection to GALK1 deficiency is debated (RubioGozalbo2021Galactokinase).

Alterations in GALK1 expression have been associated with cancer, particularly bladder cancer (BCa). GALK1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for early detection and prognosis of BCa, with its protein levels increasing with cancer progression (Davalieva2023Proteomics). Elevated GALK1 activity has also been linked to specific promoter mutations, such as c.-22T>C, which enhance gene expression (Park2009A).

## Interactions
GALK1 (galactokinase 1) is involved in protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function and regulation. One notable interaction is with MCCC1, as identified in a study that used multiple assays to detect protein-protein interactions. The interaction between GALK1 and MCCC1 was confirmed in two different assays, highlighting its potential biological relevance (Braun2008An).

In the context of breast cancer metastasis, GALK1 has been identified as an immune-related prognostic factor. It is one of the three significant genes, alongside APPL1 and RPS6KB2, that were found to be differentially expressed based on lymph node and metastasis status. These genes were analyzed for their potential roles in immune infiltration and metastasis, suggesting that GALK1 may interact with other proteins involved in these processes (Chen2023Integrated).

These interactions and roles suggest that GALK1 is not only crucial in galactose metabolism but also potentially involved in broader biological processes, including cancer progression and immune response.
