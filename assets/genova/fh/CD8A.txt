# CD8A

## Overview
The CD8A gene encodes the CD8 alpha chain, a critical component of the CD8 glycoprotein complex, which is predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This protein functions as a co-receptor in the immune system, playing a pivotal role in the recognition and response to antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The CD8 alpha chain, in conjunction with the CD8 beta chain, forms a heterodimer that enhances the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, thereby facilitating T cell activation and immune response (Shiue1988A). As a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the CD8 alpha chain is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domain, which is essential for its structural integrity and function (Moore2005Characterisation). The gene's expression and regulation are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases (Moskowitz2017Epigenomics; Niu2022The).

## Structure
The CD8A gene encodes the CD8 alpha chain, a component of the CD8 glycoprotein found on the surface of T cells. The primary structure of the CD8 alpha chain consists of a polypeptide chain with specific amino acid sequences. The secondary structure includes an immunoglobulin superfamily variable (IgSfV) domain, which is stabilized by two conserved cysteines forming disulfide bonds (Moore2005Characterisation). The hinge region, encoded mostly by exon 3, contains five O-glycosylation motifs, contributing to an extended stalk structure (Moore2005Characterisation).

The tertiary structure of the CD8 alpha chain forms a compact domain, often stabilized by disulfide bonds. The quaternary structure involves dimerization with the CD8 beta chain, which is essential for its function as a co-receptor in T cells (Moore2005Characterisation). The cytoplasmic tail of CD8A lacks the typical CXC motif for p56 lck binding found in higher vertebrates, but it contains a conserved RT-RCPHHYKR sequence, suggesting an important functional role (Moore2005Characterisation).

Post-translational modifications include O-glycosylation, which is common in the hinge region, although N-glycosylation motifs are absent in salmon and trout CD8α sequences (Moore2005Characterisation). The CD8 alpha chain also has splice variant isoforms, with a shorter variant lacking exon 6, resulting in a truncated cytoplasmic domain (Moore2005Characterisation).

## Function
The CD8A gene encodes the CD8 alpha chain, a critical component of the CD8 glycoprotein complex found on the surface of cytotoxic T cells. This protein plays a vital role in the immune response by facilitating the recognition of antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The CD8 alpha chain, in conjunction with the CD8 beta chain, forms a heterodimer that enhances the avidity of interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thereby promoting T cell activation (Shiue1988A).

CD8A is primarily active in the immune synapse, where it stabilizes the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the MHC class I molecule, enhancing TCR signaling. This interaction is crucial for the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into cytotoxic T cells, which are responsible for directly killing infected or cancerous cells (Wang2008Comparative). The expression of CD8A is downregulated during T-cell activation, indicating its involvement in the regulation of immune responses (Wang2008Comparative). The CD8A gene is also associated with changes in chromatin accessibility, which are linked to T cell differentiation and aging (Moskowitz2017Epigenomics).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD8A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), CD8A is downregulated, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. The downregulation of CD8A in these syndromes is associated with poorer prognosis, possibly due to its immunomodulatory functions affecting cardiac electrical activity and stability (Meng2024Joint).

In cancer, CD8A serves as a biomarker for immune response and therapy efficacy. Its expression is linked to tumor immune infiltration and the formation of an immunosuppressive environment. CD8A expression patterns in cancer tissues are associated with prognosis and disease stage, with low expression negatively impacting survival in several cancer types, such as thymoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Niu2022The). Epigenetic modifications of CD8A, such as methylation, also affect cancer prognosis and immune response, with varying impacts depending on the cancer type (Niu2022The).

In Alzheimer's disease, clonally expanded CD8+ T cells, which express CD8A, are found in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting a role in neurodegeneration through pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities (Gate2020Clonally).

## Interactions
The CD8A protein, a component of the CD8 glycoprotein, is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate T-cell activation and signaling. One of its primary interactions is with the p56lck tyrosine protein kinase. This interaction is mediated by a conserved sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of CD8A, which includes crucial cysteine residues. These residues are essential for binding to the amino-terminal domain of p56lck, and mutations in these cysteines disrupt the interaction (Turner1990Interaction; Shaw1990Short). The binding does not involve disulfide bonds, suggesting that metal ions might stabilize the complex (Turner1990Interaction; Shaw1990Short).

CD8A also interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, playing a role in T-cell activation by mediating adhesion between T lymphocytes and target cells. This interaction is crucial for the recognition of antigens presented by MHC class I molecules and is supported by evidence showing that CD8A can directly bind to these molecules, facilitating cell-cell adhesion (Rosenstein1989Direct). These interactions are vital for the proper functioning of cytotoxic T cells in the immune response.
