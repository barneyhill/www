# NDUFB1

## Overview
NDUFB1 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B1, a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, playing a pivotal role in oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for ATP production in cells. NDUFB1 is characterized by a single transmembrane helix and a C-terminal loop that extends into the intermembrane space, facilitating interactions with other subunits and contributing to the structural stability of complex I (Padavannil2022The). The gene is metazoan-specific, with no homologs in fungi or plants, underscoring its unique evolutionary role in mammals (Padavannil2022The). The absence of NDUFB1 disrupts complex I assembly, highlighting its critical function in cellular energy metabolism (Janssen2006Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The NDUFB1 protein is a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is characterized by a single transmembrane helix (TMH) with a C-terminal loop that extends into the intermembrane space (IMS) (Padavannil2022The). This structural feature allows NDUFB1 to interact with other subunits such as ND4, and it is involved in binding two lipid molecules, which are crucial for the stabilization of structural lipids at the interface of ND2 and ND4 (Padavannil2022The). The C-terminal loop of NDUFB1 also makes contact with subunits NDUFB5 and NDUFB10, indicating its role in the assembly and stability of complex I (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB1 is metazoan-specific, with no homologs found in fungi or plants, highlighting its unique evolutionary role in complex I assembly in mammals (Padavannil2022The). The protein's primary sequence includes the motif 'MNLL', and it is categorized under the topology 'Iβ' (Janssen2006Mitochondrial). Knockout studies in HEK293T cells have demonstrated that NDUFB1 is essential for the proper assembly of complex I, as its absence prevents the formation of the full Q/P intermediate necessary for the addition of the N-module (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFB1 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. NDUFB1 is part of the P D-a subassembly and is composed of a single transmembrane helix with a C-terminal loop extending into the intermembrane space. It interacts with other subunits such as ND4 and binds two lipid molecules, contributing to the stabilization of structural lipids at the interface of ND2 and ND4 (Padavannil2022The).

The absence of NDUFB1 disrupts the assembly of complex I, blocking the formation of the full Q/P intermediate necessary for the addition of the N-module in mammals, highlighting its critical role in complex I assembly (Padavannil2022The). NDUFB1 is metazoan-specific, with no homologs in fungi or plants, indicating its evolutionary significance in stabilizing complex I structure (Padavannil2022The). In healthy human cells, NDUFB1's function is vital for maintaining efficient electron transport and ATP production, which are essential for cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal health.

## Interactions
NDUFB1 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. NDUFB1 is part of the P D-a subassembly and is composed of a single transmembrane helix with a C-terminal loop extending into the intermembrane space. This transmembrane helix contacts the ND4 subunit and binds two lipid molecules, while the C-terminal loop interacts with NDUFB5 and NDUFB10, indicating its role in stabilizing the P P-b/P D-a subassembly (Padavannil2022The).

In HEK293T cells, knockout of NDUFB1 blocks complex I assembly and decreases the abundance of subunits associated with the P P-b, P D-a, and N subassemblies. This suggests that NDUFB1 is essential for the formation of the full Q/P intermediate required for the addition of the N-module in mammals (Padavannil2022The). NDUFB1 appears to be metazoan-specific, as it does not have homologs in fungi or plants. Its primary function may be to stabilize structural lipids at the interface of ND2 and ND4, which is crucial for complex I stability and function (Padavannil2022The).
