# PRB4

## Overview
The PRB4 gene encodes the proline-rich protein BstNI subfamily 4, a salivary protein that plays a crucial role in oral health. This protein is characterized by its high proline content and is involved in the formation of the salivary pellicle, which protects teeth by binding calcium and inhibiting hydroxyapatite formation (Kim1993The; Stubbs1998Encoding). The PRB4 protein is also known for its ability to interact with dietary tannins and function as a masticatory lubricant, aiding in chewing and digestion (Kim1993The). The gene's structure includes multiple tandem repeats, particularly in exon 3, which are essential for the protein's proline-rich nature and its functional properties (Kim1993The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which contribute to its functional diversity and interactions with other molecules (Manconi2016The; Padiglia2018Extensive).

## Structure
The PRB4 protein is a human salivary proline-rich protein characterized by a high content of proline, glycine, and glutamine, which together account for 70-88% of its amino acid composition (Manconi2016The). The primary structure of PRB4 includes several repeated sequences with three to five successive proline residues and six potential glycosylation sites (Pascal2006Overexpression). The protein is encoded by the PRB4 gene, which contains four exons, with exon 3 being the largest and containing 63bp tandem repeats that code for the proline-rich portion of the protein (Padiglia2018Extensive).

PRB4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which contribute to its heterogeneity and influence its function and interaction with other molecules (Manconi2016The; Padiglia2018Extensive). The protein is secreted in human saliva as glycosylated PRP, II-1, and as basic PRP, IB-5, after cleavage by a furin-like protease (Pascal2006Overexpression). The glycosylation of PRB4 is mainly composed of mannose and glucose, with a polysaccharide content similar to human salivary PRP (Pascal2006Overexpression).

PRB4 is intrinsically unstructured, lacking tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, cysteine, isoleucine, and leucine, which results in unusual mobility on SDS-PAGE (Pascal2006Overexpression). The protein's structure is further characterized by its potential O-glycosylation sites and N-glycosylation consensus sequences (Padiglia2018Extensive).

## Function
The PRB4 gene encodes a proline-rich protein that plays a significant role in oral health by contributing to the formation of the salivary pellicle, a protective layer on teeth. This protein is involved in various molecular processes, including the binding of calcium and the inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation, which are crucial for maintaining dental health and preventing tooth decay (Kim1993The; Stubbs1998Encoding). The PRB4 protein is also involved in the proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins, a process necessary for the production of functional proline-rich proteins (PRPs) in saliva (Stubbs1998Encoding; Lyons1988Many).

The PRB4 protein is characterized by its basic and glycosylated nature, which allows it to interact with dietary tannins and act as a masticatory lubricant, facilitating the process of chewing and digestion (Kim1993The). The protein's structure includes multiple tandem repeats in exon 3, which are essential for its proline-rich composition and functional properties (Kim1993The). These molecular activities of PRB4 contribute to its role in oral health by influencing the oral microbiota and providing enamel protection.
