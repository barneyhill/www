# STK19

## Overview
STK19 is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 19, which is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of DNA repair. Despite its name, the protein lacks detectable kinase activity and functions primarily through protein-protein interactions within the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway (van2024STK19; Ramadhin2024STK19). STK19 plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the clearance of lesion-stalled RNA polymerase II during transcription-coupled DNA repair, thereby ensuring the continuation of transcription post-repair (van2024STK19). The protein interacts with key components of the TC-NER complex, such as CSA, UVSSA, and the TFIIH complex, to stabilize and position these factors for effective DNA repair (Mevissen2024STK19; van2024STK19). Additionally, mutations in the STK19 gene, such as the D89N mutation, have been implicated in melanoma development, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Yin2019Pharmacological).

## Function
STK19 is a crucial factor in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) in human cells, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability. It facilitates the clearance of lesion-stalled RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) during TCR, ensuring that transcription can continue after DNA damage has been repaired (van2024STK19). STK19 interacts with several components of the TCR complex, including CSA and UVSSA, and is involved in the proper positioning and function of these factors within the complex (Mevissen2024STK19; van2024STK19). 

STK19 also plays a role in the ubiquitylation and degradation of RNAPII, a critical step for the removal of stalled RNAPII from chromatin, allowing access for downstream nucleotide excision repair proteins to the DNA lesion (van2024STK19). It stabilizes the TC-NER complex and promotes the recruitment of the TFIIH complex, which is essential for the repair of transcription-blocking lesions (Tan2024STK19; Ramadhin2024STK19). Despite its name, STK19 lacks detectable kinase activity and functions primarily through its interactions with other proteins in the TCR pathway (van2024STK19; Ramadhin2024STK19).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STK19 gene have been implicated in the development of melanoma, particularly in the context of NRAS-driven melanomagenesis. The STK19 D89N mutation is identified as a gain-of-function mutation that enhances NRAS phosphorylation, leading to increased signaling through pathways such as MEK-ERK and PI3K, which promote melanocyte proliferation and malignant transformation (Yin2019Pharmacological). This mutation is associated with a higher incidence of melanoma in genetically engineered mouse models, especially when combined with oncogenic NRAS mutations like Q61R (Yin2019Pharmacological).

The STK19 D89N mutation is also noted as a UVR signature mutation, suggesting its role in melanoma development due to ultraviolet radiation exposure (Yin2019Pharmacological). Inhibition of STK19 using specific inhibitors, such as ZT-012-037-1, has shown potential in reducing melanoma progression by targeting NRAS-driven pathways, indicating a promising therapeutic approach for NRAS mutant melanomas (Yin2019Pharmacological).

STK19's role extends beyond melanoma, as it is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathways, crucial for DNA damage repair. Alterations in STK19 expression or function could potentially impact the stability of repair complexes and the ubiquitylation of RNA polymerase II, although specific mutations in STK19 have not been directly linked to conditions like Cockayne syndrome (Ramadhin2024STK19).

## Interactions
STK19 is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and interacts with several key proteins in this process. It binds to the XPD subunit of the TFIIH complex, which is crucial for positioning TFIIH on the TC-NER complex and facilitating DNA repair (Mevissen2024STK19). This interaction involves the WH3 domain of STK19 and is essential for the proper functioning of TC-NER (Mevissen2024STK19). STK19 also interacts with CSA and DDB1, which are important for the stability and function of the TC-NER complex (Mevissen2024STK19).

STK19 is part of a complex that includes RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), CSB, CSA-DDB1, UVSSA, and ELOF1, which are involved in the clearance of lesion-stalled RNAPII (van2024STK19). It facilitates the recruitment of TFIIH to the TC-NER complex by stabilizing UVSSA and interacting directly with XPD (Ramadhin2024STK19). The interaction with RNAPII is crucial for transcription recovery after DNA damage, as STK19 helps clear lesion-stalled RNAPII, allowing for the recruitment of downstream repair proteins (van2024STK19).
