# C20orf144

## Overview
C20orf144 is a gene located on chromosome 20 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 20 open reading frame 144. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite the limited understanding of its precise role, C20orf144 has been implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer prognosis. The gene's expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in several cancer types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, in testicular germ cell tumors, its expression is part of a gene panel linked to disease-free survival, suggesting a nuanced role in cancer biology (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further research is necessary to elucidate the protein's function and its potential implications in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C20orf144 has been identified as having prognostic significance in certain cancers. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), low expression levels of C20orf144 are associated with unfavorable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker in these cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The exclusion of C20orf144 from gene panels significantly decreases the prognostic significance of the remaining genes in these cancers, highlighting its importance in the prognostic assessment (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), C20orf144 is part of a six-gene panel where low expression levels correlate with better disease-free survival, suggesting a complex role in cancer prognosis that may vary depending on the cancer type (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In mouse models, C20orf144, also known as 1700003F12Rik, has been associated with a homeostasis/metabolism phenotype, indicating potential implications in metabolic processes, although specific clinical significance in humans remains to be fully elucidated (Petit2015Combining). Further research is needed to clarify the role of C20orf144 in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target.
