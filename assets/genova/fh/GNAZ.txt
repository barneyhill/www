# GNAZ

## Overview
The GNAZ gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha z, a member of the Gαi family of proteins, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its nucleotide-binding domain with intrinsic GTPase activity and is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including neurotransmission and sensory perception. G protein subunit alpha z is particularly significant in the brain and retina, where it influences adenyl cyclase activity and ion channel regulation, and is implicated in circadian photoreceptor function. The protein's unique biochemical properties, such as slower GTP hydrolysis kinetics, distinguish it from other Gα subunits. GNAZ's interactions with other proteins, such as ADAM17 and the delta opioid receptor, underscore its role in maintaining cellular barrier functions and GPCR-mediated signaling pathways. Clinically, alterations in the GNAZ gene have been associated with conditions like melanoma, bipolar affective disorder, and retinal diseases, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Chan2023Blue; Sriroopreddy2019Differentially; Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Structure
The GNAZ gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha z, which is part of the Gαi family of proteins. This protein is characterized by a nucleotide-binding domain with intrinsic GTPase activity and an α-helical domain. The GNAZ protein has a predicted disorder profile of 23.7%, with a long N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDPR) and multiple post-translational modification (PTM) sites, which are crucial for its function (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). 

The structural rearrangements of segments known as switches I-III are essential for the protein's function. In the GDP-bound form, switches II and III are disordered but undergo a disorder-order transition upon GTPγS binding (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). GNAZ is distinct from other Gα subunits due to its unique biochemical properties, such as slower GTP hydrolysis kinetics (CárdenasNavia2010Novel).

The GNAZ gene has a unique exon-intron structure, located on the opposite strand within an intron of the RSPH14 gene, suggesting it may have emerged through retrotransposition (Lokits2018Tracing). Common post-translational modifications include myristoylation and palmitoylation, which are important for membrane localization. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of GNAZ are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The GNAZ gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha z, which is part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in signal transduction. This protein plays a crucial role in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors, influencing various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, GNAZ is primarily involved in the activation of adenyl cyclase and ion channels, specifically calcium (Ca 2+) and potassium (K +) channels, which are essential for neurotransmission and sensory perception (Sriroopreddy2019Differentially).

GNAZ is expressed at high levels in the brain and is a key substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) mediated responses, which are important for lipid hydrolysis and signal transduction (Sriroopreddy2019Differentially). In the retina, GNAZ is involved in the circadian regulation of photoreceptor function, potentially mediated by dopamine signaling via D4 receptors. This regulation is independent of light/dark transitions and is controlled by the retinal circadian clock (Vancura2017Gnaz).

Additionally, GNAZ acts as a negative regulator of ADAM17, an enzyme involved in the degradation of CLDN5, a protein crucial for maintaining the integrity of the inner blood-retinal barrier. Under normal conditions, GNAZ inhibits ADAM17 activity, thereby helping to maintain cellular barrier functions (Chan2023Blue).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GNAZ gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In melanoma, GNAZ has been identified with nonsynonymous somatic mutations in about 5% of tumors studied. These mutations occur in the G protein alpha subunit domain, which is crucial for G protein interactions with receptors and effectors, potentially affecting critical functions of GNAZ in cancer progression (CárdenasNavia2010Novel). 

In the context of bipolar affective disorder (BPD), a study found a potential association between a polymorphism in the GNAZ gene and BPD. The frequency of the 309T polymorphism was higher in patients with BPD compared to controls, suggesting a possible link, although the statistical significance was not strong enough to confirm a definitive association (Saito1999Analysis).

GNAZ also plays a role in retinal health. Blue light exposure has been shown to disrupt the interaction between GNAZ and ADAM17, leading to the degradation of claudin-5 (CLDN5) and increased retinal permeability. This disruption can contribute to retinal damage and conditions like retinopathy and macular degeneration (Chan2023Blue). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of GNAZ in various pathological conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
GNAZ, the G protein subunit alpha z, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of signal transduction. In resting endothelial cells, GNAZ interacts with ADAM17, an interaction that is disrupted upon exposure to blue light. This disruption leads to the dissociation of the GNAZ-ADAM17 complex, resulting in the activation of ADAM17 and subsequent degradation of CLDN5, a protein crucial for maintaining the blood-retinal barrier. GNAZ acts as a negative regulator of ADAM17, sequestering its activity under normal conditions (Chan2023Blue).

The intrinsic disorder and structural features of GNAZ, similar to other Gα i family members, suggest potential interaction capabilities due to its conformational flexibility. This intrinsic disorder may play a role in its functionality and interaction with other molecules, although specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNAZ is also associated with the delta opioid receptor (DOPr), where it has been identified as one of the G protein subunits potentially interacting with this receptor. This interaction highlights GNAZ's role in GPCR-mediated signaling pathways (Degrandmaison2020In).
