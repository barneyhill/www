# VWC2L

## Overview
VWC2L, or von Willebrand factor C domain containing 2 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various biological processes, particularly in neural development and bone formation. The protein encoded by VWC2L functions as a neural-specific antagonist of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling, which is crucial for promoting neurogenesis over astrogenesis in neural precursor cells. This regulatory role is essential for maintaining the balance between neuron and astrocyte generation, thereby supporting proper brain development and function (Miller2018Cortical). Additionally, VWC2L is implicated in bone growth by modulating the activity of Osterix, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, highlighting its significance in the musculoskeletal system (Kulminski2019Polygenic). The protein also engages in interactions with various cellular receptors and proteins, suggesting its involvement in metabolic regulation and cancer progression (Karunakaran2018Mesothelioma; Siepe2022Identification).

## Structure


## Function
The VWC2L gene, also known as Brorin-like, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in neural development by modulating BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling. VWC2L acts as a neural-specific antagonist of BMP signaling, promoting neurogenesis over astrogenesis in neural precursor cells. This antagonistic action is crucial for maintaining the balance between the generation of neurons and astrocytes, which is essential for proper brain development and function (Miller2018Cortical). In healthy human cells, VWC2L is primarily expressed in neurons, with its expression increasing in astrocytes as they age. This suggests a role in the ongoing regulation of neural cell fate and possibly in neurodegenerative conditions (Miller2018Cortical).

VWC2L is also involved in bone formation by modulating the activity of Osterix, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor. This indicates its role in the development and maintenance of the musculoskeletal system, particularly in bone growth and development (Kulminski2019Polygenic). Additionally, VWC2L is implicated in regulatory processes in human cells, potentially influencing gene expression through enhancer activity and interactions with transcription factors (Kulminski2019Polygenic).

## Interactions
VWC2L, or von Willebrand factor C domain containing 2 like, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in various biological processes. One notable interaction is with CD36, a receptor involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. This interaction was identified using a CRISPRa enrichment screening platform, which suggested a potential binding of VWC2L to CD36 on the cell surface, indicating a possible role in cellular signaling or metabolic regulation (Siepe2022Identification).

In the context of cancer, VWC2L interacts with ATIC, a protein involved in purine biosynthesis, which may contribute to cancer cell metabolism and malignant transformation. VWC2L also interacts with CHEK1, a cell cycle regulator implicated in breast cancer metastasis, and TRAF2, a protein that enhances cancer cell invasion and metastasis. These interactions suggest that VWC2L may play a role in the convergence of metabolic and oncogenic pathways, potentially influencing cancer progression (Karunakaran2018Mesothelioma).

In neurobiology, VWC2L is known to act as a neural-specific antagonist of BMP signaling, promoting neurogenesis over astrogenesis in mouse neural precursor cells. This function aligns with its role in antagonizing BMPs, which typically shift neural precursor cell fate from neurogenesis to astrogenesis (Miller2018Cortical).
