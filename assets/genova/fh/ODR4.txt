# ODR4

## Overview
ODR4 is a gene that encodes the odr-4 GPCR localization factor homolog, a protein involved in the localization and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This protein plays a critical role in the maturation and proper trafficking of GPCRs, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The odr-4 GPCR localization factor homolog is known to interact with the human ortholog of UfSP2, a Ufm1-specific protease, forming a complex that is essential for the proper folding and export of GPCRs. This interaction is crucial for the function of olfactory receptors, such as the ODR-10 receptor in Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating a conserved mechanism across species (Chen2014An). The protein's role as a potential chaperone or cargo receptor highlights its importance in the posttranscriptional regulation and trafficking of GPCRs, contributing to the understanding of sensory perception and signaling pathways (Chen2014An; Dwyer1998Odorant).

## Interactions
The human gene ODR4, known as the odr-4 GPCR localization factor homolog, is involved in the localization and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). ODR4 interacts with the human ortholog of UfSP2, a Ufm1-specific protease, forming a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This interaction is crucial for the maturation and proper trafficking of GPCRs, such as the olfactory receptor ODR-10 in C. elegans, suggesting a conserved function across species (Chen2014An).

In C. elegans, ODR-4 forms a complex with ODR-8/UfSP2, facilitating the trafficking of the ODR-10 receptor to sensory cilia. This complex is essential for the proper folding and export of GPCRs from the ER, indicating that ODR-4 may act as a chaperone or cargo receptor, assisting in the folding or stabilization of olfactory receptors (Chen2014An; Dwyer1998Odorant). The interaction between ODR-4 and ODR-8/UfSP2 is not dependent on the protease activity of UfSP2, highlighting a Ufm1-independent mechanism in GPCR maturation (Chen2014An). These interactions underscore the role of ODR4 in the posttranscriptional regulation and trafficking of GPCRs within neurons.
