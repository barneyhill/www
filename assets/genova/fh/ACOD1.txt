# ACOD1

## Overview
ACOD1, or aconitate decarboxylase 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme aconitate decarboxylase 1, which plays a pivotal role in immunometabolism. This enzyme is primarily active in macrophages, where it catalyzes the conversion of cis-aconitate to itaconate, a metabolite with notable antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. As a key player in metabolic reprogramming, ACOD1 influences the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in immune cells, a process essential for effective host defense mechanisms. The enzyme's activity is crucial for modulating immune responses, maintaining redox balance, and linking innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, ACOD1 is involved in various interactions that affect its function, including inhibition by citraconate and modulation of inflammatory pathways through its product, itaconate (Wu2020ACOD1; Chen2022Citraconate; Wang2023Metabolica).

## Structure
The human ACOD1 gene encodes the enzyme aconitate decarboxylase 1, which forms homodimers in solution, indicating its quaternary structure as a homodimer (Chen2019Crystal). The crystal structure of human cis-aconitate decarboxylase (hCAD), comprising residues 4 to 461, has been determined at a resolution of 1.7 Å (Chen2019Crystal). Each monomer of hCAD consists of two distinct domains: a larger domain that is purely α-helical, encompassing residues 1 to 267 and 413 to 462, and a smaller domain, comprising residues 273 to 410, which folds into an antiparallel β-sheet with four strands and three helical elements (Chen2019Crystal). The active site is located at the interface between these two domains, with specific residues identified as important for catalysis (Chen2019Crystal).

The dimer interface is approximately 2,000 Å² and is located on the larger domain (Chen2019Crystal). The study highlights the impact of naturally occurring human mutations on itaconate synthesis, showing that certain mutations can significantly alter enzymatic activity (Chen2019Crystal). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of hCAD are not provided in the available context (Chen2019Crystal).

## Function
The ACOD1 gene, also known as aconitate decarboxylase 1, plays a crucial role in immunometabolism by regulating the production of itaconate, a metabolite with significant antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In healthy human cells, ACOD1 is primarily active in macrophages, where it catalyzes the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconate. This process is essential for modulating immune responses and cellular metabolism (Wu2020ACOD1; Wang2023Metabolica).

ACOD1 is involved in the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, particularly under inflammatory conditions. It facilitates the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is vital for host defense. Itaconate, produced by ACOD1, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and inactivates KEAP1, leading to the activation of NFE2L2 and enhancing the antioxidant capacity of immune cells (Wu2020ACOD1).

The gene also plays a role in mitochondrial metabolism, influencing the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This balance is crucial for macrophage polarization and function, impacting the immune response and maintaining redox balance (Wang2023Metabolica). ACOD1's activity in these processes underscores its importance in linking innate and adaptive immunity (Wu2020ACOD1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACOD1 gene, also known as aconitate decarboxylase 1, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of diet-induced obesity, increased ACOD1 expression is observed in the colon of obese individuals and correlates with lower glucose tolerance. This suggests a role in obesity-related metabolic disturbances (Eberhart2024ACOD1). In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), higher ACOD1 expression in the liver correlates with disease severity and hepatic steatosis grades, indicating its involvement in liver-related metabolic disorders (Eberhart2024ACOD1).

ACOD1 is also linked to inflammatory responses. Itaconate, a metabolite produced by ACOD1, has immunomodulatory properties and is involved in limiting inflammatory responses. Alterations in ACOD1 expression can impact conditions like chronic inflammation and cardiovascular diseases (Chen2019Crystal). In the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ACOD1 expression in myeloid cells is crucial for preventing excessive inflammation and immunopathology, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Nair2018Irg1).

Furthermore, ACOD1 has been associated with cancer progression. Itaconate released from macrophages may act as a growth factor for tumors, and a protumorigenic role of ACOD1 has been reported in gliomas (Chen2022Citraconate).

## Interactions
ACOD1, also known as aconitate decarboxylase 1, participates in several interactions that influence its function in immune responses and metabolic processes. It is directly inhibited by citraconate, which binds to the active site of ACOD1, reducing its catalytic activity by about 90% at a concentration of 10 mM. This interaction involves electrostatic attractions with specific residues such as His159, Lys207, Lys272, and Leu278, forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that are crucial for the inhibitory effect (Chen2022Citraconate).

ACOD1 is also involved in metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, particularly macrophages, through its product itaconate. Itaconate interacts with several proteins, including KEAP1, by alkylating specific cysteine residues, which leads to the activation of the transcription factor NFE2L2 (NRF2). This activation enhances the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of immune cells (Wu2020ACOD1). Itaconate also interacts with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines by limiting aerobic glycolysis (Wu2020ACOD1).

These interactions highlight ACOD1's role in modulating inflammation and immune responses through both direct inhibition by small molecules and the effects of its metabolic products.
