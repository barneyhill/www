# ZNF107

## Overview
ZNF107 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 107, a transcription factor characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcriptional landscape within the nucleus (Zhang2021Whole‐genome). ZNF107 is also involved in maintaining chromatin architecture, as it frequently interacts with gene-dense regions and is located near the centromere (Gheldof2013Structural). While its specific physiological functions are not fully elucidated, ZNF107 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as left ventricular non-compaction and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Saeliw2022LINE1; Zhang2021Whole‐genome).

## Function
ZNF107 (zinc finger protein 107) is a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in modulating gene expression. It contains C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate direct interactions with DNA, allowing it to function as a transcription factor (Zhang2021Whole‐genome). Although the specific physiological functions of ZNF107 in healthy human cells are not fully explored, it is known to be active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by binding to specific DNA sequences. This activity is crucial for regulating processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

ZNF107 is part of a broader network of gene interactions, as evidenced by its frequent chromatin interactions with gene-dense regions and its proximity to the centromere, which suggests a role in maintaining chromatin architecture (Gheldof2013Structural). Despite its involvement in these interactions, studies have not shown significant changes in ZNF107 expression in certain conditions, such as Williams-Beuren syndrome, indicating that its function might be more related to structural roles in chromatin rather than direct gene expression changes (Gheldof2013Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF107 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In a study involving a three-generation Chinese family, a stop-gain variant in ZNF107 was identified as a potential contributor to left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), a rare genetic cardiomyopathy. This variant was classified among the top 0.1% of deleterious variants in the human genome, suggesting a significant impact on cardiac health (Zhang2021Whole‐genome).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the methylation status of Alu elements within the ZNF107 gene has been studied as a potential biomarker. The AluSq element within ZNF107 showed high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing ASD with 16.p11.2 deletion from non-ASD and ASD with CHD8 variants, indicating that epigenetic dysregulation of ZNF107 may alter the function of autism-related genes (Saeliw2022LINE1).

ZNF107 has also been studied in relation to Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). Although no significant changes in expression were observed in WBS patient cell lines, structural changes in chromatin architecture and histone marks were noted, suggesting that ZNF107 may be involved in the broader genomic alterations associated with WBS (Gheldof2013Structural).

## Interactions
ZNF107, a zinc finger protein, is implicated in various biological processes through its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in transcriptional regulation. Although specific protein interactions involving ZNF107 are not extensively detailed, some studies provide insights into its potential roles. In the context of left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), ZNF107 is identified as a candidate gene with a stop-gain variant, suggesting its possible involvement in cardiac functions through its zinc finger regions, which are known to mediate DNA interactions and serve as transcriptional regulators (Zhang2021Whole‐genome).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ZNF107 is part of a module of down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within a functional interaction network, indicating its potential role in the disease's molecular pathways (Luo2017Identification). Additionally, ZNF107 is included in a module associated with early embryonic development and ESC differentiation, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle-related processes (Shen2021Conserved).

While these studies highlight the potential significance of ZNF107 in various biological contexts, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored, necessitating further research to elucidate its precise functional roles.
