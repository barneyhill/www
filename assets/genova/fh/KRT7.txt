# KRT7

## Overview
KRT7 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 7, a type II intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in epithelial cells. Keratin 7 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of these cells, contributing to various cellular processes such as organelle positioning, protein targeting, and cell cycle progression. The protein is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, essential for its structural function, and forms heterodimers with other keratins to maintain filament stability. Keratin 7 is involved in significant physiological processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is crucial for development, immune response, and wound healing. Its expression is regulated by factors such as TGF-β1, and it interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cancer progression and metastasis. Alterations in KRT7 expression are associated with several cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging; Smith2002Cloning; An2020KRT7).

## Structure
Keratin 7 (KRT7) is a type II intermediate filament protein primarily found in epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This rod domain is crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function (Smith2002Cloning). The secondary structure of KRT7 is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of stable filamentous structures. 

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT7 assembles into filaments, which are essential for maintaining cellular architecture and resilience. The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with other keratins, such as K8 and K18, which are necessary for filament stability and function (Alam2021Keratin). 

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in the regulation of KRT7. These modifications are crucial for the assembly and disassembly of keratin filaments, affecting their dynamic nature and function in response to cellular stress and signaling (Smith2002Cloning). The conservation of certain serine and threonine residues across species suggests potential phosphorylation sites that are important for KRT7's regulatory mechanisms (Smith2002Cloning).

## Function
Keratin 7 (KRT7) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial cells. It is primarily expressed in simple epithelia, such as those lining internal organs, glandular ducts, and blood vessels (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging). KRT7 is involved in various cellular processes, including the positioning of organelles, protein targeting, cell polarization, cellular motion, cell size determination, protein synthesis, transmembrane transport, cell cycle progression, cell death, and signal transduction (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging).

In healthy human cells, KRT7 contributes to normal physiological processes such as proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are essential for embryo development, immune response, and wound healing (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging). The protein is active in the cytoskeleton, where it forms intermediate filaments that provide structural support to epithelial cells. KRT7's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating repair mechanisms.

KRT7 expression is regulated by factors such as TGF-β1, which significantly increases its expression through SMAD 2/3 signaling pathways (Fowler2022A). This regulation is crucial for its role in cellular differentiation and response to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KRT7 gene are associated with various cancers, including ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. In ovarian cancer, KRT7 is upregulated and linked to tumor progression through the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. This upregulation correlates with advanced cancer stages and poor prognosis (An2020KRT7). In colorectal cancer, KRT7 expression is influenced by Fusobacterium nucleatum infection, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to increased KRT7 expression and enhanced cancer cell migration and metastasis (Chen2020Fusobacterium). 

KRT7 is also implicated in bladder cancer, where its mRNA expression in circulating tumor cells is associated with higher cancer stages and lymph node involvement, indicating a higher risk of metastasis and poor prognosis (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging). In lung adenocarcinoma, high KRT7 mRNA expression in peripheral blood is linked to worse performance status, although its prognostic value remains uncertain (Koren2015Prognostic). These findings suggest that KRT7 overexpression is a reliable indicator of poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging).

## Interactions
Keratin 7 (KRT7) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cancer progression and metastasis. KRT7 interacts with the long non-coding antisense RNA KRT7-AS, which forms an RNA-RNA duplex with KRT7 mRNA. This interaction stabilizes KRT7 mRNA, enhancing its expression at both the RNA and protein levels, particularly in gastric cancer cells (Huang2016Long). The overlapping (OL) region of KRT7-AS is crucial for this stabilizing effect, as it protects KRT7 mRNA from degradation (Huang2016Long).

KRT7 is also associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration through the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. It facilitates the translocation and phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which are essential for EMT, and is linked to the expression of mesenchymal markers such as Snail1, Snail2, Twist1, Twist2, MMP2, MMP9, Fibronectin, and Vimentin (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging; An2020KRT7). In ovarian cancer, KRT7 overexpression increases cell-matrix adhesion via the integrin-β1-FAK signaling pathway, promoting tumor cell metastasis (An2020KRT7).

KRT7 is also linked to immune evasion in tumors by correlating with the expression of immune checkpoints such as CD274 (PD-L1), CD276 (B7-H3), HAVCR2 (TIM-3), and VTCN1 (B7-H4), contributing to a suppressive tumor microenvironment (Hosseinalizadeh2024Emerging).
