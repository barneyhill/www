# NAA60

## Overview
The NAA60 gene encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 60, NatF catalytic subunit, a Golgi-localized bi-functional acetyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the acetylation of N-terminal α-amines of transmembrane proteins and lysine residues on histone H4, playing a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and proper chromatin assembly (Aksnes2015An; Chen2016Structure). The NAA60 protein is characterized by a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold and is essential for cell cycle regulation, particularly at the S/G2/M checkpoint (Donnarumma2022NAA60). Mutations in the NAA60 gene are linked to autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcifications, underscoring its significance in brain development and function (Chelban2024Biallelic).

## Structure
The NAA60 protein, also known as NatF, is a Golgi-localized bi-functional acetyltransferase characterized by a unique molecular structure. It contains a central domain with a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold, which includes nine β-sheets and six α-helices, essential for its enzymatic activity (Chen2016Structure; Donnarumma2022NAA60). The protein's structure features specific loops and hairpins, such as the β3-β4 loop, which is longer in NAA60 compared to other NATs and plays a crucial role in substrate interaction (Donnarumma2022NAA60). 

The C-terminal region of NAA60 is critical for its Golgi localization, containing amphipathic α-helices that interact with the membrane through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Aksnes2017Molecular). This region also includes putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) and S-palmitoylation sites, which are important for membrane localization (Donnarumma2022NAA60). 

NAA60 forms a homodimer in the presence of its substrate, with specific residues mediating dimer stability through van der Waals and non-covalent interactions (Donnarumma2022NAA60). The protein is also subject to auto-acetylation on specific lysine residues, which influences its activity (Chen2016Structure).

## Function
The NAA60 gene encodes a Golgi-localized bi-functional acetyltransferase involved in N-terminal acetylation and lysine Nε-acetylation. This enzyme, also known as NatF, primarily acetylates the N-terminal α-amine of transmembrane proteins and lysine residues on histone H4, including H4K20, H4K79, and H4K91 (Chen2016Structure). NAA60 is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus, as its depletion leads to Golgi fragmentation and chromosomal segregation defects during mitosis (Aksnes2015An; Donnarumma2022NAA60).

NAA60's activity is essential for proper chromatin assembly and nucleosome organization, which are vital for genome expression and cell growth. It plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle, with its expression peaking at the S/G2/M checkpoint, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression (Donnarumma2022NAA60). The enzyme's localization to the Golgi is facilitated by its C-terminal transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in acetylating transmembrane proteins and maintaining Golgi ribbon integrity (Aksnes2015An; Donnarumma2022NAA60). Overall, NAA60 is vital for maintaining normal cell function through its roles in protein acetylation, chromatin structure, and response to DNA damage (Donnarumma2022NAA60).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAA60 gene are associated with autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcifications (PFBC), a condition characterized by calcium deposits in the brain that lead to movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline (Chelban2024Biallelic). These mutations result in impaired N-terminal acetylation capacity, affecting the function of membrane proteins such as SLC20A2, which is crucial for maintaining phosphate homeostasis in the brain (Chelban2024Biallelic). The loss of NAA60 function leads to a lack of N-terminal acetylation of several membrane proteins at the Golgi apparatus, potentially causing phosphate and calcium phosphate accumulation in the brain (Chelban2024Biallelic).

Clinical features of individuals with NAA60 mutations include developmental disorders, movement disorders like ataxia and parkinsonism, psychiatric features, and cognitive impairments (Chelban2024Biallelic). The age of onset varies, with symptoms appearing from early childhood to early twenties, and the phenotype becomes more uniform as the disease progresses (Chelban2024Biallelic). The study of NAA60 variants highlights the gene's role in brain development and function, with its highest expression in the putamen, a region associated with movement and coordination (Chelban2024Biallelic).
