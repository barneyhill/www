# GOLGA6A

## Overview
GOLGA6A is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family member A, which is part of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins. These proteins are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle responsible for the processing and trafficking of proteins and lipids within cells. Golgin A6 family member A is believed to play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi cisternae and facilitating membrane fusion processes. While the precise function of GOLGA6A in human cells is not fully understood, it is predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane, and cytoplasm, similar to other golgin proteins (Bekpen2019Human; Galson2014Pathobiology). The gene is part of a larger family of GOLGA genes that are implicated in fundamental cellular functions related to vesicular traffic and Golgi architecture maintenance (Bekpen2019Human; Trivedi2021Arraybased).

## Structure


## Function
GOLGA6A is a member of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in processing and trafficking proteins and lipids within cells. These proteins are thought to play a role in membrane fusion and provide structural support for the Golgi cisternae (Galson2014Pathobiology; Ralston2012Pathogenesis). Although the specific function of GOLGA6A in healthy human cells is not well-defined, it is predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane, and cytoplasm, similar to other golgin proteins like GM130 (Bekpen2019Human).

The GOLGA6A gene is part of a larger family of GOLGA genes, which are involved in basic cellular functions related to the Golgi apparatus, such as vesicular traffic and maintenance of Golgi architecture (Bekpen2019Human; Trivedi2021Arraybased). The expression of GOLGA6A and its potential role in cellular processes suggest it may contribute to the proper processing and transport of proteins and lipids, although specific molecular activities and organismal outcomes remain to be fully elucidated (Bekpen2019Human).
