# ARHGAP36

## Overview
ARHGAP36 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 36, which is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, including protein kinase A (PKA) and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. The protein is categorized as a Rho GTPase-activating protein, although it lacks the typical catalytic activity associated with this class, suggesting it may have non-catalytic roles (Nano2021Structureactivity). ARHGAP36 is characterized by multiple isoforms, each with distinct functional domains that contribute to its regulatory roles. The protein's N-terminal region contains an arginine-rich motif that inhibits PKA activity, while its C-terminal domain is involved in modulating protein trafficking and activity (Nano2021Structureactivity; Eccles2016Bimodal). ARHGAP36 is implicated in various biological processes, including neural development and tumorigenesis, and is overexpressed in certain cancers, such as medulloblastoma, where it acts as an oncogene (Beckmann2019Sleeping; Rack2014Arhgap36dependent).

## Structure
ARHGAP36 is a protein with multiple isoforms, each varying in the N-terminal region while sharing a Rho GAP domain and an arginine-rich region (Eccles2016Bimodal). The protein's N-terminal domain is crucial for its function, containing an arginine-rich motif that inhibits protein kinase A (PKA) activity and mediates PKA degradation, which is essential for Gli transcription factor activation (Nano2021Structureactivity). This region includes two arginines, R153 and R154, which are part of a sequence resembling the consensus motif for PKAC substrates/inhibitors (Eccles2016Bimodal).

The GAP-like domain of ARHGAP36 lacks the typical 'arginine finger' motif, which is common in other Rho GTPase-activating proteins, suggesting non-catalytic roles (Nano2021Structureactivity). This domain may interact with other proteins, such as PREPL, influencing ARHGAP36's function (Nano2021Structureactivity).

The C-terminal domain of ARHGAP36 is involved in counteracting an autoinhibitory motif in certain isoforms, enhancing the protein's activity and promoting its trafficking to the primary cilium (Nano2021Structureactivity). ARHGAP36 is expressed in five splice variants, with isoform 1 being predominant in the fetal cerebellum and others in medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma (Nano2021Structureactivity).

## Function
ARHGAP36 is a protein involved in the regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. It acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAC), blocking substrate binding and promoting PKAC degradation through a unique endolysosomal pathway, which is atypical for cytosolic proteins (Eccles2016Bimodal). This degradation is mediated by K63-linked ubiquitylation at a specific site, K285, and is Vps4 dependent (Eccles2016Bimodal). ARHGAP36's interaction with PKAC suggests it plays a role in modulating PKA signaling, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Eccles2016Bimodal).

In the context of Hh signaling, ARHGAP36 functions independently of Smoothened (Smo) to activate Gli transcription factors by preventing their phosphorylation-dependent proteolysis, thus promoting the transcription of Hh target genes (Nano2021Structureactivity; Rack2014Arhgap36dependent). This noncanonical activation of Gli is significant in neural development and tumorigenesis, as ARHGAP36 is overexpressed in certain cancers, such as medulloblastomas resistant to Smo inhibitors (Rack2014Arhgap36dependent). The protein's activity is regulated by its structure and interactions, allowing it to translate cellular inputs into distinct signaling outputs (Nano2020Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ARHGAP36 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. ARHGAP36 is overexpressed in certain subtypes of medulloblastoma, a common childhood brain tumor, where it acts as an oncogene. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors, which are used in treating Hedgehog pathway-related cancers (Beckmann2019Sleeping; Rack2014Arhgap36dependent). Transposon insertions in the ARHGAP36 locus have been linked to increased expression in medulloblastomas, particularly in groups 3 and 4, contributing to tumor progression and accelerated mortality (Beckmann2019Sleeping).

ARHGAP36 is also involved in neural development and has been associated with neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma, tumors of neural crest origin (Eccles2016Bimodal). In addition, mutations in ARHGAP36 have been linked to spina bifida, a neural tube defect, suggesting a broader role in developmental disorders (Nano2021Structureactivity).

In a rare condition characterized by progressive ectopic calcification, ARHGAP36 is activated through enhancer hijacking, leading to abnormal bone formation. This condition highlights the gene's role in bone-related signaling pathways and its potential involvement in other connective tissue-to-bone transformation diseases (Melo2023Enhancer).

## Interactions
ARHGAP36 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. It acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of Protein Kinase A catalytic subunits (PKAC), inhibiting their activity and promoting their degradation through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. This interaction is facilitated by ARHGAP36's N-terminal region, which is crucial for recruiting PKAC to the plasma membrane and vesicles (Eccles2016Bimodal). The interaction with PKAC involves a pseudosubstrate motif, leading to PKAC's polyubiquitylation and degradation via the endolysosomal pathway (Eccles2016Bimodal).

ARHGAP36 also interacts with Patched1, influencing the ciliary translocation of Smoothened and subsequent hedgehog pathway activation (Nam2019Critical). It is involved in a complex with E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Praja2, Stub1, and Huwe1, which facilitate PKAC ubiquitination and degradation (Eccles2016Bimodal). Additionally, ARHGAP36 interacts with the protein PREPL, which can suppress ARHGAP36-mediated Gli activation by decreasing ARHGAP36 protein levels (Nano2021Structureactivity). These interactions highlight ARHGAP36's role in modulating key signaling pathways through its interactions with various proteins.
