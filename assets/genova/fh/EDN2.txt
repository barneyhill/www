# EDN2

## Overview
Endothelin 2 (EDN2) is a gene that encodes the peptide endothelin 2, a member of the endothelin family known for its potent vasoconstrictive properties. The endothelin 2 peptide plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including ovulation, where it facilitates follicle rupture through its action on myofibroblast cells in the ovarian follicle (Ko2022Endothelin). Beyond its reproductive functions, endothelin 2 is involved in vascular regulation, angiogenesis, and immune cell recruitment, contributing to processes such as corpus luteum formation and vascular permeability (Cacioppo2014Loss; Ko2022Endothelin). Clinically, alterations in EDN2 expression are linked to reproductive disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and retinal pathologies, underscoring its importance in both health and disease (Alrashdi2018Endothelin2; Ling2012Endothelin‐2).

## Structure
Endothelin 2 (EDN2) is a peptide encoded by the EDN2 gene, belonging to the endothelin family known for its role in vasoconstriction. The primary structure of EDN2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form a peptide chain. This sequence is crucial for its biological activity and interaction with receptors. The secondary structure of EDN2 may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of EDN2 refers to the three-dimensional folding of the peptide, which is essential for its biological activity. This folding allows the peptide to interact effectively with its target receptors and perform its physiological functions. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple peptide units, although specific details about this aspect of EDN2 are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the stability and function of EDN2. Disulfide bond formation is a critical modification that enhances the stability of the peptide, ensuring its proper function within the endothelin family. These structural features collectively contribute to the biological activity of EDN2 as a potent vasoconstrictor.

## Function
Endothelin 2 (EDN2) is a peptide that plays a crucial role in the ovulation process by promoting contraction in the myofibroblast cells of the theca layer of the follicle, which is essential for follicle rupture and oocyte release (Ko2022Endothelin). EDN2 is transiently expressed in granulosa cells of ovulatory follicles just before ovulation, acting as a trigger for follicle rupture through an EDNRA-mediated pathway that induces follicle contraction (Ko2022Endothelin). This contraction is necessary for ovulation, as it facilitates the release of the oocyte (Ko2022Endothelin).

EDN2 is also involved in the regulation of vascular functions within the ovary. It may bind to EDNRB on vascular endothelial cells, inducing nitric oxide production, which causes vasodilation and increases vascular permeability, potentially influencing follicular rupture (Ko2022Endothelin). However, its role in successful ovulation is likely independent of these vascular changes (Ko2022Endothelin).

In addition to its role in ovulation, EDN2 is involved in angiogenesis, cell migration, and cell proliferation, which are necessary for corpus luteum formation (Cacioppo2014Loss). It acts as a chemoattractant for immune cells, promoting macrophage accumulation, which may influence the degradation of the follicular basal lamina necessary for ovulation (Ko2022Endothelin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the EDN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of reproductive health, EDN2 is crucial for normal ovulation and corpus luteum formation. Loss of function in the EDN2 gene leads to impaired ovulation and absence of corpora lutea, which are essential for successful reproduction. This has significant implications for understanding infertility and developing contraceptive methods (Cacioppo2014Loss).

In the cardiovascular system, EDN2 is associated with essential hypertension and contributes to conditions such as glomerulosclerosis in the kidney. It acts as a strong positive inotrope on the human myocardium and may influence cardiac conduction, with specific polymorphisms linked to increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Ling2012Endothelin‐2).

In retinal pathology, EDN2 is involved in the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and damage to Müller cells, contributing to retinal vascular diseases like diabetic retinopathy. This is mediated through interactions with the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system and reactive oxygen species, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for retinal diseases (Alrashdi2018Endothelin2).

ET-2 deficiency in mice also leads to growth retardation, hypothermia, and emphysema, indicating its role in lung development and function, which could have implications for conditions like pulmonary arterial hypertension (Chang2013Endothelin2).
