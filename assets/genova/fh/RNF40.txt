# RNF40

## Overview
RNF40 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 40, a crucial component of cellular processes, particularly in the context of histone modification and transcription regulation. The protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120, a modification essential for transcriptional elongation and chromatin dynamics (Foglizzo2016Structure; Fu2020Epigenetic). RNF40 forms a heterodimer with its paralog RNF20, and this complex is integral to the regulation of gene expression and the DNA damage response (Fu2020Epigenetic; Meng2021Ring). Beyond its nuclear functions, RNF40 is also implicated in lipid metabolism, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular homeostasis (Liu2024LIMA1). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various cancers and inflammatory diseases, underscoring its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Prokakis2023RNF40; Oss-Ronen2022Histone).

## Structure
RNF40, also known as BRE1B, is a protein encoded by the RNF40 gene, consisting of 1001 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 113,678 Da (Fu2020Epigenetic). The protein structure of RNF40 includes four coiled-coil domains and a C-terminal RING finger domain, which are crucial for protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions (Fu2020Epigenetic). The RING domain is a type of zinc finger domain involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and is essential for the protein's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Foglizzo2016Structure).

RNF40 forms a stable heterodimer complex with its paralog RNF20, which is necessary for its role in histone modification, specifically the monoubiquitylation of histone H2B at lysine 120 (Onishi2023Structure; Fu2020Epigenetic). This complex utilizes RAD6 as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and interacts with WAC to facilitate H2Bub1 (Fu2020Epigenetic). The RING domains of RNF40 and RNF20 are highly conserved and play a role in recognizing and modifying histone H2B (Foglizzo2016Structure).

RNF40 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has been confirmed in the brain, where it localizes in cytosolic and membrane-related pools (Fu2020Epigenetic). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair and transcription regulation (Fu2020Epigenetic).

## Function
RNF40, a ring finger protein, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2B-K120). This post-translational modification is essential for various nuclear processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics. The RNF40 protein, in conjunction with RNF20, forms a complex that facilitates this ubiquitination, which is crucial for transcriptional elongation by helping RNA polymerase II overcome nucleosomal barriers (Hahn2011The).

RNF40 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cell cycle progression. It is involved in the regulation of p53 target genes, which are important for the DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The RNF20/RNF40 complex stabilizes p53 protein levels and maintains the expression of its target genes, such as p21 and PUMA, following DNA damage (Meng2021Ring).

In addition to its nuclear functions, RNF40 also plays a role in lipid metabolism by promoting the degradation of LIMA1, a protein involved in cholesterol absorption. This activity suggests a novel mechanism by which RNF40 regulates lipid metabolism, independent of its role in gene transcription (Liu2024LIMA1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RNF40 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, RNF40 plays complex roles, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the subtype. In basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), high RNF40 expression is associated with cancer stem cell properties, poor chemotherapy response, and higher relapse probability, suggesting its role in supporting aggressive cancer behavior (Prokakis2023RNF40). In HER2-positive breast cancer, RNF40 supports tumorigenesis by maintaining actin dynamics and focal adhesion signaling, with high expression correlating with poor outcomes (Wegwitz2020RNF40dependent).

In colorectal cancer, decreased levels of RNF40 and its associated histone modification, H2Bub1, correlate with high cancer grade and poor survival, although RNF40 also appears to play an oncogenic role by controlling apoptotic gene expression (Fu2020Epigenetic). In prostate cancer, RNF40 interacts with the androgen receptor to modulate transcriptional activity, and its depletion retards cancer cell growth (Jääskeläinen2012Histone).

RNF40 is also involved in inflammatory diseases, with its downregulation linked to inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer (Oss-Ronen2022Histone). These findings highlight RNF40's context-dependent roles in cancer and inflammation.

## Interactions
RNF40, as part of the RNF20/RNF40 complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions. It forms a stable heterodimer with RNF20, which is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, particularly in the monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (Foglizzo2016Structure). This complex also interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor protein, playing a crucial role in regulating p53 target genes during the DNA damage response. The interaction with p53 is mediated through the coiled-coil domain of RNF40, and specific mutations in RNF40 can disrupt this interaction (Meng2021Ring).

RNF40 also interacts with eEF1BδL, a heat shock-responsive transcription factor, facilitating its monoubiquitylation at lysine 381. This interaction is crucial for the transcription of heat shock-responsive genes, as it enhances the recruitment of transcription elongation factors to promoter regions (In2019RNF2040mediated). Additionally, RNF40 interacts with CDC73, a tumor suppressor, as part of a complex that maintains histone H2B monoubiquitination, which is vital for chromatin dynamics and gene expression (Hahn2011The). These interactions highlight RNF40's role in transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses.
