# DUSP23

## Overview
DUSP23 is a gene that encodes the protein dual specificity phosphatase 23, which is categorized as a phosphatase due to its role in dephosphorylating target proteins. This protein is particularly significant in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion within epithelial tissues. By modulating the phosphorylation state of β-catenin, a critical component of the E-cadherin adhesion complex, DUSP23 influences the integrity and function of adherens junctions. The dephosphorylation activity of dual specificity phosphatase 23 at specific tyrosine residues of β-catenin is essential for the interaction between α-catenin and β-catenin, thereby maintaining robust cell-cell junctions and facilitating proper cell polarization and coordination during processes such as collective cell migration and wound healing (Gallegos2016A).

## Function
DUSP23, a dual specificity phosphatase, plays a significant role in regulating cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells by modulating the phosphorylation state of β-catenin, a core component of the E-cadherin adhesion complex. DUSP23 promotes the dephosphorylation of β-catenin at Tyr 142, which is crucial for the association between α-catenin and β-catenin, thereby maintaining the integrity of E-cadherin adherens junctions. This interaction is essential for strong cell-cell junctions and proper cell polarization and coordination during collective cell migration (Gallegos2016A).

DUSP23 is localized at cell-cell junctions and selectively regulates cell-cell adhesion, not cell-matrix adhesion, highlighting its specific role in epithelial cell movement and orientation, particularly during processes like wound healing (Gallegos2016A). The knockdown of DUSP23 results in decreased α-catenin co-immunoprecipitation with β-catenin and increased phosphorylation at Tyr 86, indicating reduced binding between these proteins and a decrease in mature cell-cell adhesions (Gallegos2016A). These findings underscore the importance of DUSP23 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues.

## Interactions
DUSP23 is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion. It is identified as a novel phosphatase for β-catenin, a key component of adherens junctions, and promotes the dephosphorylation of β-catenin at Tyr142. This dephosphorylation enhances the interaction between α-catenin and β-catenin, which is essential for the proper functioning of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (Gallegos2016A). DUSP23 localizes at cell-cell junctions and selectively regulates cell-cell adhesion, not cell-matrix adhesion (Gallegos2016A).

The study by Gallegos et al. also highlights interactions between DUSP23 and other proteins within the context of cell-cell adhesion complexes. DUSP23 is linked to the adherens junction complex, along with other tyrosine phosphatases like ACP1 and ACP2. It also interacts with ITGB4 (Integrin beta-4), as validated through immunoprecipitation and western blotting (Gallegos2016A). These interactions suggest that DUSP23 plays a significant role in regulating the structural integrity and strength of cell-cell adhesions by modulating the phosphorylation status of β-catenin and its associated proteins. However, the study primarily focuses on protein-protein interactions rather than interactions with nucleic acids (Gallegos2016A).
