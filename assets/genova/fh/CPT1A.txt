# CPT1A

## Overview
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, a critical component in the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria by converting them into acyl-carnitines. This conversion is essential for the subsequent β-oxidation process, which is a major source of energy production in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle (Schlaepfer2020CPT1Amediated; Liang2023Mitochondrial). The activity of CPT1A is tightly regulated by malonyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor, to maintain a balance between fatty acid synthesis and oxidation (Liang2023Mitochondrial). Mutations in the CPT1A gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in energy homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as diabetes and cancer (Schlaepfer2020CPT1Amediated; Liang2023Mitochondrial).

## Structure
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is an enzyme located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in fatty acid oxidation. The primary structure of CPT1A includes an N-terminal domain with two transmembrane segments and a large C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain, comprising residues 1-147, is essential for mitochondrial targeting and oligomerization, while the C-terminal domain, spanning residues 123-773, is responsible for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Gobin2003Functional; Faye2007Rat).

The secondary structure of the NH2-terminal domain includes an α-helix and four β-strands, modeled based on the structure of Xenopus laevis transcription factor IIIA (LópezViñas2007Definition). The tertiary structure involves interactions between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains, with specific residues like Phe 10 interacting with Glu 729 and Asn 730, contributing to the enzyme's conformation and function (LópezViñas2007Definition).

CPT1A forms a quaternary structure as a homotrimer, which can further assemble into a hexamer, likely a dimer of trimers. This oligomeric state is crucial for its enzymatic activity and regulation by malonyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor (Faye2007Rat). The oligomerization is mediated by the N-terminal domain, particularly the second transmembrane segment (Faye2007Rat).

## Function
CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) is a crucial enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), primarily facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. This process is essential for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle (Schlaepfer2020CPT1Amediated; Liang2023Mitochondrial). CPT1A is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the conversion of long-chain acyl-CoA into acyl-carnitine, allowing these fatty acids to enter the mitochondrial matrix where they are oxidized to produce ATP (Schlaepfer2020CPT1Amediated; Liang2023Mitochondrial).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by malonyl-CoA, which acts as an inhibitor, ensuring a balance between fatty acid synthesis and oxidation (Liang2023Mitochondrial). CPT1A is also involved in maintaining energy homeostasis, especially during fasting or when glucose utilization is impaired, such as in diabetes (Liang2023Mitochondrial). Its proper function is vital for metabolic health, and dysregulation can lead to metabolic disorders and contribute to diseases like cancer (Liang2023Mitochondrial). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and pancreas, highlighting its widespread role in energy metabolism (Schlaepfer2020CPT1Amediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPT1A gene are associated with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This condition is characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and cardiac insufficiency, often triggered by fasting or illness (Gobin2002Organization). Specific mutations, such as p.K455T and p.Y498S, impair protein folding and stability, leading to rapid degradation and metabolic decompensation (Roomets2012Carrier). The p.R595W mutation causes structural changes in the CPT1 protein, resulting in steric hindrance and impaired function, which can lead to severe hypoglycemic episodes and hepatomegaly (Fontaine2012A).

The P479L variant, prevalent in indigenous Arctic populations, affects enzyme activity and is linked to altered fatty acid metabolism. While it may have provided a historical selective advantage, it is associated with increased infant mortality and hypoglycemia during fasting (Skotte2017CPT1A; Koeller2017Health). In some populations, such as the Inuit, this mutation correlates with a lower prevalence of multiple sclerosis, suggesting a protective effect against certain CNS diseases (Mørkholt2019CPT1A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CPT1A mutations in metabolic and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
CPT1A, a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation, participates in several significant protein interactions. It forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member (ACSL) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This complex facilitates the transfer of activated fatty acids into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where CPT1A converts them to acylcarnitines (Lee2011Mitochondrial). 

CPT1A can also exist as homo-oligomeric trimers or hexamers, although its functional unit is the monomeric form (Lee2011Mitochondrial). The oligomerization state of CPT1A is not influenced by fasting or diabetes, indicating that its catalytic activity is independent of its oligomerization state (Lee2011Mitochondrial).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, CPT1A interacts with Rab14, a protein associated with radiation resistance. This interaction is enhanced in radiation-resistant cells and is suggested to facilitate fatty acid trafficking from lipid droplets to mitochondria (Tan2018Targeting).

CPT1A also interacts with Bcl-2, a protein involved in apoptosis resistance. This interaction is crucial for anchoring Bcl-2 in the mitochondria, thereby modulating apoptosis resistance in macrophages (Gu2021Targeting).
