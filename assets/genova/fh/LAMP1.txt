# LAMP1

## Overview
LAMP1, or lysosomal associated membrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a type-1 transmembrane protein predominantly located in the lysosomal membrane. The LAMP1 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining lysosomal integrity and stability, contributing to various cellular processes such as autophagy, phagosome maturation, and lysosomal motility. It is characterized by a heavily glycosylated luminal domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its function and lysosomal targeting (Schwake2013Lysosomal; Eskelinen2006Roles). Despite its abundance, LAMP1 is not essential for survival, as evidenced by viable mice lacking this protein, suggesting compensatory mechanisms through other lysosomal proteins like LAMP2 (Eskelinen2006Roles). LAMP1's interactions with various proteins, such as galectin-3 and transthyretin, underscore its involvement in processes like endocytosis and metastasis, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, particularly cancer (Sarafian1998Expression; CHANG2004Transthyretin).

## Structure
LAMP1 is a glycoprotein primarily located in the lysosomal membrane, characterized by a polypeptide chain with multiple glycosylation sites. The primary structure of human LAMP1 consists of 416 amino acids, including a 27-residue NH2-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved during maturation (Fukuda1988Cloning). The protein is heavily glycosylated, containing 19 potential N-glycosylation sites, although only 18 N-glycans are typically utilized (Fukuda1988Cloning).

The secondary structure of LAMP1 includes a transmembrane domain, which spans the lysosomal membrane, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The tertiary structure features a large luminal domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, forming a β-prism structure similar to other members of the LAMP family (Terasawa2016Lysosomeassociated; Wilke2012Crystal). This domain is stabilized by conserved disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity (Wilke2012Crystal).

LAMP1 can form multimeric complexes, with its N-domain facilitating assembly into SDS-resistant structures (Terasawa2016Lysosomeassociated). The protein's quaternary structure is influenced by its ability to self-oligomerize, which may play a role in its function within the lysosomal membrane (Wilke2012Crystal).

## Function
LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1) is a major component of the lysosomal membrane, constituting about 50% of its protein content. It is a type-1 transmembrane protein with a large luminal domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, which is crucial for lysosomal targeting and function (Schwake2013Lysosomal; Eskelinen2006Roles). LAMP1 plays a significant role in maintaining lysosomal integrity and stability by forming a glycoprotein layer on the luminal side of the lysosomal membrane, which is important for regulating lysosomal fusion with phagosomes, autophagosomes, and the plasma membrane (Schwake2013Lysosomal).

LAMP1 is involved in several cellular processes, including autophagy and phagosome maturation. It facilitates the fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes, a process essential for the degradation of engulfed particles, by recruiting RAB7, a small GTPase necessary for this fusion (Luzio2007Lysosomes:; Huynh2007LAMP). LAMP1 also contributes to lysosomal motility and distribution within the cell, which is crucial for efficient lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis (Huynh2007LAMP). Despite its abundance, LAMP1 is not essential for survival, as mice deficient in LAMP1 are viable, suggesting compensatory mechanisms, possibly through LAMP2 (Eskelinen2006Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LAMP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, LAMP1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. High LAMP1 levels correlate with clinical parameters such as histological grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, making it an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in breast cancer patients (Wang2017LAMP1).

In melanoma, LAMP1 is involved in lung metastasis. Its surface expression on melanoma cells correlates with metastatic potential, and downregulation of LAMP1 reduces metastasis. The protein's interaction with extracellular matrix components and its glycosylation status are crucial for effective metastasis (Agarwal2015Role).

LAMP1 is also overexpressed in high-grade gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme, suggesting a role in tumor progression and cell adhesion (Sarafian2018LAMP‐1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LAMP1 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
LAMP1, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its functional roles. It interacts with amelogenin, a protein involved in enamel formation, through a specific region defined by residues 226-251. This interaction is crucial for receptor-mediated endocytosis in ameloblast cells, which are responsible for enamel biomineralization (Zou2007Determination).

LAMP1 also interacts with galectin-3, a galactoside-binding lectin, in human tumor cells. This interaction may facilitate tumor cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, promoting metastasis. The presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamines on LAMP1 is associated with higher metastatic potential, possibly due to their role in cell adhesion (Sarafian1998Expression).

In the context of lysosomal stability, LAMP1 interacts with the lysosomal polypeptide transporter TAPL. This interaction enhances TAPL's stability by reducing its proteolytic degradation, although it is not necessary for TAPL's lysosomal targeting or transport activity (Demirel2012The).

LAMP1 is also known to interact with transthyretin, a plasma protein, through its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction suggests a potential role in LAMP1 aggregation in circulation (CHANG2004Transthyretin). These interactions highlight LAMP1's involvement in cellular processes such as endocytosis, metastasis, and lysosomal stability.
