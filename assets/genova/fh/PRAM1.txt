# PRAM1

## Overview
PRAM1, or PML-RARA regulated adaptor molecule 1, is a gene that encodes an intracellular adaptor protein involved in critical signaling pathways within granulocytes, particularly neutrophils. The protein, also referred to as PRAM-1, is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal proline-rich region, a central SH2 binding site, and a C-terminal SH3-like domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for the modulation of signaling cascades associated with tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, such as those involving integrins and Fcγ receptors. PRAM-1 is specifically expressed during the terminal maturation stages of granulocytes and plays a pivotal role in integrin-dependent processes, including reactive oxygen species production and degranulation, although it does not affect all integrin-mediated responses. The protein's function is crucial for effective immune responses, as it links cytoskeletal rearrangements to the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex and granule exocytosis, thereby influencing neutrophil effector functions (Clemens2004PRAM1).

## Structure
PRAM-1, also known as PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) regulated adaptor molecule 1, is a 683-amino-acid intracellular adaptor protein with a molecular weight of approximately 97 kDa. The protein is composed of three structural domains: an N-terminal proline-rich region with several putative SH3 recognition motifs, a central SH2 binding site, and a C-terminal SH3-like domain. These domains exhibit structural homology with the hematopoietic-specific adaptor protein ADAP, and PRAM-1 shares several binding partners with ADAP (Clemens2004PRAM1).

The murine PRAM-1 protein is 53% identical and 57% similar to human PRAM-1, with the greatest homology in the carboxy-terminal SH3-like domain, which is 98% identical. Human PRAM-1 contains two tyrosine-based motifs recognized by group I SH2 domains, one of which is conserved in murine PRAM-1, while the other has a single amino acid substitution. The murine PRAM-1 sequence includes a 45-amino-acid region near the carboxy terminus, which is not present in a sequence generated by Riken, suggesting a possible splice variant (Clemens2004PRAM1).

PRAM-1 is involved in signaling pathways linked to tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, including those engaging antigen, immune complexes, and integrin ligands, indicating its importance in granulocyte signaling (Clemens2004PRAM1).

## Function
PRAM1 encodes an intracellular adaptor protein that plays a significant role in neutrophil function, particularly in integrin-dependent processes. Neutrophils are crucial components of the immune system, responsible for responding to infections by migrating to infection sites, phagocytosing pathogens, producing reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), and releasing cytotoxic granules (Clemens2004PRAM1). PRAM1 is specifically expressed in granulocytes at terminal maturation stages and is structurally similar to the hematopoietic-specific adaptor ADAP, sharing several binding partners such as SKAP55-hom and SLP-76 (Clemens2004PRAM1).

In neutrophils, PRAM1 is involved in signaling pathways linked to tyrosine kinase-associated receptors and is crucial for specific integrin functions, particularly in adhesion-dependent effector functions like ROI production and degranulation (Clemens2004PRAM1). While PRAM1-deficient neutrophils show defects in these integrin-mediated responses, other integrin-dependent responses such as cell spreading remain unaffected, indicating that PRAM1 selectively influences certain signaling pathways (Clemens2004PRAM1). The protein is hypothesized to be involved in a signaling pathway downstream of cytoskeletal rearrangements, linking actin remodeling to the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex and granule exocytosis (Clemens2004PRAM1).

## Interactions
PRAM1, also known as PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR␣) regulated adaptor molecule 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neutrophil function. It constitutively associates with SKAP55-hom and can inducibly bind to SLP-76 and the Src family kinase lyn, suggesting its involvement in signaling pathways linked to tyrosine kinase-associated receptors (Clemens2004PRAM1). These interactions are important for the modulation of signaling cascades involving receptors such as Fcγ receptors and integrins (Clemens2004PRAM1).

PRAM1 contains structural domains that facilitate these interactions, including an N-terminal proline-rich region with SH3 recognition motifs, a central SH2 binding site, and a C-terminal SH3-like domain. These domains are similar to those found in the hematopoietic-specific adaptor ADAP, with which PRAM1 shares several binding partners (Clemens2004PRAM1). The protein's interactions are implicated in specific integrin-mediated responses, such as reactive oxygen species production and degranulation, although other integrin-dependent responses like cell spreading remain unaffected in PRAM1-deficient models (Clemens2004PRAM1). These findings highlight PRAM1's role in specific signaling pathways that are essential for optimal integrin-dependent neutrophil function.
