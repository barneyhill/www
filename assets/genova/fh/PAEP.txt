# PAEP

## Overview
The PAEP gene encodes the progestagen-associated endometrial protein, commonly referred to as glycodelin, which is a glycoprotein belonging to the lipocalin family. Glycodelin is characterized by its complex glycosylation patterns, which are crucial for its diverse biological functions, including roles in reproductive processes and immune modulation. This protein is predominantly expressed in the endometrium and is involved in key reproductive events such as sperm-oocyte binding and maternal-fetal immune tolerance. Glycodelin exists in multiple isoforms, each with distinct glycosylation profiles that influence its interaction with immune cells and reproductive tissues. The regulation of glycodelin is hormonally controlled, with significant implications for pregnancy and potential therapeutic targets in conditions like recurrent pregnancy loss and certain cancers (Ren2015Human; PearsonFarr2021PAEP; Yang2024Significance).

## Structure
The PAEP gene encodes the progestagen-associated endometrial protein, also known as glycodelin, which is a glycoprotein belonging to the lipocalin family. This protein is characterized by its glycosylation, a post-translational modification that significantly influences its function and stability. Glycodelin is glycosylated at specific asparagine residues, notably Asn-28 and Asn-63. The Asn-28 site carries high mannose, hybrid, and complex-type structures, while the Asn-63 site is exclusively occupied by complex-type glycans. These glycans include structures such as lacNAc, lacdiNAc, and their sialylated forms, which are rare in mammalian glycoproteins (Dell1995Structural).

Glycodelin exists in multiple isoforms, which differ in their glycosylation patterns. These isoforms share an identical protein skeleton but have variations in their carbohydrate structures, affecting their biological functions. For instance, the presence or absence of sialic acid in different isoforms influences their interaction with T cells (Ren2015Human). The glycosylation patterns of glycodelin are crucial for its immunosuppressive and contraceptive activities, potentially by inhibiting selectin-mediated adhesions and modulating immune responses (Dell1995Structural). The precise tertiary and quaternary structures of PAEP are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The PAEP gene encodes glycodelin, a glycoprotein involved in various reproductive processes and immune modulation. In healthy human cells, glycodelin plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system, particularly in the endometrium, where it influences processes such as capacitation, acrosome reaction, and sperm-oocyte binding. It is also involved in immune system suppression during the establishment of pregnancy, contributing to maternal-fetal tolerance by modulating the activity of cytotoxic uterine natural killer cells (PearsonFarr2021PAEP; Weber2018Pathways).

Glycodelin is a member of the lipocalin family and has four isoforms (A, S, F, and C), each differing in glycosylation patterns, which affect their biological functions. These isoforms are regulated by hormones such as progesterone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and relaxin, which can increase glycodelin synthesis (Weber2018Pathways). The protein is active in the endometrium, where it plays a regulatory role in maternal immune tolerance and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical embryo implantation (Ren2015Human). Glycodelin's immunosuppressive properties are essential for creating a suitable uterine environment for embryo implantation and successful pregnancy outcomes (PearsonFarr2022Endometrial).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and splicing of the PAEP gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), the PAEP gene is upregulated and exhibits differential splicing, producing novel transcripts through cryptic splice sites. This dysregulation suggests that PAEP may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in RPL, as it plays a role in modulating cytotoxic uterine natural killer cells, which can adversely affect pregnancy (PearsonFarr2022Endometrial; PearsonFarr2021PAEP).

In the context of cancer, PAEP is overexpressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and is associated with shorter survival rates. High PAEP expression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. Silencing PAEP in ccRCC cells reduces cell viability and tumor progression, indicating its role as an oncogene (Yang2024Significance). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PAEP, also known as glycodelin, is regulated by various signaling pathways and is suggested to help tumors evade immune surveillance. Its expression is influenced by the tumor microenvironment and specific signaling cascades, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (Weber2018Pathways).

## Interactions
PAEP, also known as glycodelin, is a glycoprotein that participates in various interactions influencing immune modulation and reproductive processes. It is known to interact with human monocytes, where it binds to a specific receptor on CD14+ monocytes, but not on CD20+ B cells or CD3+ T cells. This interaction is pH- and temperature-sensitive and can be reduced by proteolytic pre-digestion, indicating a specific binding mechanism (Miller1998A).

Glycodelin also exhibits immunosuppressive properties by directly inhibiting T-cell activation and proliferation. It affects early T-cell receptor signaling pathways, reducing IL-2 secretion, which is crucial for T-cell proliferation (Rachmilewitz1999Placental). This direct inhibition occurs without the need for accessory cells, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Rachmilewitz1999Placental).

In reproductive contexts, glycodelin interacts with spermatozoa, impacting processes such as sperm-oocyte binding and capacitation. Different isoforms of glycodelin, such as glycodelin-A and glycodelin-F, have varying effects on sperm function, including inhibiting sperm binding to the zona pellucida and preventing premature acrosome reactions (Seppälä2007Glycosylation). These interactions are crucial for successful fertilization and are influenced by the glycosylation patterns of glycodelin (Seppälä2007Glycosylation).
