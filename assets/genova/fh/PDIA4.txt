# PDIA4

## Overview
PDIA4, or protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional enzyme belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family. The protein product of PDIA4 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a critical role in catalyzing the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, which are essential for proper protein folding and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Turano2002Proteins; Galligan2012The). As a member of the PDI family, PDIA4 is characterized by its thioredoxin-like domains, which facilitate redox reactions and possess chaperone and isomerase activities (Turano2002Proteins). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response and calcium regulation, and is implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and treatment resistance (Tufo2014The; Galligan2012The).

## Structure
PDIA4, also known as protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4, is a large enzyme consisting of 645 amino acids and is part of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) superfamily. The protein is characterized by a multi-domain structure that includes five thioredoxin (TRX)-like domains, three of which contain the classical Cys-Gly-His-Cys (CGHC) active site motifs essential for its catalytic activity (Tu2023Protein; Karatas2021Hepatocyte). These domains facilitate the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, crucial for protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Komatsu2020Effect).

The structure of PDIA4 includes both catalytic and non-catalytic domains. The catalytic domains are arranged in a specific order, with each containing a WCGHCK sequence in the active site, a variant of the CXXC motif (Komatsu2020Effect). The N-terminus of PDIA4 is rich in acidic amino acids, which may play a role in its interaction with other proteins, such as cyclophilin B (Komatsu2020Effect).

PDIA4 is part of a multiprotein chaperone complex and shares approximately 40% sequence identity with PDIA3/Erp57, indicating structural similarities within the PDI family (Karatas2021Hepatocyte). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the redox state of proteins and cellular secretion (Tu2023Protein).

## Function
PDIA4, also known as protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in proteins, which is essential for proper protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Galligan2012The). This protein is part of the larger protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (Turano2002Proteins).

PDIA4 is characterized by a multidomain structure with thioredoxin-like active sites, which are involved in redox reactions. It has higher redox potentials than thioredoxin and possesses additional chaperone and isomerase activities due to domains without active sites (Turano2002Proteins). The protein contains five thioredoxin domains, three of which have active sites composed of Cys-Gly-His-Cys, and it has an ER retention sequence (Galligan2012The).

PDIA4 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, although less abundantly than other PDI family members, and is involved in the unfolded protein response, which is crucial for cellular stress management (Galligan2012The). It is also implicated in calcium regulation, earning it the rat homolog name calcium-binding protein-2 (CaBP2) (Galligan2012The).

## Clinical Significance
PDIA4 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In cervical cancer, PDIA4 is overexpressed, promoting malignant behavior by enhancing cell proliferation and migration. Its high expression correlates with worse overall and relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Xing2022High). Silencing PDIA4 in cervical cancer cell lines reduces the expression of proliferation-related molecules like cyclin D1 and PCNA, and migration-related molecules like Vimentin, while increasing E-cadherin expression, which is associated with reduced malignancy (Xing2022High).

In lung adenocarcinoma, PDIA4 contributes to resistance against cisplatin-induced cell death. Its overexpression in resistant cancer cells is linked to the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, aiding in chemoresistance. Inhibition of PDIA4 can restore sensitivity to cisplatin, indicating its role in cancer cell survival and resistance mechanisms (Tufo2014The). PDIA4's involvement in the unfolded protein response and redox regulation further supports its role in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy (Powell2021Protein). These findings suggest that targeting PDIA4 could be a potential therapeutic strategy in treating certain cancers.

## Interactions
PDIA4, also known as protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4, is involved in various protein interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is a part of a chaperone complex that includes proteins such as Hsp70, BiP, Grp94, and ERp29, which are crucial for protein folding and quality control (Karatas2021Hepatocyte). PDIA4 interacts specifically with the Z variant of alpha 1-antitrypsin (Z-AAT), playing a role in its ER retention and misfolding, which is significant in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) (Karatas2021Hepatocyte).

In glioblastoma cells, PDIA4 interacts with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), regulating its secretion and thereby influencing angiogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the migratory and tube formation capacities of endothelial cells, which are indicative of angiogenesis (Tu2023Protein). PDIA4 also interacts with procaspases 3 and 7, inhibiting their activation and thus preventing apoptosis in cancer cells. This interaction is dependent on the CGHC motifs of PDIA4, which are essential for its function in tumor growth and metastasis (Kuo2017Protein).

In renal cell carcinoma, PDIA4 interacts with the PERK/ATF4 signaling pathway and its downstream target SLC7A11, which are involved in ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death (Kang2023PDIA4). These interactions highlight PDIA4's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in different diseases.
