# ZNF599

## Overview
ZNF599 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 599, which is a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) subfamily. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF599, play crucial roles in various cellular processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, and gene expression regulation. The ZNF599 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.11, a region associated with microdeletion syndromes that can lead to developmental and intellectual disabilities (Gana201219q13.11). Despite its potential involvement in these conditions, the specific biological functions and mechanisms of action of zinc finger protein 599 remain to be fully understood (Chowdhury2013Phenotypic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF599 is implicated in the 19q13.11 microdeletion syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, growth retardation, speech disturbances, microcephaly, and other physical anomalies (Chowdhury2013Phenotypic). The smallest region of overlap for this syndrome includes ZNF599 among other genes, suggesting its potential contribution to the clinical features observed in affected individuals (Gana201219q13.11). Although the specific role of ZNF599 in human diseases is not clearly established, it is part of the KRAB-ZNF subfamily, which is involved in various cellular processes such as embryonic development and cell differentiation (Gana201219q13.11).

The involvement of ZNF599 in neurodevelopmental disorders is suggested by its inclusion in studies identifying critical exon genes within pathogenic copy number variations in patients with such disorders (Akter2023Construction). However, the clinical significance or specific conditions related to ZNF599 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the available literature (Akter2023Construction). Overall, while ZNF599 is associated with certain syndromes and disorders, its precise role and the mechanisms by which it contributes to these conditions remain to be fully elucidated.
