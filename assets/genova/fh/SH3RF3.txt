# SH3RF3

## Overview
SH3RF3 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain containing ring finger 3 protein, which functions as a scaffold protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its multiple SH3 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a RING finger domain that may confer ubiquitin ligase activity. SH3RF3 plays a crucial role in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by interacting with components such as JNK1, JNK2, and MAP kinase kinases MKK4 and MKK7, thereby influencing stress responses and apoptosis. Additionally, SH3RF3 is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and tau phosphorylation, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease, and is associated with cancer stem cell properties in breast cancer. These functions underscore its significance in maintaining cellular signaling networks and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases (Mehrabipour2023A; Zhang2020SH3RF3; Patel2024Reduced).

## Function
SH3RF3, also known as SH3 domain containing ring finger 3, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It contains multiple SH3 domains, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions, allowing SH3RF3 to interact with a variety of partner proteins and modulate multiple signaling pathways. Specifically, SH3RF3's fourth SH3 domain interacts with MKK7, while its first and second SH3 domains interact with JIP3 and JNK1. These interactions facilitate the assembly of the MKK-JNK complex via JIP, leading to the activation of the JNK-JUN signaling pathway, which is involved in stress responses and apoptosis (Mehrabipour2023A).

In healthy human cells, SH3RF3 is involved in regulating inflammatory responses and tau phosphorylation, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Knockdown of SH3RF3 in human neurons reduces JNK-specific tau phosphorylation, which is associated with tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. In microglial-like cells, SH3RF3 knockdown decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by modulating the JNK and NF-kB signaling pathways, indicating its role in regulating inflammatory responses (Patel2024Reduced). These functions highlight SH3RF3's importance in maintaining cellular signaling networks and potentially stabilizing protein complexes.

## Clinical Significance
The SH3RF3 gene is clinically significant in the context of breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In breast cancer, SH3RF3 is implicated in the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Overexpression of SH3RF3 enhances the expression of PTX3 through the JNK-JUN pathway, promoting CSC features such as increased tumorsphere formation and a higher CD44+CD24- cell population. This overexpression is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis and lower survival rates in breast cancer patients, indicating a poor prognosis (Zhang2020SH3RF3).

In Alzheimer's disease, SH3RF3 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses in microglial cells. A reduction in SH3RF3 expression is associated with decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially offering protection against Alzheimer's by lowering microglial pro-inflammatory responses. This modulation occurs through the JNK and NFkB signaling pathways, which are critical in the inflammatory response. The gene's role in these pathways suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation and delaying Alzheimer's disease onset (Patel2024Reduced).

## Interactions
SH3RF3, also known as SH3 domain containing ring finger 3, is a scaffold protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its SH3 domains. It interacts with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway components, including JNK1 and JNK2, and the MAP kinase kinases MKK4 and MKK7, which are crucial for JNK activation. These interactions are facilitated by the SH3 domains of SH3RF3, which mediate the assembly of the MKK-JNK complex in a JIP-dependent manner (Mehrabipour2023A; Zhang2020SH3RF3).

SH3RF3 also interacts with JIP3, a JNK-interacting protein that acts as a scaffold for the JNK signaling complex. The interaction between SH3RF3 and JNK is dependent on JIP3, as JIP3 knockdown impairs SH3RF3's ability to bind to JNK proteins and promote JUN phosphorylation (Zhang2020SH3RF3). The fourth SH3 domain of SH3RF3 interacts with MKK7, while the first and second SH3 domains interact with JIP3 and JNK1 (Mehrabipour2023A).

In addition to its role in the JNK pathway, SH3RF3 interacts with PAK2 and RAC1 through its SH3 domains, and its RING finger domain may confer self-ubiquitinating enzymatic activity (Zhang2020SH3RF3). These interactions suggest that SH3RF3 is involved in modulating multiple signaling pathways simultaneously.
