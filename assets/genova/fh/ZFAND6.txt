# ZFAND6

## Overview
ZFAND6 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger AN1-type containing 6 protein, which plays a critical role in cellular processes such as mitophagy, a form of autophagy responsible for the degradation of damaged mitochondria. The protein is characterized by the presence of A20-like and AN1 zinc finger domains, which facilitate its function as an adaptor protein within the TRAF2-cIAP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is essential for the initiation of ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy, thereby maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (Shaikh2024ZFAND6). ZFAND6's involvement in immune responses and its potential implications in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and viral infections underscore its clinical significance (Binjawhar2023Genetic; Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

## Structure


## Function
ZFAND6 is a gene encoding a protein that functions as a subunit of the TRAF2-cIAP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is essential for mitophagy, a process crucial for the clearance of damaged mitochondria through lysosomal degradation. In healthy human cells, ZFAND6 acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions between cIAP1 and TRAF2, which are necessary for initiating ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy. This process is vital for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

The protein contains A20-like and AN1 zinc finger domains, which are implicated in binding polyubiquitin chains, and is suggested to function as an adaptor protein, potentially binding to ubiquitinated TRAF2 and/or cIAP1, or to ubiquitinated proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, recruiting the TRAF2/cIAP complex (Shaikh2024ZFAND6). ZFAND6's role in mitophagy is linked to preventing the leakage of mitochondrial DNA, which can activate the cGAS-STING pathway and other immune responses (Shaikh2024ZFAND6). The absence of ZFAND6 leads to impaired mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, increased ROS, and the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZFAND6 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. The gene is associated with the regulation of mitophagy, and its loss leads to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and defects in mitochondrial morphology. This impairment can activate the cGAS-STING pathway, potentially rendering cells resistant to certain viral infections, but also increasing susceptibility to low doses of influenza A virus due to impaired type I interferon responses (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

ZFAND6 has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZFAND6, such as rs11634397, which are associated with prediabetes and inflammatory markers in specific populations. The heterozygous GA genotype of this SNP is associated with a decreased risk of prediabetes, suggesting a protective role against insulin resistance (Binjawhar2023Genetic).

The gene's role in immune responses is significant, as it is required for cIAP1-mediated TRAF2 degradation, essential for macrophage activation and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Alterations in ZFAND6 expression or function can significantly impact immune responses and viral susceptibility, highlighting its potential clinical significance in immune regulation and viral infections (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

## Interactions
ZFAND6 is a subunit of the TRAF2-cIAP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in mitophagy. It is essential for the interaction between TRAF2 and cIAP1, which is necessary for the initiation of ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy. ZFAND6 facilitates the interaction between TRAF2 and cIAP1 upon mitochondrial damage, acting as an adaptor or subunit in the complex. This interaction is impaired in Zfand6 knockout cells, leading to decreased mitophagosomes and impaired degradation of mitochondrial proteins (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

ZFAND6 contains an A20-like zinc finger domain and an AN1 zinc finger domain, which are involved in binding polyubiquitin chains. Mutations in the A20-like zinc finger domain affect ZFAND6's ability to bind ubiquitin, indicating its role in ubiquitin binding (Shaikh2024ZFAND6). ZFAND6 may bind to ubiquitinated TRAF2 and/or cIAP1, or to ubiquitinated proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, recruiting the TRAF2/cIAP complex (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).

ZFAND6 has also been implicated in regulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-ÎºB signaling and mitigating reactive oxygen species generation in breast cancer cells (Shaikh2024ZFAND6).
