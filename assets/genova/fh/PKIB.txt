# PKIB

## Overview
PKIB, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor beta, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the protein kinase inhibitor family. This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), a critical enzyme involved in numerous cellular processes, including metabolism, cell division, and gene expression. PKIB contains a pseudosubstrate motif that allows it to interact with the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C), albeit with weaker inhibitory activity compared to other family members such as PKIA (Chung2009Overexpressing). The protein encoded by PKIB is involved in the regulation of PKA activity by facilitating the transport of PKA-C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Dou2016PKIB). PKIB's interaction with PKA-C is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where its overexpression has been associated with increased aggressiveness, notably in prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (Chung2009Overexpressing; Dou2016PKIB).

## Function
PKIB (cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor beta) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme involved in various cellular processes such as metabolism, cell division, and gene expression. PKIB is part of the protein kinase inhibitor family and contains a pseudosubstrate motif that allows it to interact with the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C), although its inhibitory activity is weaker compared to other family members like PKIA (Chung2009Overexpressing). 

In healthy human cells, PKIB modulates PKA activity by binding to the catalytic subunits of PKA in the nucleus and facilitating their transport to the cytoplasm. This process helps reform the inactive PKA complex with the regulatory subunits, thereby controlling PKA's activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Dou2016PKIB). PKIB's regulatory mechanism is essential for controlling the activity of PKA, which is involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, cell division, and gene expression (Dou2016PKIB). 

PKIB's function is linked to the modification of PKA-C kinase activity, which can occur both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Chung2009Overexpressing).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PKIB (cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor beta) is known to interact with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C), inhibiting its activity. This interaction is significant in the context of prostate cancer, where PKIB overexpression has been linked to increased cancer aggressiveness. PKIB facilitates the nuclear import or inhibits the nuclear export of PKA-C, unlike PKIA, which is known for exporting PKA-C from the nucleus. This interaction affects the subcellular localization of PKA-C, reducing its presence in the nucleus when PKIB is knocked down (Chung2009Overexpressing).

PKIB also plays a role in enhancing Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, potentially by modifying PKA-C kinase activity. This suggests that PKIB may act as a PDK2, facilitating PKA-C's ability to phosphorylate Akt-Ser473. The precise mechanism by which PKIB enhances PKA-C's kinase activity is not fully understood, but it is suggested that PKIB might alter PKA-C's conformation to increase its affinity for Akt (Chung2009Overexpressing).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PKIB is implicated in promoting cell proliferation and invasion through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, indicating its interaction with components of this signaling pathway (Dou2016PKIB).
