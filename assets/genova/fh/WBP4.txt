# WBP4

## Overview
WBP4, or WW domain binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a spliceosome-associated protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. The protein product of WBP4 is characterized by the presence of a zinc finger motif and two tandem WW domains, which are integral to its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions within the spliceosomal complex. As a spliceosome protein, WBP4 is crucial for the early stages of spliceosome assembly, particularly in the Spliceosome B complex, where it influences splice site selection and the transition to the catalytically active spliceosome. The protein is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with elevated levels in skeletal and heart muscles, and is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to mRNA maturation and regulation of gene expression. WBP4's interactions extend beyond the spliceosome, as it also modulates the activity and localization of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), impacting cellular processes related to vitamin D signaling (Engal2023Biallelic; Rovito2020Cytosolic).

## Structure
The WBP4 protein is a spliceosome component involved in early spliceosomal complex formation. It is composed of 376 amino acids and features a zinc finger motif and two tandem WW domains, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins such as SF3B4, SIPP1, and SmB/B' (Engal2023Biallelic). These WW domains are small protein modules that facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in the splicing machinery (Engal2023Biallelic).

The primary structure of WBP4 is defined by its amino acid sequence, which includes the zinc finger motif and WW domains. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with WW domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would involve the 3D folding of these motifs, contributing to its functional conformation. The quaternary structure is not detailed in the available context.

WBP4 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which can result in different functional forms, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context (Engal2023Biallelic).

## Function
WBP4 (WW domain binding protein 4) is a spliceosome protein that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. It is involved in the early stages of spliceosome assembly, specifically within the Spliceosome B complex, where it acts before the catalytic activation of the spliceosome (Engal2023Biallelic). WBP4 contains a zinc finger motif and two tandem-WW domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins such as SF3B4, SIPP1, and SmB/B' (Engal2023Biallelic). These interactions are essential for splice site selection, as WBP4 regulates the transition from the B to the Bact complex by unwinding the U4/U6 duplex, releasing U4 snRNP, and enabling U6 snRNA to base-pair with U2 snRNA, forming a catalytically important stem-loop (Engal2023Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, WBP4 is expressed in all tissues, with higher levels in skeletal and heart muscles (Engal2023Biallelic). It enhances splicing both in vitro and in vivo and regulates alternative splicing, contributing to normal splicing and gene expression regulation (Engal2023Biallelic). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to mRNA maturation, affecting cellular processes like growth and differentiation (Xu2002WAC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WBP4 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in WBP4 are associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by phenotypes such as hypotonia, global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, brain abnormalities, and musculoskeletal defects. This syndrome shares similarities with conditions caused by mutations in the RNU4-2 gene, suggesting a potential overlap in the underlying mechanisms, particularly involving spliceosome dysfunction (Greene2024Mutations).

In the context of cancer, WBP4 has been identified as a significant biomarker for predicting biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer. It is part of a 13 RNA-binding protein signature used to stratify patients into risk categories for cancer progression. This suggests that alterations in WBP4 expression or function may influence cancer prognosis and could be utilized in clinical settings to guide treatment strategies (Xing2021A).

Additionally, WBP4 interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and this interaction can be modulated by certain compounds, potentially affecting conditions like vitamin D-induced hypercalcemia. However, the direct clinical significance of WBP4 mutations in this context remains to be fully elucidated (Rovito2020Cytosolic).

## Interactions
WBP4 (WW Domain Binding Protein 4) is a spliceosome protein that plays a significant role in RNA splicing by interacting with various proteins. It is involved in the early spliceosomal complex and interacts with the U2-associated protein SF3B4, SIPP1, and the core splicing protein SmB/B'. These interactions are facilitated by the transient multivalent recognition of the WW domains with proline-rich sequences (Engal2023Biallelic). WBP4 is exclusively present in the Spliceosome B complex, where it binds and inhibits SNRNP200, similar to C9ORF78 and TSSC4, playing a crucial role in splice site selection (Engal2023Biallelic).

WBP4 also interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), particularly in the presence of the compound ZK, which enhances this interaction in the cytosol. This interaction affects the intracellular localization of VDR, promoting its sequestration in the cytosol and reducing its nuclear localization (Rovito2020Cytosolic). Silencing WBP4 results in a predominantly nuclear localization of VDR and increased expression of VDR target genes (Rovito2020Cytosolic). These interactions highlight WBP4's role in modulating VDR activity and localization, impacting cellular processes related to vitamin D signaling.
