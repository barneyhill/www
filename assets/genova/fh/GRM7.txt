# GRM7

## Overview
The GRM7 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7), a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system by modulating neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. As a receptor, mGluR7 is primarily located in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it regulates the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, thereby influencing synaptic strength and neuronal excitability (Fisher2018Metabotropic; Liu2015Rare). The receptor's structure is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain, a large N-terminal ligand-binding domain, and several splice variants, which contribute to its diverse functional roles (Fisher2018Metabotropic). mGluR7 is involved in critical processes such as long-term potentiation and depression, which are essential for learning and memory, and it also modulates N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor activity, impacting cognitive and emotional processes (Gu2012Regulation). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2015Rare; Liang2020Variants).

## Structure
The GRM7 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7), a G-protein coupled receptor involved in neurotransmission. The primary structure of mGluR7 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor, which is composed of 11 exons and spans 832.6 kb of genomic DNA (Liu2015Rare; WU2002Genomic). The secondary structure features a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, which is crucial for its function in signal transduction (Liu2015Rare). 

The tertiary structure of mGluR7 includes a large N-terminal ligand-binding domain known as the Venus flytrap domain (VFD), a cysteine-rich domain, and a heptahelical domain (Fisher2018Metabotropic). The VFD is responsible for binding glutamate, the endogenous ligand, and is involved in dimerization, which is a key aspect of the receptor's quaternary structure (Fisher2018Metabotropic). 

mGluR7 has several splice variants, with mGluR7a and mGluR7b being the major isoforms. These isoforms differ at their C-termini, which may mediate different protein-protein interactions (Fisher2018Metabotropic). The receptor is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Liu2015Rare).

## Function
The GRM7 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7), a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in modulating neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. mGlu7 is predominantly expressed in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it regulates the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, thereby influencing synaptic strength and neuronal excitability (Fisher2018Metabotropic; Liu2015Rare).

mGlu7 is involved in key molecular processes, including the inhibition of neurotransmitter release through interactions with calcium channels and proteins like G βγ, PKC, and PICK1. This receptor acts as a 'metaplastic switch' that can influence the direction of synaptic plasticity, playing a significant role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are essential for learning and memory (Fisher2018Metabotropic).

In addition to its role in synaptic transmission, mGlu7 modulates the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in the prefrontal cortex, affecting cognitive and emotional processes. This modulation involves actin-dependent mechanisms that influence NMDAR trafficking and function, highlighting mGlu7's importance in maintaining synaptic function and plasticity (Gu2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRM7 gene, which encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7), have been implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. A rare de novo deletion affecting five coding exons of GRM7 has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and hyperactivity, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of mGluR7 contributes to these conditions (Liu2015Rare). The I154T mutation in GRM7 is linked to developmental delay and neurological phenotypes, leading to reduced receptor dimerization and impaired cell surface trafficking (Fisher2021A). 

In a large consanguineous family, a homozygous variant c.1411G>A (p.Gly471Arg) in GRM7 was associated with developmental epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by severe developmental impairments and seizures (Jdila2021A). GRM7 has also been implicated in schizophrenia, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of developing the disorder and influencing the response to antipsychotic therapy (Liang2020Variants). 

Additionally, GRM7 mutations and expression changes have been linked to mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, with mGluR7 modulation affecting anxiety and depression-like behaviors (Fisher2018Metabotropic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GRM7 in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
GRM7, or metabotropic glutamate receptor 7, interacts with several proteins that modulate its function and localization. One key interaction is with PICK1, a PDZ domain-containing protein. PICK1 binds to the C-terminal LVI sequence of GRM7, which is crucial for the receptor's ability to inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, thereby influencing synaptic transmission (Perroy2002PICK1). This interaction is essential for the receptor's functional coupling to Ca2+ channels, although it is not required for cell surface trafficking (Perroy2002PICK1).

Phosphorylation of GRM7 at serine 862 (S862) by protein kinase C (PKC) enhances its surface expression and modulates its interactions with other proteins. This phosphorylation increases binding to PICK1 while reducing binding to calmodulin (CaM), indicating a competitive relationship between PICK1 and CaM for GRM7 binding (Suh2008Corequirement). CaM binds to a specific region in the C-terminus of GRM7, preventing PKC-mediated phosphorylation and displacing Gβγ subunits, which are involved in neurotransmitter release regulation (Enz2012Metabotropic).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving GRM7, which are crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.
