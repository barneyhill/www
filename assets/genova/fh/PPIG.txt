# PPIG

## Overview
PPIG, or peptidylprolyl isomerase G, is a gene that encodes a cyclophilin protein involved in the catalysis of cis-trans isomerization of proline residues, a critical process for protein folding. The protein encoded by PPIG is characterized by a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain and an SR/RS repeat region, which are essential for its function in pre-mRNA splicing within the nucleus (Szlavicz2017Splicing; Rajiv2018Structural). As a component of the spliceosome, PPIG interacts with various spliceosomal proteins and is implicated in the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, and stress responses (Szlavicz2017Splicing; Rajiv2018Structural). Additionally, PPIG's expression levels have been associated with disease states, such as psoriasis, highlighting its potential role in inflammatory and proliferative processes (Szlavicz2017Splicing).

## Structure
PPIG, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase G, is a multidomain cyclophilin gene encoding a protein with a distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of PPIG consists of 754 amino acids, featuring a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPI) domain from amino acids 11 to 176 and an SR/RS repeat region from 540 to 639 (Rajiv2018Structural). The isomerase domain has been structurally characterized, showing a high degree of similarity in both its apo form and when bound to the pan-inhibitor cyclosporine (Rajiv2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of PPIG includes a central closed barrel type beta fold, typical of cyclophilins, with ordered loops and small helices (Rajiv2018Structural). The isomerase domain interacts with spliceosomal proteins such as SNW1, CWC15, and PRPF8, indicating its role in the spliceosome (Rajiv2018Structural). However, the approximately 600 residues outside the isomerase domain remain unmodeled, leaving a significant portion of the protein's structure uncharacterized (Rajiv2018Structural).

PPIG is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions within the spliceosome (Mesa2008Spliceosomal). The presence of splice variant isoforms suggests potential variations in its function and localization (Davis2010Structural).

## Function
PPIG (peptidylprolyl isomerase G) encodes a cyclophilin protein that plays a crucial role in protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. This enzymatic activity is essential for the proper folding and function of proteins within the cell. PPIG is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression where introns are removed, and exons are joined to form mature mRNA. This function is particularly important in the regulation of gene expression and the production of diverse protein isoforms (Szlavicz2017Splicing).

PPIG is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the splicing of pre-mRNA and potentially influences other nuclear processes. Its role in splicing is linked to the regulation of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and stress responses, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Szlavicz2017Splicing). In the context of psoriasis, PPIG expression is decreased in non-involved psoriatic epidermis compared to healthy controls, suggesting its involvement in disease-related pathways (Szlavicz2017Splicing). This indicates that PPIG may have broader implications in inflammatory and proliferative processes associated with certain diseases.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PPIG, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase G, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the spliceosome. It interacts with the Clk kinase, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing, by phosphorylating RS splicing factors (Thapar2015Roles). PPIG also directly interacts with the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II via its RS domains, suggesting a role in transcription elongation and splicing (Mesa2008Spliceosomal; Thapar2015Roles).

Within the spliceosome, PPIG interacts with several proteins, including SNW1, CWC15, and PRPF8, through its isomerase domain. These interactions are significant for its function in the spliceosomal C complex (Rajiv2018Structural). Despite its limited abundance in the spliceosome, PPIG has been modeled into the C complex structure, where it interacts with SNW1 in the α2-β8 loop region and with CWC15 and PRPF8 in other regions (Rajiv2018Structural).

PPIG's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in more transient interactions that influence splicing efficiency. It has been shown to inhibit mRNA production and splicing of certain substrates, indicating a regulatory role in spliceosome assembly and function (Adams2015Nuclear).
