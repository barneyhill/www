# CEP55

## Overview
CEP55 is a gene located on chromosome 10q23.33 that encodes the centrosomal protein 55, a crucial component involved in the process of cytokinesis. The protein, characterized by its 55 kDa molecular weight, contains coiled-coil domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, essential for its function in cell division (Kumar2013CEP; Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2). Centrosomal protein 55 plays a pivotal role in maintaining midbody integrity and facilitating cell abscission by recruiting the ESCRT-III complex during the final stages of cell division (Zhao2006Cep55; Tedeschi2020Cep55). The protein's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which is necessary for its proper localization and interaction with other proteins such as Plk1 (Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2). Mutations in the CEP55 gene are linked to severe congenital disorders and its overexpression is associated with cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Fan2022The; Rashidieh2021Cep55).

## Structure
CEP55 is a centrosomal protein composed of 464 amino acids, encoded by a gene located on chromosome 10q23.33. The protein has a molecular weight of 55 kDa and contains three central coiled-coil domains spanning residues 57-355, which are common motifs in centrosome proteins and facilitate protein-protein interactions through homo- and heterodimerization (Kumar2013CEP; Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2). The C-terminal region, specifically residues 355-464, is crucial for its localization to the centrosome and midbody, independent of microtubules (Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2).

CEP55 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine residues S425, S428, and S436, which are essential for its function during mitosis and cytokinesis. These modifications regulate its dissociation from the centrosome and interaction with other proteins like Plk1 (Kumar2013CEP; Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2). The protein's quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form homodimers, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (MartinezGaray2006The). CEP55 also interacts with proteins such as MKLP1 and ALIX, which are involved in cytokinesis (Zhao2006Cep55; Kumar2013CEP).

## Function
CEP55, a centrosomal protein, plays a critical role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. It is primarily involved in maintaining midbody integrity and facilitating cell abscission, the process that physically separates daughter cells. During cell division, CEP55 localizes to the midbody, a structure formed between dividing cells, where it recruits the ESCRT-III complex, essential for membrane fission (Zhao2006Cep55; Tedeschi2020Cep55).

CEP55 interacts with the centralspindlin complex, which includes MKLP1 and MgcRacGAP, to ensure proper cytokinesis. This interaction is crucial for the localization of CEP55 to the spindle midzone and midbody during anaphase and cytokinesis (Zhao2006Cep55). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which is necessary for its recruitment to the midbody and interaction with other proteins like Plk1 (Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2).

In healthy cells, CEP55 is essential for the correct localization of several cytokinesis regulators, such as Aurora B and Plk1, at the midbody. Its absence can lead to cytokinesis failure, resulting in binucleated or multinucleated cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Zhao2006Cep55; Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP55 gene are associated with severe congenital malformations and lethal syndromes. Homozygous nonsense mutations in CEP55 can lead to conditions such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome-like Syndrome and MARCH syndrome, both of which are characterized by severe clinical manifestations including renal dysplasia, oligohydramnios, and central nervous system abnormalities, often resulting in perinatal lethality (Wang2023CEP55associated; Rashidieh2021Cep55). These mutations result in truncated CEP55 proteins that lack critical domains necessary for proper cellular function, leading to defects in cytokinesis and neural stem cell abscission (Wang2023CEP55associated; Little2021Loss).

CEP55 is also implicated in cancer progression. Overexpression of CEP55 is observed in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, where it correlates with tumor stage, invasiveness, and poor prognosis (Fan2022The). High CEP55 expression is linked to poor overall survival and disease-specific survival in multiple cancer types, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Li2023CEP55:). The gene's expression is associated with tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability, indicating its involvement in tumor progression and immune response (Li2023CEP55:).

## Interactions
CEP55 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis through its interactions with various proteins. It directly associates with MKLP1, a component of the centralspindlin complex, which is essential for midbody integrity and cell abscission during cytokinesis (Zhao2006Cep55). This interaction is specific and is mediated by the C-terminal half of CEP55, which is also responsible for its localization to the midbody (Zhao2006Cep55). CEP55 also self-associates, as demonstrated by co-precipitation experiments (Zhao2006Cep55).

CEP55 interacts with the ESCRT machinery proteins ALIX and TSG101, which are necessary for the abscission phase of cell division. The GPPX3Y motif of TEX14 can block these interactions, preventing cell abscission and leading to stable intercellular bridges in germ cells (Iwamori2010TEX14). CEP55's interaction with Plk1 is phosphorylation-dependent, and this interaction is crucial for its recruitment to the midbody during cytokinesis (Fabbro2005Cdk1Erk2). CEP55 also associates with the centralspindlin complex, which includes MKLP1 and MgcRacGAP, indicating a regulatory role in cytokinesis (Zhao2006Cep55).
