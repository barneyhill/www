# FAM43A

## Overview
FAM43A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 43 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM43A has been identified in several studies as playing a role in different physiological and pathological contexts, including cognitive functions, osteoarthritis, cancer, and immune responses. The protein encoded by FAM43A is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its involvement in disease pathways suggests it may have regulatory roles in cellular signaling and gene expression. Research continues to explore the implications of FAM43A in health and disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and stratification (Ma2024Development; Chen2011Identification; Li2023Identification; Zhao2018Diagnosis; BaronCohen2014A).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM43A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or genetic variations. In the context of mathematical ability, a genome-wide association study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near FAM43A and mathematical ability, suggesting that variations in this gene may influence cognitive functions (BaronCohen2014A).

In osteoarthritis, FAM43A is upregulated in a specific subgroup of patients, indicating its potential role in the pathophysiology of the disease. This upregulation was used to train a classifier to distinguish osteoarthritis subtypes, highlighting its clinical relevance in disease stratification (Zhao2018Diagnosis).

FAM43A is also involved in bladder cancer, where it is part of a gene set used to identify endothelial-related molecular subtypes. These subtypes are associated with different prognostic outcomes, suggesting that FAM43A may play a role in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Li2023Identification).

In sepsis, FAM43A is one of the macrophage-associated genes used to develop a prognostic model. This model predicts clinical outcomes and immune infiltration, indicating that FAM43A may be significant in understanding immune responses in sepsis (Ma2024Development).

Additionally, FAM43A is included in a gene model predicting recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer, demonstrating its potential utility in cancer prognosis (Chen2011Identification).
