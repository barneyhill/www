# DAD1

## Overview
The DAD1 gene encodes the defender against cell death 1 protein, a small integral membrane protein that plays a critical role in the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of eukaryotic cells. This protein is essential for N-linked glycosylation, a process crucial for proper protein folding and stability. As a subunit of the OST complex, DAD1 contributes to the structural integrity and function of the complex, interacting with other subunits such as OST48, ribophorin I, and ribophorin II. The protein's involvement in preventing apoptosis is linked to its role in maintaining the OST complex, with its absence leading to cell death in certain contexts. DAD1 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes (Kelleher1997DAD1; Roboti2012The; Sanjay1998DAD1).

## Structure
The DAD1 protein, encoded by the DAD1 gene, is a small integral membrane protein with a molecular mass of approximately 12.5 kDa. It consists of 113 amino acids, featuring a 28-residue N-terminal hydrophilic segment followed by three hydrophobic segments that likely function as transmembrane spans (Kelleher1997DAD1). The protein is highly conserved across species, sharing significant sequence identity with homologs in organisms such as Xenopus laevis and Caenorhabditis elegans (Kelleher1997DAD1).

DAD1 is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in N-linked glycosylation within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (Kelleher1997DAD1). The protein's hydrophilic domains are oriented toward the cytosol, consistent with its role in the OST complex (Kelleher1997DAD1). DAD1 forms heterodimers and heterotetramers with other OST subunits, such as OST48, ribophorin I, and ribophorin II, indicating its involvement in the quaternary structure of the OST complex (Kelleher1997DAD1).

The DAD1 protein is essential for the structural integrity and function of the OST complex, and its degradation at non-permissive temperatures leads to the destabilization of other OST components (Sanjay1998DAD1).

## Function
The DAD1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. This complex is responsible for N-linked glycosylation, a process that attaches oligosaccharides to asparagine residues on nascent polypeptides, which is essential for proper protein folding, stability, and function (Roboti2012The; Sanjay1998DAD1). DAD1 is necessary for the structural integrity and function of the OST complex, as its absence leads to destabilization of other OST subunits and a loss of N-glycosylation activity (Roboti2012The; Sanjay1998DAD1).

In healthy human cells, DAD1 is involved in maintaining the stability of OST complexes that contain the STT3A and STT3B catalytic subunits, which are crucial for the N-glycosylation process (Roboti2012The). The protein's role in preventing apoptosis is linked to its function in the OST complex, as the loss of DAD1 leads to apoptosis in certain cell lines, highlighting its importance in cell survival (Kelleher1997DAD1; Nakashima1993Molecular). DAD1's evolutionary conservation across species underscores its fundamental role in cellular processes (Kelleher1997DAD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DAD1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. DAD1 is known for its role in inhibiting apoptosis, and its dysregulation can contribute to cancer development and progression. In several cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and prostate cancer, DAD1 expression is often upregulated, providing tumor cells with a survival advantage by preventing apoptosis (Luo2021Emerging). In prostate cancer, DAD1 expression is associated with higher Gleason scores and perineural invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker (Luo2021Emerging).

DAD1 is also involved in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, where its expression is upregulated in resistant cell lines (Luo2021Emerging). In Sézary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a somatic deletion affecting the DAD1 gene has been observed, suggesting a link to apoptotic processes (Prasad2016Identification).

Polymorphisms in the DAD1 gene have been associated with asthma and atopy. The SNP rs1681577 (G allele) is identified as a protective factor for asthma, while SNPs rs1051101 (T allele) and rs3811189 (C allele) are risk factors for IL-13 production, a cytokine involved in allergic responses (Pires2018Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
DAD1 is a subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the complex. It is tightly associated with other OST subunits, including ribophorin I (RI), ribophorin II (RII), and OST48. DAD1 is present in equimolar amounts relative to these subunits, indicating its integral role within the complex (Kelleher1997DAD1; Sanjay1998DAD1).

DAD1 interacts directly with OST48, as demonstrated by crosslinking experiments that show DAD1 can be crosslinked to OST48 in intact microsomes. This interaction is mediated by the amino-terminal domain of DAD1, which interacts with the C terminus of OST48 (Kelleher1997DAD1; Sanjay1998DAD1). The association of DAD1 with OST48 is essential for the stability of the OST complex, as the degradation of DAD1 leads to the destabilization of OST48 and other subunits, resulting in a loss of N-glycosylation activity (Roboti2012The; Sanjay1998DAD1).

DAD1 is also associated with the translocon complex (TC) in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in the cotranslational N-glycosylation of nascent polypeptide chains. GFP-Dad1, a fusion protein used to study DAD1, shows reduced mobility in the ER, suggesting its incorporation into large polysome arrays during active protein synthesis (Nikonov2002Active).
