# DHH

## Overview
The Desert Hedgehog (DHH) gene encodes a signaling protein that is a pivotal component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is integral to various developmental processes. The DHH protein, a member of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules, is characterized by its role in cell differentiation and tissue patterning, particularly in the development and function of the testes and peripheral nerves (Yao2002Desert; Tajouri2018In). As a signaling molecule, DHH interacts with specific receptors and cell adhesion molecules, facilitating crucial biological processes such as testicular differentiation and muscle regeneration (Norris2022Hedgehog; Kavran2010All). Mutations in the DHH gene are linked to disorders of sex development and peripheral neuropathies, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Pan2022Case; Ayers2019Functional).

## Structure
The Desert Hedgehog (DHH) protein is a member of the hedgehog family of signaling proteins, which includes Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Indian Hedgehog (IHH). The DHH protein is composed of 396 amino acids and is encoded by three exons located on chromosome 12q12.13 in humans (Tajouri2018In). The protein undergoes autocatalytic processing, cleaving itself into an N-terminal fragment (HhN) and a C-terminal fragment (HhC). The HhN domain is responsible for biological signaling activity, while the HhC domain is involved in autocatalytic cleavage and cholesterol modification (Bürglin2008The).

The primary structure of DHH includes specific domains such as the Hedgehog signaling domain. The secondary structure consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's stability and function (Castro2013In). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with cell adhesion molecules and metal binding sites (Castro2013In). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available context.

Post-translational modifications of DHH include cholesterol modification and palmitoylation, which facilitate its release and signaling function (Bürglin2008The). These structural features are vital for the protein's role in developmental processes, particularly in testicular differentiation (Castro2013In).

## Function
The Desert Hedgehog (DHH) gene encodes a signaling protein that is a crucial component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in cell differentiation and tissue patterning. In healthy human cells, DHH is particularly important for the development and function of the testes and peripheral nerves. It is expressed in Sertoli cells within the testes and is involved in the differentiation of peritubular myoid cells and the formation of testis cords, as well as the differentiation of Leydig cells by upregulating SF-1 and Cyp11a1 expression (Yao2002Desert; Tajouri2018In).

DHH signaling involves the interaction with its receptor PTCH1, which is expressed in interstitial cells, to regulate Leydig cell differentiation during testis organogenesis (Yao2002Desert). This signaling pathway is essential for specifying fetal Leydig cell fate and is crucial for normal testicular development and function, potentially influencing germ cell maturation and spermatogenesis (Pachernegg2021The).

In skeletal muscle, DHH acts as a cell fate determinant during regeneration by restricting intramuscular adipose tissue formation and promoting myofiber regeneration. It influences fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) to express anti-adipogenic factors, thereby blocking adipogenic differentiation and supporting muscle regeneration (Norris2022Hedgehog).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHH gene are associated with 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD), particularly gonadal dysgenesis, which can manifest as either partial or complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD). These conditions are characterized by discrepancies between an individual's chromosomal and phenotypic sex, often resulting in atypical development of gonads and external genitalia (Pachernegg2021The; Ayers2019Functional; Tajouri2018In). Biallelic mutations in DHH are typically linked to more severe phenotypes, such as CGD, where individuals may present with streak gonads and female external genitalia despite having a 46,XY karyotype (Pan2022Case; Pachernegg2021The).

In addition to gonadal dysgenesis, DHH mutations can lead to peripheral neuropathies, particularly in patients with homozygous variants. These neuropathies can worsen with age, potentially leading to severe complications (Pan2022Case). Some patients with DHH mutations may also develop gonadal cancers, necessitating careful monitoring and potential removal of dysplastic gonads to mitigate tumor risk (Pan2022Case).

The DHH gene's role in male fertility is also significant, as mutations can result in male infertility due to impaired testis differentiation and spermatogenesis, without necessarily affecting external genital development (Mehta2021Mutations).

## Interactions
The Desert Hedgehog (DHH) protein is involved in several key interactions within the Hedgehog signaling pathway. DHH interacts with cell adhesion molecules CDO and BOC in a calcium-dependent manner, forming 1:1 complexes. These interactions are conserved across mammalian Hedgehog proteins and are crucial for their signaling functions (Kavran2010All). The binding between DHH and these molecules is affected by pH, with reduced interactions observed at pH 6.0 (Kavran2010All).

Mutations in the DHH protein, such as p.L162P and p.D90del, can destabilize the protein and affect its interaction with CDO and BOC, leading to less stable complexes (Castro2013In). DHH also interacts with Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip), which functions as an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. This interaction involves a b-propeller region in Hhip that binds to DHH with low nanomolar affinity, coordinating a zinc ion crucial for the inhibitory function (Beachy2010Interactions).

These interactions highlight the importance of DHH in cellular signaling and its potential role in developmental processes and diseases associated with Hedgehog pathway dysregulation.
