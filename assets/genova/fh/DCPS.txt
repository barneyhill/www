# DCPS

## Overview
The DCPS gene encodes the decapping enzyme, scavenger (DcpS), which is a member of the HIT (histidine triad) protein family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the mRNA decay pathway by cleaving the cap structure of mRNA, specifically converting m7GpppN to m7GMP, thereby facilitating proper mRNA turnover and regulation (Ahmed2015Mutations; Ng2015Loss). DcpS is a homodimeric protein with a domain-swapped fold, featuring distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains that undergo conformational changes upon substrate binding to achieve catalytic competence (fuchs2021structural). Beyond its canonical role in mRNA decay, DcpS also participates in miRNA turnover and pre-mRNA splicing, highlighting its multifaceted functions in gene expression regulation (Meziane2015The; Shen2008DcpS). Mutations in the DCPS gene have been linked to intellectual disability and other developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment (Ahmed2015Mutations).

## Structure
The DCPS protein, also known as DcpS, is an 80 kDa homodimer with a domain-swapped fold, consisting of distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains connected by a flexible hinge region (fuchs2021structural). The N-terminal domain is described as a lid-like structure, while the C-terminal domain is larger, forming a bipartite active site essential for catalytic activity (fuchs2021structural). The enzyme belongs to the HIT protein family, characterized by a histidine triad (H-X-H-X-H) in the active site located in the C-terminal domain (fuchs2021structural).

In its apo form, DcpS is symmetrical, but upon substrate binding, it undergoes a conformational change to an asymmetric state, where the N-terminal domain flips over the C-terminal domain to enclose the substrate (fuchs2021structural). This conformational change is crucial for forming a catalytically competent active site (fuchs2021structural). The enzyme's activity is influenced by substrate length, showing reduced activity with longer substrates due to steric hindrance (fuchs2021structural).

The DCPS protein is subject to substrate inhibition, where high substrate concentrations induce excessive conformational changes that inhibit catalysis (fuchs2021structural). This mechanism is thought to regulate the enzyme's activity and prevent the accumulation of m7GMP (fuchs2021structural).

## Function
The DCPS gene encodes a scavenger decapping enzyme that plays a crucial role in mRNA decay, a process essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, DCPS is involved in the degradation of mRNA cap structures, specifically cleaving the cap structure m7GpppN into m7GMP, which is vital for proper mRNA turnover and regulation (Ahmed2015Mutations; Ng2015Loss). This activity prevents the accumulation of cap structures that could sequester cap-binding proteins, thereby ensuring efficient mRNA splicing and translation (Shen2008DcpS; Ahmed2015Mutations).

DCPS functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, with distinct roles in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, it modulates pre-mRNA splicing by influencing cap-binding protein interactions, particularly affecting the splicing of the first intron (Shen2008DcpS). In the cytoplasm, DCPS is involved in miRNA turnover, enhancing miRNA degradation independently of its decapping activity, which suggests a non-canonical function in miRNA regulation (Meziane2015The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal cognitive function and development, as mutations in DCPS are linked to intellectual disability (Ahmed2015Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DCPS gene are associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability and a novel syndrome characterized by syndromic intellectual disability and neuromuscular defects. In particular, mutations such as a splice site variant (c.636+1G>A) and a missense variant (c.947C>T; p.Thr316Met) have been identified in affected individuals, leading to impaired decapping activity of the DCPS enzyme. This impairment results in the accumulation of m7GpppN cap structures, which can disrupt mRNA splicing and translation, contributing to intellectual disability (Ahmed2015Mutations).

In a Jordanian family, a recessive splice site mutation in the DCPS gene was linked to a syndrome with craniofacial anomalies, intellectual disability, and neuromuscular defects. This mutation leads to the loss of the major DCPS transcript, resulting in reduced enzymatic activity and altered mRNA processing (Ng2015Loss). The absence of DCPS activity affects the processing of mRNA caps, which is crucial for normal cellular function, and is linked to the observed clinical symptoms (Ng2015Loss).

These findings underscore the critical role of DCPS in neurodevelopment and highlight the potential for mutations in this gene to cause significant cognitive and developmental impairments.

## Interactions
The human DCPS gene encodes the scavenger decapping enzyme DcpS, which is involved in mRNA degradation. DcpS interacts with several proteins and complexes within the mRNA decay pathway. It is known to interact with components of the exosome complex, which plays a crucial role in mRNA decay (fuchs2021structural). DcpS also interacts with the protein Xrn1, which is involved in the regulation of 5'-3' mRNA decay and mRNA stability. This interaction is transcript-specific, as DcpS does not coordinate the regulation of all Xrn1-responsive RNAs (Zhou2015DcpS).

In yeast, DcpS can form heterodimers with its inactive homologue Dcs2p, which serves as a means of activity regulation (fuchs2021structural). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its ability to bind the m7G-cap structure of RNA, with a preference for short mRNA fragments (fuchs2021structural). Structural studies have shown that DcpS undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, which are essential for its catalytic activity (fuchs2021structural). These interactions and conformational dynamics are crucial for DcpS's role in mRNA processing and degradation.
