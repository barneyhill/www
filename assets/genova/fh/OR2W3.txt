# OR2W3

## Overview
The OR2W3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily W member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by contributing to the diversity of olfactory responses (Concas2021The). OR2W3 is expressed not only in the olfactory epithelium but also in various non-olfactory tissues, including the thyroid gland and human spermatozoa, suggesting additional roles in cellular signaling and potentially in sperm motility (Weidinger2021Functional; Flegel2016Characterization). Despite its broad expression, the specific functions of OR2W3 in non-olfactory tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Abaffy2015Human).

## Function
The OR2W3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in odorant signal transduction. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory responses (Concas2021The). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2W3 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including the thyroid gland, where it participates in cellular signaling pathways. Activation of OR2W3 in the thyroid leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium and cAMP concentrations, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and invasion (Weidinger2021Functional).

OR2W3 is also expressed in human spermatozoa, specifically localized in the flagella, indicating a potential role in sperm motility or signaling (Flegel2016Characterization). Despite its broad expression, the specific functional role of OR2W3 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as studies have primarily focused on its expression and potential roles in various tissues rather than detailed functional characterization (Abaffy2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OR2W3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. A study by Xiangyu Ma et al. identified a novel missense mutation, c.424 C>T (p.R142W), in the OR2W3 gene as a cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP). This mutation co-segregated with the disease phenotype in multiple generations of affected families, suggesting its significant role in the pathogenesis of RP, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive vision loss and specific retinal changes (Ma2015Wholeexome). The R142W mutation was found to be highly conserved among primates and predicted to have a deleterious effect, highlighting its potential impact on retinal function (Ma2015Wholeexome).

In addition to its association with retinitis pigmentosa, the OR2W3 gene has been studied in the context of male infertility. Research has shown that certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OR2W3, such as rs11204546, are associated with male infertility, particularly in specific populations. However, the clinical significance of these SNPs remains unclear, as studies have reported varying results regarding their association with conditions like non-obstructive azoospermia (Plaseski2012Association; Zhang2014Association).
