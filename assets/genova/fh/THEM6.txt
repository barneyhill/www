# THEM6

## Overview
Thioesterase superfamily member 6 (THEM6) is a gene that encodes the protein THEM6, which is a member of the thioesterase superfamily. This protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and the cellular stress response, particularly in cancer cells. THEM6 is involved in various protein interactions that are essential for maintaining ER integrity and function, including interactions with proteins involved in protein transport and homeostasis. The protein's involvement in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its impact on pathways such as ATF4/CHOP highlight its significance in cellular stress mechanisms. THEM6 has been identified as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics (Blomme2021THEM6mediated; Lu2023THEM6).

## Clinical Significance
THEM6 (thioesterase superfamily member 6) has been identified as a significant biomarker in breast cancer, with its overexpression linked to poorer overall survival in patients. This gene is notably overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, which is a more aggressive subtype (Lu2023THEM6). THEM6 is associated with several cancer-related pathways, including the cell cycle, PI3K-Akt signaling, and MAPK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer development and progression (Lu2023THEM6).

In breast cancer, high THEM6 expression correlates with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and progression (Lu2023THEM6). THEM6 also influences the tumor microenvironment by affecting immune cell infiltration. It is linked to the recruitment and polarization of macrophages, particularly through the secretion of CCL2, which promotes a tumor-supportive M2 macrophage phenotype (Lu2023THEM6).

These findings highlight THEM6 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer, given its involvement in tumor progression and immune modulation (Lu2023THEM6). Further research is needed to validate these associations and explore potential treatments targeting THEM6.

## Interactions
THEM6, a protein encoded by the thioesterase superfamily member 6 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid metabolism and stress response in cancer cells. THEM6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that interacts with a range of proteins involved in protein transport and homeostasis. Pull-down experiments have identified 152 proteins interacting with THEM6, including exportins, importins, and components of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. Notable interactions confirmed through immunoprecipitation include CRM1, AMFR, and SEC61b, which are involved in protein transport and ER membrane-associated processes (Blomme2021THEM6mediated).

THEM6 also plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) during ER stress, particularly affecting the ATF4/CHOP pathway. Its interaction with proteins involved in lipid metabolism and ER stress response highlights its significance in maintaining ER integrity and function (Blomme2021THEM6mediated). These interactions suggest that THEM6 is integral to the regulation of membrane protein trafficking and lipid-mediated stress responses, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Blomme2021THEM6mediated).
