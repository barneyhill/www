# VPS51

## Overview
VPS51 is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is integral to intracellular transport processes. The VPS51 protein, characterized by its coiled-coil domains, is involved in the tethering and fusion of vesicles at the trans-Golgi network, playing a pivotal role in the recycling and stabilization of Golgi glycosylation enzymes. This protein is also a component of the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex, contributing to the recycling of proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane. The interactions of VPS51 with SNARE proteins are crucial for vesicle tethering and fusion, impacting protein trafficking and localization within the cell. Mutations in the VPS51 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Khakurel2021The; Gershlick2019A; Uwineza2019VPS51).

## Structure
The VPS51 protein is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which plays a crucial role in endosome-to-Golgi transport. The protein is composed of 164 amino acids and contains 2-3 putative coiled-coil regions, which are important for its function within the complex (Reggiori2003Vps51). These coiled-coil domains are essential for the assembly of the VFT complex, a related complex in yeast, and are necessary for the protein's interaction with other subunits (Siniossoglou2002Vps51p).

The N-terminal domain of VPS51 is critical for binding to the SNARE protein Tlg1p, with residues 1-30 being highly conserved and necessary for efficient binding (Siniossoglou2002Vps51p). The last 40 residues of the protein have the potential to form an amphipathic coiled-coil, which may contribute to its structural stability and function (Siniossoglou2002Vps51p).

VPS51 is part of a heterotetrameric complex with a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry, interacting with other subunits such as VPS52, VPS53, and VPS54 (Reggiori2003Vps51). The protein does not have clear mammalian homologues, which makes it unique among the GARP complex components (Reggiori2003Vps51).

## Function
The VPS51 gene encodes a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is crucial for maintaining the Golgi glycosylation machinery in human cells. The GARP complex, located at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), is involved in tethering retrograde transport vesicles derived from endosomes, ensuring the proper localization and function of Golgi glycosylation enzymes. This process is essential for the recycling and stabilization of these enzymes, which impacts the modification of N- and O-glycans and the stability of glycoproteins (Khakurel2021The).

VPS51 is also a component of the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex, which facilitates the recycling of proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane. In healthy cells, VPS51 is necessary for the correct assembly of both GARP and EARP complexes, ensuring proper protein and lipid distribution within the cell. Mutations in VPS51 can lead to altered protein distribution and lysosomal swelling, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Gershlick2019A).

The GARP complex, including VPS51, interacts with SNARE proteins, playing a role in vesicle tethering and fusion processes. This interaction is crucial for the formation and localization of SNARE complexes in the Golgi, impacting intracellular protein trafficking and localization (Khakurel2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS51 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, often referred to as 'Golgipathies.' These disorders are characterized by symptoms such as microcephaly, intellectual disability, and brain malformations. The clinical significance of VPS51 mutations is highlighted by cases involving biallelic variants, which have been linked to progressive microcephaly, intellectual disability, and white matter defects (Gershlick2019A; Uwineza2019VPS51). 

In one study, a homozygous in-frame deletion in VPS51 was identified in two siblings, leading to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including delayed psychomotor development and absent speech (Uwineza2019VPS51). Another case involved a 6-year-old patient with compound heterozygous mutations in VPS51, presenting with global developmental delay, microcephaly, and epilepsy. These mutations resulted in reduced levels of the GARP and EARP complexes, affecting lysosomal function and leading to systemic manifestations (Gershlick2019A).

The mutations in VPS51 disrupt the function and localization of the GARP and EARP complexes, which are crucial for intracellular transport processes. This disruption can lead to lysosomal defects, as evidenced by increased LAMP1 levels and lysosomal swelling, further contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals (Gershlick2019A).

## Interactions
VPS51 is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which includes VPS52, VPS53, and VPS54. It plays a crucial role in mediating the interaction between the GARP complex and the t-SNARE protein Tlg1p. VPS51 is essential for the binding of VPS52 to Tlg1p, as demonstrated by in vitro experiments where VPS52 failed to bind to Tlg1p in the absence of VPS51. However, VPS51 can still bind to Tlg1p even without the presence of VPS52, VPS53, or VPS54, although the binding affinity is reduced (Conibear2003Vps51p).

In yeast, VPS51 interacts with the SNARE protein Tlg1p through a short sequence at its N terminus, which is crucial for this binding. This interaction is part of the VFT complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the late Golgi (Siniossoglou2002Vps51p). In mammals, VPS51 interacts with the regulatory Habc domain of syntaxin-6, suggesting it serves as an adaptor linking the GARP complex to the SNARE machinery at the acceptor membrane, facilitating SNARE pairing (Luo2011TheCaenorhabditis).

VPS51 is also involved in the proper assembly and localization of the GARP and EARP complexes, which are crucial for intracellular trafficking processes (Gershlick2019A).
