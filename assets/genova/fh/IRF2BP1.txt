# IRF2BP1

## Overview
IRF2BP1, or interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions primarily as a transcriptional corepressor. The IRF2BP1 protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of immune response and cell growth. It achieves this by forming complexes with transcription factors such as IRF2, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity of target genes. The protein is implicated in chromatin remodeling, influencing the accessibility of DNA to transcriptional machinery, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression. Through its interactions with various proteins, IRF2BP1 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stimuli, highlighting its importance in cellular processes and potential implications in clinical contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Interactions
IRF2BP1 (interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence gene expression. It is known to interact with IRF2, forming complexes that function as transcriptional corepressors. These complexes play a significant role in regulating immune response and cell growth by modulating the expression of target genes. IRF2BP1's interaction with IRF2 is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression, as it helps in the formation of a repressive complex that can inhibit the transcription of specific genes.

In addition to its interaction with IRF2, IRF2BP1 is also involved in interactions with other transcription factors. These interactions suggest that IRF2BP1 may participate in chromatin remodeling, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression. By influencing chromatin structure, IRF2BP1 can affect the accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity of various genes.

The ability of IRF2BP1 to interact with multiple proteins highlights its versatile role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics. These interactions underscore the importance of IRF2BP1 in maintaining proper cellular function and response to external stimuli.
