# H3Y1

## Overview
H3Y1 is a gene that encodes the H3.Y histone 1 protein, a primate-specific variant of the histone H3 family. This variant is distinguished by its unique amino acid composition, which contributes to its specialized role in chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation. The H3.Y histone 1 protein is primarily associated with euchromatin and is enriched at transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes, suggesting its involvement in facilitating a relaxed chromatin structure that enhances transcription factor access. Structurally, the H3.Y nucleosome is characterized by increased DNA end flexibility compared to canonical histones, which is attributed to specific amino acid differences such as Lys42. This flexibility results in reduced binding affinity for linker histone H1, further promoting a chromatin state conducive to active transcription. The gene's expression is notably implicated in the pathogenesis of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), where it is a significant target of the DUX4 transcription factor, highlighting its clinical relevance (Schätzl2024Metaanalysis; Kujirai2016Structure; Kong2022Engineered).

## Structure
The human histone variant H3.Y, encoded by the H3Y1 gene, is a primate-specific variant of the histone H3 family. It differs from the canonical H3.3 by 26 amino acid residues and from H3.1 by 30 residues, with specific differences including Lys42, Leu46, Lys53, and Gln59, which are located near the DNA ends of the nucleosome (Kujirai2016Structure). These residues contribute to the unique structural properties of the H3.Y nucleosome, such as increased DNA end flexibility compared to H3.3 (Kujirai2016Structure).

The tertiary structure of the H3.Y nucleosome was determined through crystallography at a resolution of 2.8 Å, revealing that the H3.Y-specific residues influence DNA binding and nucleosome stability (Kujirai2016Structure). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of H3.Y with other histones (H2A, H2B, and H4) into nucleosomes, forming a more relaxed chromatin configuration due to the flexible DNA ends (Kujirai2016Structure).

H3.Y nucleosomes exhibit reduced binding affinity for linker histone H1, attributed to the presence of Lys42 instead of Arg42 found in H3.3, which affects the interaction with DNA and chromatin compaction (Kujirai2016Structure). This structural characteristic may facilitate transcription factor access and influence gene regulation (Kujirai2016Structure).

## Function
H3Y1, also known as H3.Y histone 1, is a primate-specific variant of the histone H3 family, derived from H3.3. It plays a significant role in chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation. H3.Y is predominantly found in euchromatin and is enriched at transcription start sites (TSSs) of actively transcribed genes, suggesting its involvement in transcription regulation (Kujirai2016Structure). The presence of H3.Y at TSSs indicates that it may facilitate a relaxed chromatin structure, allowing transcription factors easier access to DNA, thereby influencing gene expression (Kujirai2016Structure).

The H3.Y nucleosome exhibits unique structural properties, such as more flexible DNA ends compared to the H3.3 nucleosome, which contributes to its relaxed chromatin configuration (Kujirai2016Structure). This flexibility is attributed to specific amino acid residues in H3.Y, such as Lys42, which differ from those in H3.3 and affect DNA binding and linker histone H1 interaction (Kujirai2016Structure). The reduced binding of H1 to H3.Y nucleosomes may further promote a chromatin state conducive to active transcription (Kujirai2016Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the H3Y1 gene, a target of the DUX4 transcription factor, are implicated in the pathogenesis of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). In FSHD, the inhibition of DNA methylation significantly upregulates DUX4 target genes, including H3Y1, in mutant myotubes. H3Y1 is one of the most highly induced targets, and its incorporation into target gene regions enhances their expression, contributing to a positive feedback loop that fortifies the DUX4-triggered gene network (Kong2022Engineered). This upregulation is associated with the disruption of muscle myogenesis and the induction of apoptosis at high levels of DUX4 expression, as well as the inhibition of myogenesis at lower levels (Schätzl2024Metaanalysis).

The meta-analysis of FSHD also highlights H3Y1 as the most upregulated DUX4 biomarker gene, with a standardized log2-fold change of +2.89, indicating its significant role in the disease's pathology (Schätzl2024Metaanalysis). These findings underscore the importance of epigenetic regulation in FSHD and suggest that alterations in H3Y1 expression are a critical component of the disease mechanism, emphasizing the need for further research into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
H3Y1, also known as H3.Y histone 1, is a variant of the histone H3 family that participates in specific interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins, influencing chromatin dynamics. The H3.Y nucleosome exhibits a more relaxed chromatin configuration compared to the H3.3 nucleosome, primarily due to its flexible DNA ends. This flexibility is attributed to the presence of the amino acid residue Lys42 in H3.Y, which differs from Arg42 in H3.3. This difference affects the binding efficiency of the linker histone H1, which binds less efficiently to the H3.Y nucleosome than to the H3.3 nucleosome (Kujirai2016Structure).

Despite the reduced binding efficiency, H1 can still bind to the H3.Y nucleosome under low salt conditions, as confirmed by hydroxyl radical footprinting and MNase treatment assays (Kujirai2016Structure). The H3.Y nucleosome is also involved in forming heterotypic nucleosomes with H3.3, which are more susceptible to MNase digestion, indicating a flexible DNA nature. In these heterotypic nucleosomes, H1 binding is reduced compared to the H3.3 nucleosome, suggesting that H3.Y-specific characteristics are conserved (Kujirai2016Structure).
