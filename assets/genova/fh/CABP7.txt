# CABP7

## Overview
CABP7 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium binding protein 7, which is a member of the calcium-binding protein family characterized by EF-hand motifs. This protein is involved in calcium signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in regulating phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels, which are essential for cytokinesis in mammalian cells. Calcium binding protein 7 is categorized as a tail-anchored (TA) protein due to its C-terminal transmembrane domain, which is vital for its localization to the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes. This localization is dynamic, changing throughout the cell cycle to facilitate its function in lysosomal clustering and cytokinesis. The protein interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), acting as a Ca2+-independent inhibitor, thereby influencing lysosomal content sorting and positioning during cell division (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation; McCue2009Membrane).

## Structure
CaBP7, also known as calneuron 2, is a member of the calcium-binding protein family characterized by EF-hand motifs. These motifs are typically involved in calcium ion binding, although in CaBP7, some EF hands have undergone deletions or substitutions that likely prevent effective calcium binding. Specifically, CaBP7 has a three amino acid deletion in EF3 and modifications in EF4, suggesting it may only bind divalent cations using EF1 and EF2 (McCue2010Bioinformatic).

The protein features a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix, which is crucial for its sub-cellular targeting to the Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles. This TM domain is essential for the correct localization and orientation of CaBP7 within cellular membranes, functioning as a tail-anchored (TA) protein inserted post-translationally (McCue2011Determination; McCue2009Membrane).

CaBP7's structure includes a large cytosol-oriented N-terminal domain, a single TM-spanning domain, and a short C-terminal luminal domain. This configuration is consistent with a type-II membrane topology (McCue2011Determination). The protein does not contain consensus motifs for post-translational modifications like N-myristoylation, which are common in other calcium-sensing proteins (McCue2011Determination).

## Function
CaBP7 (calcium binding protein 7) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its role in calcium signaling pathways. It functions as a regulator of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels, which is crucial for cytokinesis in mammalian cells. CaBP7 modulates the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), a kinase associated with lysosomes, influencing lysosomal content sorting and positioning during cell division (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation). 

CaBP7 is localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and lysosomes, with its distribution varying throughout the cell cycle. During interphase, it is associated with the Golgi apparatus, but it relocates to lysosomes as cells enter mitosis, reversing during cytokinesis (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation). This dynamic localization is essential for its function in lysosomal clustering and cytokinesis, as depletion of CaBP7 leads to lysosome mislocalization and cytokinesis failure (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation).

The protein's C-terminal transmembrane domain is crucial for its membrane association and sub-cellular targeting, distinguishing it from other calcium-binding proteins that rely on different mechanisms for membrane localization (McCue2011Determination; McCue2009Membrane).

## Interactions
CaBP7 (calcium binding protein 7) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), acting as a Ca2+-independent inhibitor of this kinase. This interaction is crucial for regulating phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels, which are essential for normal cytokinesis in mammalian cells (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation). The modulation of PI4P levels by CaBP7 affects lysosomal positioning and clustering, particularly during cytokinesis, where lysosomes cluster at the intercellular bridge (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation).

CaBP7 is also associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and late endosomes/lysosomes, suggesting its role in vesicular trafficking and phosphoinositide metabolism (Rajamanoharan2015Modulation; McCue2009Membrane). The protein's C-terminal transmembrane domain is crucial for its membrane localization, which is necessary for its interactions and functions within the cell (McCue2011Determination; McCue2009Membrane). While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, CaBP7's regulatory role in PI4KIIIβ activity and its localization to key cellular compartments highlight its importance in cellular signaling and division processes.
