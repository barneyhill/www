# GHRL

## Overview
The GHRL gene is responsible for encoding the preproghrelin peptide, which is subsequently processed into the hormones ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin, a peptide hormone primarily produced in the stomach, is known for its role in stimulating appetite and regulating energy balance, earning it the moniker "hunger hormone" (Wren2001Ghrelin). It functions by binding to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a), a G protein-coupled receptor, to promote the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland (Kojima1999Ghrelin). Ghrelin also influences glucose homeostasis and has various roles in the central nervous system, including effects on mood, learning, and memory (Müller2015Ghrelin). Obestatin, another peptide derived from the GHRL gene, is believed to counteract some of ghrelin's effects, although its precise functions remain less well-defined (Gahete2013Ghrelin). The GHRL gene's complexity, including its alternative splicing and multiple isoforms, highlights its significant involvement in diverse physiological processes and potential implications in various diseases.

## Structure
The GHRL gene encodes the preproghrelin peptide, which is a precursor to the ghrelin and obestatin peptides. The preproghrelin consists of 117 amino acids, including a 23-amino acid signal peptide and a 94-amino acid proghrelin segment. This segment undergoes proteolytic processing to generate the mature 28-amino acid ghrelin peptide and the C-ghrelin peptide, which can further be processed into obestatin (Gahete2011A; Gahete2013Ghrelin). Ghrelin undergoes a unique post-translational modification where an octanoyl group is added to the third serine residue, a process catalyzed by the enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT). This acylation is crucial for ghrelin's ability to bind to its receptor, GHSR1a (Gutierrez2008Ghrelin; Gahete2013Ghrelin).

The GHRL gene exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms, such as the In1-ghrelin variant. This variant includes exons 0, 1, intron 1, and exon 2, but lacks exons 3 and 4, leading to a novel C-terminal tail and preventing the production of obestatin (Gahete2011A). The In1-ghrelin variant retains the first 12 amino acids of native ghrelin, including the Ser3 octanoylation site, and is overexpressed in certain cancers (IbáñezCosta2015In1ghrelin).

## Function
The GHRL gene encodes the ghrelin and obestatin prepropeptide, which is cleaved to produce the hormones ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin, primarily produced in the stomach, plays a significant role in stimulating appetite and regulating energy balance by acting on the hypothalamus. It is known as the "hunger hormone" because it increases food intake and promotes fat storage (Wren2001Ghrelin). Ghrelin also stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland by binding to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) (Kojima1999Ghrelin). This hormone is involved in glucose homeostasis, inhibiting insulin secretion and stimulating glucagon secretion, which impacts glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (Poher2018Ghrelin; Müller2015Ghrelin).

Ghrelin is active in various tissues, including the brain, where it influences appetite and energy balance by activating specific neurons in the hypothalamus (Müller2015Ghrelin). It also affects gastrointestinal motility and has roles in learning, memory, and mood regulation (Müller2015Ghrelin). Obestatin, another product of the GHRL gene, is thought to counteract some of ghrelin's effects, although its functions are less understood (Gahete2013Ghrelin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GHRL gene, which encodes the ghrelin and obestatin prepropeptide, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GHRL gene, such as rs27627 and rs35683, have been associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer, while the rs696217 (Leu72Met) SNP is linked to early onset of esophageal adenocarcinoma and obesity (Chopin2012The). The In1-ghrelin variant, a novel transcript of the GHRL gene, is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and is associated with increased cell proliferation, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Gahete2011A).

In obesity, the Leu72Met polymorphism has been associated with early-onset obesity, although results vary across populations (Scerif2011Ghrelin). Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), characterized by hyperphagia and obesity, is associated with high ghrelin levels, although not all PWS patients exhibit this trait. This suggests that other factors, such as hypothalamic dysfunction, may contribute to the condition (Scerif2011Ghrelin). The complexity of the GHRL gene, with its multiple transcripts and variants, underscores its potential involvement in various pathophysiological conditions.

## Interactions
Ghrelin, encoded by the GHRL gene, interacts with the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a) to stimulate growth hormone release. This interaction is crucial for ghrelin's biological activity and is dependent on the octanoylation of serine-3, a modification mediated by the enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) (Gutierrez2008Ghrelin). The N-terminal region of ghrelin, particularly the first five amino acids, is essential for binding and activating GHSR1a. The hydrophobic n-octanoyl group on serine-3 and the presence of leucine at position 5 are critical for this interaction (Bednarek2000Structure−Function).

Mutations in ghrelin, such as the [S2A, L5R] variant, can alter its interaction with GHSR1a. This mutant form compensates for the loss of leucine-5 through alternative interactions, such as cation-π and π-π interactions between arginine-5 and phenylalanine residues in the receptor (Li2021Unusual). Ghrelin also interacts with lipoproteins in the bloodstream, binding to VLDL, LDL, and HDL, which may act as transporters and influence its stability and signaling (Cleverdon2016The).
