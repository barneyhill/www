# PILRB

## Overview
PILRB is a gene that encodes the paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor beta, a transmembrane receptor involved in the modulation of immune responses. This receptor is part of the paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR) family, which includes both activating and inhibitory receptors that play crucial roles in immune system regulation. PILRB is primarily expressed in various immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, where it contributes to the recognition of self versus non-self antigens, thereby facilitating immune surveillance (Wilson2006Comparative). The receptor functions by interacting with the DAP12 adaptor molecule, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), to transduce activating signals that can influence immune responses, such as those involved in inflammation and pathogen clearance (Banerjee2010Modulation). The gene's evolutionary history is marked by duplication and inversion events, which have contributed to its complex genomic structure and functional diversity (Wilson2006Comparative).

## Function
PILRB is an activating receptor involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells. It is characterized by a truncated cytoplasmic tail and a charged amino acid in its transmembrane domain, which distinguishes it from its inhibitory counterpart, PILRA (Wilson2006Comparative; Mousseau2000PILRα). PILRB is expressed in various blood cell types, including CD8+, CD4+, and CD19+ cells, with higher expression levels in resting cells compared to activated ones (Wilson2006Comparative). 

The gene is part of the paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR) locus, which has undergone significant evolutionary changes, such as duplication and inversion events, contributing to its complex genomic structure (Wilson2006Comparative). PILRB's expression is notably high in NK cells, suggesting its role in distinguishing between self and foreign antigens, which is crucial for immune surveillance (Wilson2006Comparative). 

PILRB interacts with the adaptor molecule DAP12, transducing an activating signal through the DAP12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is involved in the modulation of immune responses (Banerjee2010Modulation). This interaction plays a role in the immune system's response to infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus-induced pneumonia, where PILRB's activation can exacerbate inflammatory responses (Banerjee2010Modulation).

## Interactions
PILRB, a paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor beta, is involved in several key interactions that regulate immune responses. It is an activating receptor that associates with the ITAM-bearing DAP12 adapter molecule, which is crucial for its signaling functions (Wang2008An). PILRB interacts with CD99, a broadly expressed protein on various cells, including lymphocytes. This interaction is dependent on the presence of sialylated O-linked sugar chains on CD99, which are essential for recognition by PILRB (Wang2008An). The interaction between PILRB and CD99 is enhanced under flow conditions, which is significant for neutrophil arrest and diapedesis, processes critical for immune response and inflammation (Li2019Blood).

PILRB also plays a role in modulating the host's immune response to bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus-induced pneumonia. It influences cytokine and chemokine production, affecting the inflammatory response (Banerjee2010Modulation). The absence of PILRB leads to a more robust immune response, characterized by increased neutrophil and macrophage influx, which is crucial for effective bacterial clearance (Banerjee2010Modulation). These interactions highlight PILRB's role in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
