# COMMD7

## Overview
COMMD7 is a gene that encodes the protein COMM domain containing 7, a member of the COMMD protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions and dimerization. The protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as endosomal membrane trafficking and the regulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune responses and inflammation (Maine2007COMMD; Healy2018Structural). COMMD7 is a component of the Commander complex, a multiprotein assembly involved in endosomal protein trafficking, and is implicated in various cellular functions, including the trafficking of Notch proteins and copper transporters (Mallam2017Systemswide). The gene's expression and function have been linked to the progression of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (You2016COMMD7; Zheng2012ShRNATargeted).

## Structure
COMMD7 is a member of the COMMD protein family, characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is crucial for dimerization and interactions with other proteins (Healy2018Structural). The COMM domain forms a tightly interlocked dimeric structure, essential for COMMD-COMMD interactions and non-specific membrane association (Healy2018Structural). COMMD7, like other COMMD proteins, forms obligatory dimers and can interact in both homo- and heterodimeric arrangements via the C-terminal COMM domain (Healy2018Structural).

The N-terminal region of COMMD7, referred to as the HN domain, is structurally conserved across the COMMD family and consists of a modular architecture with alpha-helical structures (Healy2018Structural). The HN domain acts as a flexible appendage to the C-terminal COMM domain dimers (Healy2018Structural). The ability of COMMD7 to self-assemble and form heteromeric complexes is a core property, contributing to its role in cellular processes such as endosomal membrane trafficking and inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB (Healy2018Structural). The structural features observed in COMMD9, another COMMD family member, suggest that COMMD7 may share similar dimeric structures (Healy2018Structural). Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of COMMD7 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
COMMD7 is a member of the COMMD protein family, which is characterized by a conserved COMM domain at the carboxy terminus. This domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, allowing COMMD7 to participate in the formation of multimeric complexes within cells (Maine2007COMMD). COMMD7 is part of the Commander complex, a multiprotein assembly involved in endosomal protein trafficking, which is crucial for cellular processes such as protein sorting and transport (Mallam2017Systemswide). The Commander complex, including COMMD7, plays a role in the trafficking of various proteins, such as Notch proteins and copper transporters, and is essential for vertebrate embryogenesis (Mallam2017Systemswide).

COMMD7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting it may influence processes like immune responses and cellular stress pathways. While the specific functions of COMMD7 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, it is implied that, like other COMMD proteins, it may be involved in regulating NF-kB signaling, a pathway critical for inflammation and immune responses (Maine2007COMMD). The precise cellular localization and specific functions of COMMD7 remain largely unexplored, but its involvement in the Commander complex indicates a significant role in endosomal trafficking and cellular homeostasis (Mallam2017Systemswide).

## Clinical Significance
COMMD7 is implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its overexpression and involvement in key signaling pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), COMMD7 is overexpressed and associated with tumor invasion and poor prognosis. Silencing COMMD7 in HCC cell lines reduces cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and causes cell cycle arrest, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2012ShRNATargeted). COMMD7 also plays a role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where its high expression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. Inhibition of COMMD7 in PDAC cells reduces proliferation and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (You2016COMMD7).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high COMMD7 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with adverse clinical features, such as high bone marrow blasts and poor survival outcomes. It is considered an independent prognostic factor in AML, particularly in patients with specific genetic mutations (Li2021High). COMMD7's involvement in the NF-kB signaling pathway is noted across these cancers, contributing to its role in tumor progression (You2023COMMD).

## Interactions
COMMD7 is a member of the COMMD protein family and is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the NF-kB signaling pathway. It specifically interacts with NEMO, a component of the IKK complex, which is crucial for NF-kB signaling. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells. Unlike other COMMD family members such as COMMD1 and COMMD6, COMMD7 uniquely interacts with NEMO (Esposito2015COMMD7).

COMMD7 also interacts with COMMD1, and together they cooperate to down-regulate NF-kB activity. This interaction does not interfere with the binding of NEMO to the IKKs, indicating that COMMD7 acts as a scaffold between the IKK complex and COMMD1, facilitating the termination of NF-kB-dependent transcription (Esposito2015COMMD7).

In addition to its role in NF-kB signaling, COMMD7 is part of the CCC complex, which is involved in endosomal membrane trafficking. It interacts with CCDC22 and CCDC93 proteins through its C-terminal COMM domain, which is crucial for these interactions (Mallam2017Systemswide; Healy2018Structural).
