# MS4A3

## Overview
MS4A3, or membrane spanning 4-domains A3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the MS4A family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. This protein, also known as HTm4, is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, particularly in myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Mattiola2021The; Gingras2001CFFM4:). The MS4A3 protein is involved in forming multimolecular complexes, potentially functioning as part of receptor complexes involved in signal transduction (Liang2001Identification). It acts as a negative regulator of the cell cycle by inhibiting the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), which is crucial for controlling the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Xu2022Shortterm; Heller2015EVI1). The gene's expression is down-regulated during terminal differentiation, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including hematological malignancies and atopic conditions (Heller2015EVI1; Kutok2011Characterization).

## Structure
The MS4A3 protein, also known as HTm4, is a member of the MS4A family characterized by four transmembrane-spanning domains. These domains are hydrophobic, allowing the protein to span the cell membrane multiple times, with small extracellular and intracellular loops between them (Adra1994Cloning; Gingras2001CFFM4:). The transmembrane regions are highly conserved among MS4A family members, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Mattiola2021The; Liang2001Identification).

The primary structure of MS4A3 consists of 214 amino acids, with significant sequence homology to other MS4A proteins, particularly in the transmembrane domains (Adra1994Cloning). The protein's N- and C-terminal regions are cytoplasmic and contain proline-rich sequences, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (Adra1994Cloning). 

MS4A3 is expressed in hematopoietic cells, particularly in myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and its expression is down-regulated during terminal differentiation (Mattiola2021The; Gingras2001CFFM4:). The protein may form multimolecular complexes, similar to other MS4A family members, potentially functioning as part of receptor complexes involved in signal transduction (Liang2001Identification).

## Function
The MS4A3 gene encodes a protein that is primarily involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and differentiation of myeloid cells. It is expressed on the membrane of human blood monocytes and granulocytes, marking early myeloid differentiation in both humans and mice (SilvaGomes2021Differential). MS4A3 is a negative regulator of the cell cycle, acting upstream of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) by inhibiting its phosphorylation. This regulation is crucial for controlling the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Xu2022Shortterm; Heller2015EVI1).

In the context of erythropoiesis, MS4A3 downregulation leads to increased CDK2 activity, promoting the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, which enhances red blood cell production (Xu2022Shortterm). MS4A3 is also involved in immune responses, as it is expressed in basophils and progenitor cells, suggesting a role in the differentiation and function of myeloid cells (SilvaGomes2021Differential). The protein's expression in various leukocyte subsets indicates its involvement in immune cell activation and potential roles in cancer, autoimmunity, and infection (Mattiola2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The MS4A3 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In the context of hematological malignancies, MS4A3 is a direct target of the EVI1 oncogene, which represses its expression. This repression is associated with aggressive disease courses in myeloid leukemias, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where high EVI1 expression correlates with low MS4A3 levels, contributing to poor outcomes (Heller2015EVI1). Re-expression of MS4A3 in EVI1-positive cells has been shown to reduce tumor growth, suggesting its potential role in modulating tumor aggressiveness (Heller2015EVI1).

In addition to its role in leukemia, MS4A3 is associated with atopic conditions, including asthma, due to its high expression in basophils, which are involved in allergic responses (Kutok2011Characterization). The gene's expression is also observed in various cancers, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian adenocarcinomas, indicating its involvement in tumor cell cycle regulation (Kutok2011Characterization).

Furthermore, MS4A3 is linked to the TGFβ/EMT signaling pathway in AML, where its expression is regulated by miR-431. This regulation affects cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting MS4A3's role in cancer progression (Jiang2018Ecotropic).

## Interactions
MS4A3 is involved in several interactions that influence cell cycle regulation and erythropoiesis. It forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and kinase-associated phosphatase (KAP), where it stimulates KAP's enzymatic activity. This interaction leads to the dephosphorylation of CDK2 at Thr160, resulting in cell cycle arrest (Heller2015EVI1). MS4A3 also regulates the G1-S cell cycle transition by phosphorylating CDK2 or through direct binding to CDK inhibitor 3 in the nucleus (Xu2022Shortterm).

In the context of short-term intensive fasting (STIF), MS4A3 downregulation is associated with increased transcription and phosphorylation of CDK2, suggesting a regulatory role at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels (Xu2022Shortterm). This regulation is independent of erythropoietin (EPO) upregulation and relies on autophagy integrity, as defects in autophagy disable the STIF-triggered upregulation of CDK2 expression and phosphorylation (Xu2022Shortterm).

EVI1, an oncogene, represses MS4A3 by directly binding to its promoter, which is necessary for EVI1's tumor-promoting effects (Heller2015EVI1). This repression highlights the role of MS4A3 in differentiation and its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Heller2015EVI1).
