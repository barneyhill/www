# GPR55

## Overview
GPR55 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 55, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including bone metabolism, endothelial cell signaling, and the inflammatory response. GPR55 is activated by ligands such as alpha-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and is implicated in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels and the activation of transcription factors. The receptor's expression in diverse tissues, including the brain, spleen, and bone marrow, underscores its multifaceted role in human health and disease. Notably, GPR55 has been associated with pathological conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Akimov2023The; Godlewski2009Receptors; MedinaVera2023The).

## Structure
GPR55 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of Class A GPCRs. The primary structure of GPR55 includes unique sequence motifs that distinguish it from other GPCRs, such as a conservative substitution in the TMH3 E/DRY motif and a non-conservative substitution in the TMH7 NPXXY motif (Kotsikorou2011Identification). The secondary structure involves these helices forming a bundle, with specific proline residues causing bends in TMH1 and TMH2, influencing the receptor's conformation and ligand binding pocket (Kotsikorou2011Identification).

The tertiary structure of GPR55 is modeled based on homology with other GPCRs, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor and the A2A adenosine receptor, with modifications to account for sequence differences (Kotsikorou2011Identification; Elbegdorj2013A). The receptor's extracellular loops and transmembrane regions are crucial for ligand interaction, with specific residues like Lys80 playing a key role in ligand binding (Elbegdorj2013A). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting receptor function, although specific modifications for GPR55 are not detailed in the context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
GPR55 is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various signaling pathways in human cells. It couples with G proteins such as Gα13, Gα12, and Gαq, leading to the activation of small GTPases like RhoA, cdc42, and rac1. This activation results in intracellular calcium release and the activation of transcription factors like NFAT, which regulate gene expression (Godlewski2009Receptors). GPR55 is implicated in endothelial cell signaling, influencing vasodilation and vasoconstriction, and is involved in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Godlewski2009Receptors). 

In bone metabolism, GPR55 is expressed in osteoclasts and osteoblasts, where it influences bone remodeling. Studies have shown that GPR55 ligands affect osteoclast formation and function, with CBD acting as an antagonist. In GPR55 knockout mice, there is an increase in trabecular bone volume and a decrease in bone resorption, indicating GPR55's role in bone mass regulation (Sharir2010Pharmacological). 

GPR55 is also expressed in various tissues, including the brain, spleen, and bone marrow, indicating its involvement in the inflammatory response. It is present in cancer cells and is considered a multi-ligand receptor, activated by ligands such as alpha-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), which leads to increased cell proliferation (Akimov2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the GPR55 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Alzheimer's disease, GPR55 expression is significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of App NL-G-F knock-in mice, correlating with high levels of amyloid-beta load, cognitive dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. This suggests a potential role for GPR55 in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, with its modulation being considered as a therapeutic strategy (MedinaVera2023The).

In cancer, GPR55 is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration. It is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer cell lines, where it enhances cell migration and invasion, particularly in response to its ligand L-a-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) (Ford2010A). GPR55 is also involved in the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, with THC acting through GPR55 to modulate tumor cell growth (Kolbe2021THC).

GPR55 expression is altered in immune responses, being upregulated in activated T-cells and in cells infected with pathogens like Epstein-Barr virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suggesting a role in immune cell differentiation and chemoattraction (Wnorowski2021Gene).

## Interactions
GPR55 interacts with the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) but not with RGS1. This interaction is specific and results in the translocation of RGS2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, forming a ternary complex with GPR55 and G-protein subunits such as Ga q or Ga 12/13. This complex formation does not depend on the presence of Ga subunits, although Ga q can be part of the complex (Jang2020Modulation). RGS2 acts as a scaffold protein, inhibiting GPR55-mediated signaling pathways, including ERK phosphorylation and calcium mobilization, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and migration (Jang2020Modulation).

GPR55 does not have documented interactions with nucleic acids. Its interactions are primarily with proteins, particularly in the context of signaling pathways. The third intracellular loop of GPR55 is a key site for interaction with RGS2, which is consistent with its role in modulating GPR55 signaling (Jang2020Modulation). These interactions highlight the potential of RGS2 as a therapeutic target for controlling GPR55-mediated pathophysiological processes, such as tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Jang2020Modulation).
