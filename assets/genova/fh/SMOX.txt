# SMOX

## Overview
The SMOX gene encodes the enzyme spermine oxidase, a flavoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the polyamine catabolic pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the oxidation of spermine into spermidine, 3-aminopropanaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide, thereby contributing to the regulation of polyamine homeostasis and cellular redox balance. Spermine oxidase is categorized as an oxidase due to its function in catalyzing oxidation reactions. It is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the brain and bone marrow, where it influences various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress by modulating reactive oxygen species levels. Alterations in SMOX expression have been linked to several pathological conditions, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Perrone2023Spermine; Marcoli2022Transgenic; SánchezJiménez2019Polyamines).

## Structure
Human spermine oxidase (SMOX) is a dimeric enzyme involved in the polyamine catabolic pathway, catalyzing the oxidation of spermine into spermidine, 3-aminopropanaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide (Rilievo2023Spermine). The enzyme contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, which is crucial for its oxidase function. The FAD group is non-covalently bound and located at the interface between the FAD-containing F-domain and the substrate-binding S-domain (Diaz2022Structure).

The primary structure of SMOX consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the SMOX gene, with a molecular weight of approximately 68 kDa per monomer (Rilievo2023Spermine). The secondary structure includes a 6-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by five α-helices, forming part of the substrate-binding domain (Diaz2022Structure). The tertiary structure of SMOX reveals a folding architecture similar to other flavoenzymes, with two distinct domains (Diaz2022Structure).

SMOX's quaternary structure is dimeric, and the enzyme's stability and activity can be modulated by interactions with nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SAMNs), which preserve its native structure upon immobilization (Rilievo2023Spermine). The enzyme's structure is maintained with minimal conformational changes upon complexation with SAMNs, as confirmed by techniques like circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopy (Rilievo2023Spermine).

## Function
Spermine oxidase (SMOX) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in polyamine metabolism by catalyzing the oxidation of spermine to spermidine, with the concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide and 3-aminopropanal. This process is essential for maintaining polyamine homeostasis, which is crucial for normal cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Dunston2020Identification; SánchezJiménez2019Polyamines). SMOX is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain and bone marrow, indicating its importance in these areas (SánchezJiménez2019Polyamines).

In healthy human cells, SMOX activity contributes to cellular redox balance by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the production of hydrogen peroxide. This regulation is vital for preventing oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Perrone2023Spermine; SánchezJiménez2019Polyamines). The enzyme's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular processes, including gene expression and energy metabolism (SánchezJiménez2019Polyamines).

SMOX's role in polyamine catabolism is interconnected with other metabolic pathways, highlighting its significance in maintaining the balance of polyamines, which are involved in numerous cellular functions (Dunston2020Identification). The precise regulation of SMOX activity is crucial to prevent the accumulation of toxic byproducts and ensure normal cellular function (Dunston2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMOX gene, which encodes spermine oxidase, have been implicated in various diseases. In fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma (FN-RMS), low levels of SMOX are associated with a poor prognosis. The downregulation of SMOX in FN-RMS cells, particularly in high-risk tumors, is linked to increased tumorigenic features. Forced expression of SMOX in these cells leads to increased DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the sensitivity of FN-RMS cells to irradiation (Perrone2023Spermine).

In neurological contexts, overexpression of SMOX in cerebrocortical neurons of transgenic mice results in astrocyte dysfunction and increased susceptibility to epileptic seizures. This is due to oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, highlighting the role of SMOX in conditions characterized by increased oxidative stress (Marcoli2022Transgenic).

In skeletal muscle pathophysiology, SMOX expression is altered in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Changes in SMOX expression affect polyamine metabolism, which is crucial for muscle health and may contribute to disease progression (Cervelli2018Skeletal; ReinosoSánchez2020Emerging).

## Interactions
Spermine oxidase (SMOX) is an enzyme involved in the polyamine catabolic pathway, primarily catalyzing the oxidation of spermine to spermidine. SMOX interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and oxidative stress. The enzyme's activity is modulated by its interactions with substrates and inhibitors. For instance, SMOX forms a complex with the selective allosteric inhibitor JNJ-1289, which stabilizes a loop near the active site entrance, resulting in a unique U-shaped substrate-binding cavity. This interaction involves several hydrogen bonds and π-stacking interactions, contributing to the inhibitor's high selectivity for SMOX (Diaz2022Structure).

SMOX also interacts with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SAMNs) to form a biologically active nano-hybrid. This interaction is facilitated by the anchoring of SMOX to the SAMN surface through His-tags, exploiting the exposed iron (III) sites on the nanoparticles. The resulting SAMN@SMOX complex preserves the enzyme's structure and enhances its catalytic activity, particularly at low salinity, due to electrostatic interactions (Rilievo2023Spermine). These interactions highlight the potential of SMOX in therapeutic applications, particularly in modulating enzyme function and enhancing catalytic efficiency.
