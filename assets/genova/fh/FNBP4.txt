# FNBP4

## Overview
FNBP4, or formin binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and dynamics. The protein, categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, features domains such as the SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. FNBP4 interacts with formin proteins, which are key regulators of actin filament assembly, thereby playing a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell cycle regulation, particularly during the M phase (Harada2007Genomewide; Nourashrafeddin2014The). Structural variations, such as tandem repeat mutations, can influence the protein's binding affinity and stability, impacting cellular processes (Wendt2022Phenomewide). Additionally, FNBP4 is implicated in cell adhesion and has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular architecture and function (Russo2008Fullterm).

## Structure
The FNBP4 (formin binding protein 4) gene encodes a protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, featuring domains such as the SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. The protein structure is influenced by tandem repeat (TR) mutations, particularly the contraction of the FNBP4-[GGT] N repeat. This contraction has minimal impact on the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein, as indicated by a mean ΔpLDDT score of 3.41. However, it significantly increases structural confidence in two proline-rich stretches, with mean ΔpLDDT scores of 17.47 and 21.32 for residues 709-728 and 902-915, respectively (Wendt2022Phenomewide).

The FNBP4 protein contains a binding pocket with two tryptophan-rich regions that interact with proline-rich sequences of formins. The presence of the FNBP4-[GGT] 2 mutation results in higher position error, suggesting decreased structural stability in this region (Wendt2022Phenomewide). This structural alteration may enhance the protein's affinity for formin, which is crucial for cytoskeletal formation (Wendt2022Phenomewide). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, contributing to its functional diversity. Splice variant isoforms of FNBP4 can lead to structural variations, affecting its interactions and functions.

## Function
FNBP4 (formin binding protein 4) is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and dynamics. It interacts with formin proteins, which are key regulators of actin filament assembly, to maintain cell shape, motility, and division (Nourashrafeddin2014The). FNBP4 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular dynamics and structural integrity by influencing the formation and stability of actin filaments (Nourashrafeddin2014The).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, FNBP4 is associated with the M phase, where its expression is significantly upregulated, suggesting a role in cell cycle progression or mitosis (Harada2007Genomewide). The protein's interaction with formin is crucial for cytoskeletal formation, and mutations in FNBP4 can lead to structural changes that may affect its binding affinity with formin, potentially impacting cellular processes (Wendt2022Phenomewide).

FNBP4 also plays a role in cell adhesion, as indicated by its association with specific Gene Ontology terms related to this process (Russo2008Fullterm). This involvement in cell adhesion further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the FNBP4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and developmental disorders. FNBP4 plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling pathways, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions. Disruptions in these processes can lead to abnormal cell growth and division, contributing to the development of cancer. Alterations in FNBP4 expression levels may affect the stability and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, potentially leading to increased invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells.

In addition to cancer, FNBP4 mutations or dysregulation may be associated with developmental disorders. The gene's involvement in cellular structure and signaling suggests that any disruption could impact normal developmental processes, potentially resulting in congenital anomalies or other developmental issues. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which FNBP4 alterations contribute to these conditions is an area of ongoing research, with the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets and strategies for intervention. Insights into the gene's role in disease mechanisms could lead to improved diagnostic and treatment options for affected individuals.

## Interactions
FNBP4 (formin binding protein 4) is involved in interactions that are crucial for cytoskeletal dynamics. It binds with formins, which are proteins that play a significant role in actin filament formation. The interaction between FNBP4 and formins is essential for cytoskeletal formation, as changes in the tandem repeat of FNBP4 can affect this interaction by potentially destabilizing formin-binding sites. This destabilization may increase the affinity for formin, thereby influencing cytoskeletal dynamics (Wendt2022Phenomewide).

The structural effects of tandem repeat variations in FNBP4, specifically the contraction of the FNBP4-[GGT]N repeat, have been shown to impact the protein's three-dimensional structure. This contraction is associated with increased structural confidence in two proline-rich stretches, which are important for the interaction with tryptophan-rich regions in the FNBP4 binding pocket. These regions interact with proline-rich sequences of formins, suggesting that tandem repeat variations may affect FNBP4's ability to interact with other proteins, particularly those with proline-rich sequences (Wendt2022Phenomewide).

In breast cancer tissues, FNBP4 expression is similar to that in normal tissues, indicating no significant difference in expression levels. However, the specific physical interactions of FNBP4 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Nourashrafeddin2014The).
