# RPP30

## Overview
RPP30 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30, a protein integral to the function of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RMRP) complexes. These complexes are essential for the processing of precursor tRNA molecules, a critical step in the maturation of tRNAs necessary for protein synthesis. The RPP30 protein is characterized by its TIM-barrel fold, which facilitates its interaction with pre-tRNA and contributes to the structural stability of the RNase P complex (Wu2022New). As a highly conserved protein, RPP30 forms a heterodimer with the Pop5 protein, enhancing the catalytic activity of RNase P and playing a pivotal role in RNA processing within the nucleolus (Wu2022New; JARROUS2002Human). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance, with mutations or alterations in RPP30 linked to several diseases, including systemic sclerosis and certain cancers (Wu2022New; Shaukat2021The).

## Structure
The RPP30 protein is a subunit of the human ribonuclease P complex, which is involved in tRNA processing. It is highly conserved and forms part of the palm module in the protein clamp structure. The RPP30 protein adopts a TIM-barrel fold, which stabilizes its structure and enhances its interaction with pre-tRNA, promoting the formation of a native fold necessary for its function (Wu2022New). 

In terms of quaternary structure, RPP30 is part of a complex that includes one RNA subunit and ten conserved proteins. It forms a heterodimer with the Pop5 protein, which is essential for the catalytic activity of RNase P. This complex increases the affinity of the holoenzyme for Mg2+ and protects the RNase P RNA's catalytic domain from cleavage (Wu2022New). The RPP30 protein subunit is homologous to RNase P protein subunits in archaea and other eukaryotes, indicating its conserved nature (Wu2022New). However, the secondary and tertiary structures of RPP30 have not been fully analyzed, and specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context (Wu2022New).

## Function
The RPP30 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RMRP) complexes, which are involved in the processing of precursor tRNA molecules. This processing is essential for the maturation of tRNAs, which are necessary for protein synthesis in cells (Wu2022New; Eder1997Characterization). RPP30 functions by forming a heterodimer with Pop5, which is critical for pre-tRNA cleavage, a key step in tRNA maturation (Wu2022New).

RPP30 is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to RNA processing and the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes (JARROUS2002Human). It is also involved in the regulation of holoenzyme activity and nuclear localization, playing a role in the formation of the polynuclease P complex and the ribonuclease MRP complex, which are necessary for RNA polymerase III gene transcription (Wu2022New).

The protein is highly conserved across various organisms, indicating its fundamental role in basic life processes. In humans, RPP30 interacts with several other protein subunits to stabilize the structure and enhance the affinity of pre-tRNA of RNase P (Wu2022New).

## Clinical Significance
The RPP30 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations, expression alterations, or interactions. In Drosophila, mutations in RPP30 can lead to sterility by affecting tRNA processing, causing transcription-replication conflicts and DNA replication stress. This results in the activation of DNA duplication checkpoint proteins and impacts piRNA transcription, which is crucial for germline cell genome defense (Wu2022New; Shaukat2021The). In humans, anti-RPP30 antibodies are associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and may indicate a lower risk of cancer but a higher risk of severe lung diseases (Wu2022New). In cancer, RPP30 is linked to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through its rearrangement with the NPM1 gene, and its expression levels are correlated with cancer-related pathways in glioblastoma and gastric cancer. High RPP30 expression is associated with lower overall survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer, suggesting its role in cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression (Wu2022New). Additionally, RPP30 is considered essential for cell survival, as it limits homozygous deletions in cancer genomes, indicating its critical role in cellular processes (Pertesi2019Essential).

## Interactions
RPP30 is a protein subunit of the human ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex, which is involved in the maturation of tRNA molecules. It interacts directly with the RNA subunit of RNase P, known as H1 RNA, as well as with several other protein subunits within the complex. These interactions have been confirmed through genetic and biochemical methods, including yeast three-hybrid assays and UV crosslinking studies (JIANG2001Protein–RNA; Reiner2011RNA).

RPP30 is part of a heteropentamer complex in human RNase P, which includes the RPP20-RPP25 heterodimer, Pop5-RPP14-(RPP30)2-RPP40 heteropentamer, and RPP21-RPP29-RPP38 heterotrimer. Within this structure, RPP30 forms a palm module in the protein clamp, with two RPP30 molecules binding to the central POP5-RPP14 from opposite sides, creating a TIM barrel fold (Wu2022New).

RPP30 also interacts with other protein subunits such as RPP14, RPP20, RPP21, RPP25, RPP29, RPP38, RPP40, Pop1, and Pop5. It forms a heterodimer with Pop5, which is crucial for the assembly and function of RNase P, enhancing the affinity for Mg2+ and protecting the RNA subunit from cleavage (Wu2022New).
