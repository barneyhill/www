# HOXD13

## Overview
HOXD13 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D13 protein, a member of the homeobox transcription factor family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation and differentiation of limbs and digits. As a transcription factor, homeobox D13 is involved in DNA binding and the regulation of developmental pathways, including those related to skeletogenesis and cell cycle progression (Salsi2009HOXD13; Cantile2009HOX). Mutations in the HOXD13 gene are linked to various limb malformations, such as synpolydactyly, due to disruptions in its transcriptional regulatory functions (Kurban2011A; Fantini2008A). The protein's interactions with other signaling molecules, such as Smad proteins, further underscore its role in modulating developmental processes and maintaining skeletal integrity (Zhang2023A; Williams2005Group).

## Structure
The HOXD13 protein is a member of the homeobox transcription factor family, characterized by a conserved homeodomain responsible for DNA binding. The primary structure of HOXD13 includes a homeodomain located in the C-terminal region, encoded by the second exon, which is highly conserved and crucial for its function (Brison2013Joining; Akarsu1996Genomic). The protein also contains a polyalanine tract in the N-terminal region, encoded by the first exon, which is significant for its structural and functional properties (Brison2013Joining; Muragaki1996Altered).

The secondary structure of HOXD13 likely involves alpha helices, typical of homeodomain proteins, which often form helix-turn-helix motifs. The tertiary structure details are less defined, but the homeodomain's role in DNA binding suggests a compact and stable configuration. Quaternary structure information is limited, but homeodomain proteins can form dimers, which may be relevant for HOXD13's function.

Mutations in the polyalanine tract, such as expansions, are associated with synpolydactyly (SPD), affecting the protein's conformation and function (Muragaki1996Altered; Goodman1997Synpolydactyly). These mutations can lead to misfolding and cytoplasmic aggregation, impacting the protein's ability to enter the nucleus and perform its transcriptional regulatory roles (Brison2013Joining).

## Function
The HOXD13 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. HOXD13 is involved in the initiation of DNA replication by binding to DNA replication origins and promoting the recruitment of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) proteins, such as CDC6, Orc1, and Mcm7. This binding facilitates origin licensing, a critical step for DNA synthesis initiation (Salsi2009HOXD13). The interaction of HOXD13 with geminin, a replication inhibitor, suggests a regulatory mechanism where HOXD13 can counteract geminin's effects, preventing the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase and promoting cell cycle progression (Salsi2009HOXD13).

HOXD13 is also part of the HOX gene family, which is essential for the development of the skeletal system, particularly in limb and digit formation. It activates pathways like the Wnt5a signaling pathway, crucial for skeletogenesis and cell polarity in growth plates (Bondos2020Contextdependent). In the nucleus, HOXD13 binds DNA to regulate gene expression involved in morphogenesis and differentiation, maintaining proper skeletal development and limb formation (Cantile2009HOX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXD13 gene are associated with a range of limb malformations, most notably synpolydactyly (SPD), a condition characterized by the fusion of digits and the presence of extra digits. SPD is often linked to polyalanine expansions in the HOXD13 gene, which act as dominant negative mutations, disrupting normal protein function and leading to limb malformations (Kurban2011A; Fantini2008A). Nonframeshifting indel mutations in the polyalanine repeat region of HOXD13 have been identified in Chinese families, causing either synpolydactyly or polydactyly by altering the length of polyalanine repeats, which affects the transcription factor activity of the protein (Zu2021Nonframeshifting).

Missense mutations, such as G220V and R306L, have also been implicated in SPD. The G220V mutation affects the transcriptional regulation domain of HOXD13, leading to a variant form of SPD with unique phenotypic features like clinodactyly and partial digit duplication (Fantini2008A). The R306L mutation promotes osteoclast differentiation and bone loss, further contributing to the severity of SPD (Zhang2023A). These mutations highlight the phenotypic heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance associated with HOXD13-related limb malformations (Kurban2011A).

## Interactions
HOXD13 is known to interact with various Smad proteins, which are involved in the BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways. Specifically, HOXD13 interacts with the MH2 domain of Smad5, as well as with Smad1 and Smad2, but not with Smad4. These interactions occur independently of HOXD13's DNA-binding capability and can modulate Smad transcriptional activation functions (Williams2005Group). The interaction between HOXD13 and Smad proteins has been confirmed in mammalian cells through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, supporting the findings from yeast two-hybrid assays (Williams2005Group).

A novel mutation in the HOXD13 gene has been shown to affect its interaction with phosphorylated Smad5 (pSmad5), leading to increased osteoclast differentiation. This mutation reduces the interaction between HOXD13 and pSmad5, resulting in more free pSmad5, which is involved in the induction of Rank, c-Fos, and phosphorylated p65 expression. These changes contribute to the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone loss (Zhang2023A). The mutation also enhances the phosphorylation of Smad5, further influencing the regulatory axis involving pSmad5, p65, c-Fos, and Rank (Zhang2023A).
