# HSD17B7

## Overview
The HSD17B7 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 7, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme is integral to both steroid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis, performing critical functions such as the conversion of estrone to estradiol and the reduction of zymosterone to zymosterol (Mindnich2004The; Breitling200117βhydroxysteroid). Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 7 is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues, the liver, and the developing brain, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and supporting essential cellular processes (Pleshinger2022Inhibition; Breitling200117βhydroxysteroid). The enzyme's activity is crucial for mitochondrial function and the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, underscoring its importance in the central nervous system (Xu2021HSD17B7). Additionally, HSD17B7's involvement in breast cancer and its regulation by various transcription factors highlight its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Shehu2011The; Ohnesorg2006Transcriptional).

## Structure
The HSD17B7 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 7, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. The primary structure of the protein consists of 334 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 37,317 Da (Nokelainen1998Expression). The enzyme features a typical glycine pattern and specific amino acid residues, including Ser 180, Tyr 193, and Lys 197, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Nokelainen1998Expression).

The secondary structure includes a β-α-β Rossmann fold, which is involved in nucleotide cofactor binding (Nokelainen1998Expression). The enzyme also contains a hydrophobic region that suggests a membrane-spanning domain, indicating its membrane-associated character (Nokelainen1998Expression).

Post-translational modifications of HSD17B7 include four N-glycosylation sites, three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, which may influence the protein's function and stability (Nokelainen1998Expression). The enzyme does not have reported splice variant isoforms in the provided context. The protein's structure and modifications suggest its involvement in estrogen biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism (Breitling200117βhydroxysteroid).

## Function
The HSD17B7 gene encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7, which plays a crucial role in both steroid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of estrone, an inactive estrogen, to estradiol, a biologically active form, thus regulating estrogen activity in the body (Mindnich2004The; Breitling200117βhydroxysteroid). HSD17B7 also exhibits 3-ketosteroid reductase activity, converting zymosterone to zymosterol, which is a key step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (Mindnich2004The). This dual functionality highlights its importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.

The enzyme is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues such as the breast, ovary, and placenta, as well as in the liver and developing brain, which are critical sites for cholesterol synthesis (Breitling200117βhydroxysteroid). In the context of cell biology, HSD17B7 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the production of cholesterol precursors necessary for various cellular functions (Pleshinger2022Inhibition). The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper functioning of cellular processes, including the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which are vital for myelination in the central nervous system (Pleshinger2022Inhibition; Xu2021HSD17B7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HSD17B7 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. The gene is crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis, and its deficiency can lead to significant metabolic disruptions. In knockout mouse models, the absence of HSD17B7 results in embryonic lethality due to a blockage in fetal cholesterol synthesis, which is not compensated by maternal cholesterol supply. This suggests that HSD17B7 is essential for neuroectodermal survival and cardiovascular differentiation during embryonic development (Saloniemi2011The).

In humans, variations in the HSD17B7 gene have been studied in the context of breast cancer susceptibility. Although no high-penetrance mutations were identified, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene have been associated with modest risks of breast cancer in French Canadian families with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer (Plourde2009Analysis). The study of these genetic variants aims to understand their potential role in cancer predisposition, although larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these associations (Plourde2009Analysis).

HSD17B7's role in cholesterol biosynthesis also suggests it could be a candidate gene for inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism, potentially contributing to conditions like Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (Saloniemi2011The).

## Interactions
HSD17B7 is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in breast cancer cells and cholesterol biosynthesis. In breast cancer cells, HSD17B7 interacts with the prolactin (PRL) receptor, which stabilizes the enzyme and enhances its activity in converting estrone to estradiol. This interaction suggests that HSD17B7 may be a common molecule used by both PRL and estradiol to promote breast tumorigenesis (Shehu2011The). The transcriptional regulation of the HSD17B7 gene involves the recruitment of nuclear factor 1 (NF1) to its promoter region, which is essential for estradiol-mediated up-regulation. Estradiol stimulates the binding of NF1 and estrogen receptor α (ERα) to the promoter, highlighting a mechanism where NF1 plays a significant role in the gene's regulation (Shehu2011The).

In the context of cholesterol biosynthesis, HSD17B7 is regulated by several transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), SP1, and NF-Y, which bind to its promoter region. These interactions are crucial for the gene's transcriptional activity and its role in cholesterol biosynthesis (Ohnesorg2006Transcriptional). The enzyme is also involved in a post-translational pathway mediated by Pex19 and Pex3, which facilitates its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Leznicki2021Cotranslational).
