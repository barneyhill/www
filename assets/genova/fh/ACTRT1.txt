# ACTRT1

## Overview
The ACTRT1 gene encodes the actin-related protein T1 (ARP-T1), which is a member of the actin-related protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, cellular organelles that play a critical role in signal transduction and cellular movement. ARP-T1 localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium and is essential for ciliogenesis, interacting with various proteins to regulate ciliary structure and function (Park2021ARPT1associated). Additionally, ARP-T1 is implicated in the regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a key pathway in developmental processes (Park2021ARPT1associated). Mutations in the ACTRT1 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, such as Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Park2019ARPT1; Park2021ARPT1associated).

## Function
The ACTRT1 gene encodes the ARP-T1 protein, which plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia in healthy human cells. ARP-T1 localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium, where it regulates ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, by interacting with proteins involved in the ciliary machinery, such as septin 2 and components of the actin cytoskeleton network (Park2021ARPT1associated). This protein is essential for maintaining the normal length of primary cilia, and its absence can lead to defects in ciliary structure and function, which are characteristic of ciliopathies (Park2021ARPT1associated).

ARP-T1 is also involved in the regulation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, where it binds to the GLI1 promoter and inhibits GLI1 mRNA expression, suggesting a role in a SMO-independent HH pathway (Park2021ARPT1associated). The protein is active at the interface of the ciliary pocket or periciliary plasma membrane, which is crucial for the movement of the basal body to the plasma membrane and for vesicular and endosomal trafficking (Park2021ARPT1associated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTRT1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably acephalic spermatozoa syndrome and Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome (BDCS). Acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is a rare form of teratozoospermia characterized by spermatozoa that are mostly headless, leading to male infertility. Pathogenic variants such as c.95G>A:p.Arg32His and c.662A>G:p.Tyr221Cys have been identified in patients with this condition. These mutations are highly conserved and predicted to be deleterious, affecting the head-tail connection of sperm by interacting with centrioles (Sha2021Pathogenic).

Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by basal cell carcinoma, follicular atrophoderma, and ciliary defects. Mutations in ACTRT1, including the insertion mutation ACTRT1 547_548insA, lead to a truncated protein and loss of function, contributing to the pathogenesis of BDCS. This syndrome is considered a novel ciliopathy due to the role of ACTRT1 in ciliogenesis, with mutations resulting in shortened cilia and disrupted Hedgehog signaling pathways, which are crucial for normal cellular function and development (Park2019ARPT1; Park2021ARPT1associated). These findings highlight the critical role of ACTRT1 in maintaining normal cellular processes and its involvement in disease when mutated.

## Interactions
The ACTRT1 gene encodes the ARP-T1 protein, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for ciliogenesis. ARP-T1 interacts with several proteins associated with the structure and function of primary cilia, including acetylated-tubulin, TCP8, HSC70, BAG2, gamma-tubulin, EHD4, septin 2, and septin 9. These interactions have been confirmed through immunoblot analysis and proximity ligation assays (Park2019ARPT1; Park2021ARPT1associated). ARP-T1 localizes to the ciliary base and co-localizes with rootletin, a major basal body protein, forming a complex with gamma-tubulin near the basal body (Park2021ARPT1associated).

ARP-T1 is also involved in the regulation of the ciliary axoneme extension and interacts with the Chaperon containing TCP-1 (CCT/TRiC) complex, which is essential for folding proteins like actin and tubulin and assembling the BBSome complex. This complex is crucial for ciliogenesis as it regulates vesicle transport to the cilium (Park2021ARPT1associated). Additionally, ARP-T1 interacts with septin 2 and septin 9, which are involved in ciliary structure, with septin 2 localizing to the base of the axoneme and being crucial for cilium formation (Park2021ARPT1associated). These interactions highlight the role of ARP-T1 in maintaining ciliary structure and function, which is significant in preventing ciliopathies such as Bazex-Dupré-Christol Syndrome.
