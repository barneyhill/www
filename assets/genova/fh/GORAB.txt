# GORAB

## Overview
The GORAB gene encodes the golgin, RAB6 interacting protein, which is a crucial component of the Golgi apparatus involved in intracellular trafficking and protein modification. This protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein, playing a significant role in COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking, which is essential for maintaining Golgi integrity and ensuring proper glycosylation of proteins. GORAB interacts with small GTPases such as RAB6 and ARF5, facilitating its localization and function within the Golgi. Mutations in the GORAB gene can lead to disorders such as gerodermia osteodysplastica, characterized by skin and bone abnormalities due to impaired Golgi function and glycosylation processes (Egerer2015GORAB; Liu2021The).

## Structure
The GORAB protein, encoded by the GORAB gene, is associated with the Golgi apparatus and plays a role in intracellular trafficking. It contains a coiled-coil region, which is a structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions, spanning approximately 150 amino acids. This region is highly conserved and is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as Scyl1 and Sas6 (Munro2011The; Kovacs2017GORAB). 

GORAB features a Golgi Targeting Domain (GTD) within amino acids 200-277, which is essential for its localization to the Golgi. A missense mutation, p.Ala220Pro, within this domain disrupts Golgi localization, highlighting its importance (Kovacs2018Gorab). The protein also contains an 'internal Golgi-targeting RAB6 and ARF5 binding domain' (IGRAB), which facilitates its interaction with GTP-bound forms of RAB6 and ARF5, further supporting its role in Golgi localization (Frappaolo2020The).

GORAB functions as a scaffolding protein for COPI assembly at the trans-Golgi network, undergoing oligomerization and localizing to discrete puncta where it interacts with Scyl1. This interaction is necessary for recruiting the COPI complex to Golgi membranes (Frappaolo2020The). The protein's role in glycosylation involves maintaining the proper set of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi trans-cisterna (Frappaolo2020The).

## Function
The GORAB gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the function of the Golgi apparatus, particularly in intracellular trafficking and protein modification processes. In healthy human cells, GORAB is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network, where it interacts with small GTPases such as RAB6 and ARF5. These interactions are essential for Golgi targeting and function, facilitating the proper localization and trafficking of proteins within the cell (Egerer2015GORAB).

GORAB functions as a scaffolding protein for COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining Golgi integrity and ensuring the correct recycling of Golgi enzymes. This process is vital for the proper glycosylation of proteins, a key modification that affects protein stability and function (Frappaolo2020The; Liu2021The). In particular, GORAB is involved in the glycosylation of proteoglycans, which are important for the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and play a role in bone remodeling (Chan2018Impaired).

Mutations in GORAB can disrupt its interactions with RAB6 and ARF5, leading to impaired Golgi targeting and function, which can result in disorders such as gerodermia osteodysplastica, characterized by skin and bone abnormalities (Egerer2015GORAB; Liu2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GORAB gene are associated with gerodermia osteodysplastica (GO), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin laxity, osteoporosis, and facial dysmorphism. This condition is considered a segmental progeroid disorder due to its resemblance to aging-related changes (Egerer2015GORAB). The disease results from disruptions in the Golgi apparatus function, specifically affecting COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking and glycosylation processes. Mutations in GORAB lead to impaired proteoglycan glycosylation, which is crucial for collagen fibrillogenesis and bone integrity, resulting in bone fragility and abnormal osteoblast differentiation (Chan2018Impaired).

GORAB mutations disrupt its interactions with proteins such as Rab6 and ARF5, affecting its Golgi localization and function. This disruption leads to improper glycosylation and trafficking processes, contributing to the pathogenesis of GO (Egerer2015GORAB; Liu2021The). The condition is classified as a type II congenital disorder of glycosylation, with a milder clinical presentation compared to other COPI-tethering deficiencies (Ondruskova2021Congenital). Despite these mutations, no detectable changes in Golgi complex morphology have been observed (Bexiga2013Human).

## Interactions
The GORAB protein, also known as SCYL1BP1 or NTKLBP1, is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. It primarily interacts with the small GTPases RAB6 and ARF5 at the Golgi apparatus. These interactions are mediated through the IGRAB domain of GORAB, which is crucial for its Golgi targeting. GORAB specifically binds to the active, GTP-bound forms of RAB6 and ARF5, facilitating its role in Golgi-related transport processes (Egerer2015GORAB).

GORAB also interacts with ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and PIRH2, which localize to the nucleus or cytoplasm, indicating a potential role in protein ubiquitination pathways (Egerer2015GORAB). In Drosophila, GORAB forms a complex with Sas6, a protein involved in centriole duplication, highlighting its role in centrosome function. This interaction is mediated through a specific domain within GORAB, termed the Sas6-interacting-domain (SID), which overlaps with its Golgi Targeting Domain (Kovacs2018Gorab; Kovacs2017GORAB).

GORAB is also associated with components of the COPI coatomer complex, suggesting a role in retrograde vesicle transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (Kovacs2017GORAB). These interactions underscore GORAB's multifaceted role in cellular transport and structural processes.
