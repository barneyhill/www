# CDCA5

## Overview
Cell division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) is a gene that encodes the protein Sororin, which is integral to the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. Sororin is a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion by stabilizing the cohesin complex on chromatin, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability during cell division. This stabilization is crucial for the proper alignment and separation of chromosomes, preventing chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy. CDCA5's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic integrity, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal development. Additionally, CDCA5 has been implicated in cancer progression, with its altered expression linked to various malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xiong2024CDCA5; Chen2019CDCA5).

## Structure


## Function
CDCA5, also known as Sororin, is a protein that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is essential for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion by stabilizing the cohesin complex on chromatin. This stabilization is crucial for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division, thereby maintaining genomic stability. CDCA5 is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the proper alignment and separation of chromosomes, preventing errors that could lead to aneuploidy or other chromosomal abnormalities. The protein's function in stabilizing the cohesin complex is vital for the cohesion of sister chromatids, which is necessary for their correct attachment to the spindle apparatus and subsequent segregation into daughter cells. By ensuring the fidelity of chromosome segregation, CDCA5 contributes to the overall genomic integrity of dividing cells, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
CDCA5, also known as Sororin, is implicated in the progression of various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CDCA5 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor size and number. It promotes oncogenesis by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through the AKT pathway (Chen2019CDCA5; Li2021CDCA123578). In prostate cancer, high CDCA5 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with higher initial PSA levels, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of CDCA5 reduces cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression via the ERK signaling pathway (Ji2021CDCA5).

In breast cancer, CDCA5 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and promotes tumor growth by facilitating the binding of E2F1 to the FOXM1 promoter, enhancing FOXM1 expression. This interaction is crucial for the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells and is mediated through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Xiong2024CDCA5). CDCA5 is also upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where it is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and poor survival outcomes. Its knockdown enhances the DNA damage response, leading to increased apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation (Huang2021Loss). These findings suggest that CDCA5 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CDCA5, also known as Sororin, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cancer progression and cell cycle regulation. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CDCA5 interacts with Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 1 Alpha 1 (EEF1A1). This interaction is significant for the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes tumor growth. Although CDCA5 knockdown does not affect EEF1A1 expression, EEF1A1 overexpression can counteract the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and migration caused by CDCA5 knockdown, indicating that EEF1A1 mediates CDCA5's impact on ccRCC cells (Wang2024CDCA5EEF1A1).

In breast cancer, CDCA5 facilitates the binding of the transcription factor E2F1 to the FOXM1 promoter, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing CDCA5's interaction with E2F1, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirming E2F1 recruitment to the FOXM1 promoter. CDCA5 overexpression enhances this process, indicating its role in promoting the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells through the E2F1-FOXM1 axis (Xiong2024CDCA5).
