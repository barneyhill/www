# PLVAP

## Overview
PLVAP, or plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein, is a gene that encodes a type II integral membrane glycoprotein involved in the formation of diaphragms within endothelial cells. The protein, also referred to as PLVAP, plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular permeability and homeostasis by forming structures such as fenestral and stomatal diaphragms. These diaphragms are essential for regulating the selective permeability of molecules across the endothelial barrier, thereby influencing nutrient exchange, leukocyte migration, and vascular permeability (Denzer2023The). PLVAP is predominantly expressed in fenestrated endothelia found in organs such as the lungs, kidneys, and spleen, and its absence can lead to increased permeability and physiological abnormalities (Herrnberger2012The; Denzer2023The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as neuropilin-1 and integrins, further underscore its significance in endothelial cell function and its potential as a therapeutic target in various pathological conditions, including cancer and protein-losing enteropathy (Nakakura2021Fibronectinintegrin; Denzer2023The).

## Structure
PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 55-65 kDa. It is characterized by a short intracellular domain consisting of 27 amino acids, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain comprising 380 amino acids (Denzer2023The). The intracellular domain includes a putative caveolin-1 binding domain, which may facilitate interactions with other cellular components. The extracellular domain is highly conserved and features four N-glycosylation sites, two coiled-coil domains, and a proline-rich region near the C-terminus (Denzer2023The).

PLVAP forms homodimers that contribute to the formation of radial fibrils, which are organized in an octagonal wheel-like symmetry. These fibrils are crucial for the formation of fenestral diaphragms (FDs) or sinusoidal diaphragms (SDs) in endothelial cells. The extracellular tail of these fibrils interweaves in a central mesh, while the intracellular tail anchors them within the cell membrane, potentially binding directly to the cytoskeleton or via linker molecules (Denzer2023The). Glycosylation near the transmembrane domain prevents the collapse of PLVAP on the extracellular side, maintaining its structural integrity (Denzer2023The).

## Function
PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle associated protein) is a critical component in endothelial cells, where it is involved in the formation of diaphragms within endothelial microdomains such as caveolae, fenestrae, and transendothelial channels. These structures are essential for regulating nutrient exchange, leukocyte migration, and vascular permeability (Denzer2023The). PLVAP is the only known protein component of these diaphragms and plays a significant role in maintaining vascular permeability and homeostasis. In healthy human cells, PLVAP is crucial for the development of the cardiovascular system and postnatal physiological processes, including maintaining blood composition and organ homeostasis (Denzer2023The).

PLVAP is primarily expressed in fenestrated endothelia, such as those found in the lungs, kidneys, spleen, endocrine glands, and digestive tract. It is essential for the formation of fenestral diaphragms (FDs) and stomatal diaphragms (SDs), which regulate the selective permeability of molecules across the endothelial barrier (Denzer2023The). In the absence of PLVAP, increased permeability for plasma proteins is observed, allowing them to pass through the fenestrated endothelial layer (Denzer2023The). This protein is also involved in the high hydraulic conductivity of Schlemm's canal, necessary for the flow of aqueous humor in the eye (Herrnberger2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLVAP gene are associated with severe syndromic protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), characterized by excessive protein loss due to compromised endothelial barrier function. This condition is marked by symptoms such as secretory diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, severe hypoalbuminemia, and hypoproteinemia, often leading to multiorgan failure and death. A specific mutation, PLVAP 1072C>T p.Arg358*, introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein and loss of diaphragms in endothelial fenestrae, which are crucial for maintaining vascular integrity (Elkadri2015Mutations; Broekaert2018Mutations).

Alterations in PLVAP expression are linked to various pathological conditions. Overexpression of PLVAP is observed in diseases such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and ischemic brain disease, where it contributes to barrier disruption and increased vascular permeability. This upregulation can lead to pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory responses, making PLVAP a potential therapeutic target in cancer therapy (Denzer2023The). In PLVAP knockout mice, the absence of the protein results in prenatal death and severe physiological abnormalities, underscoring its critical role in vascular development and stability (Herrnberger2012Lack; Denzer2023The).

## Interactions
PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in endothelial cell function and vascular permeability. It physically interacts with neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a co-receptor involved in VEGFR2 signaling, which may stabilize the VEGFR2/NRP-1 complex and enhance VEGFR2 signaling, potentially creating a positive feedback loop that affects vascular permeability (Bosma2018The; Denzer2023The). PLVAP also interacts with vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein, which may influence its role in transcytosis and molecular exchange (Bosma2018The).

In the context of cholangiocarcinoma, PLVAP is upregulated through the DKK1/CKAP4/PI3K signaling pathway. DKK1, secreted by cancer cells, binds to CKAP4, leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequent upregulation of PLVAP, which enhances angiogenesis (Wang2021Plasmalemma). This interaction highlights PLVAP's role in tumor angiogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

PLVAP's interactions with integrins, particularly integrin α5β1, are crucial for its localization at endothelial fenestrae. This interaction is regulated by fibronectin-integrin signaling, which affects PLVAP distribution and function in endothelial cells (Nakakura2021Fibronectinintegrin).
