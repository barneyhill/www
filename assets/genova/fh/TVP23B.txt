# TVP23B

## Overview
The TVP23B gene encodes the trans-Golgi network vesicle protein 23 homolog B, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and regulating host-microbe interactions. This protein is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the intestine, particularly within the crypts, and is essential for the proper functioning of Paneth and goblet cells. TVP23B is involved in the glycosylation processes within the Golgi apparatus, influencing the glycosylation of mucins such as MUC2, which are vital for forming a protective mucus layer in the intestine. The protein interacts with the Golgi protein YIPF6 to regulate the Golgi proteome, including glycosyltransferases necessary for core-3 O-glycosylation, thereby maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier and protecting against gastrointestinal infections and conditions like colitis (Song2023TransGolgi).

## Function
The TVP23B gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and regulating host-microbe interactions. It is highly expressed in the epithelial cell layer of the intestine, particularly in the crypts, and plays a significant role in the function of Paneth and goblet cells. TVP23B is involved in the glycosylation processes within the Golgi apparatus, specifically affecting the glycosylation of mucins like MUC2, which are essential for forming a protective mucus layer in the intestine (Song2023TransGolgi).

The protein interacts with another Golgi protein, YIPF6, to regulate the Golgi proteome, including glycosyltransferases such as B3GNT6, which are critical for core-3 O-glycosylation. This glycosylation is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier, preventing excessive host-microbe interactions, and protecting against gastrointestinal infections and conditions like colitis (Song2023TransGolgi).

In TVP23B-deficient models, there is a notable decrease in glycosylation enzymes, leading to a thinner and more penetrable mucus layer, increased intestinal permeability, and a higher number of tissue-associated bacteria (Song2023TransGolgi).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TVP23B gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to colitis, particularly ulcerative colitis, due to defects in mucus glycosylation. These defects result in a compromised intestinal barrier, leading to increased microbial colonization and inflammation. A specific mutation, a G > T transversion in intron 1, causes exon 1 skipping, which has been associated with colitis in mice models (Song2023TransGolgi). TVP23B deficiency affects the glycosylation of mucins, particularly core-3 O-glycosylation, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the mucus layer and preventing microbial penetration (Song2023TransGolgi). 

The gene's role in glycosylation is further underscored by its interaction with the Golgi protein YIPF6, which is necessary for the stability and expression of glycosyltransferases like B3GNT6. This interaction is critical for proper glycosylation processes and maintaining the intestinal barrier (Song2023TransGolgi). 

In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, a mutation in TVP23B has been specifically associated with ulcerative colitis, highlighting its clinical significance in inflammatory bowel disease (Song2023TransGolgi). These findings suggest that TVP23B plays a non-redundant role in intestinal health, and its mutations or altered expression can lead to significant gastrointestinal disorders.

## Interactions
TVP23B, a trans-Golgi network vesicle protein, interacts with the Golgi protein YIPF6. This interaction is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, where HA-tagged TVP23B was immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged YIPF6 from co-transfected cells. Endogenous TVP23B also binds YIPF6 in goblet cell lines. YIPF6 is necessary for the stability of TVP23B, as Yipf6-deficient animals show decreased levels of TVP23B in colonocytes (Song2023TransGolgi).

The interaction between TVP23B and YIPF6 plays a significant role in regulating the Golgi proteome, particularly in the context of glycosylation. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals significant changes in the Golgi proteome of Tvp23b and Yipf6-deficient animals, with a notable reduction in glycosyltransferases and other proteins critical for glycosylation (Song2023TransGolgi). This interaction is essential for the regulation of the Golgi proteome, including the glycosyltransferase B3GNT6, which is crucial for core-3 O-glycosylation of MUC2, a key mucin (Song2023TransGolgi). The cooperative role of TVP23B and YIPF6 is vital for maintaining the composition of Golgi enzymes, which are essential for intestinal barrier function (Song2023TransGolgi).
