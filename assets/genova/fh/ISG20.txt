# ISG20

## Overview
ISG20 is a gene that encodes the interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 protein, which is a crucial component of the innate immune response. The protein functions as a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease, primarily targeting single-stranded RNA and, to a lesser extent, single-stranded DNA, thereby playing a significant role in RNA and DNA metabolism (Nguyen2001The). As an interferon-stimulated protein, ISG20 is involved in the antiviral response, particularly against RNA viruses, by degrading viral RNA to inhibit replication (Espert2003ISG20). The protein is localized in the nucleus, including the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, where it participates in rRNA processing and contributes to genomic stability (Zheng2017Interferonstimulated). ISG20's interactions with viral components and its ability to modulate RNA stability underscore its importance in both antiviral defense and cellular RNA regulation (Wu2019The).

## Function
ISG20 encodes a protein that functions as a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease, primarily degrading single-stranded RNA and, to a lesser extent, single-stranded DNA. This activity is crucial for its role in RNA and DNA metabolism within human cells (Nguyen2001The). The protein is part of the interferon-induced antiviral response, targeting viral RNA to inhibit replication, particularly against RNA viruses such as the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Espert2003ISG20). ISG20's exonuclease activity is dependent on Mn2+ ions and is optimal at a pH of around 7.0, with a preference for RNA substrates over DNA (Nguyen2001The).

In healthy human cells, ISG20 is involved in the regulation of RNA stability and turnover, potentially contributing to the degradation of cellular mRNAs as part of interferon and estrogen signaling (Nguyen2001The). The protein is localized in the nucleus, including the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, and is involved in rRNA processing (Zheng2017Interferonstimulated). ISG20's activity in these cellular compartments suggests a role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating transcriptional processes (Nguyen2001The). Its ability to discriminate between self and non-self mRNAs during translation further highlights its function in the innate immune response (Wu2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ISG20 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in cancer and viral infections. In cancer, ISG20 expression is significantly increased in several types, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), breast cancer, and various other tumors. High ISG20 expression is associated with poor prognosis in glioma and GBM, where it correlates with increased tumor grade and immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages and neutrophils, which may contribute to tumor progression and immune evasion (Gao2018ISG20; Jiang2022InterferonStimulated). In breast cancer, elevated ISG20 expression is linked to an aggressive metastatic phenotype, with higher levels observed in metastatic tissues compared to primary tumors (Alsheikh2021Disruption).

ISG20 also plays a role in the immune response to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Its expression is linked to reduced vulnerability to viral invasion in cancer patients, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for enhancing antiviral defenses (Cheng2022The). The gene's expression is modulated by genetic and epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, which can influence its activity in different cancers (Jiang2022InterferonStimulated). These findings highlight ISG20's dual role in promoting tumor progression and providing antiviral defense, making it a significant focus for therapeutic research.

## Interactions
ISG20, an interferon-stimulated exonuclease, participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that contribute to its antiviral functions. It directly binds to the epsilon (ε) stem-loop structure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA, specifically targeting the lower stem region, which is crucial for its role in inhibiting HBV replication (Liu2017Interferon-inducible). This interaction is independent of its exonuclease activity, as demonstrated by the ISG20 D94G mutant, which can still bind to HBV RNA and inhibit pregenomic RNA encapsidation despite lacking enzymatic activity (Liu2017Interferon-inducible).

ISG20 also interacts with the nucleoprotein (NP) of the Influenza A virus (IAV), a component of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex. This interaction is essential for its antiviral activity against IAV, as the exonuclease-defective mutant ISG20-D94G does not associate with NP, indicating that exonuclease activity is necessary for this interaction (Qu2016Influenza).

Additionally, ISG20 interacts with the m6A reader protein YTHDF2, which binds to N6-methyladenosine modified HBV transcripts. This interaction is independent of HBV presence and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Imam2020Interferonstimulated). These interactions highlight ISG20's role in modulating viral RNA stability and replication.
