# C11orf86

## Overview
C11orf86 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 86, also referred to as the fasting-and CREB-H-induced (FACI) protein. This protein is categorized as a clathrin adaptor protein, playing a significant role in cholesterol homeostasis and endocytosis. FACI is involved in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) endocytosis through its interaction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex, which is crucial for its localization to clathrin-coated pits on plasma membranes (Cheng2023FACI). The gene has been implicated in various cancers, including bladder cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, where its expression levels are associated with disease prognosis and progression (Chen2020RNAseq; Chen2022A). Additionally, C11orf86 is involved in the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, indicating its potential role in stress-related liver diseases (Duan2021Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf86 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression levels associated with disease prognosis and progression. In bladder cancer, C11orf86 expression is significantly lower in patients with lymph node metastasis (LN+), suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. Lower expression levels of C11orf86 in LN+ patients are correlated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its clinical significance in predicting lymph node metastasis and survival in bladder cancer patients (Chen2022A).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), C11orf86 is among the genes associated with prognosis. Its expression is linked to hormone-related pathways, which are crucial in TNBC tumorigenesis. This association suggests that C11orf86 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in TNBC (Supplitt2024The; Chen2020RNAseq).

In the context of hepatocellular injury caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress, C11orf86 is down-regulated under stress conditions and up-regulated when CHOP, a stress-related transcription factor, is knocked down. This expression pattern suggests a role in the cellular response to stress, although its specific clinical implications in liver disease remain to be fully elucidated (Duan2021Exploring).

## Interactions
C11orf86, also known as the fasting-and CREB-H-induced (FACI) protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis and endocytosis. FACI is identified as a novel clathrin adaptor protein 2-binding protein, facilitating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) endocytosis by interacting with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex. This interaction is mediated by a conserved DxxxLI motif in FACI, which is essential for its localization to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) on plasma membranes. Disruption of this motif abolishes its CCP localization but does not affect its association with the plasma membrane (Cheng2023FACI).

FACI interacts with proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and the membrane cytoskeleton. It colocalizes with clathrin and clathrin adaptor proteins such as Dab2 and AP2 subunits AP2M1 and α-adaptin. The interaction with the AP2 complex is crucial for FACI's role in enhancing LDL uptake, as demonstrated by increased LDL uptake in FACI-overexpressed cells and impaired uptake in FACI-depleted cells (Cheng2023FACI).

Cholesterol loading affects the intracellular distribution of FACI, promoting its transport from the plasma membrane to the endocytic recycling compartment in a clathrin-dependent manner (Cheng2023FACI).
