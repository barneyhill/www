# OR8G5

## Overview
The OR8G5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily G member 5, which is part of the extensive G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily known for their role in the olfactory system, where they detect odor molecules and initiate signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Degli2021Exosomes). Beyond their traditional olfactory functions, olfactory receptors like OR8G5 are expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting additional roles in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and regeneration (Grison2014Mesencephalic). The gene has been implicated in clinical contexts, including kidney transplantation and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential significance in diverse biological and pathological processes (Pineda2017Novel; Logue2023Genetics). Despite its involvement in these areas, detailed interaction data for the OR8G5 protein remains limited, necessitating further research to elucidate its full range of functions and interactions.

## Function
The OR8G5 gene encodes the olfactory receptor 8G5, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons and play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in olfactory perception (Degli2021Exosomes).

Beyond their traditional role in the olfactory epithelium, olfactory receptors like OR8G5 are also expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting they may have additional functions. For instance, olfactory receptors are involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and regeneration, indicating a broader functional repertoire beyond olfaction (Grison2014Mesencephalic). In the context of sensitive skin, OR8G5 and other olfactory receptor genes are downregulated, which may be linked to disturbances in epidermal homeostasis, although it remains unclear whether this is a cause or consequence of sensitive skin (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

The expression of olfactory receptors in non-olfactory tissues, such as mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, suggests potential roles in processes like axonal convergence and sperm chemotaxis, highlighting their involvement in diverse cellular signaling pathways (Grison2014Mesencephalic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OR8G5 gene have been implicated in various medical conditions. In the context of kidney transplantation, OR8G5 has been associated with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). The gene contains two non-synonymous variants and one synonymous variant, which may lead to altered mRNA and protein expression, potentially triggering an antibody response and renal allograft rejection (Pineda2017Novel; Pineda2018Corrigendum:). These variants are thought to influence transplant outcomes through their association with the VWA5A gene, affecting circulating von Willebrand factor protein levels and impacting survival after organ transplantation (Pineda2017Novel; Pineda2018Corrigendum:).

OR8G5 has also been mentioned in studies related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A novel genome-wide significant association was found between OR8G5 and AD among APOE ε4 carriers, suggesting a potential link, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Logue2023Genetics). Despite this association, OR8G5 does not interact or co-express with the APP network, which is central to AD pathology (Elhawary2024Clinical).

In neuroblastoma, OR8G5 mutations have been considered for their potential relevance as tumor markers, although no direct association with neuroblastoma has been established (Degli2021Exosomes).

## Interactions
The human gene OR8G5, a member of the olfactory receptor family, is involved in odor detection through its role as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). While specific protein interactions for OR8G5 are not extensively documented, it is known that olfactory receptors, including OR8G5, typically interact with G proteins to transduce signals. These interactions are generally transient and involve the activation of signaling pathways upon binding to specific ligands. 

In the context of kidney transplants, OR8G5 has been identified with multiple genetic variants that may influence antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). The study by Pineda et al. suggests that mutations in genes like OR8G5 could lead to altered mRNA and protein expression, potentially triggering an antibody response and renal allograft rejection (Pineda2017Novel). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving OR8G5 in this context are not detailed.

Additionally, OR8G5 was detected as one of the missing proteins in the NCI60 cell lines, but the study notes that further validation is needed, and specific interactions of the OR8G5 protein are not provided (Guruceaga2017Enhanced). Overall, while OR8G5 is implicated in certain biological processes, detailed interaction data remains limited.
