# KBTBD4

## Overview
KBTBD4 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 4, which is a crucial component of the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB domain, a BACK domain, and a C-terminal KELCH-repeat propeller domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition (Yeo2024Asymmetric). KBTBD4 functions primarily as a substrate receptor, mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, such as the REST Corepressor (CoREST) and histone deacetylase HDAC1/2 complexes, thereby playing a significant role in cellular regulation and homeostasis (Yeo2024Asymmetric; Chen2022Diseaseassociated). Mutations in the KBTBD4 gene have been associated with various brain tumors, including medulloblastoma and pineal parenchymal tumors, where they contribute to tumorigenesis through altered protein interactions and degradation pathways (Lee2019Recurrent; Chen2022Diseaseassociated). These mutations highlight the potential of KBTBD4 as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment (Xie2024KBTBD4).

## Structure
The KBTBD4 protein is characterized by the presence of a Kelch domain, which includes six Kelch repeat motifs (I-VI) that form the blades of a β-propeller fold. This structural configuration is crucial for its function as it facilitates substrate binding. The protein also contains a BTB domain, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of ubiquitin ligase complexes (Chen2022Diseaseassociated).

Mutations in the KBTBD4 gene, such as KBTBD4 R313PRR and KBTBD4 P311PP, are located in the second Kelch repeat. These mutations are predicted to alter the substrate-binding loop in blade II, potentially supporting interactions with neo-substrates. The mutations cause a repositioning of the N-terminal wild-type residues into the substrate pocket, thereby modifying the substrate-binding surface (Chen2022Diseaseassociated).

The KBTBD4 protein is involved in the regulation of the Cullin RING ubiquitin Ligase 3 (CRL3) complex, where it acts as an adaptor protein. This role is facilitated by its structural domains, which enable the recruitment and ubiquitylation of substrates such as the REST Corepressor (CoREST) (Chen2022Diseaseassociated). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications and exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing.

## Function
KBTBD4 is a protein that functions as a substrate receptor within the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular regulation (Lee2019Recurrent). The protein contains a BTB domain, a central BACK domain, and a C-terminal KELCH-repeat propeller domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Yeo2024Asymmetric). In healthy cells, KBTBD4 is part of the CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which includes components like Cul3 and Rbx1, suggesting its role in substrate recognition and ubiquitylation (Chen2022Diseaseassociated).

KBTBD4 forms a dimeric complex that engages with histone deacetylase HDAC1, facilitating the degradation of HDAC1/2 complexes. This interaction is mediated by specific structural elements of KBTBD4, such as the b-hairpin of the KBTBD4-A loop and the KELCH-repeat domain of KBTBD4-B, which form interfaces with HDAC1 (Yeo2024Asymmetric). The protein's activity is enhanced by the molecular glue UM171, which stabilizes the interaction between KBTBD4 and HDAC1, promoting the degradation of CoREST complexes (Xie2024KBTBD4). This function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KBTBD4 gene have been implicated in several types of brain tumors, notably medulloblastoma and pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTID). In medulloblastoma, particularly in groups 3 and 4, KBTBD4 mutations are identified as primary genetic drivers. These mutations lead to neomorphic ubiquitylation activity, promoting the degradation of the REST Corepressor (CoREST), which is involved in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. This degradation results in significant transcriptional changes that enhance the stemness of cancer cells, contributing to tumorigenesis (Chen2022Diseaseassociated).

In PPTID, KBTBD4 mutations are characterized by recurrent small in-frame insertions, such as p.R313delinsPRR. These mutations are not found in pineoblastomas, which instead show mutations in DICER1 or deletions in DROSHA. The presence of KBTBD4 mutations in PPTID can be used diagnostically to distinguish it from pineoblastoma (Lee2019Recurrent; Yamashita2023Clinicopathologic).

The mutations in KBTBD4 also lead to the aberrant degradation of HDAC1/2 corepressor complexes, which is a potential target for therapeutic intervention using HDAC1/2 inhibitors (Xie2024KBTBD4). These findings suggest that KBTBD4 mutations play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these tumors and may offer avenues for targeted therapies.

## Interactions
KBTBD4 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly through its role as a substrate receptor in the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutations in KBTBD4, often found in medulloblastoma, lead to neomorphic interactions with the CoREST complex, resulting in its ubiquitylation and degradation. This interaction is facilitated by changes in the substrate-binding loop of the Kelch domain, allowing mutant KBTBD4 to bind CoREST, a capability not observed in the wild-type protein (Chen2022Diseaseassociated).

KBTBD4 also forms a homodimer through its BTB domain, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ligase. This dimeric structure allows KBTBD4 to engage with the HDAC1/2 corepressor complexes. The interaction is enhanced by the presence of molecular glues like UM171, which stabilize the binding between KBTBD4 and HDAC1, promoting the degradation of these complexes (Yeo2024Asymmetric).

Cryo-electron microscopy studies have shown that KBTBD4 mutants engage HDAC1 asymmetrically, with specific loops in the KBTBD4 structure interacting closely with the HDAC1 catalytic domain. These interactions are stabilized by inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), which acts as a molecular glue at the protein interface (Xie2024KBTBD4).
