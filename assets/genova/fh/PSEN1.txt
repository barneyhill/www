# PSEN1

## Overview
The PSEN1 gene encodes presenilin 1, a transmembrane protein that is a vital component of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in the proteolytic processing of several type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors. Presenilin 1 is characterized by its nine transmembrane domains and is essential for the catalytic activity of the γ-secretase complex, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways such as Notch and Wnt, impacting cell fate determination and differentiation (Vetrivel2006Pathological; Bagaria2022Genetics). Mutations in the PSEN1 gene are the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Bagaria2022Genetics). The protein's interactions with other components of the γ-secretase complex, as well as its involvement in calcium signaling and synaptic homeostasis, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and neuronal function (Verdile2006The; Bagaria2022Genetics).

## Structure
Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) is a protein that is a crucial component of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and other substrates. The primary structure of PSEN1 includes multiple transmembrane domains, specifically nine helical transmembrane segments, with the N-terminus being hydrophilic and flexible, located in the cytosol, and the C-terminus either embedded within the lumenal face of the lipid bilayer or protruding into the lumen or extracellular space (Li2014Structural). 

The secondary structure of PSEN1 is characterized by these transmembrane helices, with TM6 and TM7 each containing one of the two aspartyl residues required for its catalytic activity (Li2014Structural). The tertiary structure involves a complex folding pattern, with a significant hydrophilic loop between transmembrane helices TM6 and TM7, which is cleaved during PSEN1 maturation (Somavarapu2016The). 

In terms of quaternary structure, PSEN1 forms part of the γ-secretase complex, which is a hetero-tetrameric structure composed of presenilin, APH1, nicastrin, and PEN-2 (Li2014Structural). This complex has a bilobed structure with a head domain containing the ectodomain of nicastrin and a base domain with a central cavity and lateral cleft, facilitating substrate access to the catalytic site (Li2014Structural). 

Post-translational modifications of PSEN1 include phosphorylation, and the protein undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage into N- and C-terminal fragments during the assembly and maturation of the complex (Li2014Structural).

## Function
Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) is a critical component of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in the proteolytic processing of several type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors. This processing is essential for the generation of amyloid-β peptides and the regulation of cellular signaling pathways such as Notch and Wnt, which are crucial for cell fate determination and differentiation (Vetrivel2006Pathological; Bagaria2022Genetics).

PSEN1 is a transmembrane protein with nine domains and contains catalytic aspartic acids necessary for its γ-secretase activity. It interacts with other proteins in the γ-secretase complex, such as nicastrin, PEN2, and APH-1, to facilitate the transport and cleavage of APP fragments (Bagaria2022Genetics). Beyond APP processing, PSEN1 influences calcium signaling and synaptic homeostasis, impacting phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, which are vital for maintaining cellular functions in healthy human cells (Bagaria2022Genetics).

PSEN1 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in neuronal development and synaptic function. Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper neuronal function (Vetrivel2006Pathological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSEN1 gene are the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), often following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Over 300 mutations have been identified, which can lead to neurodegeneration through gain-of-function or loss-of-function mechanisms. These mutations often result in an elevated Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Bagaria2022Genetics). 

PSEN1 mutations can also lead to atypical phenotypes, including seizures, motor-behavioral dysfunctions, and conditions like spastic paraparesis and cotton wool plaques. The mutation location within the gene can influence the phenotype, with different symptoms associated with mutations in the N-terminal or C-terminal regions (Bagaria2022Genetics). 

Alterations in PSEN1 expression levels, such as hypomethylation, have been linked to increased PSEN1 mRNA expression in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role in disease progression (Monti2020CpG). Additionally, circular RNAs derived from PSEN1, like circPSEN1, are upregulated in Alzheimer's disease and may serve as potential biomarkers (Sanadgol2023Presenilin1Derived). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PSEN1 in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly within the gamma-secretase complex. PSEN1 interacts with nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, forming the active gamma-secretase complex responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce beta-amyloid peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Verdile2006The). PSEN1 also interacts with APP directly, forming stable complexes that are involved in the regulation of APP processing and amyloid-beta production (Xia1997Interaction).

PSEN1 is known to interact with subunits of the 20S proteasome, specifically HC5 and ZETA. These interactions were confirmed through in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a role in the regulation of PSEN1 turnover and degradation (Van1999Alzheimer’s). The interaction with the proteasome subunits suggests a functional relationship that may influence the stability and activity of PSEN1 (Van1999Alzheimer’s).

Additionally, PSEN1 forms complexes with β-catenin, which are involved in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell adhesion (Yu1998The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PSEN1 in cellular function and its potential impact on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
