# LHFPL1

## Overview
LHFPL1 is a gene that encodes the protein LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 1, which is part of the tetraspanin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their four transmembrane domains, playing crucial roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and membrane trafficking. The LHFPL1 gene is expressed in various tissues and is implicated in several biological pathways, although its specific functions and interactions are still under investigation. Mutations or dysregulation of LHFPL1 have been associated with certain pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
