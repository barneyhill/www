# CALHM4

## Overview
CALHM4, or calcium homeostasis modulator family member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the calcium homeostasis modulator family. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane channel, featuring a unique structural configuration with four transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic C-terminal helix. CALHM4 forms large oligomeric assemblies, typically in decameric and undecameric states, which span the lipid bilayer and are involved in cellular signaling processes. Although the precise physiological role of CALHM4 remains to be fully elucidated, it is notably expressed in the placenta, suggesting a potential involvement in placental physiology. The protein's ability to form large pores capable of accommodating ATP molecules hints at a possible role in ATP transport or signaling. However, electrophysiological studies have yet to demonstrate significant channel activity, indicating that its function may be modulated by other factors such as lipids or post-translational modifications (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Syrjanen2021On).

## Structure
The CALHM4 protein is characterized by a distinct molecular architecture, consisting of four transmembrane helices (TM1-TM4) that form the core of its structure. TM1 extends from the cytoplasm towards the extracellular side, facing the central pore, while TM2, TM3, and TM4 form the outer layer of the channel (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Syrjanen2021On). The protein also features a cytoplasmic C-terminal helix (CTH) of about 40 residues, which interacts with adjacent protomers, creating an arrangement similar to overlapping blades in a camera shutter (Syrjanen2021On).

CALHM4 forms large oligomeric assemblies, existing in decameric and undecameric states, which are cylindrical pores spanning the lipid bilayer (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Syrjanen2021On). The N-terminal helix (NTH) is predicted to play a role in voltage-dependent gating, extending towards the pore center (Syrjanen2021On). The extracellular domain is stabilized by disulfide bridges, and the intracellular side features a short helix (CLH) preceding TM2 (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM).

The quaternary structure of CALHM4 is influenced by the orientation of the C-terminal helices and the TM4-CTH loop, with a proline residue playing a significant role in determining its oligomeric state (Syrjanen2021On). The protein's structure is unique compared to other large-pore channels, suggesting a different evolutionary path (Syrjanen2021On).

## Function
CALHM4 is a member of the calcium homeostasis modulator family, which is involved in forming large pore channels that may play a role in cellular signaling processes. Although the specific function of CALHM4 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is known to be highly expressed in the placenta, suggesting a potential role in placental physiology (Syrjanen2021On; Drożdżyk2024Structural). Structurally, CALHM4 can form decameric and undecameric assemblies with large pores, which are capable of accommodating ATP molecules, indicating a possible involvement in ATP transport or signaling (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM).

Despite its structural potential for ion conduction, electrophysiological studies have not demonstrated significant channel activity for CALHM4, suggesting that its function might be regulated by other factors such as lipids or post-translational modifications (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Syrjanen2021On). The presence of lipids within the pore may indicate a regulatory mechanism that affects its conductive properties (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). The exact physiological role of CALHM4 remains elusive, and further research is needed to elucidate its function in cellular and organismal contexts (Syrjanen2021On; Drożdżyk2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CALHM4 primarily forms oligomeric assemblies, interacting mainly with itself to create dimers and larger structures. These interactions occur predominantly at the intracellular side, with significant dimerization mediated by contacts at this region (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). CALHM4 can exist as 10-mers and 11-mers, with the oligomeric state influenced by the orientation of the C-terminal helices and the TM4-CTH loop, which are critical for inter-protomer interactions (Syrjanen2021On).

CALHM4 also participates in heteromeric channel formation with CALHM2, although these interactions are less pronounced compared to homomeric interactions. The heteromeric assemblies involve specific subunit interfaces, with CALHM2 and CALHM4 maintaining distinct structural features while influencing each other's conformations (Drożdżyk2024Structural). The interactions between CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits promote heteromeric channel formation, but homomeric interactions are more prevalent due to larger buried areas in equivalent subunit interfaces (Drożdżyk2024Structural).

No interactions of CALHM4 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond its oligomeric assembly have been reported in the available studies (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Drożdżyk2024Structural).
