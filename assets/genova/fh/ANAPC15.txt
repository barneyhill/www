# ANAPC15

## Overview
ANAPC15 is a gene that encodes the anaphase-promoting complex subunit 15, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The protein encoded by ANAPC15 is integral to the APC/C's function in targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase during cell division (Giotti2018Assembly; Thu2018Disruption). As part of the APC/C's platform sub-complex, ANAPC15 contributes to the structural conformation necessary for the complex's activation (Melloy2019The; Zhou2016Insights). The proper functioning of ANAPC15 is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Zhou2016Insights). Additionally, alterations in ANAPC15 have been associated with cancer prognosis and treatment resistance, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Thu2018Disruption; Melloy2019The).

## Function
ANAPC15 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The APC/C plays a significant role in the transition from metaphase to anaphase by targeting specific proteins for degradation, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation and mitotic progression (Giotti2018Assembly; Thu2018Disruption). ANAPC15 is part of the APC/C's platform sub-complex, which includes other subunits such as APC1, APC4, and APC5, and is involved in altering the conformation of the APC/C for activation (Melloy2019The; Zhou2016Insights).

In healthy human cells, ANAPC15 contributes to the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, particularly during the S/G2-M phases, by ensuring the timely degradation of cell cycle proteins, thus facilitating proper cell cycle progression (Giotti2018Assembly). The APC/C, including ANAPC15, is active in the nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability by controlling the degradation of proteins involved in chromatid segregation and other cell cycle processes (Zhou2016Insights). This regulation is critical for preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Zhou2016Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ANAPC15 gene, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), have been implicated in various cancer-related conditions. In glioma, specifically glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma (GBMLGG), a low copy number of ANAPC15 is associated with poor patient survival, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis (Melloy2019The). Alterations in ANAPC15, along with other APC/C components, can influence the entire complex's activity, affecting cancer subtype-specific outcomes (Melloy2019The).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the disruption of ANAPC15 has been linked to resistance against TTK inhibitors, a class of drugs used in cancer treatment. The inactivation of ANAPC15 and other APC/C components allows cancer cells to tolerate chromosomal instability induced by these inhibitors, suggesting that ANAPC15 plays a role in mediating drug response (Thu2018Disruption). These findings highlight the significance of ANAPC15 in cancer therapy resistance and its potential as a biomarker for treatment responsiveness. Understanding the clinical implications of ANAPC15 alterations could lead to improved prognostic tools and therapeutic strategies in oncology.

## Interactions
ANAPC15 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. ANAPC15 is part of the APC/C complex, which is composed of multiple subunits that work together to facilitate protein ubiquitination and degradation, essential for mitotic progression (Zhou2016Insights). Although specific physical interactions of ANAPC15 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is known to be a component of the APC/C complex, which includes subunits like ANAPC13 and ANAPC5, and is involved in substrate recognition and ubiquitination (Melloy2019The; Zhou2016Insights).

ANAPC15 has been implicated in resistance mechanisms to TTK inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer, where its inactivation, along with other APC/C components, confers resistance by allowing cells to tolerate chromosomal instability (Thu2018Disruption). This suggests that ANAPC15, as part of the APC/C, plays a role in maintaining chromosomal stability during cell division. The APC/C complex, including ANAPC15, is regulated by co-activators such as Cdc20 and Cdh1, which bind to different regions of the complex to modulate its activity (Zhou2016Insights).
