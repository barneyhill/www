# ZFP42

## Overview
ZFP42, also known as Rex1, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger protein belonging to the C2H2 zinc finger protein superfamily, specifically related to the YY1 sub-family of transcription factors. The ZFP42 protein is characterized by its four C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities and its role as a transcription factor. This protein is predominantly expressed in pluripotent stem cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating gene expression necessary for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. ZFP42 is involved in the regulation of endogenous retroviruses in embryonic stem cells, acting as a negative regulator to maintain genomic stability. Its expression and function are also implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Guallar2012Expression; Mongan2006The; Zeng2019REX1).

## Structure
The ZFP42 protein, also known as Rex1, is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein superfamily and is closely related to the YY1 sub-family of transcription factors. It contains four C2H2-type zinc finger motifs located in the C-terminal half of the protein, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities (Mongan2006The; Lee2010Transcriptional). These zinc fingers typically consist of two anti-parallel beta-sheets and an alpha-helix that coordinate a central zinc ion, facilitating interactions with DNA (Mongan2006The).

The C-terminal zinc finger domains of ZFP42 share significant sequence similarity with the human YY1 protein, with a 75% identity, although the N-terminal domains do not share this similarity (Mongan2006The). The protein's structure allows it to bind the DNA major groove, similar to YY1, due to the conserved spacing and orientation of its zinc fingers (Mongan2006The). The TGEKP motif, conserved in both ZFP42 and YY1, plays a role in stabilizing DNA binding (Mongan2006The).

ZFP42 is expressed in pluripotent stem cells and is associated with maintaining pluripotency. It is also involved in regulating the expression of endogenous retroviruses in mouse embryonic stem cells (Guallar2012Expression).

## Function
ZFP42, also known as Rex1, is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. It functions as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression essential for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. ZFP42 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular processes that impact development and cell fate decisions (Mongan2006The).

In healthy human cells, ZFP42 is expressed in early passage normal epithelial cell cultures, such as keratinocytes, prostate, and lung-derived cells, suggesting its involvement in maintaining stem cell characteristics in these tissues (Mongan2006The). The protein is a member of the YY1 sub-family of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, sharing sequence similarity with YY1, particularly in the zinc finger domains, which suggests potential functional similarities (Mongan2006The).

ZFP42 is involved in regulating the expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in embryonic stem cells and embryos. It acts as a negative regulator of ERV elements, preventing their expression and potential genomic integration, which is crucial during early embryonic development (Guallar2012Expression). The protein's activity in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function in stem cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFP42 gene, also known as Rex1, have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, ZFP42 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor growth by activating the MEK/ERK pathway and repressing the tumor suppressor gene RASSF1a through promoter methylation. This suggests that targeting the ZFP42/DNMT3b/RASSF1a axis could be a potential therapeutic approach for prostate cancer (Liu2021REX1). In contrast, ZFP42 expression is significantly reduced in several human cancer cell lines, including prostate and renal cancer, indicating that its loss may be associated with neoplastic transformation (Lee2010Transcriptional; Raman2005Decreased).

In cervical cancer, ZFP42 acts as an oncogene, where its overexpression is linked to increased metastasis through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. It promotes metastasis by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, potentially by downregulating SOCS1, a known inhibitor of this pathway (Zeng2019REX1).

In testicular function, ZFP42 deficiency in mice leads to impaired testicular function, abnormal testis morphology, and aberrant gene expression, suggesting its role in germ cell differentiation and testicular health (Rezende2011Rex1).

## Interactions
ZFP42, also known as Rex1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating gene expression. Rex1 interacts with key transcription factors such as Nanog and Oct4, forming complexes that include itself and YY1, another zinc-finger protein. These interactions are part of a transcriptional network in mouse embryonic stem cells, where Rex1 is a target of several transcription factors, including Nanog, Oct4, Dax1, NacI, and Klf4 (Lee2010Transcriptional).

Rex1 also binds to genomic repeats derived from LTR retrotransposons, such as muERV-L and IAP elements, and interacts with LSD1, a lysine demethylase. This suggests a cooperative role in the regulation of muERV-L expression, potentially involving histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Guallar2012Expression). The interaction with LSD1 indicates that Rex1 may work in concert with HDACs to regulate the expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in embryonic stem cells (Guallar2012Expression).

In the context of genomic imprinting, Rex1 is suggested to function as a DNA-binding transcription factor, influencing the expression of downstream genes. It shares DNA-binding sites with YY1, indicating shared regulatory pathways (Kim2011Rex1Zfp42).
