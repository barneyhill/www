# EMC7

## Overview
EMC7 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 7, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and quality control of membrane proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As a structural subunit, EMC7 is involved in the insertion of transmembrane domains, facilitating the proper integration of proteins into the ER membrane. The protein is characterized by a beta-sandwich structure, which is anchored to other EMC components, contributing to the complex's stability and function (Pleiner2020Structural; Bai2020Structure). EMC7's interactions with other proteins, such as Rab7 and Stx18, highlight its role in intracellular transport processes, including the delivery of viral particles to the ER (Bagchi2020Selective). The functional integrity of EMC7 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health, underscoring its significance in cellular biology (Page2023Role).

## Structure
EMC7 is a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a crucial role in the insertion of transmembrane proteins. The EMC7 protein is located in the lumenal region of the EMC and is characterized by a beta-sandwich structure. This beta-sandwich is anchored to EMC1 via hydrophobic contacts, forming part of the lumenal domain along with EMC10 (Pleiner2020Structural; Bai2020Structure). The lumenal domain of EMC7 is primarily composed of beta-strands, contributing to its structural stability (Bai2020Structure).

EMC7 is associated with the beta-propellers of EMC1, forming a dynamic association that can exist in different conformational states (MillerVedam2020Structural). The protein's structure is further complicated by conformational heterogeneity, which poses challenges in resolving its structure in certain environments, such as detergent maps (MillerVedam2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications of EMC7 include N-glycosylation at specific positions, such as N53, N85, and N115, which are consistent with its lumenal orientation (Bai2020Structure). These modifications may influence the protein's function and stability within the EMC complex.

## Function
EMC7 is a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a critical role in the biogenesis and quality control of membrane proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). EMC7 is involved in the insertion of the first transmembrane domain (TMD) of proteins, facilitating their proper integration into the ER membrane (Page2023Role). It interacts with other complexes such as BOS, GEL, and PAT to ensure efficient handover and insertion of substrates, which is crucial for maintaining cellular proteostasis (Page2023Role).

EMC7 is also part of a dynamic subdomain within the EMC, contributing to a gating mechanism that regulates substrate access to the EMC3 hydrophilic vestibule. This mechanism is essential for the insertion of moderately hydrophobic TMDs (Hegde2022The). The cytosolic C-terminus of EMC7 interacts with substrates, aiding in the translocation of N-terminal soluble domains through the EMC's hydrophilic vestibule, a rate-limiting step for insertion into the ER lumen (Page2023Role).

In healthy human cells, EMC7's function is vital for the proper folding and stability of multipass membrane proteins, impacting cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Page2023Role).

## Interactions
EMC7, a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC), participates in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with Rab7, a GTPase associated with late endosomes, which is essential for the transport of the SV40 virus from the late endosome to the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is mediated by the disordered domain and low-complexity region within EMC7's cytosolic domain (Bagchi2020Selective). EMC7 also binds to the ER-resident SNARE protein Stx18, facilitating the vesicular fusion event necessary for SV40 delivery into the ER lumen (Bagchi2020Selective).

EMC7 forms part of the EMC's structural framework, interacting with other EMC subunits such as EMC1 and EMC10. It is scaffolded on the beta-propellers of EMC1, contributing to the stability and function of the EMC complex (MillerVedam2020Structural). EMC7's interactions with EMC3 and EMC4 have been suggested through crosslinking studies, indicating its role in the dynamic subdomain of the EMC (Hegde2022The). These interactions are crucial for the EMC's role in the biogenesis and insertion of transmembrane proteins (Pleiner2022A). EMC7 does not have known interactions with nucleic acids (Hegde2022The; MillerVedam2020Structural).
