# OR5M8

## Overview
OR5M8 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily M member 8, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the sensory perception of smell, functioning as an olfactory receptor that detects chemical stimuli in the olfactory epithelium. Characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, OR5M8 facilitates the transduction of odorant signals through interaction with G proteins, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that lead to neuronal responses (Girard2022Naive). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR5M8 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where it may contribute to processes like epidermal proliferation and cytokine production, indicating a broader physiological significance (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Structure
OR5M8 is an olfactory receptor, part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs. This structure allows the receptor to traverse the cell membrane seven times, forming a complex topology essential for its function in detecting chemical stimuli related to smell (Girard2022Naive). The primary structure of OR5M8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, while the secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, crucial for the receptor's ability to interact with ligands and transduce signals across the cell membrane.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, which can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and function. These modifications are typical in olfactory receptors, although specific details for OR5M8 are not provided in the available context. The identification of a unique peptide corresponding to a cytoplasmic domain of OR5M8 suggests specific regions of the protein that may be involved in intracellular signaling (Girard2022Naive). There is no information available regarding quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms for OR5M8 in the provided context.

## Function
OR5M8 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of chemical stimuli, playing a crucial role in the sensory perception of smell. OR5M8 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Girard2022Naive). The protein is predicted to be involved in the signal transduction pathways that initiate the perception of smell by interacting with G proteins, which then trigger a cascade of intracellular events leading to neuronal responses (Girard2022Naive).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR5M8 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where they may participate in various cellular processes. These include epidermal and keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production, suggesting a broader role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The downregulation of OR5M8 in certain conditions, such as sensitive skin, indicates its potential involvement in skin physiology and pathophysiology (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
