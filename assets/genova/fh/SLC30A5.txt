# SLC30A5

## Overview
SLC30A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 5, also known as ZnT5, which is a zinc transporter protein. This protein is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus and secretory granules in human cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis by transporting zinc ions from the cytoplasm into the secretory pathway (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic; Singh2016Analysis). ZnT5 is categorized as a transmembrane transporter protein and is essential for the proper functioning of zinc-requiring enzymes within the early secretory pathway (Singh2016Analysis). The protein forms heterodimers with other zinc transporters, such as SLC30A6, to facilitate zinc transport, which is necessary for the maturation and activation of secretory proteins (Kumar2015Altered; Bui2024Structures). SLC30A5 is expressed in various tissues, including the pancreas, kidney, and liver, and its dysfunction can lead to significant physiological consequences, such as impaired osteoblast maturation and cardiac issues (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic; Singh2016Analysis).

## Function
SLC30A5, also known as ZnT5, is a zinc transporter protein primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus and secretory granules in human cells. It plays a crucial role in transporting zinc ions from the cytoplasm into the secretory pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis and supporting various cellular functions (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic; Singh2016Analysis). In particular, SLC30A5 is involved in the loading of zinc onto zinc-requiring enzymes within the early secretory pathway, which is vital for the proper functioning of these enzymes (Singh2016Analysis).

SLC30A5 forms heterodimers with another zinc transporter, SLC30A6, to facilitate zinc transport, a process necessary for the maturation and activation of secretory proteins (Kumar2015Altered; Bui2024Structures). This transporter is expressed in various tissues, including the pancreas, kidney, and liver, and is particularly important in pancreatic β cells for depositing zinc into secretory granules (Singh2016Analysis).

Disruption of SLC30A5 function can lead to significant physiological consequences, such as impaired osteoblast maturation, reduced bone density, and cardiac issues, highlighting its critical role in organismal health (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic; Singh2016Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC30A5 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In gastric cancer, SLC30A5 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Its expression levels are positively associated with tumor stage, nodal metastasis, and Helicobacter pylori infection status. High expression of SLC30A5 is correlated with improved overall survival, first progression survival, and post-progression survival in gastric cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Guo2020Comprehensive).

In contrast, bi-allelic loss of function variants in SLC30A5 have been identified as a cause of perinatal lethal cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by severe cardiac issues, including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, leading to perinatal mortality. The identified variants result in frameshifts and are predicted to cause a loss of function due to nonsense-mediated decay, disrupting zinc homeostasis (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic).

Altered expression of SLC30A5 is also implicated in a mammary gland disorder characterized by reduced zinc secretion into milk. This condition is associated with reduced mRNA and protein levels of SLC30A5, potentially due to epigenetic changes rather than genetic mutations (Kumar2015Altered).

## Interactions
SLC30A5, also known as ZnT5, is involved in zinc transport and forms heterodimers with other zinc transporters, such as SLC30A6 (ZnT6). This interaction is crucial for their zinc transport function, as SLC30A6 does not directly transport zinc but may act as a modulator (Kumar2015Altered). SLC30A5 is localized at the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it is responsible for the influx of Zn2+ ions into the lumen of cell organelles (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic). The protein's interaction with SLC30A6 is significant in maintaining zinc homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular functions, including those related to mammary gland function and milk secretion (Kumar2015Altered).

In the context of gastric cancer, SLC30A5 is part of a broader network of interactions involving the SLC30A family genes. These interactions are implicated in zinc transport and homeostasis, which are important for cellular functions and cancer progression (Guo2020Comprehensive). The protein-protein interaction networks and gene ontology analyses suggest that SLC30A5, along with other SLC30A family members, may play a role in tumor microenvironment interactions (Guo2020Comprehensive).
