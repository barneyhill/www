# FFAR2

## Overview
The FFAR2 gene encodes the free fatty acid receptor 2, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. This receptor is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, immune cells, and the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, immune regulation, and gut health. FFAR2 is involved in the secretion of hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), which are essential for glucose regulation and energy balance (Kimura2020Free; Tolhurst2012ShortChain). Additionally, FFAR2 modulates inflammatory responses and maintains gut microbiota composition, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and immune functions (Sivaprakasam2016An; Kimura2020Free). The receptor's interactions with various proteins also implicate it in viral entry processes and immune cell signaling, underscoring its multifaceted role in health and disease (Wang2020The; Chun2019MetaboliteSensing).

## Function
FFAR2, also known as free fatty acid receptor 2, is a G-protein-coupled receptor activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. It is primarily expressed in adipose tissue, immune cells, and the gut, where it plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In the gut, FFAR2 is expressed in enteroendocrine L-cells and is involved in the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), which are crucial for glucose homeostasis and energy balance (Kimura2020Free; Tolhurst2012ShortChain). 

FFAR2 activation by SCFAs leads to increased intracellular calcium levels and the activation of signaling pathways such as the MAPK cascade, which modulates inflammation by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-6 (Kimura2020Free). In immune cells, FFAR2 is involved in the regulation of leukocyte migration and cytokine secretion, contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs (Kimura2020Free). FFAR2 also plays a role in maintaining a healthy gut microbiota composition and suppressing intestinal carcinogenesis, highlighting its importance in gut health and immune regulation (Sivaprakasam2016An; Kimura2020Free).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FFAR2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of metabolic disorders, FFAR2 expression is linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). FFAR2 activation by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can decrease insulin signaling and inhibit fat accumulation, suggesting its potential role in obesity and T2D treatment. However, conflicting reports exist, with some studies indicating that FFAR2-deficient mice show improved insulin sensitivity and increased energy expenditure (Kimura2020Free).

In inflammatory diseases, FFAR2 plays a significant role in immune regulation. FFAR2-deficient mice exhibit worsened inflammation in models of arthritis, colitis, and asthma, indicating its role in mediating anti-inflammatory effects (Kimura2020Free). FFAR2 is also involved in maintaining intestinal integrity, with knockout mice showing compromised gut barrier functions and increased risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) development (Mishra2020Free).

In cancer, FFAR2 expression levels vary, with increased expression observed in gastric and colorectal cancers, while decreased expression is noted in colon adenocarcinomas. FFAR2 overexpression in colon cancer cells enhances the anti-proliferative effects of SCFAs, suggesting a protective role against tumorigenesis (Kimura2020Free).

## Interactions
FFAR2, also known as GPR43, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with β-arrestin1, which plays a significant role in the internalization of the influenza A virus (IAV) by facilitating the recruitment of the AP-2 complex, specifically the AP2B1 subunit, during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Wang2020The). This interaction is essential for the efficient endocytosis of IAV into host cells (Wang2020The).

FFAR2 also interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), including GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6, which phosphorylate FFAR2. This phosphorylation is crucial for the recruitment of β-arrestin1 and the subsequent internalization of IAV (Wang2020The). The interaction between FFAR2 and these GRKs enhances IAV replication by promoting the virus's entry into host cells (Wang2020The).

In addition to its role in viral entry, FFAR2 is involved in immune regulation. It modulates the activity of colonic group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) through signaling pathways involving AKT and STAT3, influencing the production of IL-22, a key cytokine in gut immunity (Chun2019MetaboliteSensing). These interactions highlight FFAR2's multifaceted role in both viral infection and immune response regulation.
