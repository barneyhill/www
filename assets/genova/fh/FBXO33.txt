# FBXO33

## Overview
FBXO33 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 33, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is pivotal in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, responsible for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and influencing processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Wang2014Evolution). The F-box protein 33 is involved in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination, impacting inflammatory cytokine levels and playing a role in neurodevelopmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Mahmoudpour2018Chemotherapyinduced). Additionally, FBXO33 is implicated in muscular dystrophies through its role in the degradation of dystrophin, and it has potential therapeutic implications in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) by modulating the solubility of pathological proteins (McCourt2017Mouse).

## Function
FBXO33 is a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. It functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover, impacting cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Wang2014Evolution).

FBXO33 has been implicated in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination, which affects the serum level of inflammatory cytokines. It is associated with attention deficiency hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a neurodevelopmental disease, where variant alleles are linked to decreased FBXO33 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines and reduced frontal grey matter volume. This suggests a role in the development of the nervous system and neuronal sensitivity (Mahmoudpour2018Chemotherapyinduced).

In mouse models, FBXO33 is identified as a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in the degradation of dystrophin through ubiquitination. This indicates its potential role in targeting missense dystrophins to the proteasome for degradation, impacting the stability and functionality of dystrophin in muscular dystrophy models (McCourt2017Mouse).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO33 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the context of muscular dystrophies, FBXO33 is involved in the degradation of dystrophin, a protein crucial for muscle function. Research has identified FBXO33 as a candidate E3 ligase that targets missense dystrophins for proteasomal degradation, suggesting a potential link between FBXO33 and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (McCourt2017Mouse).

FBXO33 has also been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A gene-wide association study identified FBXO33 as one of the genes with nominal signals linked to ADHD, indicating its potential role in the genetic susceptibility to this disorder. The study found that FBXO33 is located within a genomic segment on chromosome 14, which is often deleted in individuals exhibiting various neurological and psychiatric traits, including ADHD symptoms (GarciaMartínez2017Genewide).

In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), FBXO33 has been shown to alleviate cellular toxicity caused by the pathological variant ATXN3-PolyQ. Overexpression of FBXO33 increases the solubility of ATXN3-PolyQ, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in managing SCA3 (HernándezCarralero2024ATXN3:).
