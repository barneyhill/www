# HLA-DQB2

## Overview
HLA-DQB2 is a gene located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region on chromosome 6, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by encoding proteins involved in antigen presentation. The protein encoded by HLA-DQB2, known as major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 2, is categorized as a transmembrane protein. Although structurally compatible with expression, the HLA-DQB2 gene is unique in that it has not been observed to be expressed in any tissue, which is atypical for genes in this region known for their allelic diversity (Berdoz1989Remarkable). Despite its lack of observed expression, the gene's conservation and proximity to highly polymorphic genes suggest it may have essential functional properties if expressed (Berdoz1989Remarkable). The gene's role in disease susceptibility, particularly in autoimmune conditions and cancer, underscores its potential clinical significance (Dias2024A).

## Function
The HLA-DQB2 gene is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is crucial for the immune system's ability to present extracellular antigens to CD4+ T cells. This process is essential for initiating immune responses and is primarily active in antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Despite its structural compatibility with expression, HLA-DQB2 has not been observed to be expressed in any tissue, which is unusual given its location in a region characterized by extensive allelic diversity (Berdoz1989Remarkable). The gene exhibits little to no polymorphism, suggesting it may be part of an invariant region of the MHC or under strong selective pressure to maintain its amino acid sequence (Berdoz1989Remarkable).

The specific function of the HLA-DQB2 protein in healthy human cells remains unclear, as the gene's expression has not been observed. However, its conservation and location near highly polymorphic genes like DQA1 and DQB1 suggest potential essential functional properties if expressed (Berdoz1989Remarkable). The lack of polymorphism in both coding and noncoding regions further indicates a high level of sequence conservation (Berdoz1989Remarkable).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HLA-DQB2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Variations in HLA-DQB2 can influence susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease and type 1 diabetes, by affecting antigen presentation. These alterations may disrupt immune tolerance, leading to pathological conditions. In the context of cancer, a novel HLA-DQB2::MET gene fusion has been identified in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This fusion was associated with resistance to initial treatments but showed a prolonged response to the MET inhibitor tepotinib, suggesting potential clinical significance in predicting response to MET inhibitors (Dias2024A). The identification of this fusion through next-generation sequencing highlights the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling in identifying actionable mutations in cancer treatment. The case underscores the need for further research into the therapeutic potential of MET inhibitors for NSCLC with MET rearrangements, as well as the broader implications of HLA-DQB2 alterations in disease progression and treatment response (Dias2024A).
