# FPGS

## Overview
The FPGS gene encodes the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthase, which is a critical component of folate metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the polyglutamylation of folate molecules, a modification that enhances their cellular retention and functional efficacy. Folylpolyglutamate synthase exists in two primary isoforms: a cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form, each serving distinct roles in cellular metabolism. The cytosolic isoform is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis, while the mitochondrial isoform contributes to amino acid synthesis, particularly glycine (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate; Chen1996Purification). As a key player in one-carbon metabolism, folylpolyglutamate synthase is also involved in the activation of antifolate drugs, which are used in chemotherapy. The enzyme's activity and interactions with other cellular proteins underscore its importance in both normal cellular function and in the context of cancer treatment, where its role in drug resistance is of particular clinical significance (Osborne1993Regulation; Yu2020FPGS).

## Function
Folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the intracellular retention and function of folates by catalyzing the addition of glutamate residues to folate molecules, converting them into polyglutamate forms. This polyglutamylation is essential for maintaining high intracellular concentrations of folates, as it prevents their recognition and extrusion by efflux transporters (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate). FPGS exists in two isoforms: a cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form, each with distinct roles in folate metabolism. The cytosolic FPGS is necessary for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis, while the mitochondrial form is involved in glycine biosynthesis (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate; Chen1996Purification).

FPGS activity is critical for the conversion of folate and antifolate drugs into polyglutamate derivatives, which are more effective substrates for enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism, a process vital for DNA synthesis and repair (Osborne1993Regulation; Sussman1986Characterization). The enzyme's activity is influenced by pH and substrate availability, with reduced folates being preferred substrates (Chen1996Purification). FPGS is also linked to the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic regimens involving folate analogs, as polyglutamate forms of antifolates have increased affinity for target enzymes and enhanced cellular retention (Osborne1993Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FPGS gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer treatment resistance. FPGS is crucial for the polyglutamylation of antifolate drugs like methotrexate, which enhances their retention and efficacy within cells. Deficiency or mutations in FPGS can lead to resistance against these drugs, posing challenges in treating cancers such as leukemia and colorectal cancer (van2023A; Yu2020FPGS). 

In relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), specific mutations in the FPGS gene, such as R419W, have been identified as contributing to methotrexate resistance by impairing its polyglutamylation, which is essential for its antileukemic effects (Yu2020FPGS). These mutations are often relapse-specific, indicating their role in acquired drug resistance (Yu2020FPGS).

Additionally, genetic variations in FPGS, such as the R424C and S457F variants, have been shown to reduce protein expression and enzymatic activity, potentially impacting the efficacy of antifolate therapies in cancer patients (Leil2007Identification). These findings underscore the importance of FPGS in determining the success of chemotherapy regimens and highlight the potential for novel therapeutic strategies targeting FPGS-deficient cells (van2023A).

## Interactions
Folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) interacts with various proteins, particularly those associated with the cytoskeleton and cellular membranes. The cytoplasmic isoform of FPGS (cFPGS) has been shown to associate with microtubules and actin filaments, suggesting a role in intracellular transport and localization. cFPGS specifically binds to active microtubule filaments, as indicated by its interaction with microtubule-specific motor proteins like dynein and kinesin (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate). It also co-localizes with α-tubulin, a microtubule subunit, indicating a significant association with the microtubule network (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate).

cFPGS interacts with the T-complex protein 1 (TCP1) ring complex (TRiC) and the 14-3-3 protein family. TRiC assists in protein folding and complex assembly, potentially facilitating the assembly of cFPGS-containing complexes. The 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate cellular processes by binding phosphoproteins, may interact with cFPGS, influencing the sensing of folate cofactors necessary for nucleotide biosynthesis (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate).

Additionally, cFPGS is involved in the crosstalk between folate metabolism and glycolysis, with proteins like MTHFD1 potentially mediating folate channeling (Stark2021Folylpolyɣglutamate). These interactions suggest that cFPGS plays a crucial role in the dynamic assembly and compartmentalization of folate metabolic pathways within the cell.
