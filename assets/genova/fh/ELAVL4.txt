# ELAVL4

## Overview
ELAVL4, also known as HuD, is a gene that encodes the ELAV-like RNA binding protein 4, a member of the ELAV-like protein family. This protein is predominantly expressed in neurons and plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, influencing mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), ELAVL4 binds to adenosine/uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, thereby stabilizing them and affecting their translation. This function is vital for neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and memory processes. ELAVL4 is involved in various stages of neuronal development and interacts with other RNA-binding proteins, forming multimeric complexes that enhance its RNA-binding affinity. The gene's expression and function are implicated in several neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal neuronal function and disease pathogenesis (Bronicki2013Emerging; Bowles2021ELAVL4).

## Structure
The ELAVL4 protein, also known as HuD, is a member of the ELAV-like protein family and is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its RNA-binding function. These RRMs are highly conserved and contribute to the protein's ability to bind specific target mRNAs, particularly in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs (Bronicki2013Emerging; Mulligan2023The). The first two RRMs are involved in binding to cis-acting elements, while the third RRM interacts with the poly(A) tail, stabilizing the RBP-mRNA complex (Bronicki2013Emerging).

The ELAVL4 protein also contains a hinge region between the second and third RRM, which includes nuclear export and localization signals, facilitating RNA shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Mulligan2023The). This region undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and methylation, which can influence the protein's function (Bronicki2013Emerging).

ELAVL4 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript isoforms, including HuD, HuD mex, and HuD pro, with up to 24 different mRNA variants possible (Bronicki2013Emerging). These isoforms are predominantly expressed in the postnatal mouse brain, indicating their role in neuronal development (Bronicki2013Emerging).

## Function
ELAVL4, also known as HuD, is a neuronal RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mRNA stability, splicing, and translation in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons, where it binds to adenosine/uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs. This binding stabilizes mRNAs, influencing their stability and translation, which is crucial for neuronal differentiation and function (Bronicki2013Emerging).

HuD is involved in various stages of neuronal development, including the commitment, differentiation, and activity of neuronal stem/progenitor cells. It promotes cell cycle exit and differentiation, essential for terminal differentiation processes such as dendritic and axonal outgrowth (Bronicki2013Emerging). HuD also plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, axonal regeneration, and synaptic function, contributing to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (Bronicki2013Emerging).

In addition to its role in neuronal development, HuD regulates alternative splicing and polyadenylation, affecting mRNA localization and translation in neurons. It interacts with intronic AREs and other splicing factors to modulate exon inclusion or exclusion in pre-mRNAs (Bronicki2013Emerging). These functions underscore HuD's importance in maintaining normal neuronal functions and its involvement in learning and memory processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ELAVL4 gene, also known as HuD, have been implicated in several neurological disorders and cancers. In Alzheimer's disease, HuD is involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins, with decreased levels of nELAV proteins correlating with increased Aβ peptide levels, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Silvestri2022Emerging). In Parkinson's disease, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the HuD locus have been associated with the age at onset, particularly in specific populations (Bronicki2013Emerging). 

HuD is also linked to spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where it interacts with SMN protein and is sequestered in TDP-43 aggregates, respectively, potentially affecting mRNA metabolism (Silvestri2022Emerging). In schizophrenia, increased HuD levels in the prefrontal cortex may alter post-transcriptional control, affecting mRNA abundance (Silvestri2022Emerging). 

In cancer, particularly neuroblastomas and small cell lung cancers, aberrant HuD expression or mutations are associated with disease progression and prognosis. Deletions or mutations in the HuD gene are linked to poor outcomes in neuroblastomas, while high HuD levels correlate with a favorable prognosis (Bronicki2013Emerging).

## Interactions
ELAVL4, also known as HuD, is a neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability, localization, and translation by binding to adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs) in mRNAs. ELAVL4 interacts with other RNA-binding proteins such as AUF1, KSRP, and TIA-1, indicating a complex interplay between stabilizing and destabilizing factors in mRNA regulation (Bronicki2013Emerging). 

ELAVL4 can form multimeric complexes, such as homotrimers, which enhance its RNA binding affinity. This multimerization is facilitated by its RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and is enhanced by the presence of cellular RNA molecules (Mulligan2023The). ELAVL4 also binds to the MAPT RNA and co-localizes with tau protein and stress granule markers TIA1 and G3BP1, suggesting its involvement in stress granule formation and indicating that mutant tau may impair ELAVL4 function by recruiting it to stress granules (Bowles2021ELAVL4).

In the context of neurological disorders, ELAVL4 interacts with the SMN protein in spinal muscular atrophy and is sequestered by TDP-43-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a role in mRNA metabolism misregulation (Bronicki2013Emerging).
