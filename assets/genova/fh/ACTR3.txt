# ACTR3

## Overview
ACTR3 is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 3, a critical component of the ARP2/3 complex, which is involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. The protein encoded by ACTR3 is categorized as an actin-related protein and plays a pivotal role in actin nucleation and branching, essential for various cellular processes such as cell migration, endocytosis, and vesicle trafficking (Goley2006The; Rotty2012New). The ARP2/3 complex, which includes ACTR3, is responsible for initiating the formation of branched actin filament networks, a process crucial for the development of cellular structures like lamellipodia that facilitate cell movement (Miano2007Serum). ACTR3's function is regulated by interactions with nucleation-promoting factors and other proteins, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport (Goley2006The; Mageed2024Analysis). Additionally, ACTR3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Yang2013CFL1; Hu2021ACTR3).

## Structure
ACTR3, also known as actin-related protein 3, is a component of the Arp2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin filament nucleation and branching. The primary structure of ACTR3 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ACTR3 gene. While specific details about the secondary and tertiary structures of ACTR3 are not provided, it is known that ACTR3, along with Arp2, forms a 'side-to-side' heterodimer that resembles the barbed end of an actin dimer, facilitating actin monomer addition (May2001The).

In terms of quaternary structure, ACTR3 is part of the seven-subunit Arp2/3 complex, which includes Arp2, ARPC1, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, and ARPC5 (Wang2020Actin). This complex is evolutionarily conserved and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and vesicle transport (Huang2021Identification).

ACTR3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function within the Arp2/3 complex. The protein contains specific domains that facilitate its role in actin nucleation and branching, although detailed information on these domains is not provided in the context. There is also mention of an isoform of Arp3 identified in neuronal tissue, indicating the presence of splice variant isoforms (May2001The).

## Function
ACTR3, a component of the ARP2/3 complex, plays a crucial role in actin polymerization, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell migration, endocytosis, and vesicle trafficking. The ARP2/3 complex, composed of seven subunits including ACTR3, initiates the formation of branched actin filament networks by binding to the side of existing actin filaments and nucleating new filaments at a 70° angle (Goley2006The; Rotty2012New). This branching is critical for the formation of lamellipodia, which are actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells, facilitating cell movement (Miano2007Serum; Rotty2012New).

The ARP2/3 complex is activated by nucleation-promoting factors such as WASP, N-WASP, and WAVE, which position the complex near existing F-actin to stimulate actin polymerization (Goley2006The; Rotty2012New). In healthy human cells, ACTR3 is involved in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport mechanisms, including endocytosis and phagocytosis, by localizing to endosomes and phagosomes (Goley2006The). The activity of ACTR3 and the ARP2/3 complex is essential for the dynamic assembly and disassembly of actin filaments, which are critical for the structural and motor functions of the cytoskeleton (Goley2006The).

## Clinical Significance
ACTR3, a component of the ARP2/3 complex, plays a significant role in cancer metastasis and prognosis. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ACTR3 is markedly upregulated, with a 7-fold increase in expression compared to non-cancerous tissues. This upregulation is linked to poor clinical outcomes, particularly shorter disease-free survival, although it does not impact overall survival. ACTR3 promotes cell migration and invasion by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis. Knockdown of ACTR3 expression in PDAC cells reduces their migratory and invasive capabilities, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic indicator (Hu2021ACTR3).

In gallbladder cancers, specifically squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, high expression of ACTR3 (referred to as Arp3) is associated with poor survival, high TNM stage, and larger tumor size. It is involved in the aggressive characteristics of these cancers, correlating with poor differentiation in adenocarcinomas. This suggests that ACTR3 could serve as a diagnostic or prognostic marker and a potential target for gene therapy in these cancers (Yang2013CFL1).

## Interactions
ACTR3, or actin-related protein 3, is a key component of the ARP2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin nucleation and branching. This complex is essential for the formation of intricate actin networks that facilitate various cellular processes, including cell motility and intracellular transport (Mageed2024Analysis). ACTR3 interacts with other proteins such as ACTR2 and ACTG1, forming a highly interconnected network that is vital for modifying actin dynamics and cytoskeletal rearrangements (Mageed2024Analysis). 

The ARP2/3 complex, which includes ACTR3, binds to the sides of actin filaments, particularly at the leading edges of motile cells, and caps the pointed ends of actin filaments with high affinity. This interaction inhibits monomer addition and dissociation at these ends, promoting the formation of branching networks of actin filaments (Mullins1998The). 

ACTR3 also interacts with protein kinase D2 (PKD2) as part of the ARP2/3 complex, which is significant for understanding PKD2's role in transport processes at the trans-Golgi network (Häupl2016Protein). These interactions highlight the importance of ACTR3 in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular processes.
