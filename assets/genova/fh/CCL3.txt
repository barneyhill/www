# CCL3

## Overview
CCL3, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1α), is a gene that encodes the C-C motif chemokine ligand 3, a member of the chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating chemotaxis, the process by which immune cells are directed to sites of inflammation or injury. CCL3 is primarily involved in the recruitment and activation of various immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and CD4+ T cells, through its interaction with chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5 (Liu2012Differential). Structurally, CCL3 is characterized by a conserved fold typical of CC chemokines, stabilized by disulfide bridges, and is capable of forming homodimers and higher-order oligomers (Ren2010Polymerization; Miller2017Chemokines). The protein's expression is upregulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines, contributing to its role in various inflammatory and immune responses, as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, and certain cancers (Yang2005Essential; Bhavsar2015Macrophage).

## Structure
CCL3, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1α), is a chemokine with a well-defined molecular structure. The primary structure of CCL3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes a 10 amino acid long N-terminal loop, a short 3_10 helix, a beta-sheet composed of three anti-parallel beta-strands, and a C-terminal alpha-helix that packs against the beta-sheet (Ren2010Polymerization). The tertiary structure of CCL3 is characterized by a common fold found in CC chemokines, stabilized by disulfide bridges that are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity and receptor binding (Miller2017Chemokines).

In terms of quaternary structure, CCL3 can form homodimers and higher-order oligomers. These dimers associate to form rod-shaped, double-helical polymers, with each dimer rotating to bind to the adjacent dimer, forming a decamer that completes a 180-degree turn (Ren2010Polymerization). The dimer-dimer interface has a buried surface area of approximately 1100 Å², involving key contacts such as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Ren2010Polymerization). CCL3's ability to form oligomers is influenced by its amino acid composition and the conformation of inter-subunit interfaces, affecting the thermodynamic stability of the complexes (Miller2017Chemokines).

## Function
CCL3, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α), is a chemokine involved in various immune processes. In healthy human cells, CCL3 primarily functions by binding to the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, which are expressed on various immune cells, including CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. This binding facilitates the chemotaxis of these immune cells to sites of inflammation, playing a crucial role in immune surveillance and response (Liu2012Differential).

CCL3 is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) numbers in the bone marrow. It acts as an inhibitor of stem cell proliferation, maintaining the balance between differentiation and self-renewal of immature hematopoietic cells. This regulation is crucial for maintaining homeostatic myeloid differentiation and ensuring the proper function of the hematopoietic system (Staversky2018The).

In the context of the central nervous system, CCL3 is minimally expressed in resting human brain microvascular endothelial cells but is upregulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines. This upregulation contributes to leukocyte trafficking across the blood-brain barrier, highlighting its role in neuroinflammatory processes (Chui2010Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL3 gene, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1α), are implicated in various diseases. Elevated levels of CCL3 are associated with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, where it contributes to inflammation and immune cell recruitment in synovial fluid and serum (Bhavsar2015Macrophage). In periodontitis, increased serum levels of CCL3 are observed, which decrease following successful therapy, indicating its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Bhavsar2015Macrophage). 

In multiple myeloma, higher concentrations of CCL3 correlate with disease severity, suggesting its involvement in disease progression (Bhavsar2015Macrophage). CCL3 is also linked to cardiovascular diseases, where elevated levels are associated with conditions like congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic marker (Bhavsar2015Macrophage).

In the context of cancer, CCL3 is implicated in tumor metastasis, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, through the CCL3-CCR5 axis, which enhances tumor cell functions and progression (Bhavsar2015Macrophage). In hepatocellular carcinoma, the CCL3-CCR1 axis is crucial for tumor development, with CCL3 expression observed in tumor cells and associated with reduced tumor incidence in deficient mice models (Yang2005Essential).

## Interactions
CCL3, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1α), is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins. One notable interaction is with the tick chemokine binding protein Evasin-1. The complex between Evasin-1 and CCL3 is characterized by a significant buried surface area and a high degree of shape complementarity. This interaction involves a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, particularly between the N-terminal region of Evasin-1 and a unique motif in CCL3 (Thr16-Ser17-Arg18), which is crucial for Evasin-1's selectivity for CCL3 (Dias2009Structural).

The interaction also includes a notable edge-to-face π-π interaction between Phe14 of Evasin-1 and Phe13 of CCL3, as well as a hydrophobic stacking interaction between Trp89 of Evasin-1 and Phe29 of CCL3. These interactions are specific to the Evasin-1:CCL3 complex and are not conserved in other chemokine-binding protein complexes (Dias2009Structural). The N-terminal region of CCL3 is crucial for binding, with the first six amino acids preceding the CC motif being highly conserved and forming key interactions with Evasin-1 (Dias2009Structural). These interactions highlight the specificity and stability of the Evasin-1:CCL3 complex.
