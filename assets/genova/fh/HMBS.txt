# HMBS

## Overview
The HMBS gene encodes the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase, also known as porphobilinogen deaminase, which plays a pivotal role in the heme biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a synthase and is responsible for the polymerization of porphobilinogen molecules into hydroxymethylbilane, a precursor to heme. The enzyme's structure is highly conserved across species and consists of three domains, with its active site located between the first and second domains. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase operates in the cytoplasm and is essential for the production of heme, a critical component of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins involved in oxygen transport and cellular respiration. Mutations in the HMBS gene can lead to disorders such as acute intermittent porphyria and a rare form of leukoencephalopathy, underscoring its significance in human health (Helliwell2021The; Stutterd2021Expanding; Bung2018Human; Gill2009Structure).

## Structure
The human hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), also known as porphobilinogen deaminase, is a key enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme is composed of three domains, each approximately 110 amino acids in length. The active site, containing a dipyrromethane cofactor, is located between domains 1 and 2 (Gill2009Structure). Domain 1 includes a proposed substrate binding site, while domain 3 features a 29-residue insert unique to mammalian HMBS, forming a β-hairpin structure that contributes to a hydrogen bonding network spanning domains 1 and 3 (Gill2009Structure).

The primary structure of HMBS shows high conservation across species, with significant similarity to the Escherichia coli enzyme (Gill2009Structure). The secondary structure includes a mix of α-helices and β-sheets, with domain 1 and domain 2 both having a five-stranded mainly parallel β-sheet and α-helical segments (Gill2009Structure). The tertiary structure is maintained through compensatory substitutions, despite sequence differences, and is stabilized by various hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Gill2009Structure).

Human HMBS exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing: ubiquitous HMBS (uPBGD) and erythroid HMBS (ePBGD), differing by the presence of the first 17 amino acids in uPBGD (Gill2009Structure). The enzyme functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks quaternary structure (Bustad2023One).

## Function
Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), also known as porphobilinogen deaminase, is a crucial enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the stepwise head-to-tail condensation of four porphobilinogen (PBG) molecules to form the linear tetrapyrrole 1-hydroxymethylbilane (HMB), a precursor to heme (Helliwell2021The; Bung2018Human). This process is essential for the production of heme, a vital component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various cytochromes, which are critical for oxygen transport and cellular respiration (Helliwell2021The; Bung2018Human).

The enzyme's active site, located between its first and second domains, facilitates the polymerization of PBG molecules. Specific residues within the active site are involved in proton transfer and stabilization of the elongating pyrrole chain, ensuring the correct assembly of the tetrapyrrole structure (Bung2018Human). The enzyme operates in the cytoplasm, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining the proper synthesis of heme, which is crucial for various biological processes, including oxygen transport and cellular energy production (Helliwell2021The). Mutations in the HMBS gene can lead to acute intermittent porphyria, highlighting the enzyme's importance in human health (Helliwell2021The; Bung2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HMBS gene are primarily associated with Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by acute neurovisceral attacks. These attacks can be triggered by factors such as certain medications, fasting, and hormonal changes, and manifest as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, and neurological symptoms (Yasuda2019Recent; Chen2016Acute). AIP results from reduced activity of the HMBS enzyme, which is crucial in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Despite the presence of over 415 known mutations in the HMBS gene, the penetrance of symptomatic AIP is low, with only about 1% of heterozygotes experiencing acute attacks (Yasuda2019Recent; Chen2016Acute).

In addition to AIP, biallelic pathogenic variants in the HMBS gene are linked to a rare form of leukoencephalopathy. This condition presents with progressive neurological disease, including spasticity, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy, and is distinct from AIP. MRI findings in affected individuals show abnormalities in the white matter and bilateral thalami (Stutterd2021Expanding). The clinical presentation of HMBS-related leukoencephalopathy differs significantly from AIP, and it remains unclear whether treatments for AIP are beneficial for those with this form of leukoencephalopathy (Stutterd2021Expanding).
