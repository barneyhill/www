# WFS1

## Overview
The WFS1 gene encodes the wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein, which is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. Wolframin is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining ER homeostasis, particularly in pancreatic β-cells and neurons, by regulating calcium homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein biosynthesis, stabilization, folding, and secretion. Mutations in the WFS1 gene are associated with Wolfram syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, and sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, WFS1 mutations have been linked to psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as well as systemic chronic inflammation (Munshani2021The; Li2020Function; Caruso2024Wolfram; Cryns2003Mutational).

## Structure
The WFS1 gene encodes wolframin, a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Wolframin consists of 890 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa (Hofmann2003Wolfram; Kõks2023Genomics). The protein features nine transmembrane domains, with the N-terminus in the cytoplasm and the C-terminus in the ER lumen, following an N cyt/C lum topology (Hofmann2003Wolfram; Yurimoto2009Identification). 

Wolframin is organized into higher molecular weight complexes, likely forming tetramers with a molecular mass of approximately 400 kDa (Hofmann2003Wolfram). The protein undergoes N-glycosylation at specific sites, which is crucial for its stability and proper folding (Hofmann2003Wolfram). 

The N-terminal domain of wolframin contains a calmodulin-binding region, which is important for its function in calcium signaling (Yurimoto2009Identification). Alternative splicing of the WFS1 gene can lead to different isoforms, some of which may affect the protein's function and are associated with Wolfram syndrome (Chimienti2023AWFS1variant).

## Function
The WFS1 gene encodes wolframin, a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. Wolframin plays a crucial role in maintaining ER homeostasis, particularly in pancreatic β-cells, by regulating calcium homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Fonseca2005WFS1; Li2020Function). It is involved in protein biosynthesis, stabilization, folding, maturation, and secretion, and targets SERCA (sacro/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) for proteosomal degradation, indicating its role in protein turnover (Li2020Function).

WFS1 is highly expressed in the brain and pancreas, especially in neurons and islet β-cells, which are significantly affected in Wolfram Syndrome (Li2020Function). In neurons, WFS1 is involved in ER stress signaling pathways and interacts with dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, affecting neurotransmitter transporter expression and release (Li2020Function). The protein also plays a role in the acidification of secretory granules by stabilizing and interacting with the V1A subunit of the H+ V-ATPase, essential for protein secretion (Gharanei2012Vacuolartype). These functions are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing ER stress-related dysfunctions, contributing to the overall health and survival of cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WFS1 gene, which encodes the protein wolframin, are primarily associated with Wolfram syndrome (WS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. WS is characterized by a combination of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, and sensorineural hearing loss. These symptoms are collectively known as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness) (Caruso2024Wolfram; Cryns2003Mutational). The WFS1 gene mutations lead to a loss of function of wolframin, resulting in increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell apoptosis, contributing to the pathogenesis of WS (Gong2021A).

In addition to WS, mutations in WFS1 are linked to psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. These mutations can cause intracellular calcium dysregulation and impaired cell signaling, which are believed to contribute to mood disorders (Munshani2021The). Heterozygous carriers of WFS1 mutations also have an increased risk of mood disorders (Munshani2021The).

WFS1 mutations are also associated with systemic chronic inflammation, characterized by an imbalance in T lymphocytes and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. This inflammatory state is a key feature of WS and may serve as a potential biomarker for tracking disease progression (Panfili2021Novel).

## Interactions
WFS1, also known as wolframin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the Na+/K+ ATPase b1 subunit, a relationship identified in various cell lines, including placental and pancreatic b-cells. This interaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, specifically with the C-terminal domain of wolframin, and is not solely due to ER stress (Zatyka2007Sodiumpotassium).

WFS1 also interacts with the V1A subunit of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase, co-localizing in secretory granules in neuroblastoma cells. This interaction is necessary for the stability of the V1A subunit and is independent of ER stress (Gharanei2012Vacuolartype).

Additionally, wolframin is a novel calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein, with its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain involved in this interaction. The binding is calcium-dependent, and mutations in WFS1 that impair CaM binding are associated with Wolfram syndrome (Yurimoto2009Identification).

WFS1 also negatively regulates the expression of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA), with its depletion leading to increased SERCA activity and altered ATP dynamics in pancreatic cells (Zatyka2014Sarco(endo)plasmic page 3 of 8; Zatyka2014Sarco(endo)plasmic page 2 of 8).
