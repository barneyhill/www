# LGI3

## Overview
The LGI3 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat LGI family member 3, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. This protein is primarily recognized for its role as a pro-inflammatory adipokine, influencing various cellular processes, including inflammation and adipose tissue regulation. LGI3 is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the brain, skin, and adipose tissues, where it interacts with receptors like ADAM22 and ADAM23 to modulate signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, which are crucial for immune and inflammatory responses (Kim2021Integrative; Kim2017Leucinerich). The protein's involvement in cytokine networks and its regulatory effects on inflammatory genes underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stimuli. Alterations in LGI3 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including obesity-related inflammation and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2021Integrative; Kim2019Leucine).

## Function
The LGI3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of inflammation and adipose tissue regulation. LGI3 is involved in the cytokine network, influencing the expression of inflammatory genes and interacting with multiple cytokines and signaling proteins (Kim2017Leucinerich). It is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, skin, and adipose tissues, where it acts as a pro-inflammatory adipokine (Kim2021Integrative).

In adipose tissues, LGI3 is upregulated in obesity and suppresses adipogenesis through its receptor, ADAM23. It regulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and adiponectin, contributing to adipose tissue inflammation (Kim2017Leucinerich). LGI3 also affects intracellular signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, which are crucial for immune and inflammatory responses (Kim2021Integrative).

In keratinocytes, LGI3 is secreted in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, mediated by the NF-κB pathway. This secretion is part of the inflammatory response, with LGI3 interacting with the receptor ADAM22 (Lee2020LGI3). Overall, LGI3 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various stimuli in healthy human cells (Kim2017Leucinerich).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGI3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LGI3 expression is significantly reduced, and this downregulation is associated with poor prognosis. The gene's altered expression affects immune and inflammatory responses, potentially contributing to NSCLC progression through its interaction with receptor ADAM22 and involvement in cytokine networks (Kim2019Leucine). Somatic mutations in LGI3, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, have been identified in NSCLC, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis (Kim2019Leucine).

LGI3 is also involved in metabolic inflammation, particularly in obesity. It acts as a proinflammatory adipokine, upregulating TNF-α and downregulating adiponectin, which may exacerbate inflammatory processes in adipose tissues. This dysregulation is linked to increased expression in obesity, indicating a role in metabolic disorders (Kim2021Integrative). In adipose tissues, LGI3 influences cytokine networks and signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, which are crucial for immune and inflammatory responses (Kim2021Integrative). These findings suggest that LGI3's altered expression or function could contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and various cancers (Kim2017Leucinerich).

## Interactions
LGI3, a member of the leucine-rich repeat LGI family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In human keratinocytes, LGI3 is secreted and interacts with the protein ADAM22. This interaction is enhanced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which activates the TRIF-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to increased LGI3 expression and secretion. The binding of LGI3 to ADAM22 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry, indicating a specific interaction that does not occur with ADAM23 in these cells (Lee2020LGI3).

In adipose tissues, LGI3 interacts with its receptor ADAM23, influencing adipogenesis and inflammatory responses. The protein-protein interaction network involving LGI3 includes cytokines, adipokines, and chemokines, suggesting its role in regulating inflammatory and metabolic processes. LGI3 is associated with signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, which are crucial for immune and inflammatory responses (Kim2021Integrative).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LGI3 is part of a protein interaction network that includes cytokines and chemokines, potentially affecting tumor immunity and inflammation. The downregulation of LGI3 in NSCLC tissues may disrupt these networks, impacting cancer progression (Kim2019Leucine).
