# NUDT17

## Overview
NUDT17 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 17, a member of the nudix hydrolase family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, playing a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism and cellular stress response regulation. Nudix hydrolase 17 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in mRNA decapping, a process that involves the cleavage of the pyrophosphate linkage in mRNA molecules, potentially influencing mRNA stability and turnover (Grudzien‐Nogalska2016New). Although the specific functions of NUDT17 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, its expression in specific tissues such as glandular breast cells and seminiferous ducts suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). The gene has also been associated with various diseases, including gout and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research and drug development (Wei2022Comprehensive; Chang2022Polygenic).

## Function
NUDT17 is a member of the nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in hydrolyzing nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in nucleotide metabolism and the regulation of cellular stress responses. Although the specific function of NUDT17 in healthy human cells is not fully characterized, it is suggested to have mRNA decapping activity, potentially playing a role in mRNA regulation by cleaving the pyrophosphate linkage between the α-and β-phosphates to generate m7GDP and pRNA (Grudzien‐Nogalska2016New).

NUDT17 is also considered an uncharacterized protein with no known function in healthy cells, though it may act on nucleotide-containing molecules (Wang2017NUDT). Its expression patterns show cytoplasmic/membranous staining in glandular breast cells and seminiferous ducts in the testis, indicating its presence in specific tissues (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Despite the lack of detailed functional insights, NUDT17's potential involvement in RNA decapping and nucleotide metabolism suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and possibly influencing cellular responses to stress. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise biological functions and mechanisms in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
NUDT17 has been implicated in several diseases due to its genetic variations and expression alterations. In the context of gout, a genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the NUDT17 gene and male gout, particularly highlighting the variant rs9286836. This variant, with the genotype A/A, is associated with a high odds ratio, indicating a substantial risk factor for developing gout (Chang2022Polygenic). 

In cancer research, NUDT17 has been studied for its role in immune signaling pathways. It shares expression patterns with m7Gscore, a metric derived from m7G regulator gene sets, which is linked to poor survival outcomes in certain cancers like liver and lung cancer (Wei2022Comprehensive). Additionally, NUDT17 is characterized by heterozygous amplification in copy number variation (CNV) studies, which can affect gene expression and play a fundamental role in cancer progression (Wei2022Comprehensive).

The druggability of NUDT17 has also been assessed, with studies indicating a high potential for pharmacological targeting. This suggests that NUDT17 could be a promising target for drug development, particularly in the context of diseases where its normal function is disrupted (Michel2020In).
