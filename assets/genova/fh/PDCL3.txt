# PDCL3

## Overview
PDCL3 is a gene that encodes the protein phosducin-like 3, which functions as a chaperone protein. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), a critical receptor in angiogenesis. Phosducin-like 3 facilitates the proper folding and maturation of VEGFR-2 within the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing its degradation and ensuring its stability and function. This chaperone activity is particularly important under hypoxic conditions, where PDCL3 expression is upregulated to enhance VEGFR-2 stability, promoting angiogenesis. Additionally, phosducin-like 3 interacts with the TCP-1 complex, playing a role in actin folding, which is essential for smooth muscle contractility. The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and congenital disorders affecting smooth muscle function (Liang2024PDCL3; Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced; Billon2020Fetal).

## Function
PDCL3 (phosducin-like 3) is a chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), a key receptor in angiogenesis. PDCL3 interacts with VEGFR-2 primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, which is essential for the proper folding and maturation of VEGFR-2 (Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced). This interaction stabilizes VEGFR-2 by binding to its juxtamembrane domain, inhibiting its degradation and increasing VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, which is vital for endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Srinivasan2013Identification).

PDCL3 is also involved in the regulation of VEGFR-2 expression under hypoxic conditions, where it is upregulated, enhancing VEGFR-2 stability and function, thereby promoting angiogenesis (Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced). The protein is active in both the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic compartments, assisting in the folding of VEGFR-2 by reducing its aggregation under stress conditions (Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced). PDCL3's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining VEGFR-2 abundance and function, which are critical for angiogenesis-related physiological processes (Srinivasan2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDCL3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high PDCL3 expression is associated with poor prognosis. It enhances the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and is linked to the Hippo pathway and YAP expression, which are involved in cancer progression. High PDCL3 expression also correlates with increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting a suppressive immune microenvironment in HCC. Targeting PDCL3 could potentially reduce TP53 mutations and improve immune function, offering a therapeutic strategy for HCC (Liang2024PDCL3).

PDCL3 has also been identified as a novel candidate gene associated with an autosomal recessive form of Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS). Complete loss-of-function variants in PDCL3 disrupt smooth muscle contractility, contributing to the MMIHS phenotype. This is due to PDCL3's role in actin folding, which is crucial for smooth muscle function (Billon2020Fetal).

In the context of angiogenesis, PDCL3 regulates VEGFR-2 expression and stability, promoting angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions. Alterations in PDCL3 expression or its interaction with VEGFR-2 could significantly impact pathological conditions like cancer or retinopathy, where angiogenesis is a factor (Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced).

## Interactions
PDCL3 (phosducin-like 3) is a chaperone protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) expression and stability. It interacts with VEGFR-2 primarily within the intracellular environment, particularly at the endoplasmic reticulum, where it assists in the proper folding and maturation of the receptor. This interaction is crucial for preventing VEGFR-2 misfolding and degradation, thereby maintaining its stability and function (Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced).

PDCL3 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal methionine acetylation, which affects its stability and interaction with VEGFR-2. Acetylation-resistant PDCL3 constructs demonstrate increased stability and a stronger interaction with VEGFR-2, reducing its ubiquitination and potentially enhancing VEGFR-2-dependent angiogenesis (Srinivasan2015Hypoxiainduced).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, PDCL3 has been identified as a co-chaperone in protein folding, specifically binding to the TCP-1 protein, a chaperone of the TCP-1 complex (CCT). This interaction is crucial for actin folding, a necessary process for actin to achieve its native form and polymerize into thin filaments, which is essential for smooth muscle contractility (Billon2020Fetal).
