# S100A13

## Overview
S100A13 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A13, a member of the S100 family of proteins known for their role in calcium ion binding through EF-hand motifs. The S100A13 protein is characterized by its ability to bind both calcium and copper ions, which is crucial for its involvement in the non-classical secretion pathways of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and interleukin-1α (IL-1α). These pathways are significant for processes such as angiogenesis and cellular stress responses. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and synaptotagmin-1, further underscore its multifunctional role in cellular homeostasis and stress response. S100A13 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including atypical pulmonary fibrosis and cancer, where it influences disease progression and therapeutic resistance (Donato2012Functions; AlMutairy2019An; Sivaraja2006Copper).

## Structure
The S100A13 protein is a member of the S100 family, characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions through EF-hand motifs. The protein consists of 98 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 11 kDa (Imai2006Crystallization). The primary structure includes two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures crucial for calcium binding (Imai2008Structure). Each EF-hand motif consists of two alpha-helices and a calcium-binding loop, with the N-terminal EF-hand comprising helix 1, a calcium-binding loop, and helix 2, and the C-terminal EF-hand comprising helix 3, another calcium-binding loop, and helix 4 (Imai2008Structure).

In its quaternary structure, S100A13 forms a homodimer, with each protomer binding two calcium ions. Dimerization is facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Imai2008Structure). The protein can also bind copper ions, which are essential for its role in the nonclassical secretion of fibroblast growth factor-1 and interleukin 1 (Sivaraja2006Copper). The binding of calcium and copper ions induces distinct conformational changes, with calcium binding leading to a more compact structure (Sivaraja2006Copper). S100A13 does not expose hydrophobic patches upon calcium binding, a feature that distinguishes it from other S100 proteins (Imai2008Structure).

## Function
S100A13 is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, S100A13 plays a crucial role in the non-classical secretion pathway of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and interleukin-1α (IL-1α). This pathway is significant for processes such as angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for tissue repair and regeneration (Donato2012Functions). S100A13 is known to interact with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) on endothelial cells, which may facilitate its intracellular translocation and contribute to its role in cellular stress responses (Donato2012Functions; Singh2022Multifunctional).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell growth and differentiation. Its ability to bind calcium is a key feature that enables S100A13 to participate in these cellular processes (Donato2012Functions). Through its interactions and regulatory functions, S100A13 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stress, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the S100A13 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably atypical pulmonary fibrosis and various cancers. In atypical pulmonary fibrosis, mutations in S100A13, along with S100A3, are associated with impaired calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. These mutations lead to reduced protein expression, altered calcium signaling, and increased mitochondrial mass and hyperpolarization, contributing to the disease pathology (AlMutairy2019An; AlMutairy2023Wildtype). The mutations result in significant reductions in protein expression, affecting extracellular matrix remodeling, a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AlMutairy2019An).

In cancer, S100A13 is linked to tumor progression and angiogenesis. In melanoma, S100A13 expression is associated with chemotherapy resistance and is upregulated in more aggressive tumors, correlating with angiogenic markers like VEGF-A (Massi2010S100A13; Azimi2014Proteomics). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high S100A13 expression is linked to poor overall survival and immune infiltration, suggesting its role in immune response modulation (Zheng2021Comprehensive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of S100A13 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
S100A13 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with p40 synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) in a calcium-dependent manner, forming a hetero-oligomeric complex. This interaction is significant for the non-classical release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as prothymosin alpha (ProTα) and S100A13 itself under stress conditions. The interaction between S100A13 and Syt-1 is facilitated by SNARE proteins, which are essential for the vesicular transport and release of these proteins (Matsunaga2020Involvement).

S100A13 also plays a role in the copper-dependent nonclassical secretion of signal peptideless proteins like fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1). It binds to copper ions, which is necessary for the formation of the FGF-1 homodimer and its subsequent secretion. S100A13 may act as a source of copper ions for the organization of the FGF-1 multiprotein release complex, interacting with the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1, which binds copper with high affinity (Sivaraja2006Copper).

These interactions highlight the role of S100A13 in cellular stress responses and its involvement in the nonclassical export of proteins, mediated through its binding with metal ions and other proteins.
