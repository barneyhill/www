# ZNF775

## Overview
ZNF775 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 775, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression, cell differentiation, and development. The protein encoded by ZNF775 is implicated in the regulation of transcriptional networks, playing a role in modulating gene expression patterns in different biological contexts. Research has demonstrated that alterations in the expression of ZNF775 are associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhou2020<p>Prognostic; Tao2024Development; Zhang2021Pivotal; Wang2012Parentoforigin).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF775 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or genetic variations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF775 is part of a panel of transcription factors whose elevated expression in tumor tissues correlates with poorer clinical outcomes. It serves as a significant prognostic marker, with higher expression levels associated with reduced patient survival rates (Zhou2020<p>Prognostic). In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZNF775 is included in a five-gene prognostic model that predicts overall survival. The model identifies patients with negative outcomes, and ZNF775's expression is notably reduced in high-risk groups, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Tao2024Development).

In melanoma, ZNF775 is significantly upregulated in regulatory T cells within metastatic tumors, indicating its potential involvement in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and tumor progression (Zhang2021Pivotal). Additionally, in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a specific SNP within ZNF775 shows strong paternal transmission effects, suggesting a genetic contribution to the disorder (Wang2012Parentoforigin). These findings highlight the diverse roles of ZNF775 in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its clinical significance.
