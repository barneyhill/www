# ZSCAN29

## Overview
ZSCAN29 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 29 protein, which functions as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and a SCAN domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. ZSCAN29 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and is implicated in various biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and metabolic responses. It has been associated with several disease states, such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, and psychiatric disorders, through its involvement in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (FragosoOntiveros2012Gene; Schagdarsurengin2021Tracing; Xia2019Common). The protein's ability to interact with other proteins and pathways underscores its significance in cellular processes and its potential impact on health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN29 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its involvement in genetic and splicing variations. In the context of lung cancer, ZSCAN29 was identified as one of the germline-regulated genes from the GWAS Catalog SNPs, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility (O’Brien2018Weak). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ZSCAN29 is noted for having a de novo (cryptic) exon involved in splicing variations, which may contribute to genomic instability and the activation of the DNA damage response in ALS motor neurons (Ziff2022Genome; Ziff2022Metaanalysis). This splicing alteration is part of a broader pattern of dysregulated alternative splicing observed in ALS, which is linked to genome instability and may play a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Ziff2023Integrated).

ZSCAN29 is also listed among genetic variants shared by five major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. This suggests that ZSCAN29 may have a broader impact on neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions (Xia2019Common). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in diverse pathological processes through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.

## Interactions
ZSCAN29 is a zinc finger transcription factor that participates in various interactions influencing gene expression. In the context of HPV18 E6 protein expression, ZSCAN29 was identified as one of the genes with significant upregulation, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation processes associated with carcinogenesis (FragosoOntiveros2012Gene). 

In prostate cancer, ZSCAN29 is one of the transcription factors with binding motifs in the TET1 promoter and other TET1-coactivated genes. This indicates that ZSCAN29 may interact with TET1, a protein involved in DNA demethylation, thereby influencing gene expression through epigenetic modifications (Schagdarsurengin2021Tracing). 

Additionally, dietary interventions have shown that the ZSCAN29 protein can be upregulated in response to specific dietary components, such as high monounsaturated fatty acids, in patients with metabolic syndrome. This suggests that ZSCAN29 may interact with other proteins or pathways involved in metabolic regulation (RangelZúñiga2015Proteome). 

These interactions highlight the role of ZSCAN29 in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and metabolic responses, potentially contributing to its involvement in disease states like cancer and metabolic syndrome.
