# ZBTB16

## Overview
ZBTB16 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 protein, also known as Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger protein (PLZF). This protein is a transcription factor characterized by its BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and multiple C2H2 zinc finger domains that enable DNA binding. ZBTB16 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including neurogenesis, osteogenesis, and autophagy regulation. It acts as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in chromatin remodeling, influencing the expression of genes critical for cellular differentiation and development. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are mediated by CRBN modulators targeting specific zinc finger domains for degradation. ZBTB16's diverse roles in cellular regulation and its involvement in diseases such as cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and osteoporosis highlight its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Mance2024Dynamic; Krontira2024Human; Yu2023Super; Matyskiela2020Cereblon).

## Structure
ZBTB16, also known as Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger protein (PLZF), is a transcription factor characterized by its BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain at the N terminus and multiple C2H2 zinc finger (ZnF) domains at the C terminus. The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and can mediate homodimerization, although it does not form higher-order assemblies like some other ZBTB proteins (Mance2024Dynamic). The ZnF domains facilitate DNA binding, with ZBTB16 containing nine such domains. Six of these ZnF domains have a glycine at a critical position, acting as structural degrons for CRBN modulators, which target the protein for degradation (Matyskiela2020Cereblon).

ZBTB16 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which is crucial for its degradation. This process is mediated by CRBN modulators like CC-3060 and CC-647, which promote the ubiquitination of specific ZnF domains (Matyskiela2020Cereblon). The protein can also exist in multiple splice variants, contributing to its functional diversity. These structural features and modifications play significant roles in the protein's function as a transcriptional repressor and its involvement in chromatin remodeling.

## Function
The ZBTB16 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including neurogenesis, osteogenesis, and autophagy regulation. In the context of human cortical neurogenesis, ZBTB16 is crucial for regulating the balance between progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. It is dynamically expressed in progenitor cells during early stages of neurogenesis, promoting the proliferation of these cells and the production of upper-layer neurons (Krontira2024Human). ZBTB16 also interacts with glucocorticoids to sustain the expression of PAX6, a gene essential for neocortical development, by activating its promoter (Krontira2024Human).

In osteogenesis, ZBTB16 is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, which are vital for bone formation and maintenance. It is regulated by super enhancers and interacts with transcription factors like Osterix to promote the expression of osteogenic markers (Yu2023Super; Onizuka2016ZBTB16). ZBTB16's expression is upregulated during osteogenic differentiation, contributing to bone density and structure (Yu2023Super).

ZBTB16 also regulates autophagy by mediating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ATG14L, a key protein in autophagosome formation. This regulation is influenced by G-protein-coupled receptors, which modulate autophagy through ZBTB16's interaction with the CUL3-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase complex (Zhang2015Gproteincoupled).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZBTB16 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, a missense mutation in ZBTB16 has been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while a nonsense mutation has been reported in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ). These mutations are linked to social impairments, repetitive behaviors, and cognitive deficits, as well as abnormalities in neocortical development (Usui2021Zbtb16).

In cancer, ZBTB16 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, where its expression is often downregulated due to promoter methylation. Restoration of ZBTB16 expression in breast cancer cells can lead to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and reduced migration and invasion, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (He2020BTB/POZ).

ZBTB16 is also implicated in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Overexpression in brown adipocytes enhances mitochondrial function and reduces triglyceride content, while knockdown promotes adipogenesis. In cardiovascular contexts, ZBTB16 is involved in regulating mineralocorticoid action, potentially affecting conditions like hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy (ŠEDA2017ZBTB16).

In osteoporosis, ZBTB16 expression is reduced, affecting mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis. Targeting ZBTB16 with gene therapy has shown potential in protecting against low bone mass and impaired bone repair (Yu2023Super).

## Interactions
ZBTB16, also known as PLZF, is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the CUL3-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase complex, acting as an adaptor to mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ATG14L, a key protein in autophagy regulation (Zhang2015Gproteincoupled). This interaction is modulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which influence the phosphorylation of ZBTB16, affecting its ability to regulate autophagy (Zhang2015Gproteincoupled).

ZBTB16 also forms complexes with other proteins in the ZBTB family, such as ZBTB28 and BCL6. In breast cancer, ZBTB16 acts as a tumor suppressor by upregulating ZBTB28 and antagonizing BCL6, which is an oncogene. These interactions suggest that ZBTB16 may form heterodimers with ZBTB28 or BCL6, contributing to its tumor suppressor effects (He2020BTB/POZ).

In the context of acute promyelocytic leukemia, ZBTB16 is targeted for degradation by Cereblon modulators, such as CC-3060 and CC-647, which engage distinct structural degrons on its zinc finger domains (Matyskiela2020Cereblon). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ZBTB16 in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
