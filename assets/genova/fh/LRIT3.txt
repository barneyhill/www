# LRIT3

## Overview
The LRIT3 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat, Ig-like and transmembrane domains 3, which is a transmembrane protein crucial for visual function. This protein is predominantly expressed in the retina, where it plays a vital role in the organization and function of the postsynaptic signaling complex in both rod and cone depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) (Hasan2019Presynaptic; Gregg2022LRIT3). LRIT3 is essential for the proper localization of key proteins such as TRPM1, mGluR6, and nyctalopin at the synapse, facilitating normal synaptic transmission and visual signal processing (Neuillé2014Lrit3; Hasan2020LRIT3). Mutations in the LRIT3 gene are linked to congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), underscoring its critical role in maintaining normal visual function (Gregg2022LRIT3; Hasan2020LRIT3).

## Function
The LRIT3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the visual system, particularly in the retina. It is essential for the organization of the postsynaptic signaling complex in both rod and cone depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) (Hasan2019Presynaptic; Gregg2022LRIT3). In rod photoreceptors, LRIT3 is necessary for the proper localization of the TRPM1 channel in the postsynaptic membrane of bipolar cells, which is crucial for dim-light vision and the assembly of the postsynaptic signaling complex (Hasan2019Presynaptic). The absence of LRIT3 disrupts the trafficking of TRPM1, leading to impaired retinal function, specifically affecting scotopic (low-light) vision (Hasan2019Presynaptic).

In cone pathways, LRIT3 is required for the localization of several proteins, including mGluR6, GPR179, TRPM1, and Nyctalopin, at the cone to cone DBC synapse, which is essential for mediating excitatory inputs to downstream circuitry (Gregg2022LRIT3). LRIT3 acts transsynaptically, influencing the organization of postsynaptic components from the presynaptic side, and is involved in the ON and OFF pathway signaling in the retina (Hasan2019Presynaptic; Hasan2020LRIT3). Its role is crucial for maintaining normal visual function and signal transduction in the retina.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRIT3 gene are associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), a non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by impaired night vision. This condition results from disruptions in synaptic signaling between photoreceptors and depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) in the retina. Specifically, mutations in LRIT3 lead to a loss of function in the gene, which is crucial for the assembly of the post-synaptic signaling complex at the dendritic tips of DBCs (Gregg2022LRIT3; Hasan2020LRIT3).

In canine models, a 1 base pair deletion in LRIT3 has been identified, which introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that lacks several functional domains. This mutation co-segregates with the CSNB phenotype, indicating a direct link between the LRIT3 deletion and the disease (Das2019Genomewide). The absence of LRIT3 affects the localization of critical proteins like TRPM1 and nyctalopin, which are essential for normal visual signaling. This disruption leads to the characteristic 'no b-wave' phenotype observed in electroretinograms (ERG) of affected individuals (Neuillé2014Lrit3; Hasan2020LRIT3).

Research in mouse models has further demonstrated that LRIT3 is necessary for the proper expression of nyctalopin and the organization of the postsynaptic glutamate signaling complex, highlighting its role as a trans-synaptic organizer (Hasan2019Presynaptic; Gregg2022LRIT3).

## Interactions
LRIT3 is involved in several critical interactions within the retina, particularly in the organization of the postsynaptic glutamate signaling complex. It interacts with TRPM1, a non-selective cation channel, and is essential for its proper localization at the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells (Hasan2019Presynaptic; Neuillé2014Lrit3). LRIT3 also interacts with nyctalopin, a protein necessary for normal visual function, and this interaction is crucial for the expression and localization of TRPM1 (Hasan2020LRIT3). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that LRIT3 and nyctalopin physically interact, which is vital for the proper assembly of the postsynaptic signalplex (Hasan2020LRIT3).

LRIT3 is part of a complex network involving other proteins such as mGluR6 and GPR179, which are components of the signalplex at the synapse between photoreceptors and bipolar cells. This network is essential for the transsynaptic organization of the postsynaptic elements, ensuring proper synaptic transmission and visual signal processing (Hasan2019Presynaptic; Gregg2022LRIT3). The absence of LRIT3 disrupts these interactions, leading to significant deficits in visual function, as observed in models of complete congenital stationary night blindness (Neuillé2017LRIT3).
