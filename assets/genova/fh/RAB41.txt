# RAB41

## Overview
RAB41 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB41. This protein is categorized as a regulator of intracellular trafficking, playing a pivotal role in the organization and function of the Golgi apparatus. RAB41 is essential for efficient endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi ribbon, which is crucial for the cellular secretory pathway. The protein interacts with various effectors, including dynactin 6 and syntaxin 8, to facilitate membrane trafficking and Golgi organization. Additionally, RAB41 is implicated in processes such as xenophagy, where it interacts with proteins like VPS4 and TOM1L2, highlighting its diverse functional roles in cellular homeostasis and immune responses (Liu2013Rab41; Nozawa2023Rab41mediated; Liu2016Identification).

## Function
Rab41 is a critical regulator of Golgi apparatus organization and is essential for efficient ER-to-Golgi trafficking and cell growth in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi ribbon, a key component of the cellular secretory pathway. Depletion of Rab41 leads to fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus into short, isolated stacks and an accumulation of Golgi-associated vesicles, indicating its importance in Golgi maintenance (Liu2013Rab41).

Rab41 is involved in ER-to-Golgi and overall ER-to-plasma membrane trafficking, facilitating the transport of proteins such as the VSV-G protein. Its depletion results in slower ER-to-Golgi transport and reduced cell surface accumulation of these proteins, underscoring its role in normal trafficking processes (Liu2013Rab41).

Rab41 also interacts with effector proteins like dynactin 6 and syntaxin 8, which are involved in membrane trafficking and contribute to Golgi organization. These interactions are stronger when Rab41 is in its GTP-locked form, suggesting that its active state is crucial for its function in Golgi maintenance (Liu2016Identification). Rab41's role in these processes is distinct from other Rab VI subfamily members, such as Rab6, highlighting its unique contribution to cellular organization and function (Liu2013Rab41).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB41 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), RAB41 expression is upregulated by circFAM126A, which is transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor SP1. This upregulation promotes OSCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. The mechanism involves circFAM126A enhancing the expression and mRNA stability of RAB41 by interacting with miR-186 and the RNA-binding protein FUS. Knockdown of circFAM126A suppresses these oncogenic processes, while overexpression of RAB41 counteracts the effects of circFAM126A knockdown, indicating its role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OSCC cells (Wang2022SP1Mediated).

While the clinical significance of RAB41 gene mutations or expression alterations in other diseases is not directly addressed, its involvement in cellular processes such as Golgi apparatus organization and membrane trafficking suggests potential implications in other pathological conditions. The gene's role in maintaining autolysosomal integrity and its interaction with proteins like VPS4 during xenophagy highlight its importance in cellular homeostasis and immune responses, which could be relevant in disease contexts (Nozawa2023Rab41mediated).

## Interactions
RAB41, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and cellular processes. One of the key interactions of RAB41 is with VPS4, an AAA-ATPase essential for the disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex. This interaction is unique as it occurs in a GTPase-independent manner, which is atypical for Rab proteins. The S94 residue in RAB41 is critical for its binding to VPS4, which is necessary for recruiting VPS4 to xenophagolysosomes, a process important for membrane repair during xenophagy (Nozawa2023Rab41mediated).

RAB41 also interacts with TOM1L2, an adaptor protein that plays a role in the ESCRT-mediated repair process in xenophagy. This interaction is important for targeting RAB41 to damaged autolysosomes and xenophagolysosomes (Nozawa2023Rab41mediated).

In the context of Golgi organization, RAB41 interacts with several effectors, including dynactin 6 and syntaxin 8. These proteins preferentially bind to the GTP-locked form of RAB41 and are involved in maintaining Golgi ribbon structure. The interaction with dynactin 6, a dynein motor subunit, is particularly significant for Golgi organization (Liu2016Identification).
