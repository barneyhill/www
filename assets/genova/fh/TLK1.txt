# TLK1

## Overview
The TLK1 gene encodes the protein tousled like kinase 1, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in DNA replication, repair, and chromatin remodeling. As a kinase, TLK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of various substrates, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression. The protein is most active during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it contributes to chromatin assembly and the DNA damage response. TLK1's interactions with other proteins, such as NEK1 and Rad9, underscore its importance in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. Dysregulation of TLK1 expression and activity has been implicated in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Sillje1999Mammalian; Singh2017Identification; Carrera2003Tousledlike).

## Structure
The human Tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Its molecular structure includes several key features. The primary structure of TLK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific domains such as the kinase domain and coiled-coil domains (West2024Autophosphorylation). The secondary structure of TLK1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as indicated by the presence of these structures in the related hTLK1B protein, which shares structural conservation with TLK1 (Bhoir2018High).

The tertiary structure of TLK1 is characterized by its ability to form dimers through an intact coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its function and recruitment to damaged chromatin (West2024Autophosphorylation). The quaternary structure involves the formation of homo- and heterodimers with TLK2, facilitated by the coiled-coil 1 domain (West2024Autophosphorylation).

Post-translational modifications, particularly autophosphorylation at the N-terminus, play a significant role in regulating TLK1's activity and recruitment to DNA damage sites (West2024Autophosphorylation). The N-terminus is highly phosphorylated, which is necessary for its recruitment to damaged chromatin (West2024Autophosphorylation).

## Function
TLK1 (tousled like kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in DNA replication, repair, and chromatin remodeling in healthy human cells. It is most active during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it is involved in the phosphorylation of substrates such as ASF1, a histone chaperone, which is crucial for chromatin assembly during DNA replication (Sillje1999Mammalian; Silljé2001Identification). TLK1's activity is tightly linked to ongoing DNA replication, and its inactivation occurs rapidly when DNA replication is inhibited, indicating its essential role in these processes (Sillje1999Mammalian).

TLK1 is localized in the nucleus during interphase, where it contributes to genomic stability by facilitating the assembly of chromatin onto newly replicated DNA (Sillje1999Mammalian; Carrera2003Tousledlike). This kinase is also involved in the DNA damage response, as its activity is modulated by DNA-damaging agents and replication stress, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic integrity (Silljé2001Identification; Groth2003Human). TLK1's function in chromatin dynamics is essential for the faithful transmission of epigenetic states during DNA replication, highlighting its importance in cell cycle regulation and development (Carrera2003Tousledlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TLK1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Overexpression of TLK1 is observed in various cancers, including breast, prostate, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), often correlating with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Ibrahim2020Knockdown; Singh2017Identification). In prostate cancer, TLK1 is involved in the regulation of AKT activation, a pathway crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. This interaction is particularly relevant in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), where TLK1 enhances AKT phosphorylation, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (Khalil2021Interaction).

In breast cancer, elevated expression of TLK1B, a splice variant of TLK1, is associated with poor response to radiation therapy and doxorubicin, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (De2012The). TLK1B's role in DNA repair, particularly in facilitating the repair of double-strand breaks, contributes to radioresistance in cancer cells (SunavalaDossabhoy2005The). Targeting TLK1 with specific inhibitors has been proposed as a strategy to enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies by impairing DNA repair and checkpoint recovery (Ronald2013Phenothiazine).

## Interactions
TLK1 (tousled like kinase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. TLK1 interacts with NEK1, a kinase involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). This interaction is enhanced following oxidative stress, where TLK1 phosphorylates NEK1 at T141, increasing NEK1's activity, which is essential for the activation of ATR and Chk1, key components of the DDR pathway (Singh2017Identification).

TLK1 also interacts with Rad9, a protein involved in the DNA damage-activated checkpoint/repair response. TLK1 phosphorylates Rad9, promoting the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. This interaction is significant for processing the ends of DSBs before ligation and is crucial for cell cycle checkpoint mediation (SunavalaDossabhoy2009Tousled; Canfield2009TLK1B).

In prostate cancer, TLK1 interacts with AKTIP, which is crucial for AKT activation. TLK1 phosphorylates AKTIP, enhancing the association of AKT with PDK1 and its phosphorylation at T308 and S473, which are critical for AKT activation. This interaction plays a role in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Khalil2021Interaction).
