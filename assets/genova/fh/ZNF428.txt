# ZNF428

## Overview
ZNF428 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 428, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, acting as a transcription factor that can influence various biological processes. Zinc finger protein 428 plays a crucial role in cellular functions by modulating the expression of target genes, and it has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts. The gene's expression and regulatory mechanisms are of particular interest in the study of complex diseases, such as schizophrenia and liver cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Tiwary2012The; BarreiroAlonso2019Characterization; Ashouri2021Characterization; Salehi2021Integration; Chen2022Potential).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF428 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in gene expression and network connectivity. In schizophrenia, ZNF428 is identified as a central hub gene with increased connectivity compared to healthy networks, suggesting its significant role in the disorder's genetic network (Tiwary2012The). In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF428 is part of a novel 7-autoantibody panel used for detection, particularly in AFP-negative cases, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis (Chen2022Potential).

In prostate cancer research, ZNF428 interacts with HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins in noncancerous epithelial cells, although its biological function in this context remains unknown. These interactions suggest potential pathobiological implications, although no direct involvement in prostate cancer has been established (BarreiroAlonso2019Characterization).

Additionally, an eQTL association analysis identified significant cis eQTL insertions affecting ZNF428 expression, highlighting the regulatory mechanisms that may influence its role in various conditions. However, specific diseases related to these changes in ZNF428 expression were not detailed (Ashouri2021Characterization). In human spermatogenesis, ZNF428 is up-regulated in somatic and undifferentiated spermatogonia, indicating its involvement in this process (Salehi2021Integration).
