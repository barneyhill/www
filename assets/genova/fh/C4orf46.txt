# C4orf46

## Overview
C4orf46, or Chromosome 4 open reading frame 46, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which remains largely uncharacterized in terms of its specific biological functions. The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. It has been identified as a potential molecular marker due to its differential expression in certain cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer, where it may play a role in tumor differentiation and immune response modulation (YU2014Expression; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite its emerging significance in oncology, further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional roles and mechanisms of C4orf46 in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C4orf46, also known as Renal Cancer Differentiation Gene 1 (RCDG1), has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), especially the aggressive clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), C4orf46 is significantly downregulated compared to adjacent normal tissues. This downregulation is even more pronounced in ccRCC tissues compared to non-ccRCC tissues, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis and differentiation of RCC. The expression of C4orf46 is negatively correlated with the Fuhrman grade in ccRCC, indicating its potential as a molecular marker for RCC diagnosis and prognosis (YU2014Expression).

In the context of bladder cancer, C4orf46 is part of an eight-gene signature used for prognostic evaluation. This signature helps distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients, although the specific role of C4orf46 in bladder cancer remains to be fully elucidated (Yan2020Construction).

Additionally, C4orf46 has been associated with tumor immune cell infiltration in thymoma, suggesting a role in the immune response within the tumor microenvironment (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, its precise clinical significance in this context is not yet fully understood.
