# SNTN

## Overview
SNTN is a gene that encodes the sentan protein, a crucial component of the cilia apical structure. Sentan is categorized as a structural protein, playing a vital role in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are essential for various cellular functions, including movement and fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. The protein is particularly important in ciliated and ependymal cells, contributing to the stability and function of cilia by acting as a component of the linker structure that bridges ciliary membranes and peripheral singlet microtubules. This structural integrity is critical for maintaining the surface mucous membrane and clearing airways of inhaled contaminants, thereby playing a significant role in respiratory health (Rodrigo2022Ependymal; Lindskog2014The). Dysfunction in SNTN can lead to conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Function
SNTN, also known as sentan, is a cilia apical structure protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells. In healthy human cells, SNTN is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia by acting as a component of the linker structure that bridges ciliary membranes and peripheral singlet microtubules. This structural role is essential for the proper functioning of cilia, which are important for maintaining the surface mucous membrane and clearing airways of inhaled contaminants (Lindskog2014The).

SNTN is expressed in ciliated cells, where it contributes to the stability of the cilia's apical region, impacting processes such as cell movement and fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. The protein's expression is also noted in ependymal cells of the spinal cord, where it is associated with the maturation and potential plasticity of these cells, suggesting a role in maintaining the spinal cord's structural integrity and response to injury (Rodrigo2022Ependymal). Dysfunction in ciliary proteins like SNTN can lead to diseases with severe pulmonary dysfunction, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting its importance in respiratory health (Lindskog2014The).
