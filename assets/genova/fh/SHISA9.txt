# SHISA9

## Overview
SHISA9 is a gene that encodes the protein shisa family member 9, also known as CKAMP44, which is a type-I transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission in the brain. This protein is primarily expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and is notably abundant in GABAergic interneurons. SHISA9 plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity by interacting with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at postsynaptic sites, influencing their gating properties and thereby affecting synaptic signaling and plasticity. The protein is characterized by a C-terminal PDZ-ligand motif, which facilitates interactions with various PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as PSD95 and GRIP1, essential for synaptic trafficking and scaffolding. These interactions are crucial for maintaining efficient synaptic transmission and are implicated in learning and memory processes (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary; Karataeva2014CTerminal).

## Structure
SHISA9, also known as CKAMP44, is a type-I single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains an extracellular cysteine-rich domain, which is crucial for its function and potentially involved in forming disulfide bonds (Pei2012Unexpected). The protein also has a proline-rich intracellular region and a C-terminal PDZ type II binding motif, specifically the sequence Glu-Val-Thr-Val (EVTV), which is essential for interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins (Karataeva2014CTerminal). 

SHISA9 interacts with AMPA receptors, modulating their gating properties and influencing synaptic transmission (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). The protein's C-terminal PDZ-ligand motif is critical for its interaction with various cytosolic proteins, including PSD95 and GRIP1, which are important for synaptic and network functions (Karataeva2014CTerminal). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, affecting SHISA9's function and localization, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. The protein's structure and interactions suggest its role as an adaptor protein in the regulation of AMPA receptor localization and function (Pei2012Unexpected).

## Function
SHISA9, also known as CKAMP44, is a type-I transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in modulating synaptic transmission in the brain. It is primarily expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and is most abundant in GABAergic interneurons. SHISA9 interacts with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at postsynaptic sites, influencing synaptic plasticity by modulating AMPAR gating properties, such as deactivation and desensitization rates (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). 

The protein contains a C-terminal PDZ-ligand motif, which allows it to interact with various PDZ domain-containing proteins, including PSD95, PSD93, PICK1, GRIP1, and Lin7b. These interactions are crucial for synaptic trafficking and postsynaptic scaffolding, affecting synaptic signaling and plasticity (Karataeva2014CTerminal). Disruption of SHISA9's interactions with PDZ domain proteins can alter AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents, leading to changes in deactivation kinetics and recovery from desensitization (Karataeva2014CTerminal).

SHISA9's role in synaptic function is further highlighted by its involvement in AMPAR surface expression. It increases AMPAR surface expression in dentate gyrus granule cells, which is essential for efficient synaptic transmission and plasticity (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). These molecular activities of SHISA9 are critical for maintaining healthy neuronal function and are implicated in learning and memory processes.

## Clinical Significance
SHISA9 has been implicated in schizophrenia through differential expression analysis. In a study examining the expression levels of genome-wide significant genes in the brains of schizophrenia cases and controls, SHISA9 showed a trend of upregulation in individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls, with a P value of 0.053. This suggests that alterations in the expression level of SHISA9 may be associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia (Liu2021Genomewide).

SHISA9 is also related to major depression, as indicated by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It is known to counteract Shisa6, another member of the Shisa family, which is involved in depression-related pathways. In socially susceptible mice, SHISA9 shows a decreased trend of expression in D1 medium spiny neurons, suggesting its potential involvement in depression-related pathways (Kim2021Shisa6).

While the specific clinical significance of SHISA9 mutations or expression alterations is not detailed, SHISA9 is involved in desensitizing AMPA receptors in the plasma membrane. This role suggests that SHISA9 may act as an adaptor protein that regulates receptor localization or function, potentially impacting neurological conditions (Pei2012Unexpected).

## Interactions
SHISA9, also known as CKAMP44, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, primarily through its C-terminal PDZ-ligand motif. It is known to form interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD95, PSD93, MPP5, GRIP1, PICK1, Lin7b, and GIPC1. These interactions are crucial for modulating synaptic plasticity and AMPA receptor function, particularly in the postsynaptic density of neurons (Karataeva2014CTerminal).

The interaction between SHISA9 and these proteins is mediated by the EVTV motif at its C-terminus. Disruption of this motif, as demonstrated by a mutant lacking the EVTV sequence, results in the loss of interaction with PDZ domain proteins, underscoring the specificity and importance of this motif for SHISA9's function (Karataeva2014CTerminal).

In the hippocampus, SHISA9's interaction with PSD95 has been shown to affect AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Disruption of the SHISA9-PSD95 interaction using a TAT-tagged peptide mimicking the SHISA9 C-terminus alters the kinetics of these currents, indicating a role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (Karataeva2014CTerminal). These interactions highlight SHISA9's role in the regulation of AMPA receptor function and synaptic dynamics.
