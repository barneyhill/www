# AZIN1

## Overview
AZIN1 is a gene that encodes the protein antizyme inhibitor 1, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of polyamine metabolism. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its function in modulating the activity of antizymes, which are involved in the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. By inhibiting antizymes, antizyme inhibitor 1 facilitates the stabilization and activity of ornithine decarboxylase, thereby promoting polyamine synthesis and uptake. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. The AZIN1 gene is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues, with particularly high expression in the brain, and its activity is implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and cellular transformation (Qiu2017Antizyme; RamosMolina2011Differential; Feng2024Antizyme).

## Structure
The AZIN1 gene encodes a protein consisting of 448 amino acids, which is involved in the regulation of polyamine levels by inhibiting antizyme, a protein that targets ornithine decarboxylase for degradation (Rajput2015RefSeq). The primary structure of AZIN1 includes a serine-to-glycine substitution at amino acid 367 due to RNA editing, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and is prevalent in tumor tissues, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (Rajput2015RefSeq).

AZIN1 shares 45% identity and 67% similarity with antizyme inhibitor 1, indicating a degree of structural similarity, although specific details on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context (Rajput2015RefSeq). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in variants such as AZIN1 SV2, which encodes a shorter isoform with a distinct C-terminus and is involved in reducing fibrogenicity in hepatic stellate cells (Rajput2015RefSeq). Another variant, Azin1-X, is subject to nonsense-mediated decay and its expression is regulated by polyamine levels (Rajput2015RefSeq). The context does not provide information on specific domains, prominent folds, or common post-translational modifications for AZIN1.

## Function
AZIN1 (antizyme inhibitor 1) is a crucial regulator of polyamine metabolism, which is essential for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, AZIN1 functions by binding to antizymes (AZs) with higher affinity than ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), thereby releasing ODC from the ODC-AZ complex. This action promotes polyamine biosynthesis and uptake, maintaining intracellular polyamine levels necessary for normal cellular functions (Qiu2017Antizyme; Feng2024Antizyme).

AZIN1 is expressed in all human tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain, and plays a role in releasing ODC from the ODC-antizyme complex, promoting polyamine synthesis and uptake. This regulation is essential for maintaining polyamine homeostasis, modulating cellular proliferation, and inducing transformation (Feng2024Antizyme). AZIN1 also interacts with growth-related proteins such as cyclin D1 and Aurora-A, and is localized at the centrosomes, indicating its involvement in cell division and centrosome duplication (RamosMolina2011Differential).

In terms of cellular localization, AZIN1 moves from the cytoplasm during interphase to the centrosome during mitosis, suggesting a role in centrosome duplication and possibly in ubiquitin-independent proteasome degradation (Feng2024Antizyme). AZIN1's regulation of polyamine levels and its interactions with key cell cycle proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
AZIN1 (antizyme inhibitor 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA editing and expression alterations. In colorectal cancer (CRC), elevated AZIN1 RNA editing is associated with poor prognosis, increased metastasis, and enhanced cancer stemness, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Shigeyasu2018AZIN1). In gastric cancer (GC), increased AZIN1 RNA editing and ADAR1 expression correlate with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes, serving as independent prognostic factors (Okugawa2018Enhanced).

The S367G RNA editing site in AZIN1 is identified across multiple cancer types, including liver cancer, where it enhances cell survival and may act as a 'master' driver event (Han2015The). This editing also affects drug sensitivity, altering responses to cancer therapies (Han2015The). AZIN1's involvement in polyamine metabolism and its interactions with the TGF-β signaling pathway further contribute to its role in tumorigenesis and other diseases, such as fibrosis (Feng2024Antizyme). These findings underscore AZIN1's clinical significance in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
AZIN1 (antizyme inhibitor 1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing its role in cellular processes. The edited form of AZIN1 (edAZIN1), which contains a Ser367Gly substitution, exhibits distinct interactions compared to the wild-type AZIN1 (wtAZIN1). edAZIN1 preferentially binds to myosin-9, alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), and gamma actin 1 (ACTG1). These interactions are significant as they facilitate the nuclear translocation of edAZIN1, which is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness in prostate cancer (Ghalali2022AZIN1).

The interaction of edAZIN1 with the actin-myosin complex is crucial for its nuclear localization, which influences transcription machinery and contributes to oncogenic properties such as enhanced proliferation and invasion in cancer cells (Ghalali2022AZIN1). Blocking myosin-9, a component of this complex, prevents the nuclear translocation of edAZIN1, reducing its aggressive phenotype (Ghalali2022AZIN1).

In colorectal cancer, RNA-edited AZIN1 interacts with Ornithine Decarboxylase Antizyme 2 (OAZ2), delaying the degradation of the oncoprotein c-Myc through a ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. This interaction promotes angiogenesis by upregulating IL-8, a pro-angiogenic factor (Wei2022A).
