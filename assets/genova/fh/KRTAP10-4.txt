# KRTAP10-4

## Overview
KRTAP10-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-4, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair and nails. This protein is characterized by a high cysteine content, facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds that contribute to the stability and resilience of keratin structures (Litman2023Ancient). The gene is notable for its repetitive sequence motifs, which are indicative of low complexity regions that interact with keratin filaments, enhancing the mechanical properties of hair fibers (Litman2023Ancient). While primarily associated with hair structure, recent studies have identified a potential link between mutations in KRTAP10-4 and cardiovascular health, suggesting broader biological implications (Liu2021New).

## Structure
The KRTAP10-4 protein is part of the keratin-associated protein family, which is characterized by a high cysteine content that facilitates disulfide bond formation, contributing to the stability of hair and nail structures (Litman2023Ancient). The primary structure of KRTAP10-4 includes repetitive sequences, specifically 36 repeats of five-membered sequences beginning with 'CC', which are a common feature of keratin-associated proteins (Litman2023Ancient). These repetitive sequences are indicative of low complexity regions that play a role in the protein's function and interaction with keratin filaments.

The secondary structure of KRTAP10-4 likely involves alpha-helices, which are typical in keratin-associated proteins, although specific details on the secondary structure are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature due to the high cysteine content (Litman2023Ancient). While the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, keratin-associated proteins generally interact with keratin filaments, suggesting a role in forming complex structures within hair fibers.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications for KRTAP10-4 are not detailed in the provided context. The evolutionary relationship of KRTAP10-4 with metallothioneins, which are cysteine-rich, suggests a shared functional or structural characteristic (Litman2023Ancient).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRTAP10-4 gene have been associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with clopidogrel and aspirin. Specifically, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs201441480 in the KRTAP10-4 gene is a missense alteration predicted to be damaging, significantly increasing the risk of MACE with a hazard ratio of 3.86 and a P-value of 7.26 × 10^-6 (Liu2021New). This SNP was identified through whole exome sequencing and further validated in a replication cohort, suggesting its potential clinical significance in cardiovascular diseases (Liu2021New).

While the primary function of KRTAP genes is related to hair fiber structure, the study by Liu et al. highlights a novel association between KRTAP10-4 and cardiovascular health, indicating that mutations in this gene may have broader implications beyond hair characteristics (Liu2021New). The clinical significance of KRTAP10-4 mutations in other conditions or their role in skin disorders has not been specifically detailed in the available literature, focusing instead on its impact on cardiovascular events.
