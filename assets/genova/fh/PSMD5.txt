# PSMD5

## Overview
PSMD5 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 5, a regulatory component of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein is categorized as a non-ATPase subunit and plays a crucial role in the assembly and regulation of the proteasome, which is essential for protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The PSMD5 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the response to inflammatory signals and the regulation of proteasome activity, particularly in the context of cancer and other diseases. Alterations in PSMD5 expression, often through epigenetic modifications such as promoter hypermethylation, have been linked to cancer progression and resistance to proteasome inhibitors, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Ammann2009Cluster; Tsvetkov2016Suppression; Haertle2022SingleNucleotide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PSMD5 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In several cancer types, including low-grade gliomas and bladder carcinomas, PSMD5 expression is reduced primarily due to promoter DNA methylation rather than gene-copy-number losses. This suppression is associated with an altered cellular state that includes increased resistance to proteasome inhibitors and changes in metabolic pathways, such as reduced aerobic glycolysis and increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (Tsvetkov2016Suppression). 

In neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer cell lines, suppression of PSMD5 and other 19S proteasome subunits correlates with increased resistance to proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib and MG132, suggesting that PSMD5 suppression could serve as a marker for resistance to these treatments (Tsvetkov2016Suppression). 

In rectal cancer, PSMD5 mutations are more common in patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, indicating a potential role in chemotherapy resistance (Bagaria2022Discriminating). 

Additionally, PSMD5 inactivation has been linked to colorectal tumor progression, and its expression can be modulated by TNF-α through the NFκB pathway, which may affect proteasome assembly and activity (Li2023PSMD8).

## Interactions
PSMD5, a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in proteasome assembly and regulation. It is part of a cluster dominated by proteasome proteins, indicating its role in protein degradation pathways (Ammann2009Cluster). PSMD5 interacts with PSMC2, a crucial interaction for its regulatory function within the proteasome complex (Haertle2022SingleNucleotide). This interaction is enhanced by TNF-α, which increases PSMD5 expression through the NFκB pathway, suggesting a role in modulating proteasome activity in response to inflammatory signals (Li2023PSMD8).

In the context of multiple myeloma, PSMD5 acts as a negative regulator of proteasome activity. Its promoter hypermethylation leads to gene silencing, which is associated with increased proteolytic capacity and resistance to proteasome inhibitors (Haertle2022SingleNucleotide). This epigenetic modification is a mechanism by which tumor cells adapt to proteasome inhibitor treatment, highlighting the importance of PSMD5 in maintaining protein homeostasis under therapeutic stress (Haertle2022SingleNucleotide). These interactions and regulatory roles underscore PSMD5's significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states.
