# VHLL

## Overview
The VHLL gene encodes the von Hippel-Lindau-like protein (VLP), a protein that shares significant sequence identity with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). VLP is characterized by a structured β-domain, which includes a seven-stranded β sandwich and an α helix, similar to the β-domain of pVHL (Stebbins1999Structure; Minervini2019Insights). However, VLP lacks the elongin-binding α-domain present in pVHL, suggesting differences in their interaction capabilities and quaternary structures (Minervini2019Insights). VLP is predicted to interact with proteins such as HIF-1α, and it may undergo post-translational modifications like hydroxylation, which could regulate its interactions (Minervini2019Insights). The conservation of VLP among primates underscores its evolutionary significance (Minervini2019Insights).

## Structure
The VHLL gene encodes the von Hippel-Lindau-like protein (VLP), which shares significant sequence identity with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). The primary structure of VLP consists of 139 amino acids, with a sequence corresponding to residues 42-139 of the protein (Minervini2019Insights). The secondary structure of VLP includes a structured β-domain similar to the β-domain of pVHL, which is characterized by a seven-stranded β sandwich and an α helix (Stebbins1999Structure; Minervini2019Insights).

The tertiary structure of VLP is supported by Van der Waals interactions among hydrophobic residues, contributing to a stable β-domain structure (Minervini2019Insights). VLP lacks the elongin-binding α-domain found in pVHL, which suggests differences in their quaternary structures and interaction capabilities (Minervini2019Insights).

VLP is predicted to interact with several proteins, including HIF-1α, through specific interaction interfaces that are conserved and similar to those in pVHL (Minervini2019Insights). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as hydroxylation, which plays a regulatory role in its interactions (Minervini2019Insights). VLP is mainly conserved among primates, indicating its evolutionary significance (Minervini2019Insights).
