# GNL2

## Overview
GNL2, or G protein nucleolar 2, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar GTPase protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis within cells. The GNL2 protein functions as a molecular switch, regulating its localization and activity through GTP binding, which is essential for the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Chennupati2011Signals; Qin2023Identification). It contains nucleolar localization signals that facilitate its transport and retention in the nucleolus, where it interacts with nuclear transport receptors such as importin-β and importin-R (Chennupati2011Signals). GNL2 is highly expressed in rapidly proliferating cells, including cancer cells, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Its dysregulation has been associated with oncogenic activities in glioma and developmental defects in zebrafish, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for disease prognosis (Paridaen2011The; Yang2024Oncogenic).

## Function
GNL2, also known as G protein nucleolar 2, is a nucleolar GTPase that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis in cells. It is involved in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, ensuring efficient ribosome production, which is essential for cellular growth and proliferation (Qin2023Identification). GNL2 functions as a molecular switch, with its GTP-bound state regulating its retention in the nucleolus, similar to other small GTPases (Chennupati2011Signals). 

The protein contains nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs) that facilitate its transport into the nucleolus, where it interacts with importin-β and importin-R, key components of the nuclear transport pathway (Chennupati2011Signals). These interactions are critical for its nucleolar localization and retention, which are necessary for its function in ribosome biogenesis (Chennupati2011Signals). 

GNL2 is highly expressed in actively proliferating cells, such as cancer cells and stem cells, indicating its role in maintaining cell proliferation (Chennupati2011Signals). Its expression is regulated by cell cycle signals, and it is associated with the RNA metabolic network, further underscoring its importance in cell growth and development (Qin2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNL2 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of glioma, a type of brain tumor. GNL2 is identified as an oncogene in glioma, with its overexpression linked to poor survival outcomes in patients. High levels of GNL2 expression are associated with increased proliferation, invasion, and migration of glioma cells, contributing to the aggressive nature of the tumor. Knockdown of GNL2 in glioma cells results in reduced tumor growth and impaired protein synthesis, highlighting its role in promoting tumor development through enhanced protein synthesis (Yang2024Oncogenic).

In zebrafish, mutations in GNL2 lead to defects in retinal neurogenesis, affecting cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Loss of GNL2 function results in aberrant expression of cell cycle markers and increased apoptosis, which can be partially rescued by blocking p53 translation. This suggests that GNL2 is crucial for proper cell cycle progression and prevention of apoptosis during retinal development (Paridaen2011The).

Overall, GNL2's role in cell proliferation and its dysregulation in cancer and developmental disorders underscore its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for disease prognosis.

## Interactions
GNL2, also known as NGP-1, is a nucleolar GTPase that interacts with various proteins to regulate its localization and function within the cell. It contains two nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs) that facilitate its transport to the nucleolus. The N-terminal NoLS interacts with the nuclear transport receptor importin-β, while the C-terminal NoLS interacts with importin-R. These interactions are crucial for the nucleolar targeting of GNL2 (Chennupati2011Signals). 

GNL2's interaction with importin-β is particularly significant, as it can occur directly without the involvement of importin-R, as demonstrated by experiments where importin-R was depleted from HeLa cell lysates (Chennupati2011Signals). The protein also binds to guanine nucleotide triphosphate (GTP), which acts as a molecular switch controlling its transition between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Mutants that cannot bind GTP are primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, indicating that the GTP-binding state of GNL2 regulates its nucleolar retention (Chennupati2011Signals).

In the context of glioma, GNL2 interacts with the 60S ribosomal protein RPL11, affecting its localization and suggesting a role in ribosomal subunit assembly and protein synthesis (Yang2024Oncogenic).
