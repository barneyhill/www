# FAM131B

## Overview
FAM131B is a human gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 131, member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM131B has gained attention in the field of oncology due to its role in gene fusion events, particularly with the BRAF gene, which is implicated in the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Such fusions are significant in the context of tumorigenesis, especially in pediatric brain tumors like pilocytic astrocytoma, where they contribute to the oncogenic transformation of cells by promoting constitutive kinase activity (Cin2011Oncogenic; Ryall2017Multiplex). The study of FAM131B and its interactions is crucial for understanding its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM131B gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in oncogenic fusion events, particularly with the BRAF gene. The FAM131B-BRAF fusion results from an interstitial deletion on chromosome 7q34 and is implicated in the activation of the MAPK pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. This fusion is notably associated with pilocytic astrocytoma, a type of pediatric brain tumor, where it serves as an alternative mechanism for MAPK pathway activation (Cin2011Oncogenic). The FAM131B-BRAF fusion lacks the RAF auto-inhibitory domain, leading to constitutive kinase activity and contributing to the oncogenic transformation of cells (Cin2011Oncogenic).

In pediatric low-grade gliomas, the FAM131B-BRAF fusion is detected at a lower frequency compared to other BRAF fusions, such as KIAA1549-BRAF, but it still plays a role in the activation of the oncogenic RAS-MAPK pathway (Ryall2017Multiplex). The presence of this fusion in tumors highlights the importance of genetic alterations in the diagnosis and management of these conditions, as it aids in tumor characterization and potentially guides therapeutic strategies (Ryall2017Multiplex).
