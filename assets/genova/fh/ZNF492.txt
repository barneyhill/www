# ZNF492

## Overview
ZNF492 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 492, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are essential for DNA binding, allowing the protein to play a role in gene regulation. Zinc finger protein 492 is notable for its structural composition, which includes 12 consecutive C2H2-type zinc fingers and a KRAB-B domain, although it lacks the typical KRAB-A domain. This absence may influence its interaction with co-repressors and its regulatory functions (Lu2006Identification). In humans, ZNF492 has evolved through exon insertion, resulting in a chimeric protein that combines elements of ZNF492 and ZNF98, reflecting the evolutionary dynamics that have shaped its function (Florio2018Evolution). The gene has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly as a potential prognostic marker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma due to its altered methylation patterns (Kim2019ZNF492).

## Structure
ZNF492 is a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. The protein comprises 12 consecutive C2H2-type zinc fingers at the carboxyl end, with a consensus sequence of PYKEECGKAFNQSSTLTTHKRIHTGEK. An imperfect zinc finger is located between the 11th and 12th zinc fingers, where the first cysteine is replaced by a tyrosine, potentially affecting its zinc coordination ability (Lu2006Identification).

The primary structure of ZNF492 includes a KRAB-B domain, but it lacks the typical KRAB-A domain, which might influence its interaction with co-repressors and its role in gene regulation (Lu2006Identification). The absence of the KRAB-A domain could lead to reduced co-repressor binding, contributing to the modest upregulation of target genes (Lu2006Identification).

In humans, ZNF492 has undergone evolutionary changes, resulting in a chimeric protein that combines the repressor domain of ZNF492 with the DNA binding domain of ZNF98 due to exon insertion (Florio2018Evolution). This structural modification highlights the evolutionary processes that have shaped the gene's function in humans.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF492, also known as ZNF115, has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) due to its altered methylation patterns. The gene's methylation status is significantly higher in ccRCC tissues compared to normal controls, and this hypermethylation is associated with advanced pathological stages of the disease (Kim2019ZNF492). The study by Kim et al. suggests that the methylation of ZNF492 could serve as an independent predictor of disease progression, with hypermethylated ZNF492 linked to shorter progression durations in ccRCC patients (Kim2019ZNF492).

The expression of ZNF492 is notably lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal samples, indicating its potential role in cancer initiation and progression (Kim2019ZNF492). Despite these findings, the specific functions of ZNF492 in cancer remain limited in the literature, and further research is needed to fully understand its role and the false prediction rate of these methylation markers (Kim2019ZNF492). The study highlights the potential of ZNF492 as a methylation-induced prognostic indicator in renal cell carcinoma, emphasizing the need for additional investigation to validate these findings.
