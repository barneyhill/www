# CPPED1

## Overview
The CPPED1 gene encodes the protein calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain containing 1, which is a member of the calcineurin-like metallophosphoesterase superfamily. This protein is characterized by its phosphoesterase activity, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling and metabolism. CPPED1 is involved in the dephosphorylation of key components within the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, influencing processes such as cell growth, survival, and glucose metabolism. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and has been implicated in the regulation of glucose uptake in adipocytes, as well as in the modulation of gene expression related to glucose metabolism. Additionally, CPPED1 has been associated with various physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer progression, metabolic disorders, and the timing of term birth, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and developmental processes (Vaittinen2013Downregulation; Haapalainen2021Human; Daddali2020CPPED1targeting).

## Structure
The CPPED1 protein is a member of the calcineurin-like metallophosphoesterase superfamily and exhibits a distinct molecular structure. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal His-V5 dual tag, and the protein has a molecular weight of 38.9 kDa (Haapalainen2021Human). The secondary structure of CPPED1 comprises both α-helical and β-sheet elements, contributing to its overall stability and function (Haapalainen2021Human). 

CPPED1 contains a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is characterized by a conserved fold and active-site geometry typical of the superfamily, although CPPED1 lacks the conserved motifs found in other PPP and PPM family members (Haapalainen2021Human). Instead, it shares sequence similarity with the class III cAMP phosphodiesterase family, indicating its classification within this group (Haapalainen2021Human).

The protein is monomeric in solution, as confirmed by static light scattering, and its phosphatase activity is cation-dependent, showing higher activity in the presence of Mn2+ (Haapalainen2021Human). Specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CPPED1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the calcineurin-like metallophosphoesterase superfamily, which is involved in dephosphorylation processes crucial for cellular signaling and metabolism. In healthy human cells, CPPED1 plays a significant role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by dephosphorylating components such as AKT1 and PAK4. This activity is important for regulating various cellular processes, including growth, survival, and metabolism (Haapalainen2021Human).

CPPED1 is active in the cytoplasm and influences glucose metabolism by modulating glucose uptake in adipocytes. Downregulation of CPPED1 in adipocytes leads to increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, suggesting its role in glucose homeostasis (Vaittinen2013Downregulation). The protein also affects the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), while reducing the expression of GLUT1 and leptin (Vaittinen2013Downregulation).

In addition to its metabolic functions, CPPED1 is associated with the timing of term birth, as its expression levels vary between spontaneous and elective deliveries, indicating a potential role in placental development and labor (Haapalainen2017Expression). Overall, CPPED1 is a key regulator of cellular signaling pathways that impact metabolic and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CPPED1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the context of cancer, particularly bladder cancer, CPPED1 plays a role in the regulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Its dephosphorylation activity on AKT1 at Ser473 is linked to preventing cancer progression. Down-regulation of CPPED1 expression is observed in non-invasive bladder cancer tissues, while its overexpression is associated with tumor regression, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Haapalainen2021Human).

In the realm of metabolic disorders, CPPED1 influences glucose metabolism. Decreased expression of CPPED1 in adipose tissue leads to increased glucose uptake, which may have implications for conditions like type 2 diabetes (Daddali2020CPPED1targeting).

CPPED1 also has a significant role in pregnancy, particularly in the timing of term birth. Lower levels of CPPED1 are associated with spontaneous term deliveries compared to elective caesarean births. This suggests that CPPED1 may influence the onset of labor, potentially through its interactions with miR-371a-5p, which is upregulated during spontaneous labor and targets CPPED1, leading to its decreased expression (Daddali2020CPPED1targeting; Haapalainen2017Expression).

## Interactions
CPPED1, a member of the calcineurin-like metallophosphoesterase superfamily, is involved in the dephosphorylation of components within the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. It interacts with several proteins, notably PAK4 and PIK3R2, influencing their phosphorylation status. CPPED1 dephosphorylates PAK4 at serine residues, although it does not affect the phosphorylation of PIK3R2 (Haapalainen2021Human). 

In vitro studies using protein microarrays have identified CPPED1 as interacting with 36 proteins, including PAK4 and PIK3R2, suggesting its role in modulating the PI3K pathway (Haapalainen2021Human). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interactions between CPPED1, PAK4, and PIK3R2, indicating that CPPED1 forms complexes with these proteins in vivo (Haapalainen2021Human). 

Fluorescence colocalization analysis has shown that CPPED1 colocalizes with AKT1, PAK4, and PIK3R2 in trophoblast cells and human placenta tissue samples, although AKT1 was not identified as an interacting protein in microarray analysis (Haapalainen2021Human). These interactions suggest that CPPED1 plays a regulatory role in the PI3K-AKT pathway, potentially affecting cellular processes such as cell motility, metabolism, and proliferation (Haapalainen2021Human).
