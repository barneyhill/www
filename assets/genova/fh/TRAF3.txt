# TRAF3

## Overview
The TRAF3 gene encodes the TNF receptor associated factor 3 protein, a pivotal adaptor protein involved in the regulation of immune signaling pathways. As a member of the TRAF protein family, TRAF3 is characterized by its ability to form trimers and its structurally adaptive protein-protein interaction interface, which allows it to engage with a variety of signaling partners. The protein plays a dual role in modulating immune responses, acting as both a positive and negative regulator in different contexts. It is crucial for the regulation of interferon production and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, in various cell types. TRAF3's interactions with members of the TNF receptor superfamily and viral proteins underscore its importance in immune homeostasis and cellular responses. Mutations in the TRAF3 gene have been linked to immune dysregulation and an increased risk of malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases (hildebrand2011roles; Bishop2016TRAF3; Neja2020The).

## Structure
The TRAF3 protein is characterized by its TRAF domain, which includes an N-terminal alpha-helical segment (TRAF-N domain) and a C-terminal domain (TRAF-C) that forms an eight-stranded beta-sandwich. The TRAF-N domain spans residues 277 to 347, while the TRAF-C domain extends from residues 348 to 504. The beta-sandwich consists of two layers of beta-sheets, each containing four antiparallel strands (Ni2000Molecular; Ely2002Structurally).

TRAF3 forms a trimer in both solution and crystal form, with monomers related by crystallographic three-fold symmetry. The trimer is stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between the beta-sandwiches and coiled-coil interactions between the intertwined N-terminal helical segments, which form the stalk of the mushroom-shaped trimer (Ni2000Molecular; Ely2002Structurally).

The protein-protein interaction interface of TRAF3 is structurally adaptive, featuring 'hot spots' that facilitate binding with various partners. These 'hot spots' include a hydrophobic pocket, a hydrophilic cluster known as 'serine tongs', and a polar region, allowing TRAF3 to accommodate different recognition motifs through side-chain rearrangements (Ely2002Structurally).

## Function
TRAF3 (TNF receptor associated factor 3) is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating immune cell signaling in healthy human cells. It acts as both a positive and negative regulator in various signaling pathways. TRAF3 is involved in the regulation of interferon (IFN) production, positively influencing IFN production in myeloid cells and fibroblasts (hildebrand2011roles). It also negatively regulates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways such as p38, JNK, and NF-κB, which are crucial for immune responses (hildebrand2011roles).

In B lymphocytes, TRAF3 is essential for maintaining homeostasis and survival by inhibiting the NF-κB2 pathway, which is associated with cell survival. This regulation involves the polyubiquitination and degradation of NIK, thereby preventing non-canonical NF-κB2 activation (Lin2015TRAF3). TRAF3 also plays a role in inhibiting CD40-mediated activation events in B cells, such as NF-κB and MAPK activation, by competing with TRAF2 for binding sites (Bishop2016TRAF3).

TRAF3 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with various signaling complexes. In the nucleus, it inhibits the transcriptional activity of the CREB transcriptional complex, controlling the expression of prosurvival proteins (Bishop2016TRAF3). These functions highlight TRAF3's role as a critical regulator of immune homeostasis and cellular responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRAF3 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, particularly affecting the immune system and increasing the risk of malignancies. In B cells, TRAF3 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Mutations in TRAF3 can lead to its inactivation, resulting in persistent activation of this pathway, which is implicated in the progression of multiple myeloma and other B-cell malignancies (hildebrand2011roles; Neja2020The). TRAF3 mutations are also linked to drug resistance in multiple myeloma, particularly to proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib, due to the activation of pathways that enhance cell survival and resistance to apoptosis (Neja2020The).

TRAF3 haploinsufficiency in humans is characterized by immune dysregulation, leading to conditions such as hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphadenopathy, and autoimmune diseases. This is due to hyperactive B cells and the activation of inflammatory pathways, increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies (Rae2022Immunodeficiency). Additionally, TRAF3 mutations have been associated with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, where increased TRAF3 binding due to CD40 polymorphisms correlates with heightened disease activity (Bishop2016TRAF3).

## Interactions
TRAF3 is a versatile adaptor protein that participates in numerous protein-protein interactions, playing a critical role in various signaling pathways. It interacts with members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFR-SF), such as CD40, OX40, and 4-1BB, influencing immune cell functions and signaling pathways (Hildebrand2011Roles). TRAF3 binds to the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors, often competing with other TRAF proteins for binding sites, which can modulate NF-κB activation (Hildebrand2011Roles; Ely2002Structurally).

TRAF3 also interacts with viral proteins, such as the Epstein-Barr virus protein LMP1, where it represses NF-κB activation by displacing other TRAFs from the binding site (Devergne1996Association). In addition, TRAF3 is involved in the regulation of the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway through its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Triad3A, which targets TRAF3 for degradation (Nakhaei2009The).

The protein's interaction with TANK and other signaling molecules is facilitated by its structurally adaptive binding interface, which includes specific 'hot spots' that allow for flexible binding to diverse partners (Ely2002Structurally). These interactions are crucial for TRAF3's role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
