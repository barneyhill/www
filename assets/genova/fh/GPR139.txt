# GPR139

## Overview
GPR139 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 139, a member of the Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane alpha-helical structure, which is typical of GPCRs, and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the habenula and septum regions of the brain (Kaushik2017Modelling; Liu2015GPR139). GPR139 is activated by the essential amino acids L-tryptophan and L-phenylalanine, and it plays a significant role in neuromodulation by interacting with other receptors such as the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine D2 receptor, thereby influencing dopaminergic and opioidergic signaling pathways (Liu2015GPR139; Dao2021The). The receptor's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential impact on neuropsychiatric behaviors and its relevance in conditions such as addiction and emotional processing (Anversa2024Orphan). Additionally, GPR139 has been implicated in fetal growth restriction, highlighting its importance in both neuropsychiatric and developmental contexts (Reshetnikov2024Maternal).

## Structure
The GPR139 protein is a member of the Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane alpha-helical structure (Kaushik2017Modelling). The primary structure of GPR139 includes specific residues crucial for its function, such as F109, H187, W241, N271, R244, and E108, which are involved in ligand binding (Nøhr2017The). The secondary structure is defined by these transmembrane helices, which are typical of GPCRs (Kaushik2017Modelling).

The tertiary structure of GPR139 involves the folding of these helices to form a ligand-binding pocket, which includes a hydrophobic region and a polar region (Nøhr2017The). The protein's quaternary structure is not detailed in the available context, suggesting it may function as a monomer or its multimeric state is not well characterized.

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at position 11, which may play a role in receptor function and stability (Kaushik2017Modelling). The receptor is involved in the G(q/11) mediated pathway and interacts with the GPR142 biochemical pathway, indicating its role in complex signaling networks (Kaushik2017Modelling).

## Function
GPR139 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the habenula and septum regions of the brain. It is activated by the essential amino acids L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-phenylalanine (L-Phe), which are considered its physiological ligands (Liu2015GPR139). The receptor is coupled with Gq proteins and is involved in neuromodulation by opposing the actions of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in the brain (Stoveken2020The). GPR139 activation leads to the stimulation of cAMP production and inhibition of G protein inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, which are necessary for counteracting MOR-mediated inhibition of neuronal firing (Stoveken2020The).

GPR139 also interacts with dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), counteracting their function by signaling via Gαq/11 to oppose the Gαi/o actions of D2R (Dao2021The). This interaction suggests a role in modulating dopaminergic and opioidergic signaling pathways, which could be relevant to neuropsychiatric behaviors (Dao2021The). The receptor's expression and activity in the brain imply its involvement in central nervous system functions, although its exact physiological roles in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Liu2015GPR139).

## Clinical Significance
GPR139 is a G protein-coupled receptor with significant expression in the brain, particularly in regions associated with complex central nervous system processes. Alterations in GPR139 expression or function have been linked to various neuropsychiatric conditions. Research using Gpr139 knockout mice has demonstrated that the absence of this receptor results in behavioral abnormalities, including motor and cognitive deficits, as well as anxiolytic traits. These effects are attributed to dysfunctional signaling of μ-opioid and dopamine D2 receptors, with which GPR139 interacts (Anversa2024Orphan).

GPR139 is also implicated in addiction and emotional processing, particularly within the medial habenula-interpeduncular nucleus circuit. Pharmacological targeting of GPR139 with agonists such as JNJ-63533054 and TAK-041 has shown potential in reducing alcohol and opioid intake, suggesting its role in substance use disorders (Anversa2024Orphan). TAK-041 has been tested in clinical trials for its effects on anhedonia and schizophrenia, indicating potential therapeutic applications for these conditions (Anversa2024Orphan).

Additionally, GPR139 is involved in fetal growth restriction (FGR) through its regulatory networks, as certain genetic variants affecting GPR139 expression have been associated with FGR-related phenotypes (Reshetnikov2024Maternal). These findings highlight the receptor's significance in both neuropsychiatric and developmental contexts.

## Interactions
GPR139, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the central nervous system. It primarily couples with Gq/11 and Gi/o proteins, but not with Gs or G12/13 classes, showing a unique profile of G protein coupling (Stoveken2020The). GPR139 has been shown to interact with the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), where it opposes MOR signaling by engaging the Gq/11 pathway, which inhibits the GIRK channel and enhances cAMP production, counteracting MOR-mediated effects (Stoveken2020The). This interaction suggests a potential physical interaction between GPR139 and MOR, as GPR139 enhances β-arrestin recruitment to activated MOR and moderates its coupling to GIRK channels (Stoveken2020The).

GPR139 also co-expresses with the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in several brain regions, including the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. Functional interactions between GPR139 and DRD2 have been demonstrated in vitro, where DRD2 can activate calcium mobilization through GPR139, indicating a potential interaction (Wang2019GPR139). These interactions highlight GPR139's role in modulating neurotransmitter systems and its potential impact on neuronal signaling pathways.
