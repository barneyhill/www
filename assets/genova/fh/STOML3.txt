# STOML3

## Overview
STOML3, or stomatin-like 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the stomatin family, which is characterized by its role in modulating ion channels. The protein, stomatin-like 3, is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in sensory mechanotransduction by influencing the function of mechanically-gated ion channels, such as Piezo1 and Piezo2. These channels are essential for the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, a process vital for touch and pain perception. STOML3's ability to oligomerize is crucial for its function, as it enhances the sensitivity of these ion channels to mechanical stimuli, thereby modulating mechanosensitivity in sensory neurons (Poole2014Tuning; Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in neuropathic pain conditions and certain cancers, making STOML3 a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Nagaishi2012Amplification; Wetzel2016Smallmolecule).

## Function
STOML3, or stomatin-like protein-3, is a crucial modulator of mechanically-gated ion channels, particularly the Piezo channels, which are essential for mechanoreceptor function in the skin. These mechanoreceptors are responsible for converting physical stimuli into electrical signals, a process known as sensory mechanotransduction (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). In healthy human cells, STOML3 self-associates to perform its function, and this oligomerization is vital for its role in modulating mechanosensitivity (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). 

STOML3 is active in the plasma membrane, where it influences the sensitivity of mechanosensitive ion channels, such as Piezo1 and Piezo2, which are crucial for touch sensation (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). By modulating these channels, STOML3 plays a significant role in the perception of mechanical stimuli and pain. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining normal touch sensation, and its modulation can attenuate fine touch perception, which has potential therapeutic implications for conditions where light touch causes pain, such as nerve injury or diabetic neuropathy (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). 

Overall, STOML3 is a key component in the mechanotransduction pathway, contributing to the organismal outcomes of touch and pain perception.

## Clinical Significance
STOML3 has been implicated in various neuropathic pain conditions due to its role in mechanosensitivity. Alterations in STOML3 expression or its interactions can lead to changes in pain perception. In neuropathic pain models, such as those involving chronic constriction injury, STOML3 is associated with increased mechanical hypersensitivity. Inhibition of STOML3 oligomerization using small molecules like OB-1 has been shown to reverse mechanical hypersensitivity, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule).

STOML3 is also involved in the development of tactile allodynia, a condition where non-painful stimuli cause pain. Mice lacking STOML3 show reduced sensitivity to tactile stimuli after nerve injury, indicating a protective effect against this condition (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). 

In gliosarcomas, STOML3 gene amplification is associated with mesenchymal differentiation, although it is not prognostic of survival in gliosarcoma patients. However, in glioblastoma patients, STOML3 overexpression correlates with shorter survival times, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression (Nagaishi2012Amplification). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of STOML3 in pain management and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
STOML3 (stomatin-like 3) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly influencing mechanosensitivity in sensory neurons. It plays a significant role in modulating Piezo ion channels, specifically Piezo1 and Piezo2, which are crucial for mechanotransduction. STOML3 enhances the sensitivity of these channels to mechanical stimuli by lowering their activation thresholds and preventing desensitization after repeated stimuli (Poole2014Tuning). 

Biochemical studies have demonstrated a physical interaction between STOML3 and Piezo proteins, with co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirming that both Piezo1 and Piezo2 co-precipitate with STOML3, indicating a direct interaction (Poole2014Tuning). STOML3's ability to oligomerize is crucial for its function, as mutations that disrupt its oligomerization reduce its capacity to modulate mechanosensitive currents (Poole2014Tuning).

STOML3 also interacts with acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), particularly ASIC2 and ASIC3, modulating nociceptor mechanosensitivity. The interactions between stomatin-domain proteins like STOML3 and ASICs are essential for normal mechanosensory function, as demonstrated by gene deletion studies in mice (Moshourab2013Stomatin‐domain). These interactions highlight STOML3's role in sensory neuron function and its potential as a therapeutic target for pain modulation.
