# KIF9

## Overview
KIF9 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 9 protein, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as ciliary function, mitotic progression, and intracellular transport. Kinesin family member 9 is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis, essential for its function in cellular transport mechanisms (Fang2024Distinct; Konjikusic2021Kif9). The protein is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and is implicated in the regulation of spindle length during mitosis, as well as in the positioning of centriolar satellites (Konjikusic2021Kif9; Vicente2024The). Additionally, KIF9 has been associated with various clinical conditions, including colorectal cancer and male infertility, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Miyata2022The; Zhao2023Cytoskeleton).

## Structure
The KIF9 protein is a kinesin motor protein involved in ciliary function and axonemal organization. Its molecular structure includes a motor domain at the N-terminus, which is essential for binding to microtubules and ATP, facilitating its role in intracellular transport (Fang2024Distinct; Konjikusic2021Kif9). The motor domain shares a sequence identity of 43% with Kif6, another kinesin protein, indicating some level of conservation (Fang2024Distinct). Following the motor domain, KIF9 contains two coiled-coil regions and a tail at the C-terminus, which are less conserved and may interact with different partners depending on the cell type (Fang2024Distinct; Demonchy2009Kinesin).

KIF9 does not exhibit processive movement along axonemes in vivo, suggesting it may function as an immobilized component within the central apparatus of cilia (Fang2024Distinct; Konjikusic2021Kif9). The protein is also involved in maintaining the integrity of the distal axoneme tip, as its loss leads to the disappearance of specific distal tip domains (Konjikusic2021Kif9). KIF9's role in ciliary function is further supported by its association with central pair and radial spoke proteins, contributing to ciliary beating and waveform regulation (Konjikusic2021Kif9).

## Function
KIF9 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes. In mitotic progression, KIF9 is essential for chromosome alignment and spindle length control. It localizes to the spindle and is necessary for maintaining accurate spindle length, which is vital for proper chromosome attachment and segregation during mitosis. The loss of KIF9 results in increased microtubule density and spindle microtubule polymerization, indicating its role in destabilizing mitotic microtubules (Andrieu2012The).

KIF9 also regulates the positioning of centriolar satellites, which are involved in protein trafficking to and from the centrosome. It helps maintain the proper distance of centriolar satellites from the centrosome, preventing excessive protein degradation and ensuring proper centrosomal maturation. This regulation is critical for forming a normal mitotic spindle and achieving error-free mitosis (Vicente2024The).

In macrophages, KIF9 influences the number of podosome-forming cells and their matrix degradation ability. It interacts with microtubules and actin-rich podosome cores, playing a role in the dynamic regulation of podosome formation and function, which is important for cellular processes such as migration and tissue remodeling (Cornfine2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KIF9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). In CRC, high expression of KIF9 is associated with a better prognosis and increased sensitivity to 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) chemotherapy, a common treatment for this type of cancer. This suggests that KIF9 could serve as a biomarker for predicting the response to 5-Fu treatment and potentially improving patient outcomes (Zhao2023Cytoskeleton). High KIF9 expression is also linked to better overall survival and progression-free survival in CRC patients, making it an independent prognostic factor (Zhao2023Cytoskeleton).

KIF9 expression is further associated with the tumor immune microenvironment in CRC, where high expression correlates with more activated T cells and a better response to immunotherapy (Zhao2023Cytoskeleton). In contrast, low KIF9 expression is linked to higher immune cell scores and potentially better immunotherapy outcomes, as indicated by a negative correlation with the TIDE score, which predicts immunotherapy response (Zhao2023Cytoskeleton).

Beyond cancer, KIF9 mutations have been linked to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility. Studies in mice have shown that KIF9 is essential for normal sperm motility, and mutations affecting its motor domain can lead to conditions like asthenozoospermia (Miyata2022The).

## Interactions
KIF9 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It co-localizes with the centriolar satellite marker PCM1 in HeLa cells, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a significant overlap in their interaction (Vicente2024The). KIF9 also interacts with the GTPase Gem, which is involved in spindle length control during mitosis. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid assays, suggesting that KIF9 mediates Gem-induced spindle shortening (Andrieu2012The; Piddini2001The).

In the context of sperm motility, KIF9 is suggested to interact with HYDIN, a central pair protein in the axoneme, although direct immunoprecipitation analysis in mice is challenging. KIF9 binds to the ASH domain of HYDIN, indicating a potential interaction in the axoneme (Miyata2020Testis‐enriched).

KIF9 also plays a role in matrix degradation by macrophage podosomes through its interaction with reggie-1/flotillin-2 proteins. This interaction is crucial for the matrix-degrading ability of podosomes, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Cornfine2011The). These interactions highlight KIF9's involvement in diverse cellular functions, including mitotic progression, sperm motility, and matrix degradation.
