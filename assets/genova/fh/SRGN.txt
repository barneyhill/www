# SRGN

## Overview
The SRGN gene encodes the protein serglycin, a proteoglycan primarily characterized by its role in the storage and secretion of bioactive molecules within various cell types. Serglycin is distinguished by its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which facilitate interactions with a range of partner molecules, thereby influencing critical biological processes such as inflammation, immune response, and extracellular matrix remodeling (Guo2020Proteoglycan; TellezGabriel2022Serglycin). While serglycin is predominantly associated with immune cells, where it aids in the storage and release of chemokines and proteases, it is also expressed in other cell types, including endothelial and muscle cells, where it plays a role in cellular adaptation and signaling (Guo2020Proteoglycan; Hjorth2015The). The protein's involvement in pathological conditions, such as cancer, highlights its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, given its influence on cell migration, invasion, and tumor progression (Guo2016Serglycin; Zhang2017SRGNTGFβ2).

## Structure


## Function
Serglycin (SRGN) is a proteoglycan that plays a significant role in various cellular functions, particularly in the storage and secretion of bioactive molecules. In healthy human cells, SRGN is primarily associated with immune cells, where it contributes to the storage and release of chemokines, proteases, histamine, and growth factors. This function is facilitated by its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which are crucial for interactions with partner molecules, influencing processes such as inflammation and immune cell extravasation (TellezGabriel2022Serglycin).

SRGN is also expressed in other cell types, including endothelial and muscle cells. In muscle cells, SRGN is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, particularly in response to physical activity. It is upregulated after both acute and long-term exercise, suggesting a role in muscle adaptation and ECM remodeling (Hjorth2015The). SRGN is localized in the perinuclear region of muscle fibers and is secreted by cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells (Hjorth2015The).

In addition to its role in muscle cells, SRGN interacts with CD44, a cell surface receptor, to regulate cell adherence and activation, which is important for immune responses and cell signaling (Guo2020Proteoglycan).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRGN (serglycin) gene have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. In NSCLC, SRGN is frequently overexpressed and its interaction with the CD44 receptor promotes malignant phenotypes, such as enhanced cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to poor prognosis (Guo2020Proteoglycan; Guo2016Serglycin). The SRGN/CD44 axis is crucial for these processes, and SRGN's overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in lung cancer patients (Guo2016Serglycin).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SRGN is significantly upregulated and linked to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. It is involved in a regulatory loop with TGFβ2, enhancing the invasive and metastatic potential of TNBC cells (Zhang2017SRGNTGFβ2). SRGN's role in promoting EMT and cancer cell stemness is also noted in breast cancer, where it is highly expressed by immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TellezGabriel2022Serglycin).

In colorectal cancer, SRGN is a downstream target of HIF-1α and is associated with metastasis. Its expression is significantly higher in metastatic cases, correlating with shorter overall survival (Xu2018SRGN). These findings suggest that SRGN could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
Serglycin (SRGN) is a proteoglycan that engages in various interactions with proteins, influencing cellular processes such as migration, invasion, and immune response modulation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SRGN interacts with the cell surface receptor CD44 through its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, predominantly chondroitin sulfate GAGs. This interaction is crucial for promoting cell migration and is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, with SRGN displaying a higher affinity for CD44 than hyaluronic acid due to its stronger negative charges (Guo2020Proteoglycan). The binding of SRGN to CD44 activates Src-mediated signaling pathways, leading to focal adhesion turnover and cytoskeletal reorganization, which enhances cell migration (Guo2020Proteoglycan).

In breast cancer, SRGN interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and extracellular matrix molecules like collagen I and fibronectin, modulating their properties and contributing to cancer cell aggressiveness (Bouris2018Serglycin). SRGN also binds to complement components C1q and MBL, modulating immune responses in breast cancer cells (Korpetinou2013Serglycin). In giant cell tumor of bone, SRGN interacts with CD44 to promote osteoclast differentiation and tumor growth (He2021Serglycin).
