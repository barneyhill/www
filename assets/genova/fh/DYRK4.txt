# DYRK4

## Overview
DYRK4 is a gene that encodes the protein dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 4, which is a member of the DYRK family of serine/threonine kinases. These kinases are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and development. DYRK4 is characterized by its cytosolic localization and is specifically expressed in the testis, particularly during spermiogenesis, although it is not essential for male fertility (Sacher2007The). The protein is catalytically active, capable of phosphorylating substrates such as myelin basic protein and undergoing autophosphorylation (Sacher2007The). In the context of cancer, a fusion transcript involving DYRK4, known as RAD51AP1-DYRK4, has been associated with aggressive breast cancers, particularly the luminal B subtype, and is linked to increased cancer cell motility and metastasis (Liu2021A). This fusion transcript activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for treatment (Liu2021A).

## Structure


## Function
DYRK4 is a member of the DYRK family of serine/threonine kinases, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and development. DYRK4 is part of a subgroup that lacks additional domains and is expected to be cytosolic (Sacher2007The). It is specifically expressed in the testis, particularly in step 8 spermatids during spermiogenesis, suggesting a specialized role in this process (Sacher2007The). Despite its restricted expression, DYRK4 is not essential for male fertility in mice, as Dyrk4-deficient mice exhibit normal testis and epididymis morphology, and normal progression of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis (Sacher2007The).

DYRK4 is a catalytically active kinase capable of phosphorylating substrates like myelin basic protein (MBP) and undergoing autophosphorylation. The protein is localized in the cytosol, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry in transfected COS7 cells (Sacher2007The). The absence of nuclear localization signals (NLS) in DYRK4 supports its cytosolic localization (Sacher2007The). The specific function of DYRK4 in spermiogenesis remains unclear, but it may be involved in transcriptional regulation, potentially through pathways involving the CREB transcription factor, which is crucial for the interaction between Sertoli and germ cells during sperm development (Sacher2007The).

## Clinical Significance
The RAD51AP1-DYRK4 fusion transcript is associated with aggressive breast cancers, particularly luminal B subtypes, and is linked to increased cancer cell motility and transendothelial migration, which are critical processes in metastasis (Liu2021A). This fusion leads to the activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, enhancing the invasiveness and metastasis of breast cancer cells (Liu2021A). The RAD51AP1-DYRK4 fusion is highly tumor-specific and is not found in normal breast tissues, indicating its potential as a cancer-testis specific marker (Liu2021A).

The presence of RAD51AP1-DYRK4 confers increased sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for treating aggressive luminal B breast cancers that are often resistant to other treatments (Liu2021A). The fusion protein's role in enhancing MEK/ERK signaling is independent of the wild-type RAD51AP1, and it does not increase cell proliferation or colony-forming capability (Liu2021A). The study also suggests that RAD51AP1-DYRK4 may repress compensatory HER2/PI3K/AKT activation, further enhancing sensitivity to MEK inhibition (Liu2021A).
