# ANKRD18B

## Overview
ANKRD18B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 18B protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ankyrin repeat domain 18B may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of the ANKRD18B protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cancer biology has been increasingly recognized. Alterations in the expression and methylation of ANKRD18B have been associated with several types of cancer, including lung, breast, and oral squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Nirgude2022Genomewide; Kuk2024Prognostic; Liu2013Epigenetic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD18B gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and methylation patterns. In lung cancer, ANKRD18B is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its downregulation or silencing. This hypermethylation is cancer-specific and not observed in normal bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Liu2013Epigenetic). The gene's hypermethylation is also associated with poor differentiation and advanced tumor stages in lung cancer patients (Liu2013Epigenetic).

In breast cancer, ANKRD18B is upregulated, and its expression is linked to low survival rates in Her2 positive cases. Treatment with curcumin derivatives has shown to hypermethylate ANKRD18B, leading to its downregulation, which may impact cancer progression (Nirgude2022Genomewide).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), ANKRD18B is associated with perineural invasion, indicating a potential link to poorer prognosis (Kuk2024Prognostic). Additionally, in cervical cancer, ANKRD18B expression is significantly altered in response to Doxorubicin treatment, suggesting its involvement in the therapeutic effects of the drug (Huang2023Investigating). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance across multiple cancer types.
