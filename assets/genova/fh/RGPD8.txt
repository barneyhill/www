# RGPD8

## Overview
RGPD8 is a gene that encodes the protein RANBP2-like and GRIP domain containing 8, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving intracellular transport and cellular organization. The RGPD8 protein is categorized as a component of the nuclear pore complex, where it facilitates nucleocytoplasmic transport, a critical function for the movement of RNA and proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Bushman2009Host). This protein is also involved in regulating GTPase activity, which is essential for mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy management (Gao2023Presenilin2). Additionally, RGPD8 is part of a rapidly evolving gene family with significant expression in the human brain, indicating its potential role in brain development and function (Tajeddin2023Novel).

## Function
RGPD8 (RANBP2-like and GRIP domain containing 8) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to intracellular transport and cellular organization. The RGPD8 protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, where it plays a significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, facilitating the movement of RNA and proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Bushman2009Host). This function is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and gene expression regulation.

The protein is believed to accumulate at the nuclear pore, assisting in the transport of molecules, which is essential for processes such as transcriptional elongation and RNA splicing (Bushman2009Host). RGPD8 is also implicated in the regulation of GTPase activity, which is vital for maintaining cellular functions like mitochondrial fusion and fission, processes that are crucial for cellular energy management and apoptosis (Gao2023Presenilin2).

In the context of human evolution, RGPD8 is part of a rapidly evolving gene family with high expression levels in the human brain, suggesting a role in brain development and function (Tajeddin2023Novel). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in both cellular and organismal biology.
