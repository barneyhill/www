# PIGB

## Overview
The PIGB gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class B, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for the attachment of proteins to the cell membrane, playing a significant role in various cellular processes, including signaling, adhesion, and immune response. The enzyme functions as an α1-2 mannosyltransferase, specifically adding the third mannose to the GPI precursor, a crucial step in GPI anchor assembly (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes; Peter2007Thematic). PIGB is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is characterized by its transmembrane domain, suggesting it may have multiple transmembrane regions (Peter2007Thematic). Mutations in the PIGB gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including inherited GPI deficiency syndromes and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and development (Schiavoni2021Further; Murakami2019Mutations).

## Function
The PIGB gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane. In healthy human cells, PIGB functions as an α1-2 mannosyltransferase, responsible for adding the third mannose to the GPI precursor. This step is crucial for the proper assembly of the GPI anchor, facilitating the post-translational modification and membrane attachment of proteins (Kinoshita2000Dissecting; Eisenhaber2003Enzymes; Peter2007Thematic).

PIGB is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it operates on the lumenal side of the membrane. The enzyme is part of the CAZy Glycosyltransferase Family 22 and is anchored by a transmembrane domain, although it may have multiple transmembrane regions (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes; Peter2007Thematic). The proper function of PIGB is vital for the stability and function of GPI-anchored proteins, impacting cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. Mutations in the pig-b gene can lead to the accumulation of GPI intermediates, disrupting normal cellular processes (Peter2007Thematic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGB gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions due to its role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis. These mutations can lead to inherited GPI deficiency (IGD) syndromes, which manifest as developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and various neurological abnormalities. Specific mutations identified in the PIGB gene include c.212G>A (p.Arg71Gln), c.1162G>C (p.Ala388Pro), and c.695G>A (p.Arg232His), among others. Affected individuals may experience axonal neuropathy, demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy, hearing loss, and visual impairment (Murakami2019Mutations).

Severe cases of PIGB deficiency have been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 80 (EIEE-80), characterized by developmental delay, early-onset epilepsy, and peripheral neuropathy (Schiavoni2021Further). Some individuals with PIGB mutations have been diagnosed with DOORS syndrome, which includes symptoms such as deafness, onycho-osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures (Murakami2019Mutations).

Additionally, a novel intronic variant in the PIGB gene has been associated with acrofrontofacionasal dysostosis type 1 (AFFND1), a condition marked by craniofacial abnormalities and intellectual disability. This variant leads to exon skipping, potentially disrupting GPI anchor synthesis (Palagano2021A).
