# MPG

## Overview
The MPG gene encodes the enzyme N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that plays a pivotal role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by excising a variety of modified purine bases, such as alkylated, deaminated, and etheno adducts, from DNA. N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase is primarily active in the nucleus, where it collaborates with other BER components to repair DNA lesions and prevent tumorigenesis (Song2012Nmethylpurine; Adhikari2015Germ). Beyond its glycosylase activity, the enzyme also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, influencing cell cycle regulation and genomic stability (Song2012Nmethylpurine). The MPG gene's expression and its encoded protein's interactions have significant implications in cancer biology and other diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Cerda1998Altered; Zaïr2012Diagnostic).

## Function
The human MPG gene encodes the enzyme N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase, which plays a crucial role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This pathway is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing small DNA lesions. MPG is a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that excises a variety of modified purine bases, including alkylated, deaminated, and etheno adducts, from both the major and minor grooves of duplex DNA (Adhikari2015Germ). One of its primary substrates is 1,N6-ethenoadenine, a lesion implicated in tumorigenesis (Adhikari2015Germ).

In healthy human cells, MPG is involved in recognizing and removing damaged bases, creating abasic sites that are further processed by the BER pathway to maintain genomic stability (Song2012Nmethylpurine). The enzyme is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other BER components to facilitate DNA repair (Krokan2000Base). MPG also has a glycosylase-independent function, interacting with the tumor suppressor protein p53 to inhibit its transcriptional activity, particularly affecting p53's ability to induce cell cycle arrest (Song2012Nmethylpurine). This interaction suggests a regulatory role for MPG in cell cycle progression and genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MPG gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, MPG expression is significantly increased, with mRNA levels up to 24 times higher in tumor tissues compared to normal breast epithelium. This overexpression is not due to gene amplification or polymorphisms but correlates with increased DNA glycosylase activity, potentially leading to chromosomal damage and gene mutations due to an imbalance in the DNA repair process (Cerda1998Altered). 

In esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), MPG mRNA and protein levels are also elevated, suggesting a role in disease progression. The expression pattern of MPG changes during the transition from normal tissue to Barrett's esophagus and eventually to EAC, indicating its potential as a marker for early detection (Zaïr2012Diagnostic).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the rs2858056 polymorphism in the MPG gene is associated with an increased risk of the disease. RA patients exhibit higher serum levels of MPG protein, although no significant association with clinical manifestations of RA was found (Huang2015Effect). These findings highlight the diverse roles of MPG in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker.

## Interactions
N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) is involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway and interacts with several proteins that play roles in DNA repair and cellular processes. Notably, MPG interacts with UHRF1 and UHRF2, as identified through immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP/MS). UHRF1 is crucial for DNA methylation maintenance and is over-expressed in various cancers, acting as an oncogene, while UHRF2 may function as a tumor suppressor. The interactions between MPG and UHRF1/2 were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and confocal microscopy, demonstrating colocalization in the nucleoplasm (Liang2013Identification).

The interaction between MPG and UHRF1 was observed in several cancer cell lines, including MCF7, Hela, and H1299, but not in normal HEK293 cells. This interaction is independent of the p53 status of the cells, as shown in experiments with p53 +/+ HCT116, p53 -/- HCT116, and p53 mutant BT474 cells. UHRF2 was also found to interact with MPG in HEK293 cells, suggesting a potential role in MPG-related pathways in cancer biology (Liang2013Identification). These interactions highlight the potential involvement of MPG in carcinogenesis through its association with the UHRF family.
