# NANOGNB

## Overview
NANOGNB is a gene that encodes the NANOG neighbor homeobox protein, which is a transcription factor involved in early human embryonic development. As a paralogue of the NANOG gene, NANOGNB is expressed predominantly during the 8-cell and morula stages of pre-implantation development, with its expression diminishing before the blastocyst stage (Dunwell2017A). The protein encoded by NANOGNB is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by modulating the expression of genes associated with transcription, intracellular signaling, and cell division (Yandım2019Expression). Although it shares some functional similarities with NANOG, NANOGNB has evolved distinct roles that are essential for early developmental processes, particularly in the transition to pluripotency (Dunwell2017A).

## Structure


## Function
The NANOGNB gene, a paralogue of the NANOG gene, plays a distinct role in early human embryonic development. It is primarily expressed during the 8-cell and morula stages of pre-implantation development, with its expression significantly dropping before the blastocyst stage and being undetectable in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Dunwell2017A). NANOGNB is involved in regulating a sharp pulse of gene expression during these early stages, modulating genes related to transcription, intracellular signaling, and cell division (Dunwell2017A). 

When ectopically expressed in adult human fibroblast cells, NANOGNB influences gene expression by upregulating 1070 genes and downregulating 1155 genes, suggesting its role in repressing genes highly expressed before the morula and blastocyst stages (Dunwell2017A). This regulatory function indicates that NANOGNB may play a role in early developmental processes, potentially influencing the transition to pluripotency (Dunwell2017A). The gene's activity is primarily nuclear, where it interacts with DNA to modulate gene expression, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Yandım2019Expression). Despite its divergence from NANOG, NANOGNB has evolved new developmental roles that complement those of its paralogue (Dunwell2017A).
