# NDUFA4

## Overview
NDUFA4 is a gene that encodes the NDUFA4 mitochondrial complex associated protein, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein functions as a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as Complex IV, and plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating electron transfer from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Misceo2024Biallelic; Balsa2012NDUFA4). Initially misclassified as a subunit of Complex I, NDUFA4 has been confirmed to be associated with Complex IV, where it contributes to the structural integrity and functional activity of the enzyme (Balsa2012NDUFA4). The protein is integral to maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis (Fu2023Ndufa4). Mutations in the NDUFA4 gene are linked to mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Misceo2024Biallelic).

## Function
The NDUFA4 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as Complex IV, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Misceo2024Biallelic; Balsa2012NDUFA4). NDUFA4 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of Complex IV, contributing to efficient electron transfer and ATP synthesis in healthy human cells (Misceo2024Biallelic; Balsa2012NDUFA4).

In the cell, NDUFA4 is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it ensures the proper functioning of Complex IV. It is not required for the assembly of other COX subunits but is crucial for the enzyme's activity, suggesting a role in the biogenesis of COX to become an active enzyme (Pitceathly2013NDUFA4). The protein's activity is vital for cellular energy metabolism, impacting various physiological processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis (Fu2023Ndufa4). NDUFA4's function is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and supporting normal physiological functions in tissues and organs (Zhou2024Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDUFA4 gene are linked to several clinical disorders. In the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, NDUFA4 mutations have been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by early onset neurological regression and elevated lactic acid levels. A biallelic deletion of the NDUFA4 gene results in mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Misceo2024Biallelic). Another study identified a homozygous splice donor site mutation in NDUFA4, leading to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency and a Leigh syndrome phenotype, highlighting its role as a COX subunit (Pitceathly2013NDUFA4).

In rodent models, a novel mutation in the Ndufa4 gene has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and the development of diabetes. This mutation causes impaired mitochondrial complex I activity, reduced ATP production, and increased oxidative stress, contributing to diet-induced diabetes (Yagil2018A). Alterations in NDUFA4 expression are also implicated in diabetic obesity, where miR-210 suppresses NDUFA4 expression, affecting glucose uptake and mitochondrial function in adipocytes (Tian2020miR210).

NDUFA4 is also involved in cancer, with its overexpression promoting growth and metastasis in colorectal and gastric cancers by modulating mitochondrial energy metabolism and signaling pathways (Zhou2024Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
NDUFA4 is a protein that interacts primarily with Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase, CIV) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It was initially thought to be a subunit of Complex I (CI), but recent studies have confirmed its role as a subunit of CIV. Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that NDUFA4 interacts directly with CIV subunits, but not with those of CI (Balsa2012NDUFA4). In cells lacking CIV, NDUFA4 is absent, supporting its role as a CIV subunit (Balsa2012NDUFA4).

NDUFA4 is not required for the assembly of other COX subunits, but its deficiency impairs COX activity, indicating its role in maintaining COX function (Pitceathly2013NDUFA4). The protein may facilitate the folding of MTCO1 or modify prosthetic groups, affecting COX activity (Pitceathly2013NDUFA4). In the context of cancer, NDUFA4 interacts with leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) to influence signaling pathways like Akt and Erk, impacting mitochondrial ATP changes and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells (Zhou2024Mitochondrial).

NDUFA4's interactions are influenced by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes, which affect its binding to Complex I and monomeric COX, highlighting its dynamic role in mitochondrial function (Kadenbach2021Complex).
