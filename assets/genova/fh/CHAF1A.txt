# CHAF1A

## Overview
CHAF1A is a gene that encodes the p150 subunit of the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, a critical player in nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair. The protein product, chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit A, is a key component of the CAF-1 complex, which is involved in depositing histones H3 and H4 onto newly synthesized DNA, thereby ensuring the proper reassembly of nucleosomes and maintaining genomic stability. This protein is categorized as a chromatin assembly factor and is essential for DNA repair processes, particularly the base excision repair pathway. CHAF1A's function is conserved across eukaryotes, underscoring its importance in cell proliferation and genomic integrity (Liu2023Structural; Sauer2018Mechanistic). The gene's expression and interactions have significant implications in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Meng2016Chromatin; Zheng2018CHAF1A).

## Structure
The CHAF1A gene encodes the p150 subunit of the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex, which plays a crucial role in nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair. The p150 subunit contains several important structural features, including DNA-binding KER and WHD domains, and a highly acidic ED region implicated in histone binding (Liu2023Structural). The WHD domain is involved in chromatin silencing and nucleosome assembly, participating in H3-H4 tetramerization (Sauer2018Mechanistic).

The p150 subunit's structure includes an extended conformation with its N-terminal region (NTR) and C-terminal region (CTR) binding to p48 and p60, respectively (Liu2023Structural). The ED-loop of p150 interacts extensively with histones H3 and H4, involving negatively charged residues that bind to positively charged residues on the H3-H4 heterodimer (Liu2023Structural). This interaction is crucial for safeguarding H3-H4 from promiscuous DNA interactions during replication.

The p150 subunit undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding to H3-H4, with the ED domain adopting an extended conformation to bind H3-H4 by traversing the positively charged surface formed by α1 helices of H3 and H4 (Liu2023Structural). The quaternary structure of the CAF-1 complex involves interactions between p150, p60, and p48, forming a bilobal core complex that indicates conformational plasticity (Liu2023Structural).

## Function
CHAF1A encodes the p150 subunit of the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), which plays a crucial role in nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair. In healthy human cells, CHAF1A is involved in the regulation of DNA repair processes, particularly the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This pathway is essential for repairing oxidized base lesions in the genome, which are induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Yang2016Regulation). CHAF1A interacts with NEIL1, a DNA glycosylase involved in the BER pathway, and this interaction is crucial for the regulation of single-nucleotide base excision repair (SN-BER) (Yang2016Regulation).

CHAF1A is part of a trimeric complex that deposits histones H3 and H4 onto newly synthesized DNA, ensuring the proper reassembly of nucleosomes after the replication machinery passes. This process is vital for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability (Sauer2018Mechanistic). CHAF1A is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it localizes to DNA replication sites by binding to the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) (Sauer2018Mechanistic). The protein's function is conserved across eukaryotes, highlighting its essential role in cell proliferation and genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHAF1A gene are associated with several types of cancer, indicating its clinical significance. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHAF1A is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. High CHAF1A expression is linked to increased tumor number, size, and poor differentiation, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC (Meng2016Chromatin).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CHAF1A overexpression is associated with reduced survival rates and increased recurrence, suggesting its role in cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Zhao2019Overexpression; Liu2017CHAF1A). Similarly, in gastric cancer, CHAF1A promotes tumor growth and is linked to poor clinical outcomes. It interacts with TCF4 to upregulate oncogenes like c-MYC and CCND1, contributing to gastric carcinogenesis (Zheng2018CHAF1A).

In neuroblastoma, CHAF1A inhibits differentiation and promotes aggressive tumor behavior. Its expression is repressed by the tumor suppressor p53, and its silencing leads to increased differentiation and reduced tumor aggressiveness (Barbieri2014Histone; Tao2021CHAF1A). These findings highlight CHAF1A's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CHAF1A, a subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in DNA replication and repair. It interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through its PIP2 domain, although the enhancement of PCNA monoubiquitination by CHAF1A is independent of this interaction (Wen2023CHAF1A). CHAF1A also interacts with RAD18, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and replication protein A2 (RPA2), which are crucial for the translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathway. The C-terminal domain of CHAF1A facilitates its interaction with RAD18, while the middle domain mediates binding to RPA2. These interactions are essential for the recruitment of RAD18 to PCNA, promoting PCNA monoubiquitination at K164, a key step in the TLS pathway (Wen2023CHAF1A).

In the context of gastric cancer, CHAF1A interacts with TCF4, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, to enhance the expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC and CCND1. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays and is significant for the transcriptional activity of TCF4 (Zheng2018CHAF1A). CHAF1A's role in these interactions underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential impact on cancer progression.
