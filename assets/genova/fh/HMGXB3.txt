# HMGXB3

## Overview
HMGXB3 is a gene that encodes the HMG-box containing 3 protein, which is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and influence chromatin structure and gene expression. The HMG-box containing 3 protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. It has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as cancer and schizophrenia, due to its involvement in cellular proliferation, tumorigenesis, and response to pharmacological treatments (Zhao2022Different; Sun2017Dicer; Guo2016Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
HMGXB3 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in gene expression and cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HMGXB3 is part of a risk signature that correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. It is associated with cancer-related pathways and immune response modulation, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC (Yu2022Characterization).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), HMGXB3 is involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and tumorigenesis. It is regulated by the DICER/miR-324-5p axis, where its upregulation contributes to CRC pathogenesis by disrupting intestinal barrier integrity and promoting cell motility (Sun2017Dicer).

HMGXB3 is also linked to schizophrenia, where genetic variants in this gene are associated with the response to risperidone treatment. This suggests a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and drug response (Zhao2022Different).

In gastric cancer, HMGXB3 is overexpressed, leading to enhanced cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Its downregulation can suppress tumor growth and improve chemosensitivity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Guo2016Knockdown; Wu2022Expression).
