# EXOC8

## Overview
EXOC8 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 8, which is a crucial part of the exocyst complex, an octameric protein assembly involved in the regulation of exocytosis. This protein plays a significant role in the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, facilitating the delivery of materials to the cell surface and the release of cargoes into the extracellular space. As a cytoplasmic and plasma membrane-associated protein, exocyst complex component 8 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein trafficking, membrane extension, and cell polarity (Halim2023The). It is particularly important in neuron development, where it contributes to axon and dendrite outgrowth and may mark sites for future synapse formation (Martin-Urdiroz2016The). Mutations in EXOC8 have been linked to several human diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and ciliopathies, underscoring its clinical significance (Halim2023The).

## Function
EXOC8, a component of the exocyst complex, plays a crucial role in exocytosis by facilitating the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. This process is essential for the delivery of materials to the cell surface and the release of cargoes into the extracellular space, contributing to various cellular functions such as protein trafficking, membrane extension, and cell polarity (Halim2023The). In healthy human cells, EXOC8 is involved in vesicle tethering, which is vital for secretion and cellular organization. It interacts with the GTPase RALB to regulate autophagy initiation and serves as a scaffold for recruiting and activating TBK1, which is important for host defense and cancer cell survival (Halim2023The).

EXOC8 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it contributes to cellular signaling and organization. It is also implicated in neuron development, particularly in axon and dendrite outgrowth, and is suggested to mark sites for future synapse formation (Martin-Urdiroz2016The). The exocyst complex, including EXOC8, is essential for cell viability, and mutations in its subunits have been linked to various human diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and ciliopathies (Halim2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOC8 gene, a component of the exocyst complex, are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and ciliopathies. Variants in EXOC8 have been linked to conditions such as Joubert syndrome, characterized by neurological symptoms and structural brain malformations. A specific missense variant, c.A794T; p.E265G, located in the pleckstrin homology domain, has been identified in a patient with Joubert syndrome, suggesting a potential role in ciliopathy disorders (Halim2024The; Halim2023The).

Truncating mutations in EXOC8, such as p.Asp607* and c.1714G>T; p.Glu572*, have been found in consanguineous families, leading to severe developmental disorders characterized by brain atrophy, microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and early death (Halim2024The; Coulter2020Regulation). These mutations result in a truncated protein, disrupting normal exocyst function and contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions.

EXOC8 is also implicated in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease, a common valvular abnormality. Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms near EXOC8 that are associated with BAV, suggesting a link between the exocyst complex and cardiac development (Fulmer2019Defects). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EXOC8 mutations in both neurological and cardiac disorders.

## Interactions
EXOC8, a component of the exocyst complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is part of the octameric exocyst complex, which includes other subunits such as Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 (Nishida‐Fukuda2019The). EXOC8 interacts with RAL GTPases, specifically RALA and RALB, playing a significant role in cellular signaling, particularly in autophagy initiation and host defense mechanisms (Halim2023The). This interaction is important for recruiting and activating TBK1, which is crucial for host defense and cancer cell survival (Halim2023The).

EXOC8 is also involved in human cerebral cortical development, where it interacts with EXOC7. This interaction is essential for the assembly of the exocyst complex and is implicated in neural progenitor cell proliferation and survival (Coulter2020Regulation). A novel truncating variant in EXOC8, resulting in a premature stop codon, has been associated with developmental disorders, indicating the importance of its interactions for proper protein function (Coulter2020Regulation). While EXOC8 is part of the exocyst complex, specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature (Halim2023The).
