following stressful growth arrest conditions and treatment with DNA-damaging agents. The protein encoded by this gene responds to environmental stresses by mediating activation of the p38/JNK pathway via MTK1/MEKK4 kinase. The DNA damage-induced transcription of this gene is mediated by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010].", "symbol": "GADD45A", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1333655"}, "unigene": "Hs.80409", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P24522", "TrEMBL": ["A0A087WZQ0", "A5JUZ3", "A0A3B3ITF9"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "GADD45A"}}
