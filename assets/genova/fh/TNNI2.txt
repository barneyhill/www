# TNNI2

## Overview
TNNI2 is a gene that encodes the protein troponin I2, fast skeletal type, which is a crucial component of the troponin complex involved in the regulation of muscle contraction in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. This protein functions as an inhibitory subunit within the troponin complex, playing a pivotal role in the calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction by modulating actomyosin ATPase activity. Beyond its primary role in muscle tissue, TNNI2 is also expressed in non-muscle cells, where it may influence processes such as angiogenesis. Mutations in TNNI2 are associated with various forms of distal arthrogryposis, highlighting its clinical significance in musculoskeletal disorders (Sheng2016TNNI1; De2019The; Johnston2017Troponin).

## Function
TNNI2 encodes the fast skeletal muscle isoform of troponin I (fsTnI), a critical component of the troponin complex involved in the regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. This protein plays a central role in the calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction by inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of calcium, thereby preventing muscle contraction until calcium levels rise (Sheng2016TNNI1; De2019The). 

In addition to its primary function in muscle tissue, TNNI2 is also expressed in non-muscle cells, such as those in the corneal epithelium and cartilage, where it has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis. This suggests a broader role for TNNI2 beyond muscle contraction, potentially involving the regulation of blood vessel growth and endothelial cell proliferation (De2019The; Johnston2017Troponin). 

TNNI2 is active in the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle cells, where it interacts with other proteins in the thin filament, such as troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), actin, and tropomyosin, to mediate the effects of calcium on muscle contraction (Sheng2016TNNI1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNNI2 gene, which encodes the troponin I type 2 protein, are associated with several forms of distal arthrogryposis (DA), a group of disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures. These mutations can lead to significant phenotypic variability and are linked to different types of DA, including DA1, DA2B (Sheldon-Hall syndrome), and Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) (Li2013A; Jiang2006A).

One study identified a novel missense mutation, p.Arg162Lys, in a patient with DA, highlighting the mutation's pathogenic potential due to its location in the actin-binding domain of TNNI2, crucial for muscle contraction regulation (Čulić2016Distal). Another study found a deletion mutation, p.K175del, in a large Chinese family with DA2B, emphasizing the mutation's cosegregation with the DA phenotype (Jiang2006A).

The p.I165F mutation in TNNI2 has been linked to Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, marking the first report of such a mutation in classical FSS. This mutation is located in the C-terminal region of the protein, which is critical for its function, and is predicted to have damaging effects (Li2013A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TNNI2 mutations in contributing to the pathogenesis of DA and related syndromes.
