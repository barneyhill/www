# HSD11B2

## Overview
The HSD11B2 gene encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of active glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, into their inactive forms, like cortisone, thereby regulating glucocorticoid activity within tissues (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid; AlikhaniKoopaei2004Epigenetic). 11β-HSD2 is an intrinsic membrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, functioning as a dimer and requiring NAD⁺ as a cofactor (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid). Its activity is essential for maintaining mineralocorticoid receptor specificity, particularly in aldosterone target tissues such as the kidney, colon, and placenta, where it prevents inappropriate activation by glucocorticoids (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid). Mutations in the HSD11B2 gene can lead to disorders such as Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess (AME), characterized by hypertension and electrolyte imbalances (Lu2022Apparent). The enzyme's expression and function are influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, which can impact its role in blood pressure regulation and the development of conditions like hypertension (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid; AlikhaniKoopaei2004Epigenetic).

## Structure
The HSD11B2 gene encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which is involved in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone. The enzyme is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and functions as an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase (Draper200511βHydroxysteroid). The protein is composed of 405 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 44 kDa (Draper200511βHydroxysteroid). 

The tertiary structure of 11βHSD2 includes a conserved NAD-binding Rossmann fold motif, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This motif consists of alternating α-helices and β-strands that form the NAD+ binding domain (Yau2016A; GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). The enzyme's catalytic domain is located in the cytosol (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). 

Mutations in the HSD11B2 gene can lead to structural changes that affect enzyme function. For example, the p.T267A mutation results in the loss of a hydrogen bond critical for NAD positioning, leading to misalignment in the binding site (Yau2016A). The enzyme's structure is also influenced by species-specific differences, which are important for its function (GomezSanchez202111βhydroxysteroid). 

The quaternary structure of 11βHSD2 is not detailed in the available context, nor are specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms mentioned.

## Function
The HSD11B2 gene encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), which plays a critical role in regulating glucocorticoid activity within tissues. This enzyme is responsible for converting active glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, into their inactive forms, like cortisone, thereby modulating the access of these hormones to their receptors (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid; AlikhaniKoopaei2004Epigenetic). This conversion is essential for maintaining mineralocorticoid receptor specificity, particularly in aldosterone target tissues such as the kidney, colon, and placenta, where it prevents inappropriate activation by glucocorticoids (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid; AlikhaniKoopaei2004Epigenetic).

11β-HSD2 is a stable intrinsic membrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as a dimer and requires NAD⁺ as a cofactor (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid). Its activity is crucial for regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure by ensuring that aldosterone can effectively bind to mineralocorticoid receptors without competition from cortisol (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid). The enzyme's expression and function are influenced by various factors, including epigenetic modifications, which can affect its role in blood pressure regulation and the development of conditions like hypertension (Chapman201311βHydroxysteroid; AlikhaniKoopaei2004Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD11B2 gene, which encodes the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, are linked to Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess (AME), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and low renin levels due to impaired cortisol metabolism, leading to excessive activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (Lu2022Apparent; Yau2016A). Mutations in the HSD11B2 gene can result in inactive or truncated proteins, significantly reducing enzyme activity. These mutations often occur in exons 3-5 and include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations (Draper200511βHydroxysteroid; Lu2022Apparent).

The clinical manifestations of AME can vary, with classic forms presenting severe symptoms such as low birth weight and refractory hypertension, while non-classic forms may have milder symptoms (Lu2022Apparent). Environmental factors, such as excessive ingestion of licorice, which inhibits 11β-HSD2, can mimic AME symptoms (Lu2022Apparent). Additionally, epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation of the HSD11B2 promoter, can alter gene expression and contribute to hypertension (AlikhaniKoopaei2004Epigenetic). These genetic and epigenetic factors, along with dietary influences, play a role in the phenotypic variability of AME (Lu2022Apparent).
