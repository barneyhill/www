# MSH5

## Overview
The MSH5 gene encodes the protein mutS homolog 5, which is a member of the MutS family of proteins involved in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination. MSH5 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, particularly during meiosis, where it forms a heterodimer with MSH4 to facilitate homologous recombination and proper chromosome segregation. This protein is characterized by conserved sequence motifs, including the Walker A and B motifs, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis. Beyond its nuclear functions, MSH5 also localizes to mitochondria, where it plays a role in protecting mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage and contributes to mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. Mutations in the MSH5 gene have been linked to reproductive disorders such as premature ovarian failure and non-obstructive azoospermia, as well as potential cancer risks, highlighting its significance in both reproductive health and genomic integrity (Bannwarth2012The; MandonPépin2008Genetic; Wu2011The).

## Structure
The MSH5 protein is encoded by the human hMSH5 gene, which consists of 26 exons and spans approximately 25 kb. The open reading frame (ORF) of hMSH5 is 2501 bp, encoding an 834-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 92.9 kDa (Wu2011The). MSH5 contains conserved sequence motifs typical of the MutS family, including the Walker A and B motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis (Wu2011The).

The interaction between hMSH4 and hMSH5 is mediated by specific regions: the carboxyl terminal region of hMSH4 and both the amino and carboxyl terminal regions of hMSH5. The first 109 and the last 103 amino acid residues of hMSH5 are necessary for forming a composite hMSH4-interacting domain, while only the carboxyl terminal 93 amino acid residues of hMSH4 are required to interact with hMSH5, suggesting an asymmetric structural partition in the heterocomplex (Wu2011The).

hMSH5 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IR-induced double-strand breaks, which affects the formation of the hMSH4-hMSH5 heterocomplex (Wu2011The). Multiple alternatively spliced transcripts of hMSH5 exist, resulting in different protein isoforms, including hMSH5a, hMSH5b, hMSH5c, and hMSH5d, which may have distinct functional roles (Wu2011The).

## Function
The MSH5 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA repair and meiotic recombination. In healthy human cells, MSH5 forms a heterodimer with MSH4, which is essential for homologous recombination, a process crucial for chromosome stability during meiosis. This complex interacts with recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions, facilitating their resolution and ensuring proper chromosome segregation (Yi2005Two; Wu2011The).

MSH5 is also implicated in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the apoptotic response to DNA damage. It interacts with proteins like hRad51, c-Abl, and hMRE11, which are involved in the mitotic DNA damage response. MSH5's phosphorylation by c-Abl is important for non-crossover DSB repair, and its deficiency can increase sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Wu2011The).

In addition to its nuclear functions, MSH5 localizes to mitochondria, where it protects mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from oxidative damage. It interacts with mitochondrial proteins such as Twinkle helicase and DNA polymerase gamma, contributing to mtDNA replication and repair, thus maintaining mitochondrial genome stability (Bannwarth2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MSH5 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders and potential cancer risks. In women, MSH5 mutations have been linked to premature ovarian failure (POF), a condition characterized by the loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40, leading to infertility. A specific heterozygous missense mutation, P29S, has been identified in patients with POF, affecting protein interactions necessary for DNA recombination and potentially leading to germ cell loss or ovarian carcinoma (MandonPépin2008Genetic).

In men, MSH5 mutations are implicated in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a severe form of male infertility characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate due to spermatogenesis failure. Studies have identified frameshift deletions and compound heterozygous mutations in MSH5 that lead to meiotic arrest and defects in germ cell development (Chen2022Mutations). These mutations disrupt the MSH5-MSH4 complex, crucial for chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis, resulting in infertility (Gong2022A).

Polymorphisms in MSH5, such as the C85T variant, have also been associated with an increased risk of male infertility, including azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia (Xu2010The). These findings underscore the critical role of MSH5 in reproductive health and its potential involvement in cancer predisposition.

## Interactions
The human MSH5 protein interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in DNA repair and meiotic recombination. MSH5 forms a heterocomplex with MSH4, which is crucial for recognizing and binding to recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions during meiosis and DNA repair. This interaction is mediated by specific regions on each protein, with MSH5 requiring both its amino and carboxyl terminal regions, while MSH4 requires only its carboxyl terminal region (Yi2005Two; Wu2011The).

MSH5 also interacts with c-Abl, a tyrosine kinase involved in DNA damage signaling. This interaction is facilitated by the (Px)5 motif within the NH2-terminal proline-rich region of MSH5, and it is involved in c-Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of MSH5 in response to ionizing radiation (Tompkins2009Evidence). MSH5's interaction with c-Abl can lead to the dissociation of the MSH4-MSH5 complex, affecting its role in DNA repair (Wu2011The).

In mitochondria, MSH5 interacts with Twinkle helicase and DNA polymerase gamma, suggesting a role in mitochondrial DNA repair and replication. These interactions are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity, especially under oxidative stress conditions (Bannwarth2012The).
