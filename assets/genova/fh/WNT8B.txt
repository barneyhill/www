# WNT8B

## Overview
WNT8B is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 8B, which is part of the Wnt family of signaling molecules. These proteins are integral to various developmental processes, particularly in the brain, where WNT8B expression is predominantly localized. The WNT8B protein is characterized by its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell fate determination, proliferation, and migration. As a signaling molecule, WNT8B interacts with Frizzled receptors to influence brain patterning and development, especially in the forebrain regions such as the hippocampus. The protein's structure is marked by a conserved sequence and post-translational modifications that are essential for its function. Dysregulation of WNT8B expression has been linked to several pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it serves as a prognostic marker. Additionally, WNT8B plays a role in vascular calcification, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases (Lako1998A; Tian2018Specific; Liu2020Wnt8B; Ngernsombat2021WNT8B).

## Structure
The WNT8B protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by a sequence of 351 amino acids, including 24 cysteine residues, which are crucial for its structure and function (Lako1998A; i&gt; Sehgal2018&lt; In). The primary structure of WNT8B shows high similarity to its orthologs in other species, such as mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish, indicating evolutionary conservation (Lako1998A). The protein contains a highly conserved Wnt family 'signature sequence' and two asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, which are typical post-translational modifications that play a role in protein folding and stability (Lako1998A; i&gt; Sehgal2018&lt; In).

The tertiary structure of WNT8B includes a thumb index fold, which is a significant feature identified through in silico modeling and docking studies (i&gt; Sehgal2018&lt; In). The protein's structure is further stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by the conserved cysteine residues. The WNT8B protein is also noted for its hydrophobic nature, which complicates its isolation and crystallization (i&gt; Sehgal2018&lt; In). The mature peptide of WNT8B shares 66% identity with WNT8A, suggesting structural similarities within the Wnt8 subfamily (i&gt; Sehgal2018&lt; In).

## Function
The WNT8B gene is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes intercellular signaling molecules that play critical roles in early development, particularly in the brain. In mammals, WNT8B expression is highly restricted to the brain, especially in sharply delimited regions of the forebrain, such as the hippocampus, dorsal thalamus, and posterior hypothalamus. This expression pattern is conserved between human and mouse embryos, suggesting a significant role in forebrain development (Lako1998A).

WNT8B is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell fate determination, proliferation, and migration. It acts as a morphogen, influencing the patterning of brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, during early development (Lako1998A). The gene's expression is confined to the germinative neuroepithelium during neurogenesis, indicating a potential role in cell proliferation (Lako1998A).

The regulation of WNT8B expression is not fully understood, but it may involve interactions with homeobox genes like Otx and Emx, which are expressed in the same forebrain structures (Lako1998A). Additionally, SOX21 is known to repress WNT8B expression to maintain rostral forebrain identity, highlighting its role in neural differentiation and regional identity (Fang2019SOX21).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WNT8B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), WNT8B is significantly upregulated, and this overexpression is associated with poor patient prognosis. High levels of WNT8B correlate with worse overall and recurrence-free survival, making it an independent prognostic factor for HCC. The gene's upregulation promotes cell proliferation through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2020Wnt8B).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), WNT8B expression is also elevated and serves as an independent prognostic marker. High WNT8B expression is linked to shorter survival times, indicating its role in poor patient outcomes. This expression pattern is independent of other clinical variables, highlighting its significance in NPC progression (Ngernsombat2021WNT8B).

Additionally, WNT8B is involved in phosphate-induced vascular calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells. Knockdown of WNT8B expression can protect against this calcification by inhibiting the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like end-stage renal disease (Tian2018Specific).

## Interactions
WNT8B is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in signaling pathways. It interacts with Frizzled receptors, such as Frizzled-3a (Fzd3a), to regulate the formation of forebrain commissures in zebrafish. This interaction is essential for modulating the expression of the chemorepulsive ligand slit2, which is crucial for axon guidance and the formation of glial bridges (Hofmeister2013Frizzled3a). 

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), WNT8B is regulated by the transcription factor ZNF191, which binds directly to the WNT8B promoter, enhancing its transcription. This interaction promotes cell proliferation through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, involving the accumulation of β-catenin and the regulation of target genes such as Cyclin D1 and c-Myc (Liu2020Wnt8B).

WNT8B also interacts with specific residues on the protein, such as His-183, Val-185, Ser-186, Gly-187, Ser-188, and Thr-190, which have been identified as potential binding sites for inhibitors like ZINC04029462. These interactions are significant for drug design targeting the WNT8B protein (i&gt; Sehgal2018&lt; In).
