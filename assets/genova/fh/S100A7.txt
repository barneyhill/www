# S100A7

## Overview
S100A7 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A7, commonly referred to as psoriasin. This protein is a member of the S100 family, characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, and is primarily expressed in epithelial cells. S100A7 plays a significant role in calcium-dependent signaling pathways and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein is known for its antimicrobial properties, particularly in the skin, where it acts as a defense mechanism against pathogens. Additionally, S100A7 interacts with several proteins, such as epidermal fatty acid binding protein (EFABP) and Jab1, influencing cellular adhesion, signaling, and cancer progression. Clinically, S100A7 is implicated in diseases like breast cancer and psoriasis, where its expression levels and interactions contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression (Emberley2004S100; Brodersen1999ZincBinding; Andresen2011S100A7psoriasin).

## Structure
The S100A7 protein, also known as psoriasin, is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins characterized by EF-hand motifs. Its primary structure includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate its function in calcium and zinc binding (Brodersen1999ZincBinding). The secondary structure of S100A7 is predominantly composed of alpha-helical elements, with each monomer containing five helices labeled I to IV. Helices I and II form the N-terminal EF-hand, while helices III and IV form the C-terminal EF-hand (Brodersen1999ZincBinding).

In terms of tertiary structure, S100A7 forms a compact, globular shape, which is typical of S100 proteins. The protein functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure, with the dimerization being crucial for its biological activity (León2009Identification; Brodersen1999ZincBinding). The zinc-binding site of S100A7 involves three histidine residues and one aspartate, which are critical for its structural conformation and function (Brodersen1999ZincBinding).

S100A7 is involved in calcium-dependent signaling and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with other proteins (Brodersen1999ZincBinding).

## Function
S100A7, also known as psoriasin, is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins and is primarily expressed in epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, S100A7 plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular functions, including energy metabolism, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Peng2022A). It is involved in the regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species and cytokines, contributing to the improvement of skin barrier function (Peng2022A).

S100A7 is also known for its antimicrobial properties, particularly in the skin, where it provides defense against pathogens such as E. coli (Andresen2011S100A7psoriasin). The protein is constitutively expressed in perinuclear granules of bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, suggesting a stable role in lung tissue related to its antimicrobial functions (Andresen2011S100A7psoriasin). Despite its involvement in inflammatory responses, S100A7 expression in lung epithelial cells is not significantly altered by inflammatory stimuli, indicating a potentially stable role in lung tissue (Andresen2011S100A7psoriasin). The protein's interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is crucial for its chemotactic activity, attracting immune cells to sites of inflammation (Donato2012Functions).

## Clinical Significance
The S100A7 gene, also known as psoriasin, is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In cancer, S100A7 is overexpressed in several tumor types, including breast cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. It is particularly expressed in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and is linked to estrogen-receptor-negative tumors, correlating with shorter recurrence times and poorer survival (Emberley2004S100; Shubbar2011Psoriasin; Vegfors2012The). 

S100A7 interacts with proteins such as Jab1, affecting signaling pathways like NF-kB and AKT, which are crucial for cell survival and may promote cancer progression (Emberley2004S100A7). Its expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly CD8+ T-cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, in the tumor microenvironment (Peng2022A). 

In addition to cancer, S100A7 is linked to inflammatory conditions like psoriasis, where it is highly expressed in psoriatic skin and acts as a chemotactic agent for CD4+ cells (Emberley2004S100). The gene's expression is regulated by reactive oxygen species and NF-kB signaling, contributing to its role in disease pathogenesis (Vegfors2012The).

## Interactions
S100A7, also known as psoriasin, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with epidermal fatty acid binding protein (EFABP), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins in keratinocytes. This interaction is influenced by calcium levels, which affect the localization of S100A7 and EFABP within the cell, suggesting a role in cell adhesion or signaling (Ruse2003S100A7; HAGENS1999Calciumbinding).

S100A7 also interacts with Jab1, a protein involved in breast cancer progression. Mutations in S100A7 that disrupt its binding to Jab1 have been shown to affect cell migration and invasiveness in breast carcinoma cells, highlighting the importance of this interaction in cancer pathways (West2009Structural; León2009Identification).

Additionally, S100A7 forms a complex with S100A10, as identified using ProteinChip technology and SELDI-MS, and this interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. S100A10, when used as bait, also showed a specific interaction with S100A7, indicating a network of interactions among S100 proteins (Lehmann2005Detection). These interactions underscore the multifaceted roles of S100A7 in cellular signaling and disease mechanisms.
