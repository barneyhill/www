# PIGF

## Overview
Phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class F (PIGF) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are essential for anchoring proteins to cell membranes. The PIGF protein, characterized by its six transmembrane domains, is involved in the transfer of ethanolamine phosphate during GPI anchor assembly, a process crucial for the proper localization and function of various cell surface proteins (Inoue1993Cloning; Stokes2014New). Functioning primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, PIGF forms complexes with other enzymes such as PIGO and PIGG, facilitating the biosynthesis pathway (Wu2020The). Mutations in the PIGF gene can lead to significant clinical implications, including impaired placental development and conditions such as preeclampsia, underscoring its importance in cellular differentiation and organismal health (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The).

## Structure
The PIGF protein is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, specifically in the ethanolamine phosphate transfer steps. It is a highly hydrophobic protein composed of 219 amino acids and contains six transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of its role in the membrane (Inoue1993Cloning; Stokes2014New). The C-terminal half of PIGF is crucial for binding to other proteins involved in GPI biosynthesis, such as PIGO and PIGG, although this region alone is not sufficient to complement PIGF-deficient cells (Stokes2014New). 

A conserved motif within the C-terminal region, consisting of the sequence PLDWxRxWQxWP, is critical for the protein's function but does not affect its binding to PIGO or PIGG (Stokes2014New). The protein's structure is integral to its function, as mutations in specific residues within this motif, such as Leu 175 and Asp 176, significantly impact its ability to restore Thy-1 expression (Stokes2014New). The PIGF protein does not have a typical N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide sequence, which is unusual for membrane proteins (Inoue1993Cloning).

## Function
The PIGF gene encodes a protein that is integral to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway, which is crucial for the proper localization and function of various cell surface proteins. In healthy human cells, the PIGF protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the early steps of GPI anchor assembly. This process involves the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins, which facilitates their tethering to the cell membrane, impacting cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Wu2020The; ÁlvarezSánchez2024The).

PIGF plays a role in stabilizing the GPI-EtNP transferase II complex by forming a complex with PIG-G, which is essential for the transfer of ethanolamine phosphate to the GPI anchor. This stabilization is necessary for the proper functioning of the GPI biosynthesis pathway (Wu2020The). The absence or dysfunction of PIGF can lead to impaired syncytiotrophoblast differentiation and placental development, as seen in studies involving trophoblast stem cells, highlighting its importance in cellular differentiation processes (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The). The PIGF protein's role in these molecular processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGF gene, which is involved in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway, have significant clinical implications. These mutations can lead to defects in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis, resulting in impaired syncytiotrophoblast differentiation and placental development. Such defects are associated with placental abnormalities and have been linked to preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related disorder characterized by high blood pressure and potential damage to other organ systems (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The). The disruption of the GPI pathway due to PIGF mutations can also lead to excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, further impairing placental function (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The).

Research has identified a gene signature associated with PIGF mutations that can effectively segregate preeclampsia samples from controls, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker for this condition (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The). Additionally, PIGF mutations may alter the secretion and composition of syncytiotrophoblast extracellular vesicles, potentially affecting fetal heart and neural development (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The). While a direct connection between PIGF mutations and specific human diseases has not been extensively reported, the dysregulation of the GPI pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (ÁlvarezSánchez2024The).

## Interactions
PIGF is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for attaching proteins to cell membranes. PIGF forms heterodimers with the enzymes PIGO and PIGG, which are responsible for transferring ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) to the second and third mannoses of GPI, respectively. This interaction is essential for the stable expression of PIGO and PIGG, highlighting the importance of PIGF in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (Stokes2014New).

The C-terminal region of PIGF is critical for its function and interaction with PIGO, as it contains a conserved motif that is essential for PIGF's role in GPI biosynthesis. Mutations in this motif, particularly at Leu 175 and Asp 176, significantly affect PIGF's ability to restore Thy-1 expression, although they do not impact its binding to PIGO or PIGG (Stokes2014New).

PIGF also has a homologue in Trypanosoma brucei, which specifically binds to the T. brucei PIGO homologue, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for PIGF in the EtNP transfer step of GPI biosynthesis (Stokes2014New). These interactions underscore PIGF's critical role in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway.
