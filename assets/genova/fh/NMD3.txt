# NMD3

## Overview
NMD3 is a gene that encodes the NMD3 ribosome export adaptor protein, which is integral to the nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells. This protein functions as a ribosome export adaptor, facilitating the transport of the 60S subunit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the CRM1-mediated export pathway. The NMD3 protein is characterized by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which are essential for its shuttling function between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Trotta2003Coordinated; Thomas2003Biogenesis). It interacts with specific regions of the 25S rRNA and ribosomal proteins, playing a critical role in ribosome biogenesis and ensuring the fidelity of ribosomal assembly (Sengupta2010Characterization). Mutations in NMD3 have been linked to various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, underscoring its clinical significance (Wu2020Association; Patchett2017The).

## Structure
The NMD3 protein is a ribosome export adaptor involved in the nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) located in its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its function in nuclear export. This NES is recognized by the CRM1 export pathway and is conserved across eukaryotes (Trotta2003Coordinated; Thomas2003Biogenesis). The NES is located between amino acids 480-489 in human NMD3 (hNMD3) and is essential for its export activity (Trotta2003Coordinated).

The N-terminal domain of NMD3 contains zinc-binding centers, which are important for its ribosome-binding function (Sengupta2010Characterization). The protein also has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminal domain, which facilitates its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Thomas2003Biogenesis). The NLS is a conserved region of basic amino acids, located between residues 405-422, and overlaps with a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) that promotes nucleolar retention (Trotta2003Coordinated).

NMD3 binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit as a monomer and interacts with specific regions of the 25S rRNA, including helices 38, 69, and 95 (Sengupta2010Characterization). The protein's interaction with the ribosome is crucial for its role in ribosome biogenesis and export.

## Function
The NMD3 gene encodes a ribosome export adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit in human cells. NMD3 functions as an adaptor for the CRM1-mediated export pathway, binding to newly formed 60S subunits in the nucleus and facilitating their transport to the cytoplasm (Trotta2003Coordinated; Thomas2003Biogenesis). This process is essential for ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, impacting cellular growth and proliferation.

NMD3 contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) at its C-terminal, which is critical for its export function. This NES is recognized by the export receptor CRM1, allowing NMD3 to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Thomas2003Biogenesis). The interaction between NMD3 and CRM1 is RanGTP-dependent, and NMD3 stabilizes the CRM1-RanGTP complex, enhancing its function in ribosomal subunit export (Thomas2003Biogenesis).

NMD3 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm under normal conditions, but it relocalizes to the nucleoplasm when CRM1 is inhibited, indicating its CRM1-dependent export (Thomas2003Biogenesis). This protein is involved in monitoring the maturity of 60S subunits, ensuring that only mature subunits are exported, thus maintaining the fidelity of ribosome assembly (Trotta2003Coordinated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NMD3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of ribosomal function. In Parkinson's disease, variations in the NMD3 gene, specifically the rs34016896 variant, have been associated with non-motor symptoms such as hallucination, apathy, and postural hypotension in Chinese patients. These findings suggest that genetic variations in NMD3 may influence the manifestation of certain symptoms in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential role in the disease's pathophysiology (Wu2020Association).

In the context of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the NMD3 gene is involved in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Mutations in the ribosomal protein Rpl10, such as the rpl10-R98S mutation, trap NMD3 in the ribosomal P site, blocking its release and affecting ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is significant in T-ALL, as similar mutations in Rpl10 are drivers of the disease. Suppressor mutations in NMD3 can restore ribosomal function by allowing the release of Nmd3, indicating its critical role in ribosomal maturation and its potential implications in T-ALL (Patchett2017The).

## Interactions
NMD3 is a ribosome export adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It interacts with the export receptor CRM1 (also known as Exportin 1), facilitating the translocation of the 60S subunit through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (West2007Novel). NMD3 binds to specific regions of the 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) on the intersubunit side of the large subunit, particularly involving helices H65, H69, and H95, as shown by cryo-electron microscopy studies (Sengupta2010Characterization).

NMD3 also interacts with the ribosomal protein RPL10, which is essential for its function in ribosome export. This interaction is crucial for the release of NMD3 from the 60S subunit in the cytoplasm, a process that requires the loading of RPL10 and the cytoplasmic GTPase Lsg1p (Sengupta2010Characterization). Mutations in NMD3 can affect its binding to the 60S subunit and its interaction with CRM1, leading to altered localization and function (West2007Novel).

NMD3's interactions with nucleoporins, such as Nup82, Nup159, Nic96, and Nup85, are also significant for the export of the 60S ribosomal subunit, highlighting its role in the nuclear export pathway (West2007Novel).
