# CCDC88B

## Overview
CCDC88B is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 88B protein, which is a scaffold protein involved in immune system regulation. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for cellular signaling pathways. CCDC88B is predominantly expressed in immune-related tissues and cells, including T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, where it plays a significant role in T cell maturation, activation, and dendritic cell migration (Kennedy2014CCDC88B; Olivier2024CCDC88B). The protein interacts with other molecules such as ARHGEF2 and RASAL3, forming complexes that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility, which are essential for immune responses and inflammation (Olivier2024CCDC88B). Alterations in CCDC88B expression or function are associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis (Kennedy2014CCDC88B; Olivier2020CCDC88B).

## Structure
CCDC88B encodes a protein characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These domains are composed of helical structures that contribute to the protein's ability to engage in cellular signaling pathways. The coiled-coil domains are integral to the protein's secondary structure, providing stability and enabling the formation of higher-order structures.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within cellular pathways. These modifications are crucial for regulating the protein's activity and its role in signaling processes.

CCDC88B is known to have splice variant isoforms, resulting in different protein forms that may have distinct functions. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's structure and potentially alter its interaction capabilities and functional roles within the cell. The presence of these isoforms highlights the complexity and versatility of CCDC88B in cellular processes.

Overall, the structural features of CCDC88B, including its coiled-coil domains and potential for post-translational modifications, underscore its importance in mediating protein interactions and signaling pathways.

## Function
The CCDC88B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of T cell maturation and effector functions. This protein is expressed in immune-related tissues such as the spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and thymus, and is abundantly present in immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and myeloid cells (Kennedy2014CCDC88B). CCDC88B is associated with the T cell receptor complex, indicating its involvement in T cell activation and signaling pathways (Kennedy2014CCDC88B).

In dendritic cells (DCs), CCDC88B is essential for mobility and migration, which are critical for their ability to activate T lymphocytes. The protein interacts with ARHGEF2 and RASAL3, forming a complex that regulates DC migration by modulating RHOA activation, a master regulator of cytoskeleton rearrangement and cellular movement (Olivier2024CCDC88B). This interaction suggests that CCDC88B is involved in cellular pathways important for immune functions, impacting the recruitment of myeloid cells to sites of tissue injury and influencing inflammatory responses (Olivier2020CCDC88B).

Overall, CCDC88B is a key determinant in the proinflammatory function of T cells and the mobility of dendritic cells, contributing to the organismal immune response and potentially affecting the severity of inflammatory diseases (Kennedy2014CCDC88B; Olivier2020CCDC88B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CCDC88B gene are linked to several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. CCDC88B is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, primary biliary cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis (MS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Olivier2024CCDC88B; Olivier2020CCDC88B). In particular, CCDC88B expression is elevated in the colon of IBD patients, correlating with disease risk in Crohn's disease (Olivier2024CCDC88B). The gene is located on chromosome 11q13, a locus linked to susceptibility to these conditions (Kennedy2014CCDC88B).

In mouse models, Ccdc88b-deficient mice are protected against DSS-induced colitis, suggesting that CCDC88B plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBD by affecting immune cell recruitment and inflammatory responses (Fodil2017CCDC88B). The gene interacts with ARHGEF2 and RASAL3, which are involved in dendritic cell migration and function, impacting neuroinflammation and colitis (Olivier2024CCDC88B). Mutations in these interacting proteins also affect dendritic cell motility, further implicating CCDC88B in immune regulation (Olivier2024CCDC88B).

Overall, CCDC88B's role in immune cell function and migration underscores its clinical significance in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, with its expression levels and interactions influencing disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
CCDC88B, also known as Girdin-like, is a scaffold protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in immune cell function and inflammatory responses. It physically interacts with RASAL3 and ARHGEF2, forming a complex that is essential for the regulation of dendritic cell (DC) function, particularly in the contexts of neuroinflammation and colitis (Olivier2024CCDC88B). 

RASAL3 is a cytosolic protein that acts as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, while ARHGEF2, also known as GEF-H1, is a Rho/Rac Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor that activates Rho-GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP (Olivier2024CCDC88B). The CCDC88B/RASAL3/ARHGEF2 complex is associated with the cell membrane and intracellular compartments, and it colocalizes with actin filaments, suggesting a link to the cytoskeleton (Olivier2024CCDC88B). 

These interactions are critical for the migratory properties of DCs and T cells, as they modulate the activation of RHOA, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement and cellular movement. ARHGEF2 promotes RHOA activation, while RASAL3 inhibits it, indicating their opposing roles in regulating cell motility (Olivier2024CCDC88B). The absence of these proteins affects the migration and inflammatory responses of immune cells, highlighting their importance in immune regulation (Olivier2024CCDC88B).
