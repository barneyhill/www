# MAIP1

## Overview
MAIP1 (matrix AAA peptidase interacting protein 1) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly those related to mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism. The protein encoded by MAIP1 is categorized as a mitochondrial matrix protein and plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity by facilitating the insertion of EMRE, a component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, into the mitochondrial membrane. This function is vital for mitochondrial calcium uptake, which is essential for various bioenergetic processes, including oxidative phosphorylation (Sakai2023miR27b). Additionally, MAIP1 is implicated in lipid metabolism, particularly in hepatic cells, where it helps suppress lipid accumulation, thereby influencing conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Sakai2023miR27b). Through its interactions with m-AAA protease complexes and other mitochondrial proteins, MAIP1 contributes to mitochondrial protein quality control and stress response pathways, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (StGermain2022Functional; Patron2018mAAA).

## Structure


## Function
MAIP1 (matrix AAA peptidase interacting protein 1) is a mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. It is involved in the protection of EMRE, a component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCU), from proteolysis by assisting in its membrane insertion. This function is essential for mitochondrial calcium uptake, which is critical for regulating various cellular bioenergetic events, including oxidative phosphorylation (Sakai2023miR27b).

In healthy cells, MAIP1 assists in the transport and integration of mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondrial membrane, which is vital for processes such as oxidative phosphorylation that depend on mitochondrial calcium levels. The localization of enzymes involved in β-oxidation to the mitochondrial membrane might also require MAIP1, and its depletion could disturb fatty acid degradation, leading to lipid accumulation (Sakai2023miR27b).

MAIP1 is also implicated in lipid metabolism, particularly in hepatic cells. It acts to suppress lipid accumulation, and its downregulation is associated with increased lipid levels, as observed in primary hepatocytes and the livers of high-fat diet-fed mice (Sakai2023miR27b).

## Clinical Significance
The MAIP1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), decreased expression of MAIP1 is associated with hepatic lipid accumulation. This downregulation is linked to the progression of fatty liver conditions, as observed in high-fat diet-fed mice and NASH patients (Sakai2023miR27b). The regulatory pathway involving miR-27b targets MAIP1, leading to lipid accumulation in hepatic cells, suggesting that MAIP1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH (Sakai2023miR27b).

MAIP1 is also involved in mitochondrial function, where its depletion may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to lipid accumulation in hepatic cells. This dysfunction is due to impaired fatty acid oxidation and increased oxidative stress, which are factors in the development of NAFLD (Sakai2023miR27b). In diabetes, MAIP1 interacts with PFKFB3, an anti-apoptotic gene, which may contribute to the survival of dysfunctional β-cells, affecting metabolic performance in diabetic conditions (Raval2024Dysfunctional).

## Interactions
MAIP1 (matrix AAA peptidase interacting protein 1) is involved in several interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It associates with m-AAA protease complexes, which are essential for mitochondrial protein quality control. MAIP1 contains a TIMM44-like domain, suggesting a chaperone-like activity, although it is not required for the proteolytic activity of m-AAA proteases. Instead, it regulates the membrane insertion of EMRE, a subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, linking m-AAA protease function to mitochondrial ion homeostasis. EMRE is identified as a novel substrate of the m-AAA protease, which degrades non-assembled EMRE subunits to ensure proper MCU assembly and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis (Patron2018mAAA).

MAIP1 also interacts with mitochondrial proteins, including those associated with the mitochondrial membrane, as evidenced by its interaction with the PHF8 processed pseudogene (PHF8-ps) in mice. This interaction supports its mitochondrial association and suggests a role in sensing mitochondrial stress and regulating stress response pathways (StGermain2022Functional). These interactions highlight MAIP1's role in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in broader cellular processes.
