# SLC13A5

## Overview
The SLC13A5 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 13 member 5, also known as the sodium-coupled citrate transporter NaCT. This protein is a transmembrane transporter primarily expressed in the liver and brain, where it plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by facilitating the uptake of citrate, a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Bhutia2017Plasma; Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). The NaCT protein is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in transporting citrate across cell membranes (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). Mutations in the SLC13A5 gene are linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 25 (DEE25), a severe neurological disorder marked by early onset epilepsy and developmental delays (Hardies2015Recessive; Matricardi2020Neonatal). The protein's activity is influenced by various physiological factors, including hormonal regulation and nutritional states, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Li2021Molecular).

## Structure
The SLC13A5 gene encodes the sodium-coupled citrate transporter NaCT, which is primarily expressed in the liver and brain. The protein's molecular structure includes multiple transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as a transporter. Specifically, the protein contains 11 transmembrane helices, similar to the bacterial homolog VcINDY, which provides a structural framework for understanding SLC13A5 (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). The transmembrane domains are involved in forming the substrate and cation binding sites, essential for the transport mechanism (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled).

Mutations in SLC13A5, such as p.Thr227Met and p.Asp524His, affect the protein's structure and function by altering substrate binding and ion coordination, which are critical for its transport activity (Klotz2016Mutations). The protein's tertiary structure involves the folding necessary for its function, with specific mutations predicted to destabilize the protein, affecting its free energy change and Van der Waals forces (Hardies2015Recessive).

The quaternary structure of SLC13A5 is suggested to be a homodimer, similar to VcINDY, with interactions between specific transmembrane helices of each protomer (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). This dimerization is important for its function as a transporter.

## Function
The SLC13A5 gene encodes a sodium-coupled citrate transporter, primarily expressed in the liver, with lower levels in the brain and testis. This transporter, known as NaCT, plays a crucial role in importing citrate from the extracellular space into cells, which is vital for maintaining cellular metabolic homeostasis (Bhutia2017Plasma; Li2021Molecular). Citrate is a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and is essential for energy production, fatty acid synthesis, and gluconeogenesis (Li2021Molecular; Hu2020Comparative).

In the liver, SLC13A5 facilitates the uptake of citrate for conversion into acetyl-CoA, which is crucial for lipogenesis and energy production (Bhutia2017Plasma; Li2021Molecular). The transporter is also involved in regulating intracellular citrate levels, impacting insulin sensitivity and lipid accumulation (Li2021Molecular). In the brain, SLC13A5 is expressed in neurons and astrocytes, where it contributes to neuronal function and excitability, potentially influencing conditions like epilepsy (Bhutia2017Plasma; Beltran2024Novel).

SLC13A5's activity is modulated by various factors, including hormones like glucagon and insulin, and is influenced by nutritional states, such as fasting and high-fat diets (Li2021Molecular). The transporter also plays a role in protecting cells from zinc toxicity, which is relevant to neuronal excitation and inhibition balance (Chen2023Mapping).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC13A5 gene, which encodes the Na+/citrate cotransporter, are associated with a condition known as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 25 (DEE25). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by early onset epilepsy, typically beginning within the first days of life, profound developmental delays, and dental abnormalities such as tooth hypoplasia or hypodontia (Hardies2015Recessive; Matricardi2020Neonatal). The condition is marked by pharmacoresistant seizures and significant neurological impairments, including motor difficulties, intellectual disability, and speech problems (Bhutia2017Plasma; AlQudairy2023Clinical).

The mutations in SLC13A5 lead to a loss of citrate transport, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal energy status and neurotransmitter production. This loss of function is believed to contribute to the epileptic symptoms and developmental delays observed in affected individuals (Hardies2015Recessive; Klotz2016Mutations). Despite various treatment attempts, including antiepileptic drugs and dietary interventions, the condition remains challenging to manage, with many patients experiencing persistent seizures and developmental challenges (Bhutia2017Plasma; Klotz2016Mutations).

## Interactions
SLC13A5, a sodium-coupled citrate transporter, interacts with various proteins that influence its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with the protein slc26a6, which regulates the activity of SLC13A5. This interaction is mediated by the H4c domain of SLC13A5, where specific residues such as R108, K107, and R112 play crucial roles. R108 is essential for maintaining transport function, while K107 and R112 are important for the interaction with slc26a6. Mutations that neutralize the charge at K107 and R112 can inhibit the interaction, although R108 remains critical for function (Khamaysi2020A).

The interaction with slc26a6 is thought to regulate SLC13A5 by dissipating the positive charge of the H4c domain, which is crucial for its transport function. This regulatory mechanism suggests that the basic amino acids in the H4c domain either directly mediate interaction with the slc26a6-STAS domain or maintain the stability of the H4c helix, essential for this interaction (Khamaysi2020A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving SLC13A5 and its role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis.
