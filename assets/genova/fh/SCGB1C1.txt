# SCGB1C1

## Overview
SCGB1C1 is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 1C member 1, which is part of the secretoglobin family of small, secreted proteins. This protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, particularly within the human respiratory tract, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and maintaining epithelial integrity. As an odorant-binding protein, it is localized to Bowman's glands in the olfactory mucosa, where it binds small, hydrophobic molecules, potentially influencing olfactory processes (Jackson2011Update). Additionally, secretoglobin family 1C member 1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation, with the ability to bind steroid ligands, thereby modulating inflammatory responses and potentially preventing nasal polyp development (Kim2024SCGB1C1). The gene's expression is regulated by cytokines, suggesting its involvement in immune modulation, particularly in respiratory health contexts (Lu2011The). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the biological activities and clinical significance of SCGB1C1 in both healthy and diseased states.

## Function
SCGB1C1, a member of the secretoglobin family, is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, including the human respiratory tract. It is involved in modulating immune responses and maintaining epithelial integrity. In healthy human cells, SCGB1C1 is thought to function as an odorant-binding protein localized to Bowman's glands in the olfactory mucosa, where it binds small, hydrophobic molecules (Jackson2011Update). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of inflammation, as it can bind steroid ligands, which may prevent nasal polyp development and modulate inflammatory responses (Kim2024SCGB1C1).

SCGB1C1 expression is influenced by cytokines, with IL-4 and IL-13 upregulating its expression in normal nasal mucosa, while IFN-γ downregulates it (Lu2011The). This regulation suggests a role in immune modulation, particularly in the context of respiratory health. Although its precise biological activities in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, SCGB1C1's involvement in these processes indicates its potential importance in maintaining respiratory health and modulating immune responses (Kim2024SCGB1C1). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions in non-diseased states.

## Clinical Significance
The SCGB1C1 gene is implicated in the suppression of allergic airway inflammation, particularly in asthma. Alterations in its expression have been associated with significant immunomodulatory effects. In an ovalbumin-induced asthmatic mouse model, intranasal administration of SCGB1C1 reduced airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic inflammation, and goblet cell hyperplasia. It also decreased serum total and allergen-specific IgE levels, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in managing asthma (Kim2024SCGB1C1).

SCGB1C1 expression is modulated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, which are involved in allergic responses. Increased expression of SCGB1C1 has been observed in the nasal mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, indicating a possible role in the pathophysiology of this condition (Lu2011The). The gene's expression is also influenced by adipose-derived stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, which further suggests its involvement in immune regulation and potential as a therapeutic target for allergic airway diseases (Kim2024SCGB1C1).

Despite these findings, the specific clinical significance of SCGB1C1 gene mutations or expression alterations in human diseases requires further investigation to fully understand its role and therapeutic potential (Kim2024SCGB1C1).
