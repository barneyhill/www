# WFIKKN2

## Overview
WFIKKN2 is a gene that encodes the protein WAP, follistatin/kazal, immunoglobulin, kunitz and netrin domain containing 2, a multidomain extracellular protein involved in various biological processes. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as whey acidic protein (WAP), follistatin, immunoglobulin, Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, and netrin (NTR) (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological). Functionally, WFIKKN2 acts as a potent antagonist of growth differentiation factors like myostatin (GDF8) and GDF11, which are part of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, playing a significant role in muscle development and differentiation (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological). Additionally, WFIKKN2 serves as a bifunctional axon guidance cue, influencing neural development by interacting with receptors in the DCC family to guide motor and sensory axons (Nickerson2023WFIKKN2). The protein's ability to bind and inhibit these growth factors, along with its role in axon guidance, underscores its importance in both muscular and neural development.

## Structure
The WFIKKN2 protein is a multidomain extracellular protein characterized by several distinct domains, including a whey acidic protein (WAP) domain, a follistatin domain, an immunoglobulin domain, two Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains, and a netrin (NTR) domain (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological). The follistatin domain is primarily responsible for binding mature growth differentiation factors, such as GDF8 and GDF11, while the NTR domain significantly contributes to interactions with the myostatin propeptide (Kondás2008Both). 

The protein's structure includes an N-terminal EGF-like subdomain and a C-terminal Kazal-like protease inhibitor subdomain, with anti-parallel β-strands and a central helix, stabilized by five conserved disulfide bonds (McCoy2019Crystal). The WFIKKN2 follistatin domain adopts an 'open' conformation, which is distinct from the 'closed' conformation observed in some other follistatin domains (McCoy2019Crystal). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at specific N-glycosylation sites, such as Asn 183, Asn 319, and Asn 519, which contribute to the protein's higher observed molecular mass compared to its calculated value (Kondás2008Both). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, testis, pancreas, brain, and lung, with notable expression in fetal brain and skeletal muscle (Kondás2011Biological).

## Function
WFIKKN2 is a multidomain protein involved in several molecular processes, primarily functioning as a potent antagonist of growth and differentiation factors such as myostatin (GDF8) and GDF11. These factors are part of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, which plays a crucial role in muscle development and differentiation. WFIKKN2 binds to these growth factors with high affinity, inhibiting their activity and thus regulating muscle growth and development (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological).

The protein contains multiple domains, including WAP, follistatin, kazal, immunoglobulin, kunitz, and netrin, which suggest its involvement in protease inhibition and cell signaling. The follistatin domain is primarily responsible for binding to myostatin and GDF11, while the NTR domain contributes to these interactions (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological).

WFIKKN2 also functions as a bifunctional axon guidance cue, interacting with specific receptors in the DCC family to guide motor and sensory axons during neural development. It attracts motor axons and repels sensory axons, ensuring proper axon pathfinding and fasciculation in the nervous system (Nickerson2023WFIKKN2).

## Interactions
WFIKKN2 is a multidomain protein that interacts with various growth and differentiation factors, notably myostatin (GDF8) and GDF11, both of which are part of the TGFβ superfamily. WFIKKN2 binds to these factors with high affinity, primarily through its follistatin domain, acting as a potent antagonist that inhibits their biological activity (Kondás2008Both; Kondás2011Biological). The protein also interacts with the propeptide region of myostatin, suggesting a broader interaction profile (Kondás2008Both).

In the context of axon guidance, WFIKKN2 serves as a bifunctional cue, interacting with divergent members of the DCC receptor family, including Punc, Nope, and Protogenin (Prtg). It repels sensory axons through Nope-mediated signaling and attracts motor axons via interactions with Punc or Prtg (Nickerson2023WFIKKN2). The interaction with Nope is crucial for its repulsive effect on sensory axons, as demonstrated by experiments with Nope-deficient mice (Nickerson2023WFIKKN2).

WFIKKN2's interactions extend to forming complexes with GDF8 and GDF11, competing with the type II receptor ActRIIB for binding, which highlights its role in modulating growth factor signaling (McCoy2019Crystal).
