# DEFA1B

## Overview
DEFA1B is a gene that encodes the protein defensin alpha 1B, which is a member of the alpha-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are integral to the innate immune system, providing a crucial defense mechanism against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Defensin alpha 1B is predominantly expressed in neutrophils and epithelial cells, where it functions by disrupting the membrane integrity of invading microorganisms, thereby neutralizing them. Beyond its antimicrobial properties, defensin alpha 1B also plays a role in modulating cellular processes, such as DNA replication and cell cycle progression, through interactions with proteins like ORC1. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of viral infections, such as Zika virus, where DEFA1B expression is upregulated, contributing to the inhibition of viral replication and potentially influencing neurodevelopmental outcomes (Li2020DEFA1B).

## Function
DEFA1B, or defensin alpha 1B, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the innate immune response. This protein is primarily expressed in neutrophils and epithelial cells, where it contributes to the body's first line of defense against infections. DEFA1B exhibits broad antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities, functioning as an effector peptide that disrupts the membrane integrity of pathogens, leading to their destruction (Li2020DEFA1B).

In the context of viral infections, DEFA1B has been shown to inhibit viral replication, particularly at the viral entry stage, although it can also affect other stages of the viral life cycle. For instance, during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, DEFA1B expression is upregulated, and it can inhibit ZIKV replication by interacting with ORC1, a component involved in DNA replication. This interaction prevents ORC1 from entering the nucleus, thereby retarding cell cycle progression and influencing cell proliferation (Li2020DEFA1B).

DEFA1B is also secreted into culture supernatants and can be carried by exosomes, allowing it to exert effects on recipient cells, such as inhibiting DNA replication and cell cycle progression. This highlights its role in both immune defense and cellular regulation, potentially impacting organismal outcomes like brain development during ZIKV infection (Li2020DEFA1B).

## Clinical Significance
The DEFA1B gene has been implicated in the context of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections, where its expression is significantly increased in exosomes derived from ZIKV-infected cells. This up-regulation of DEFA1B is associated with the inhibition of ZIKV replication, particularly before the virus enters host cells. The gene's interaction with the ORC1 protein, which is involved in DNA replication, leads to cell cycle retardation by preventing ORC1 from entering the nucleus. This mechanism may have implications for neurodevelopment, as it could contribute to microcephaly observed in ZIKV infections by affecting brain size (Li2020DEFA1B).

DEFA1B expression is also linked to cell cycle regulation, as its up-regulation reduces the growth rate of HEK293T cells and decreases the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase, indicating a retardation of cell cycle progression. This effect is transmitted to recipient cells through exosomes from ZIKV-infected cells, suggesting a broader impact on cell proliferation (Li2020DEFA1B).

While the clinical significance of DEFA1B gene mutations or expression alterations is not directly addressed, the gene's role in ZIKV pathogenesis and potential therapeutic implications are highlighted (Li2020DEFA1B).

## Interactions
DEFA1B, a human alpha-defensin, is known to interact with the ORC1 protein, a key component of the Origin Recognition Complex involved in DNA replication. This interaction has been confirmed through immunoblot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that DEFA1B binds with ORC1 in the cytoplasm. Despite DEFA1B not being expressed in the nucleus, its up-regulation leads to a significant decrease in ORC1 levels within the nucleus, suggesting that DEFA1B may influence the localization or stability of ORC1, thereby affecting its presence in the nucleus (Li2020DEFA1B).

The interaction between DEFA1B and ORC1 is implicated in the retardation of cell cycle progression. This effect is observed as DEFA1B decreases ORC1 levels in the nucleus, which is crucial for initiating DNA replication. The study suggests that DEFA1B's interaction with ORC1 could be linked to neurodevelopmental issues, such as microcephaly, particularly in the context of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, where DEFA1B exhibits antiviral activity (Li2020DEFA1B).
