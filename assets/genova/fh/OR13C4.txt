# OR13C4

## Overview
The OR13C4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 4, a protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction. OR13C4 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it functions in the detection of odorant molecules, initiating a cascade of cellular events that lead to the perception of smell (Wei2012Insights). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR13C4 has been implicated in broader biological processes, including potential associations with diseases such as pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in both sensory and pathological contexts (Wei2012Insights; Park2022Investigation). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the diverse roles of OR13C4 in human health and disease.

## Structure
The OR13C4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) class. These receptors typically exhibit a seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates the transmission of external signals into cells (Wei2012Insights). The primary structure of OR13C4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains.

The tertiary structure of OR13C4 involves the three-dimensional folding of these alpha helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific ligands and initiate signal transduction pathways. Although the quaternary structure is generally not applicable to olfactory receptors, as they typically function as monomers, the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its stability and activity (Wei2012Insights). The specific molecular structure of OR13C4, including any unique domains or prominent folds, is not detailed in the available literature, but its classification as a GPCR suggests a typical structural framework for this receptor family.

## Function
OR13C4 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, a critical process for the perception of smell. OR13C4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorant molecules. This binding initiates a signal transduction cascade that ultimately results in the neuronal response associated with the perception of odors (Wei2012Insights).

The olfactory transduction pathway, which includes OR13C4, is significant not only for sensory perception but also for its potential associations with various health conditions. For instance, OR13C4 has been identified as significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk, suggesting that olfactory receptors may have broader biological roles beyond olfaction (Wei2012Insights). Despite these associations, the specific function of OR13C4 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to understand its precise role in cellular and physiological processes (Wei2012Insights). The gene's involvement in the GPCR signaling pathway highlights its importance in transmitting external signals into cells, which is crucial for various physiological processes (Wei2012Insights).

## Clinical Significance
The OR13C4 gene has been implicated in several conditions through its association with genetic pathways. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified the olfactory transduction pathway, which includes OR13C4, as significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk. This association was consistent across different cohorts, suggesting a potential role for OR13C4 in the disease's etiology (Wei2012Insights). The study highlighted OR13C4 as a major contributing gene to the olfactory transduction pathway, which was one of the top pathways with consistent small P values in pancreatic cancer studies (Wei2012Insights).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), OR13C4 was found to be upregulated in patients with low platelet counts, indicating a possible involvement in the disease's pathology (Park2022Investigation). However, the specific clinical significance of OR13C4 mutations or expression alterations in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated. While the gene has been associated with these diseases, further research is needed to understand the precise biological and molecular mechanisms involved.
