# ZRANB1

## Overview
ZRANB1 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger RANBP2-type containing 1, also known as TRABID. This protein is a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated signaling pathways. It is characterized by the presence of three zinc-finger domains and a ubiquitin thioesterase domain, which facilitate its function in modulating the ubiquitination status of various target proteins, thereby influencing their stability and activity (Bai2011Identification). ZRANB1 is involved in critical cellular processes, including the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, cytoskeletal organization, and immune signaling, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development (Bai2011Identification). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions have significant implications in health and disease, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer progression (Frank2023Trabid; Feng2019Ubiquitination).

## Function
ZRANB1, also known as TRABID, is a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its role in ubiquitin-mediated signaling pathways. It contains three zinc-finger domains and a ubiquitin thioesterase domain, which enable it to regulate the ubiquitination of target proteins, influencing their stability and function (Bai2011Identification). ZRANB1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology by modulating actin filament distribution and stress fiber formation (Bai2011Identification).

In healthy human cells, ZRANB1 is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell proliferation and differentiation. It achieves this by deubiquitinating APC, a key component of the Wnt pathway, thereby influencing microtubule dynamics and the actin cytoskeleton (Bai2011Identification). ZRANB1 also interacts with TRAF6, suggesting a role in immune signaling pathways (Bai2011Identification). Through these activities, ZRANB1 contributes to cellular homeostasis and the regulation of cell migration, which are essential for normal cellular function and organismal development (Bai2011Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZRANB1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Specific missense mutations, such as R438W and A451V, are associated with conditions like developmental microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay, autism, and constipation. These mutations disrupt the gene's deubiquitylating activity and its interaction with the STRIPAK complex, which is crucial for proper neuronal development. The impaired trafficking of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) due to these mutations affects neuronal growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth, leading to the observed developmental phenotypes (Frank2023Trabid).

In the context of cancer, ZRANB1 functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme that can promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. It cleaves specific polyubiquitin chains from UVRAG, enhancing interactions that inhibit autophagy-dependent degradation of EGFR, thereby acting as an oncogene (Feng2019Ubiquitination).

Alterations in ZRANB1 expression are also linked to retinal neurodegeneration in glaucoma. The circular RNA form, cZRANB1, is upregulated in glaucomatous retinas, contributing to retinal ganglion cell degeneration. Targeting cZRANB1 could offer therapeutic potential for treating retinal neurodegeneration (Wang2018Targeting). Additionally, cZRANB1 is involved in neuropathic pain regulation, acting through the miR-24-3p/LPAR3 axis, which affects pain signaling pathways (Wei2020Downregulated).

## Interactions
ZRANB1, also known as TRABID, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that participates in several protein interactions. It interacts with the protein CSNK1A1, which phosphorylates ZRANB1 at conserved sites Thr35 and Ser209. This phosphorylation enhances ZRANB1's deubiquitinating activity towards UVRAG, a protein involved in autophagy, and promotes its binding to UVRAG, inhibiting K29- and K33-linked ubiquitination of UVRAG (Feng2019Ubiquitination). ZRANB1 also interacts with specificity protein 1 (SP1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, stabilizing SP1 by deubiquitinating it. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) expression, which is important for HCC progression (Xie2021ZRANB1). Additionally, ZRANB1 selectively interacts with K29- and K33-linked ubiquitin chains, as confirmed by western blot analysis and competition experiments (Zhao2017Identification). These interactions highlight ZRANB1's role in regulating ubiquitin signaling and its involvement in various cellular processes, including autophagy and cancer progression.
