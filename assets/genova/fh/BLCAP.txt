# BLCAP

## Overview
BLCAP, or Bladder Cancer Associated Protein, is a gene that encodes a small, evolutionarily conserved protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle processes. The BLCAP protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains and is implicated in cellular signaling and gene expression regulation. It functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with key proteins such as Rb1 and STAT3, influencing pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis and inhibit tumor growth (ZHAO2016BLCAP; Gromova2017Identification). The gene undergoes RNA editing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may affect its function and role in cancer biology (Galeano2010Human). BLCAP's involvement in various cancers, including bladder and cervical cancer, highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (ZHAO2016BLCAP; Chen2017Upregulated).

## Structure
The BLCAP protein is a small, highly conserved protein consisting of 87 amino acids. It is characterized by two transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic domains at the N and C terminals (ZHAO2016BLCAP). The protein includes specific motifs such as PXXP (proline-X-X-proline) and SPXX (Ser-Pro-X-X), which are involved in cell signaling pathways and gene expression regulation through phosphorylation (ZHAO2016BLCAP). 

BLCAP contains several putative phosphorylation sites, including Ser66, Ser71, Ser73, and Ser78, which are potential targets for kinases like Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated, cdc2, and casein kinase II (ZHAO2016BLCAP). These phosphorylation sites suggest that post-translational modifications play a significant role in its function.

The BLCAP transcript undergoes RNA editing, resulting in multiple protein isoforms. These editing events can alter the amino acid sequence, such as converting tyrosine to cysteine at position 2, glutamine to arginine at position 5, and lysine to arginine at position 15, potentially leading to up to eight different isoforms (Galeano2010Human). The protein's structure and function are influenced by these modifications, which may impact its role as a tumor suppressor.

## Function
BLCAP, or Bladder Cancer Associated Protein, is a small, evolutionarily conserved protein involved in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle processes in human cells. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis and potentially suppress tumor growth (Gromova2012Immunoexpression). BLCAP is known to interact with Rb1 proteins, inhibiting their phosphorylation, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation. This interaction suggests that BLCAP plays a role in arresting the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis (ZHAO2016BLCAP).

In healthy cells, BLCAP is suggested to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis independently of the p53 and NF-κB pathways, indicating a unique mechanism of action (ZHAO2016BLCAP). The protein contains trans-membrane domains and phosphorylation sites that may bind DNA, further implicating its role in cellular signaling and gene expression regulation (ZHAO2016BLCAP). Despite its significant role in cancer biology, the precise function of BLCAP in normal human cells remains less clear, as it shows no significant homology to other known mammalian proteins (Gromova2012Immunoexpression).

## Clinical Significance
The BLCAP gene, known for its tumor-suppressive properties, plays a significant role in various cancers through its impact on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In cervical cancer, BLCAP has been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of the Rb1 protein, thereby blocking the G1/S checkpoint and inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells. This suggests that BLCAP's interaction with Rb1 is crucial for its antitumor activity, and alterations in this interaction could influence cancer progression (ZHAO2016BLCAP).

In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the expression of BLCAP is directly targeted by miR-9-3p, a microRNA that is upregulated in MTC tissues. The binding of miR-9-3p to the 3'-UTR of BLCAP mRNA leads to its downregulation, which is associated with increased cell growth and reduced apoptosis. This interaction highlights the potential role of BLCAP in MTC tumorigenesis and suggests that changes in miR-9-3p levels could significantly impact BLCAP expression and function (Chen2017Upregulated).

Overall, alterations in BLCAP expression or its interactions, such as those with Rb1 or miR-9-3p, may contribute to the development and progression of certain cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
BLCAP, also known as Bladder Cancer Associated Protein, has been identified as a novel interaction partner of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) in bladder cancer. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays, which confirmed the physical interaction between BLCAP and STAT3 in bladder cancer cells. The interaction is facilitated by a YXXQ motif in BLCAP, a known docking site for STAT3, similar to motifs found in various signal-transducing receptors (Gromova2017Identification).

BLCAP co-localizes with phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in the nuclei of bladder cancer cells, suggesting a role in modulating STAT3 signaling pathways. This co-localization was observed using multicolor immunofluorescence analysis and 2D western immunoblotting, although the expression levels of BLCAP and p-STAT3 are not always correlated (Gromova2017Identification).

In addition to its interaction with STAT3, BLCAP has been implicated in apoptosis regulation. In human Ewing's sarcoma cells, overexpression of BLCAP led to growth inhibition and increased apoptosis, linked to the down-regulation of EWS-FLI1 and BCL-2, and activation of caspase pathways (Fan2011BLCAP).
