# NXPH2

## Overview
NXPH2 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin 2, a member of the neurexophilin family of secreted glycoproteins. Neurexophilin 2 is characterized by its multidomain structure, including an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal domain rich in conserved cysteine residues, which are indicative of its role as a secreted protein with structural stability (Petrenko1996Structure). The protein is highly N-glycosylated, a modification essential for its function and stability (Petrenko1996Structure). Neurexophilin 2 interacts with neurexins, presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules, playing a crucial role in synaptic function and neuronal communication (Petrenko1996Structure). Although specific details about NXPH2's interactions are limited, it is known to be highly expressed in the nervous system, contributing to synaptic connectivity and plasticity. The gene is expressed exclusively in humans and does not interact with α-neurexins, distinguishing it from other neurexophilins (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin). The precise mechanisms by which NXPH2 influences synaptic dynamics are still under investigation, highlighting its importance in the healthy functioning of neural circuits.

## Structure
Neurexophilin 2 (NXPH2) is a protein characterized by a multidomain structure. It includes an N-terminal signal peptide, which is indicative of its role as a secreted protein, and a C-terminal domain rich in conserved cysteine residues, suggesting the presence of disulfide bonds that contribute to its structural stability (Petrenko1996Structure). The protein is highly N-glycosylated, a post-translational modification that is common among secreted glycoproteins, and this glycosylation is essential for its function and stability (Petrenko1996Structure). 

NXPH2 is part of the neurexophilin family, which interacts with neurexins, presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules involved in synaptic function. The interaction between neurexophilins and neurexins is specific and requires complete denaturation for dissociation, indicating a strong binding affinity (Petrenko1996Structure). Although detailed structural data specific to NXPH2 is limited, it is suggested that neurexophilins, in general, have a mature fragment that includes distinct N-terminal glycosylated and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains (Wilson2019Structures). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in synaptic connectivity, although the exact functions of NXPH2 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
NXPH2 (neurexophilin 2) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function within the nervous system. Neurexophilin 2 is a secreted glycoprotein that interacts with neurexins, which are essential cell adhesion molecules involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. This interaction is vital for synaptic signaling and neuronal communication, facilitating the proper transmission of signals across synapses. The protein's activity is primarily localized in the nervous system, where it contributes to the complex processes of synaptic connectivity and plasticity. By participating in these molecular processes, NXPH2 supports the overall function of neural circuits, which is critical for maintaining normal cognitive and motor functions in humans. The precise mechanisms by which NXPH2 influences synaptic dynamics are still under investigation, but its role in modulating synaptic interactions underscores its importance in the healthy functioning of the nervous system.

## Interactions
Neurexophilin 2 (NXPH2) is a member of the neurexophilin family, which are secreted glycoproteins known to interact with neurexins, a family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules. These interactions are crucial for synapse formation and function. However, specific details about the interactions of NXPH2 are limited. The protein was not successfully produced for binding studies, which precluded quantitative measurements of its interactions with neurexins (Wilson2019Structures). 

NXPH2 is noted for its high expression in macrophages during immune system exhaustion and is considered a prognostic factor in certain cancers. It is suggested to have a potential inhibitory role in hematopoiesis similar to NXPH1, as NXPH2, along with NXPH1 and NXPH3, binds NRXN1α and can complement each other in knockout animals (Kinzfogl2011Neurexophilin). However, NXPH2 is expressed only in humans and does not interact with α-neurexins, unlike other neurexophilins such as NXPH1 and NXPH3 (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin). The specific interactions of NXPH2 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
