# CA5B

## Overview
The CA5B gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme carbonic anhydrase 5B, which is part of the carbonic anhydrase family, a group of zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. This enzyme is crucial for various metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis, by providing bicarbonate ions necessary for these pathways (Fadason2020A). Carbonic anhydrase 5B is expressed in multiple tissues such as the liver, heart, and kidneys, highlighting its broad physiological role (Shah2000Mitochondrial). While no direct human diseases have been linked to CA5B deficiency, its involvement in metabolic pathways suggests a supportive function, especially when other carbonic anhydrases are deficient (DiezFernandez2016Defective). Additionally, CA5B has been implicated in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, with its inhibition by thiazide diuretics affecting glucose metabolism (Kucharczyk2022Thiazides).

## Function
The CA5B gene encodes the mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase 5B enzyme, which plays a significant role in various metabolic processes within healthy human cells. This enzyme is involved in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, a critical reaction that supplies bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) necessary for several metabolic pathways (Fadason2020A). In mitochondria, CA5B provides bicarbonate ions required by pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis and by carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 for pyrimidine biosynthesis, which are essential for cellular functions such as energy production and nucleotide synthesis (Fadason2020A).

CA5B is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the liver, heart, lung, kidney, testes, and muscle, indicating its broad physiological importance (Shah2000Mitochondrial). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining acid-base balance and supporting metabolic processes by regulating pH and ion transport within cells (Shah2000Mitochondrial). Although no human disease has been directly linked to CA5B deficiency, its role in metabolic pathways suggests it may have a supportive function, particularly when other carbonic anhydrases are deficient (DiezFernandez2016Defective).

## Clinical Significance
The CA5B gene, encoding mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase 5b, plays a significant role in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Alterations in CA5B expression or function can lead to metabolic disturbances, particularly in the context of thiazide diuretic treatment. Thiazides, such as hydrochlorothiazide, inhibit CA5B in β-cells, resulting in reduced insulin secretion and glucose intolerance (Kucharczyk2022Thiazides). This inhibition is CO2/HCO3--dependent and not additive to unselective carbonic anhydrase inhibition (Kucharczyk2022Thiazides). 

Research indicates that genetic deletion of CA5B in mice confers resistance to thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, suggesting that CA5B is a critical target of thiazides in β-cells (Kucharczyk2022Thiazides). The absence of CA5B does not lead to metabolic abnormalities in knockout mice, unlike CA5a knockout mice, which exhibit reduced growth and hyperammonemia, highlighting the non-redundant roles of mitochondrial CA isoforms (Kucharczyk2022Thiazides). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CA5B in maintaining glucose homeostasis and suggest that its dysfunction could contribute to glucose intolerance or diabetes, particularly in patients undergoing thiazide treatment (Kucharczyk2022Thiazides).
