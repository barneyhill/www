# IMMP1L

## Overview
IMMP1L is a gene that encodes the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 1, a critical component of the mitochondrial inner membrane protease complex. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial intermembrane space protease and is essential for the processing and maturation of mitochondrial precursor proteins. IMMP1L, in conjunction with its partner IMMP2L, cleaves specific carboxy-terminal sequences in proteins, facilitating their proper assembly and function within the mitochondria (Quirós2015New). The proteolytic activity of IMMP1L is vital for the maturation and localization of proteins to the intermembrane space, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular health (Quirós2015New). The gene's role in mitochondrial integrity underscores its importance in cellular energy production and metabolism, with potential implications in various biological processes and diseases (Botham2019Global; Lawther2023Antioxidant).

## Function
IMMP1L, or inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 1, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial inner membrane protease complex. It plays a significant role in the processing and maturation of mitochondrial precursor proteins. IMMP1L, along with IMMP2L, cleaves specific carboxy-terminal sequences in proteins, facilitating their proper assembly and function within the mitochondria (Quirós2015New). This proteolytic activity is essential for the maturation and localization of proteins to the intermembrane space, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular health (Quirós2015New).

IMMP1L forms a dimeric protease complex with IMMP2L, and while their interactomes overlap, they also have unique substrate profiles, indicating distinct roles in mitochondrial protein processing (Botham2019Global). The activity of IMMP1L is crucial for the assembly of the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complexes, which are involved in protein import into mitochondria (Quirós2015New). By ensuring the proper processing and assembly of mitochondrial proteins, IMMP1L supports mitochondrial integrity and function, which are essential for cellular energy production and metabolism (Quirós2015New).

## Interactions
IMMP1L, a mitochondrial intermembrane space protease, is known to form a dimeric protease complex with IMMP2L. This interaction was identified through proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) analysis, which revealed partially overlapping interactomes for IMMP1L and IMMP2L, with 89 shared interactors out of 143 for IMMP1L and 243 for IMMP2L. This suggests that while they share some interactors, each protease also has unique interactions (Botham2019Global). The study validated 24 interactions detected with the BioID approach using FLAG immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), supporting the formation of this complex (Botham2019Global).

In yeast, the homologs of IMMP1L and IMMP2L, known as Imp1 and Imp2, respectively, also form a heterodimeric complex, which is crucial for their function. The loss of Imp2 destabilizes this complex, but it can be stabilized by the expression of mouse Immp2l, indicating functional complementation (Lawther2023Antioxidant). The interaction between IMMP1L and IMMP2L is further supported by predictions using AlphaFold2-Multimer, which show high confidence in their heterodimerization (Lawther2023Antioxidant). These interactions highlight the importance of IMMP1L in mitochondrial function and its potential implications in various biological processes.
