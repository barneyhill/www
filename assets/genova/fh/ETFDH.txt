# ETFDH

## Overview
The ETFDH gene encodes the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme integral to the electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons from electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) to the ubiquinone pool. This process is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production within cells (Herrero2024An; Wang2020Clinical). The ETFDH protein is composed of three functional domains: the FAD-binding domain, the 4Fe-4S cluster, and the coenzyme Q10 binding domain, which are critical for its role in electron transfer (Feng2024Via; Missaglia2018Characterization). Mutations in the ETFDH gene can lead to multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), a metabolic disorder affecting fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, with clinical manifestations ranging from neonatal onset to riboflavin-responsive forms (Wang2020Clinical; Missaglia2018Characterization).

## Structure
The ETFDH gene encodes the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial protein located in the inner membrane. This protein is crucial for the electron-transfer system, facilitating electron transport from flavoprotein dehydrogenases to the ubiquinone pool (Missaglia2018Characterization). The ETFDH protein consists of 617 amino acid residues and is organized into three functional regions: the FAD-binding domain, the 4Fe4S cluster, and the ubiquinone (UQ) binding domain. The FAD-binding domain includes an ADP-binding motif between amino acids G42-G47 (Missaglia2018Characterization).

The protein's secondary structure features include alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are typical of mitochondrial enzymes involved in electron transport. The tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions within the FAD-binding domain, crucial for maintaining the protein's stability and function (Er2011Computational). The quaternary structure of ETFDH is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

Mutations in the ETFDH gene can lead to multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), affecting the protein's stability and function. These mutations often occur in conserved regions, impacting the FAD-binding domain and potentially altering protein folding and electron transfer efficiency (Er2011Computational; Missaglia2018Characterization).

## Function
The ETFDH gene encodes the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase, a crucial enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a significant role in the electron transport chain by facilitating the transfer of electrons from electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) to the ubiquinone pool, a process essential for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production in cells (Herrero2024An; Wang2020Clinical). ETFDH is involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids, linking these metabolic pathways to the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain (Olsen2007ETFDH; Wang2020Clinical).

ETFDH contains three functional domains: the FAD-binding domain, the 4Fe-4S cluster, and the coenzyme Q10 binding domain, which are critical for its electron transfer function (Feng2024Via; Missaglia2018Characterization). In healthy cells, ETFDH ensures efficient electron transport, maintaining the balance of coenzyme Q in its oxidized and reduced forms, which is vital for ATP production and minimizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Herrero2024An). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and proper electron flow, supporting overall cellular energy metabolism and function (Herrero2024An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ETFDH gene are associated with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric acidemia type II (GA II), a metabolic disorder that affects fatty acid, amino acid, and choline metabolism. MADD is characterized by a range of clinical phenotypes, including neonatal onset with or without congenital anomalies and mild or late onset, which is often riboflavin-responsive (Wang2020Clinical; Missaglia2018Characterization). 

Patients with ETFDH mutations may present with symptoms such as muscle weakness, lipid storage myopathy, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated levels of organic acids and acylcarnitines (Angelini2017Heterogeneous; Ou2020A). Specific mutations, such as c.250G>A (p.A84T) and c.1514T>C, have been identified in various populations and are linked to the severity of the disease (Lan2010High; Wang2020Clinical). 

Riboflavin supplementation has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in some patients, as riboflavin is a precursor of FAD, which is crucial for the proper function of the ETFDH protein (Fu2016Significant; Missaglia2018Characterization). The variability in clinical presentation among patients with the same mutation suggests that environmental factors may also influence the phenotype (Wang2020Clinical).

## Interactions
ETFDH, or electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase, is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It interacts with complex III (CIII) of the electron transport chain, specifically with the subunits UQCRC1 and UQCRC2. This interaction is essential for the efficient transfer of electrons and the reduction of coenzyme Q (Q) to QH2, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency in skeletal muscle (Herrero2024An). The interaction between ETFDH and CIII has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, with a suggested stoichiometry of 1:2 for ETF-CIII complexes (Herrero2024An).

ETFDH also forms part of a metabolon that includes CIII and the Q-biosynthesis regulator COQ2. This complex directs electrons from lipid substrates to the respiratory chain, reducing electron leaks and reactive oxygen species production (Herrero2024An). The interaction with COQ2 is crucial for maintaining coenzyme Q homeostasis and preventing reductive stress (Herrero2024An). Inhibitors of CIII, such as Ant A and myxothiazol, have been shown to inhibit ETFDH activity, indicating a direct interaction between ETFDH and CIII (Herrero2024An).
