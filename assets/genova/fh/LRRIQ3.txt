# LRRIQ3

## Overview
The LRRIQ3 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeats and IQ motif containing 3, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeats and an IQ motif. These structural features suggest that the protein is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially playing a role in signal transduction and cellular communication. While the precise biological functions of LRRIQ3 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes and reproductive health, with expression noted in the pituitary gland and testicles (Kałużna2021Defects). The gene has been associated with various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders, Kallmann Syndrome, and Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism, as well as psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression (Levey2020Reproducible; Cardoso2019Essential). Additionally, LRRIQ3 may play a role in epigenetic regulation, influenced by environmental factors like diet, which can affect growth, development, and male fertility (Braz2023Characterization).

## Function
The LRRIQ3 gene encodes a protein that contains leucine-rich repeats and an IQ motif, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains suggest a role in signal transduction and cellular communication. Although the specific functions of LRRIQ3 in healthy human cells are not well-characterized, proteins with similar domains are generally implicated in processes like cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization.

LRRIQ3 has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and delayed puberty, indicating its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental processes and reproductive health (Kałużna2021Defects). The gene is expressed in the pituitary gland and testicles, suggesting a role in the development of the reproductive system and possibly in the regulation of hormonal pathways (Kałużna2021Defects). Additionally, LRRIQ3 is involved in growth traits and is affected by paternal nutrition, which can influence growth and development, male fertility, and cardiac disorders (Braz2023Characterization).

The gene's expression and function may be influenced by environmental factors, such as diet, which can affect DNA methylation patterns and subsequently alter gene expression across generations (Braz2023Characterization). This highlights the gene's potential role in epigenetic regulation and its impact on various biological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRRIQ3 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Whole exome sequencing studies have identified LRRIQ3 as a candidate gene in consanguineous families with NDDs, where patients were homozygous for truncating mutations (Cardoso2019Essential). These findings suggest a potential role for LRRIQ3 in the etiology of NDDs, although specific conditions directly associated with these mutations have not been detailed.

In the context of Kallmann Syndrome (KS) and Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (IHH), LRRIQ3 has been identified as a candidate gene. A splice-site mutation in LRRIQ3 was found in a patient with a severe reproductive phenotype and hyposmia, indicating its possible involvement in these conditions. The gene's expression in the pituitary gland and testicles suggests a role in reproductive development, and mutations may impact the development of KS/IHH (Kałużna2021Defects).

Additionally, genetic studies have linked variants near the LRRIQ3 gene to anxiety and depressive disorders. A genome-wide association study identified a significant SNP near LRRIQ3, suggesting a shared genetic risk factor for anxiety and depression (Levey2020Reproducible). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in psychiatric conditions.
