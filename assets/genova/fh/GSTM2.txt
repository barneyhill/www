# GSTM2

## Overview
GSTM2, or glutathione S-transferase mu 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, specifically within the mu class. The protein product of GSTM2 is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular detoxification processes by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, thereby neutralizing toxins and carcinogens. This enzymatic activity is crucial for protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bhattacharjee2013Functional). GSTM2 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds, which is essential for minimizing oxidative stress (Alexander2013Effect). Additionally, GSTM2 has been identified as a cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase in the human brain, contributing to physiological functions such as temperature regulation and sleep-wake cycles (Beuckmann2000IdentificationofmuclassglutathionetransferasesM22andM33ascytosolicprostaglandinEsynthasesinthehumanbrain). The protein also interacts with ryanodine receptors in muscle cells, influencing muscle contraction and relaxation (Board2013Glutathione). Alterations in GSTM2 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Tang2013Glutathione; Zhang2022Integrated).

## Structure
The GSTM2 protein is a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, characterized by its dimeric structure, with each monomer comprising an amino-terminal R-β domain and a larger carboxy-terminal R-helical domain (McCallum2000LigandInduced). The primary structure of GSTM2 includes specific amino acid sequences that define its function within the mu class of GSTs. The secondary structure is rich in α-helices, with the crystal structure of GSTM1-1, a homologous protein, showing about 49% α-helices (Hornby2000Equilibrium). 

The tertiary structure of GSTM2 involves the folding of these elements into a functional 3D shape, forming a characteristic GST fold. The C-terminal domain, particularly helix 6, is crucial for its function in inhibiting cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) (Hewawasam2010The). This domain is stabilized by ionic and hydrophobic interactions, with helix 6 forming the hydrophobic core (Hewawasam2010The). 

GSTM2's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for forming functional catalytic sites and stabilizing tertiary structures (Hornby2000Equilibrium). The dimeric interface is hydrophobic, involving a lock-and-key interaction motif (Hornby2000Equilibrium). Ligand binding induces structural dynamics, particularly affecting the D-helix and the carboxy-terminal Ω-loop, which are involved in substrate binding (McCallum2000LigandInduced).

## Function
GSTM2 (glutathione S-transferase mu 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in detoxification processes within human cells. It catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to various electrophilic compounds, aiding in the neutralization of toxins and carcinogens, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bhattacharjee2013Functional). GSTM2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds by conjugating them with glutathione, which is essential for minimizing oxidative stress (Alexander2013Effect).

In healthy cells, GSTM2 can compensate for the absence of GSTM1, another member of the GST superfamily, by maintaining total plasma GST enzymatic activity. This compensation is achieved through the overexpression of GSTM2, which shares high structural homology and substrate specificity with GSTM1 (Bhattacharjee2013Functional). GSTM2 also plays a role in modulating the activity of ryanodine receptors in muscle cells, which is important for muscle contraction and relaxation (Board2013Glutathione).

Additionally, GSTM2-2, a specific isoform, functions as a cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase in the human brain, converting PGH2 to PGE2, which is involved in physiological functions such as temperature regulation and sleep-wake cycles (Beuckmann2000IdentificationofmuclassglutathionetransferasesM22andM33ascytosolicprostaglandinEsynthasesinthehumanbrain).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GSTM2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. In NSCLC, low expression of GSTM2 is often due to hypermethylation of its promoter, which is associated with shorter survival and increased cancer cell migration and metastasis (Tang2013Glutathione). In colon cancer, reduced GSTM2 expression is linked to poorer patient survival rates and is associated with immune-related pathways, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (Zhang2022Integrated). 

In prostate cancer, GSTM2 is identified as a key factor in resistance to second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors, with its overexpression contributing to drug resistance by helping cells resist oxidative stress (Li2022GSTM2). In ovarian cancer, GSTM2 is associated with venous invasion and cancer progression, and its expression is linked to chemotherapy resistance (Zhang2022Comprehensive). 

The gene's involvement in detoxification and oxidative stress response is crucial, and its altered expression or mutations can impact cancer susceptibility and progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
GSTM2, a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are crucial for calcium release in muscle cells. GSTM2-2, a specific isoform, interacts with both RyR1 and RyR2 channels. In skeletal muscle, GSTM2-2 activates RyR1 channels with low activity and inhibits those with high activity, a process known as activation-dependent inactivation (Board2013Glutathione). In cardiac muscle, GSTM2-2 inhibits RyR2 activity, which helps in calcium accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and reduces cytoplasmic calcium during diastole (Dulhunty2011Regulation).

The interaction between GSTM2-2 and RyR2 is facilitated by the C-terminal domain of GSTM2, which binds to the divergent region 3 (DR3) of RyR2. This binding is specific to RyR2 and does not occur with RyR1, explaining the differential effects on these isoforms (Dulhunty2011Regulation). Chemical cross-linking experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between GSTM2-2 and RyR2 (Dulhunty2011Regulation). These interactions suggest potential therapeutic applications for GSTM2-C or its mimetics in treating heart conditions associated with 'leaky' RyR2 channels (Board2013Glutathione).
