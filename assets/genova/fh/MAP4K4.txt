# MAP4K4

## Overview
MAP4K4, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the Ste20 protein kinase family. This kinase, part of the mammalian GCK-IV subfamily, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the Hippo signaling pathway and insulin signaling. The protein encoded by MAP4K4 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, gene expression, and glucose metabolism, impacting processes such as cell proliferation and insulin resistance (Meng2015MAP4K; Gao2016MAP4K4:). MAP4K4's interactions with other proteins, such as LATS1/2 and components of the STRIPAK complex, underscore its significance in cellular signaling networks (Kim2020STRIPAK). Clinically, MAP4K4 is associated with various diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and metabolic diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sartorius2012Association; GonzálezMontero2023MAP4K4).

## Structure
MAP4K4, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4, is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the Ste20 protein kinase family. It is part of the mammalian GCK-IV subfamily and contains approximately 1,200 amino acids, with a molecular mass of around 140 kDa (Gao2016MAP4K4:; GonzálezMontero2023MAP4K4). The protein structure includes several key domains: an N-terminal kinase domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal hydrophobic leucine-rich citron homology domain (CNH) (Singh2023Molecular; Alberici2023MAP4K4). The CNH domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, such as with MEKK1 and β1-integrin receptors (Singh2023Molecular).

MAP4K4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in five functional isoforms that share the kinase and CNH domains but differ in their inter-domain regions (Singh2023Molecular). These isoforms have identical kinase domains at the N-terminus, with variations mainly affecting the intermediate regions (Gao2016MAP4K4:). The long version of MAP4K4, cloned from tumor cells, contains proline-rich regions, unlike the short version (Gao2016MAP4K4:).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are essential for MAP4K4's activation and function. Specific phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal kinase domain, including lysine 54 and threonine 181, are critical for regulating its activity (Gao2016MAP4K4:). These structural features and modifications play significant roles in MAP4K4's interactions and functions within various cellular processes.

## Function
MAP4K4 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly within the Hippo signaling pathway. It functions by phosphorylating LATS1/2 kinases, which subsequently phosphorylate YAP, a transcription co-activator. This phosphorylation event is crucial for regulating cell growth and gene expression, as it reduces YAP's interaction with TEAD transcription factors, thereby decreasing the transcription of YAP target genes such as CTGF and CYR61 (Meng2015MAP4K). MAP4K4 acts in parallel to MST1/2 kinases to activate LATS1/2, highlighting its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and controlling cell proliferation (Meng2015MAP4K).

In addition to its role in the Hippo pathway, MAP4K4 is involved in insulin signaling pathways. It negatively regulates insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes by suppressing the expression of adipogenic transcription factors and the glucose transporter GLUT4 (Tang2006An). In skeletal muscle cells, MAP4K4 is implicated in mediating insulin resistance induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), as its silencing prevents TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of key signaling proteins, thereby restoring insulin sensitivity (Bouzakri2007MAP4K4). These functions underscore MAP4K4's role in modulating cellular responses to various signals, impacting processes like cell proliferation, glucose metabolism, and insulin resistance.

## Clinical Significance
MAP4K4 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and inflammation. In cancer, MAP4K4 is overexpressed in several types, including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its elevated expression in lung adenocarcinoma is independent of KRAS or EGFR mutations and is crucial for cancer cell functions like proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of MAP4K4 reduces tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gao2017MAP4K4; GonzálezMontero2023MAP4K4).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, de novo frameshift variants in MAP4K4 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These variants affect splicing activity and stability of MAP4K4 mRNA, contributing to neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Cesana2022Integrated).

MAP4K4 is also linked to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAP4K4 locus are associated with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and elevated plasma cytokines, suggesting a role in insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction (Sartorius2012Association).

## Interactions
MAP4K4 is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It directly interacts with LATS1 and LATS2, playing a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway by phosphorylating these proteins, which in turn induces YAP phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for regulating YAP activity and its downstream effects (Meng2015MAP4K).

MAP4K4 is also associated with the STRIPAK complex, which includes components like STRN3 and STRN4. This association is important for the dephosphorylation process mediated by PP2A, affecting MAP4K4's role in oncogenic transformation. The interaction with STRIPAK components modulates MAP4K4 phosphorylation, impacting its kinase activity and promoting cell transformation (Kim2020STRIPAK).

In the context of pancreatic tumorigenesis, MAP4K4 interacts with MLK3, regulating the TNFα-induced JNK activation pathway. MAP4K4 phosphorylates MLK3, enhancing its kinase activity and downstream signaling, which is crucial for oncogenic processes in pancreatic cancer cells (Singh2021MAP4K4).

MAP4K4 also interacts with FARP1, a protein involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, by directly phosphorylating it. This interaction affects cellular processes such as migration and neurite outgrowth (Schwaid2015MAP4K4).
