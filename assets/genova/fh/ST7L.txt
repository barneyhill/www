# ST7L

## Overview
The ST7L gene encodes the protein known as suppression of tumorigenicity 7 like, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to tumor suppression. This protein is characterized by a leucine zipper domain and is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, such as the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b; Yan2018Long). ST7L functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with the AKT protein, inhibiting its phosphorylation and subsequent activation, thereby modulating cell growth and proliferation (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b). The gene's expression and activity are influenced by various microRNAs, which can downregulate ST7L and contribute to cancer progression (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b; Yan2018Long). Understanding the role of ST7L in these pathways provides insights into its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Function
The ST7L gene encodes a polypeptide consisting of 575 amino acids and is located on human chromosome 1p13. It is homologous to the tumor-suppressor gene ST7 and contains a unique leucine zipper domain (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b). In healthy human cells, ST7L is believed to play a role in regulating AKT activity and maintaining normal cellular signaling pathways, potentially preventing uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b). 

ST7L interacts with the C-terminal region of the AKT protein, leading to decreased AKT phosphorylation and inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction suggests that ST7L is involved in regulating cellular processes that are often dysregulated in cancer (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b). Although the specific function of ST7L in healthy cells is not extensively detailed, its role in inhibiting the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway implies a function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Yan2018Long). 

ST7L's activity in various cellular compartments may influence signaling pathways that are crucial for normal cell function, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell growth and proliferation (Li2017miR378).

## Clinical Significance
The ST7L gene is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In breast cancer, ST7L expression is frequently downregulated, which correlates with increased proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. Overexpression of ST7L in breast cancer cells has been shown to suppress these malignant behaviors by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wang2019Suppression).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ST7L is targeted by miR-23b, which acts as an oncogene by promoting tumor growth and metastasis through the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction results in the suppression of ST7L expression, contributing to cancer progression (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b).

In cervical cancer, miR-378 targets ST7L, leading to its downregulation and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which promotes cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis (Li2017miR378).

In pancreatic cancer, miR-331-3p targets ST7L, contributing to drug resistance by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of ST7L can reverse these effects, highlighting its potential role in overcoming drug resistance (Zhan2020MiR3313p).

## Interactions
The ST7L protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in tumor suppression. In breast cancer, ST7L interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of ST7L leads to reduced activation of this pathway, evidenced by decreased levels of active β-catenin and reduced TCF/LEF transcriptional activity (Wang2019Suppression). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ST7L interacts with the AKT protein, specifically binding to its C-terminal region. This interaction inhibits AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308, which are critical for AKT activation, thereby suppressing the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b).

ST7L is also targeted by microRNAs, such as miR-23b and miR-575, which downregulate its expression. In HCC, miR-23b targets ST7L, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by activating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway (Zhuang2017MicroRNA23b). Similarly, miR-575 directly targets the 3'UTR of ST7L, repressing its expression and contributing to tumorigenesis (Yan2018Long). These interactions highlight ST7L's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
