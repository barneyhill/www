# AK8

## Overview
Adenylate kinase 8 (AK8) is a gene located on chromosome 9 (9q34) that encodes the cytosolic enzyme adenylate kinase 8, which plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis. The enzyme is involved in the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between ATP and AMP, thereby maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides within the cell. Structurally, the AK8 protein is characterized by a two-domain configuration, similar to that of adenylate kinase 5 (AK5), and consists of 479 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 53 kDa. Each domain of the protein retains enzymatic activity, suggesting functional redundancy within the protein structure. AK8 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, pancreas, lung, trachea, and testis, and is known to phosphorylate AMP, CMP, dAMP, and dCMP using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors. The enzyme's activity is significant in nucleotide metabolism and has been implicated in the negative regulation of epithelial cell migration, which may influence cellular processes such as growth and differentiation (Panayiotou2011The; Panayiotou2014The).

## Structure
The human adenylate kinase 8 (AK8) protein is characterized by a two-domain structure, similar to AK5, but it exists as a single transcript variant (Panayiotou2011The; Panayiotou2014The). The full-length AK8 protein consists of 479 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 53 kDa (Panayiotou2011The). The primary structure includes two p-loops, which are glycine-rich regions involved in phosphate binding (Panayiotou2011The; Panayiotou2014The).

The secondary structure of AK8 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of adenylate kinases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional conformation, allowing the protein to exhibit adenylate kinase activity. Both domains of AK8, when expressed separately, retain similar enzymatic activity, indicating that each domain is functionally active (Panayiotou2011The; Panayiotou2014The).

AK8 is a cytosolic enzyme, and its subcellular localization has been confirmed through in vivo studies (Panayiotou2011The). The protein is involved in phosphorylating AMP, CMP, dAMP, and dCMP using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors (Panayiotou2011The; Panayiotou2014The). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Adenylate kinase 8 (AK8) is a cytosolic enzyme involved in cellular energy homeostasis by catalyzing the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between ATP and AMP, thus maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides. AK8 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, pancreas, lung, trachea, and testis, and is located on chromosome 9 (9q34) (Panayiotou2014The). Structurally, AK8 has a two-domain configuration similar to AK5, with both domains exhibiting similar adenylate kinase activity when expressed separately, suggesting that the full-length protein may have two functionally active domains (Panayiotou2011The).

AK8 uses ATP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate AMP, dAMP, CMP, and dCMP, and GTP to phosphorylate AMP, CMP, and dCMP, indicating a specific substrate affinity and functional role in nucleotide metabolism (Panayiotou2011The). It is identified as having a negative regulatory role in epithelial cell migration, which may be significant in cellular processes such as growth and differentiation (Panayiotou2014The). AK8's high phosphorylation efficiency suggests its potential functional significance in maintaining ATP homeostasis and adenosine nucleotide balance in different cellular microenvironments (Panayiotou2011The).
