# ABCA6

## Overview
ABCA6 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 6 (ABCA6) protein, which is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This family is known for its role in the translocation of various substrates across cellular membranes, utilizing ATP hydrolysis as an energy source. ABCA6 is categorized as a full-size transporter and is primarily involved in lipid transport and homeostasis, with a significant presence in tissues such as the liver, lung, heart, brain, and ovaries (Albrecht2006The; Kaminski2001ABCA6). The protein is characterized by its two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, which are essential for its function in lipid trafficking and cholesterol metabolism (Kaminski2006ABC; Kaminski2001ABCA6). Although the precise physiological roles of ABCA6 are not fully understood, it is implicated in maintaining lipid balance within cells and may have species-specific functions in cholesterol regulation (He2021Hypercholesterolemia; van2015Genome).

## Structure
The ABCA6 protein is a full-size ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, consisting of 1617 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa (Albrecht2006The; Kaminski2001ABCA6). It is characterized by two transmembrane domains, each typically composed of six membrane-spanning segments, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) with conserved Walker A and B motifs (Kaminski2006ABC; Kaminski2001ABCA6). The N-terminal nucleotide-binding fold contains a bona fide signature sequence, while the C-terminal does not (Kaminski2001ABCA6).

ABCA6 has an alternative splicing variant, ABCA6Δ-139, resulting from exon 14 skipping. This variant encodes a truncated protein of 637 amino acids, lacking the Walker B motif, and is considered a half-size transporter (Albrecht2006The; Kaminski2001ABCA6). The biological function of this truncated variant remains unclear.

The protein is primarily localized in intracellular compartments, likely the Golgi apparatus, and its expression is regulated by cholesterol levels and FoxO transcription factors (Gai2013FoxO). The potential involvement of ABCA6 in lipid transport and drug transport processes is suggested by its expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms (Albrecht2006The; Kaminski2006ABC).

## Function
The ABCA6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically the ABC1 subfamily, which is unique to multicellular eukaryotes. This protein is involved in the translocation of various substrates, primarily lipids, across cellular membranes using ATP hydrolysis (Breuss2020The; van2015Genome). ABCA6 is characterized as a full-size transporter with 1,617 amino acids and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with high expression levels in the liver, lung, heart, brain, and ovaries (Albrecht2006The; Kaminski2001ABCA6).

In healthy human cells, ABCA6 is implicated in lipid transport and homeostasis, playing a role in macrophage lipid trafficking and cholesterol metabolism (He2021Hypercholesterolemia; Kaminski2001ABCA6). The protein is located on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, suggesting its involvement in mediating substrate trafficking between cells and blood circulation (He2021Hypercholesterolemia). Although the exact physiological functions of ABCA6 remain to be fully elucidated, it is thought to contribute to maintaining lipid balance within cells, impacting processes like cholesterol metabolism (van2015Genome; Kaminski2001ABCA6). Despite its association with cholesterol levels, studies indicate that ABCA6 does not regulate lipoprotein metabolism in mice or hamsters, suggesting species-specific roles (He2021Hypercholesterolemia).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCA6 gene, part of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, has been studied for its potential role in hypercholesterolemia, a condition characterized by high cholesterol levels in the blood. A specific missense variant, rs77542162, in the ABCA6 gene is associated with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol in humans. This variant results in a change from Cysteine to Arginine at position 1359 in the ABCA6 protein, leading to decreased protein stability and a shorter half-life (He2021Hypercholesterolemia). Despite this association, studies in animal models, such as mice and hamsters, have not shown a significant impact of ABCA6 on lipoprotein metabolism, suggesting that its role in cholesterol regulation may be limited or context-dependent (He2021Hypercholesterolemia).

The ABCA6 gene is also part of a cluster of genes on chromosome 17q24, which includes other cholesterol-responsive genes like ABCA5, ABCA8, ABCA9, and ABCA10. These genes are implicated in cholesterol metabolism, but the specific pathological or physiological functions of ABCA6 in lipid metabolism remain unclear (He2021Hypercholesterolemia; Albrecht2006The). While ABCA6 is up-regulated during macrophage differentiation and responsive to cholesterol concentrations, its direct involvement in specific diseases or conditions has not been conclusively established (Albrecht2006The).
