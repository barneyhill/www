# MTMR14

## Overview
MTMR14 is a gene that encodes the myotubularin-related protein 14, a phosphoinositide phosphatase involved in critical cellular processes such as autophagy and calcium homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a phosphatase due to its role in dephosphorylating specific phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), which are essential for autophagosome dynamics (Dowling2010Zebrafish; Hnia2012Myotubularin). MTMR14 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining muscle function by regulating calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus influencing excitation-contraction coupling (Dowling2010Zebrafish; Hnia2012Myotubularin). Mutations in the MTMR14 gene are linked to centronuclear myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle-related pathologies (Amoasii2012Myotubularin). Through its interactions with key signaling pathways, MTMR14 contributes to cellular homeostasis and has implications in various physiological and pathological contexts (Pan2020MTMR14; Li2020MTMR14).

## Function
MTMR14, also known as myotubularin-related protein 14, is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy, a cellular process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It specifically dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), which are important for autophagosome formation and maturation (Dowling2010Zebrafish; Hnia2012Myotubularin). MTMR14 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy by reducing the levels of these phosphoinositides, thereby controlling the progression of autophagy (Dowling2010Zebrafish; Hnia2012Myotubularin).

In muscle cells, MTMR14 is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is critical for normal muscle function and excitation-contraction coupling. It influences the activity of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1), and its deficiency can lead to calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in muscle dysfunction (Dowling2010Zebrafish; Hnia2012Myotubularin). MTMR14 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and is localized to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its involvement in membrane trafficking and cellular signaling pathways (Dowling2010Zebrafish). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining muscle performance and preventing muscle-related pathologies (Zhang2020Myotubularinrelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTMR14 gene are associated with centronuclear myopathy (CNM), a condition characterized by muscle weakness and structural abnormalities in muscle fibers. Specific mutations, such as p.Arg336Glu and p.Tyr462Cys, have been identified in patients with early-onset CNM, leading to impaired enzymatic activity of MTMR14 (Amoasii2012Myotubularin). These mutations can result in defective excitation-contraction coupling and increased autophagy, contributing to muscle dysfunction (Dowling2010Zebrafish).

MTMR14 deficiency also affects calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for muscle function. In Mtmr14 knockout mice, chronic calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is observed, leading to impaired skeletal muscle function and increased fatigue (Hnia2012Myotubularin). This disruption in calcium signaling is linked to the activation of the ryanodine receptor by excess phosphoinositides (Amoasii2012Myotubularin).

Alterations in MTMR14 expression or function can exacerbate muscle-related conditions, potentially modifying the severity of diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and centronuclear myopathy (Dowling2010Zebrafish). The gene's role in regulating autophagy and calcium homeostasis suggests that its dysfunction can contribute to muscle pathologies and age-related muscle decline (Hnia2012Primary).

## Interactions
MTMR14, also known as myotubularin-related protein 14, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the AKT signaling pathway. MTMR14 physically interacts with AKT, a key protein in the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is important for cell survival and inflammation regulation. This interaction helps modulate the pathway's activity, contributing to the protective effects of MTMR14 against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing cell death and inflammation (Li2020MTMR14).

MTMR14 also interacts with PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, where MTMR14 modulates autophagy by interacting with PTEN, thereby offering neuroprotection (Pan2020MTMR14).

In cardiac tissues, MTMR14 interacts with the PI3K pathway, which is activated by G protein-coupled receptors. This interaction is involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy, where MTMR14 inhibits the Akt signaling pathway, thereby suppressing cardiac hypertrophy (Zhang2020Myotubularinrelated; Wang2024Recent). These interactions highlight MTMR14's role in various signaling pathways, impacting cellular homeostasis and function.
