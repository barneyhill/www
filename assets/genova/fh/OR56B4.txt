# OR56B4

## Overview
OR56B4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 56 subfamily B member 4, which is part of the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which enables them to interact with a variety of ligands and initiate signal transduction pathways. The protein encoded by OR56B4 is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants in the olfactory epithelium (Geithe2015A). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR56B4 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including immune cells such as neutrophils, T cells, and B cells, suggesting a potential role in immune responses (Malki2015Class). The receptor's activation by compounds like δ-decalactone further indicates its involvement in chemotaxis and immune cell signaling (Geithe2015A; Di2019Beyond). Despite its physiological importance, detailed structural and functional insights into OR56B4 remain limited, necessitating further research to fully understand its roles in both olfactory and non-olfactory contexts.

## Structure
OR56B4 is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, allowing them to span the cell membrane and interact with various ligands. The primary structure of OR56B4 consists of amino acid sequences that form the protein, while the secondary structure includes alpha helices that traverse the cell membrane. These helices fold into a functional receptor, representing the tertiary structure. 

Although specific details about the quaternary structure of OR56B4 are not provided, olfactory receptors often function as monomers, suggesting that OR56B4 may not form multimeric complexes. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs and may influence the function and localization of OR56B4, although specific modifications for this receptor are not detailed in the available literature. 

The receptor is activated by compounds such as δ-decalactone, which induces chemotaxis in human neutrophils, indicating its role in immune responses (Geithe2015A; Di2019Beyond). Despite its physiological significance, detailed structural information, including specific domains or prominent folds, is not extensively covered in the current literature.

## Function
OR56B4 is a human gene encoding an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR56B4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the sense of smell (Geithe2015A).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR56B4 is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including human blood leukocytes such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), T cells, and B cells. This suggests a potential role in immune cell function, although the specific function of OR56B4 in these cells is not fully understood (Malki2015Class). The coexpression of OR56B4 with taste receptors in immune cells indicates that it may be involved in detecting chemical signals beyond traditional olfactory pathways, possibly contributing to immune responses (Malki2015Class).

The expression of OR56B4 in various cell types highlights its potential involvement in broader physiological processes, although further research is needed to elucidate its specific functions in healthy human cells (Malki2015Class).
