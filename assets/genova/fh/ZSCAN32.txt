# ZSCAN32

## Overview
ZSCAN32 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 32, which is part of the zinc finger protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The ZSCAN32 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and apoptosis, through its specific interaction with the Toxoplasma gondii virulence factor ROP18II (Xia2018GenomeWide). Additionally, ZSCAN32 has been associated with metabolic conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, where its expression is notably upregulated (Liu2019Key). Although its precise role in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated, ZSCAN32's involvement in disease pathways highlights its potential significance in clinical research (Granata2022Proteomics).

## Interactions
ZSCAN32 is a protein that has been identified to specifically interact with the Toxoplasma gondii virulence factor ROP18II. This interaction was discovered through a genome-wide proteomic analysis aimed at identifying human proteins that interact with Toxoplasma gondii ROP18, a protein known for its role in regulating cell immunity and apoptosis. The study utilized techniques such as SE-FRET and co-immunoprecipitation assays to identify these interactions, categorizing the interacting proteins into ROP18I-specific, ROP18II-specific, and those interacting with both. ZSCAN32 was among the ROP18II-specific targets, indicating a specific interaction with this variant of the ROP18 protein (Xia2018GenomeWide).

In addition to its interaction with ROP18II, ZSCAN32 has been noted in studies related to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), where it is upregulated. However, these studies do not provide specific information about its protein interactions in the context of T2DM, focusing instead on its gene expression levels (Liu2019Key). The role of ZSCAN32 in other conditions, such as Medullary Sponge Kidney disease, has been mentioned, but specific interactions were not detailed (Granata2022Proteomics).
