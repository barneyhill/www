# CRH

## Overview
The CRH gene encodes corticotropin-releasing hormone, a pivotal neuropeptide involved in the stress response by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This hormone is primarily synthesized in the hypothalamus and plays a crucial role in stimulating the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Corticotropin-releasing hormone is categorized as a cytokine and growth factor, influencing various physiological processes, including immune responses, skin cell proliferation, and intestinal permeability (Wallon2007Corticotropinreleasing; Slominski2005CRHa). The CRH gene's expression is modulated by several factors, including cAMP and glucocorticoids, and is subject to regulation by transcription factors such as AP-2α (Cheng2002AP2α). Dysregulation of CRH and its signaling pathways has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including stress-related disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain neurological disorders (Giannogonas2016Identification; Combi2005Frontal).

## Function
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) functions as a growth factor and cytokine in various human skin cells, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation in a context-dependent manner. In dermal fibroblasts, CRH stimulates proliferation through the IP3 signaling pathway, particularly under growth factor-deficient conditions (Slominski2005CRHa). Conversely, in epidermal keratinocytes, CRH inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation, likely through coupling with IP3 and Ca2+ signaling pathways (Slominski2005CRHa). In melanocytes, CRH acts as a survival factor under stress by preventing apoptosis, while inhibiting proliferation in the presence of growth factors (Slominski2005CRHa).

CRH also plays a role in regulating macromolecular permeability in the human colon. It increases permeability to certain macromolecules through its action on mast cells, mediated by CRH receptor subtypes R1 and R2 (Wallon2007Corticotropinreleasing). This function is significant in stress-related changes in intestinal permeability, potentially contributing to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (Wallon2007Corticotropinreleasing).

In the placenta, CRH gene expression is regulated by cAMP and glucocorticoids, with involvement of various kinases and transcription factors, influencing processes such as myometrial contractility and immune responses during pregnancy (King2001The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A novel insertion variant, Gln52insPro, in the CRH gene has been associated with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), a vision-threatening eye disease. This variant was found to decrease CRH gene expression, suggesting a link between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress response system and CSC pathogenesis. The Gln52insPro variant was strongly associated with CSC in a large cohort study, indicating a potential genetic predisposition to the disease (Jin2022An).

In the context of neurological disorders, mutations in the CRH gene have been linked to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). Specific mutations in the CRH promoter region, such as g.−1470C͘A and g.−1166G͘C, have been shown to alter CRH expression levels, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of ADNFLE by increasing neuronal excitability and affecting sleep patterns (Combi2005Frontal). Another mutation, p.Pro30Arg, affects CRH protein processing and secretion, which may impair the stress response and contribute to the pathophysiology of ADNFLE (Sansoni2013Functional). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CRH gene mutations in various conditions.

## Interactions
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various physiological processes. CRH primarily binds to its receptors, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in signal transduction. These interactions are crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway (Hillhouse2006The; Subbannayya2013An).

CRH also interacts with the CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP), which modulates its activity by binding a significant portion of CRH, thereby acting as a negative regulator and blocking CRH-mediated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion (Hillhouse2006The).

In the context of the placenta, CRH gene expression is modulated by the transcription factor AP-2α, which does not directly bind to the CRH promoter. Instead, AP-2α interacts with the CREB protein, which binds to a cAMP response element (CRE) on the CRH promoter. This protein-protein interaction is crucial for the regulation of CRH gene expression during trophoblast differentiation (Cheng2002AP2α).

CRH also influences macroautophagy, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It acts as a brake on sustained autophagy activation, which is crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis (Giannogonas2016Identification).
