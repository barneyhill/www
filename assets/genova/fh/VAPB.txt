# VAPB

## Overview
The VAPB gene encodes the VAMP-associated protein B and C, which is a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including intracellular membrane trafficking, calcium homeostasis, and the unfolded protein response (UPR). VAPB's structure is characterized by a major sperm protein (MSP) domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a transmembrane domain, which contribute to its ability to form homodimers and heterodimers. Mutations in the VAPB gene, such as the P56S mutation, are linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Type 8 (ALS8) and late-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), highlighting its clinical significance (Landers2008New; Kanekura2006Characterization). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as those involved in ER-Golgi transport and calcium exchange, underscore its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper physiological functions (De2011VAPB; Kuijpers2013The).

## Structure
The VAPB protein is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes a major sperm protein (MSP) domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a transmembrane domain. The protein forms an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel consisting of two Greek-key motifs, which is a unique topology distinct from other known β-barrels such as those in avidins and bacterial outer membrane proteins (Geerds2014Structure). This β-barrel structure is highly conserved and resistant to protease degradation, indicating its stability and functional importance (Geerds2014Structure).

The VAPB protein can form homodimers and heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure. The P56S mutation, linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affects the protein's solubility and localization, leading to misfolding and aggregation (Kanekura2006Characterization). This mutation does not prevent VAPB from interacting with other synaptic proteins but alters its solubility and subcellular localization (Kanekura2006Characterization).

VAPB is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and mutations at the 56th proline, such as P56S, inhibit this function (Kanekura2006Characterization). The protein's role in UPR is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions.

## Function
The VAPB gene encodes a protein that is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. VAPB is involved in intracellular membrane delivery, particularly in the early secretory pathway, which is essential for neuronal development and function. It interacts with the ER-Golgi recycling protein YIF1A, regulating membrane transport to dendrites and maintaining normal dendritic growth and morphology (Kuijpers2013The). VAPB also modulates the activity of the ER-localized transcription factor ATF6, influencing the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response related to the ER (Gkogkas2008VAPB).

In addition to its role in membrane trafficking, VAPB is involved in calcium homeostasis by interacting with the mitochondrial protein PTPIP51. This interaction is crucial for calcium exchange between the ER and mitochondria, which is essential for various cellular functions (De2011VAPB). VAPB also plays a role in modulating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which are important for cardiac and neuronal pacemaker functions. It enhances the surface expression and dendritic localization of HCN2 channels, thereby influencing pacemaker currents (Silbernagel2018The). These functions highlight VAPB's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VAPB gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Type 8 (ALS8) and late-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The P56S mutation, a proline to serine substitution at codon 56, is the most well-documented mutation associated with ALS8. This mutation leads to a dominantly inherited form of ALS characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype, including typical ALS, atypical ALS, and late-onset SMA. Symptoms include progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, cramps, tremors, and cognitive impairments, with an onset age ranging from 20 to 57 years (Landers2008New; Kors2022VAP).

The P56S mutation causes significant cytosolic aggregation of the mutant protein, disrupting its normal localization and function, which affects the unfolded protein response and contributes to motor neuron degeneration (Aliaga2013Amyotrophic; Landers2008New). Other mutations, such as P56H, T46I, A145V, and V234I, have also been identified and are associated with similar clinical features (Sanhueza2013Gainoffunction; Kors2022VAP).

Research suggests that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of VAPB-related diseases, with alterations in VAPB expression levels affecting neuronal health and function (Sanhueza2013Gainoffunction; Genevini2019VAPB).

## Interactions
VAPB (VAMP-associated protein B) is an integral membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in various protein interactions. It forms multiprotein complexes by interacting with proteins carrying FFAT motifs, such as oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs) and OSBP-related proteins (ORPs), which are involved in lipid transfer between organelles at ER-trans Golgi contact sites (James2021The). VAPB also interacts with proteins involved in ER-peroxisome interactions, calcium homeostasis, and ceramide transfer, including ACBD4, ACBD5, PTPIP51, and CERT (James2021The).

VAPB interacts with FFAT-like proteins, including the p97 cofactor FAF1 and the ASNA1 ATPase, linking it to ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathways and the TRC complex involved in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane (Baron2014VAPBALS8). The interaction with FAF1 is mediated through a non-canonical FFAT motif, and VAPB is shown to interact with ubiquitinated proteins in a FAF1-dependent manner (Baron2014VAPBALS8).

VAPB also interacts with YIF1A, a component of the early secretory pathway, influencing its distribution and playing a role in ER-to-Golgi transport, which is crucial for dendritic growth and morphology (Kuijpers2013The). These interactions highlight VAPB's role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Baron2014VAPBALS8).
