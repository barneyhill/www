# FDX2

## Overview
FDX2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein ferredoxin 2, which is integral to the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. These clusters are essential cofactors for numerous cellular enzymes involved in electron transfer processes. Ferredoxin 2 is categorized as a mitochondrial ferredoxin and plays a pivotal role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly in complexes I, II, and III, which are crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The protein's function is vital for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and redox homeostasis. Mutations in the FDX2 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, affecting muscle and neurological functions, highlighting its clinical significance (Spiegel2013Deleterious; Camponeschi2022Molecular).

## Structure
Ferredoxin 2 (FDX2) is a mitochondrial protein involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. The primary structure of FDX2 includes a sequence of amino acids that facilitate its role in electron transfer. The secondary structure of FDX2 is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices, particularly around helix F, which contains negatively charged residues that interact with arginine residues on NFS1 (Steinhilper2024Structural). 

The tertiary structure of FDX2 involves its overall 3D conformation, which is crucial for its binding to the core iron-sulfur cluster assembly complex. This structure allows FDX2 to adopt two conformations, 'proximal' and 'distal', which are related by a rotational motion around helix F. These conformations are essential for the efficient electron transfer necessary for Fe-S cluster assembly (Steinhilper2024Structural).

FDX2's quaternary structure involves its interaction with other proteins in the ISC complex, such as ISCU2 and NFS1, forming a functional assembly for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. The protein's C-terminal residues play a significant role in target specificity and binding dynamics within the complex (Steinhilper2024Structural). FDX2 is ubiquitously expressed, and its interaction with the ISC complex is essential for understanding Fe-S cluster formation and related diseases (Steinhilper2024Structural).

## Function
FDX2, also known as ferredoxin 2, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential cofactors for various cellular enzymes. These clusters are composed of iron and sulfur atoms and are crucial for electron transfer processes within the cell. FDX2 is one of the two mammalian 2Fe-2S ferredoxins involved in this biogenesis, contributing significantly to the proper functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, and III, which are vital for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Spiegel2013Deleterious).

In healthy human cells, FDX2 is active in the mitochondria, where it supports the enzymatic function of both cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase, as well as the biosynthesis of heme. Disruption of FDX2 can lead to decreased activity of mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) and aconitases, impairing cellular energy metabolism and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Spiegel2013Deleterious). The protein's role in maintaining the activity of Fe-S-dependent complexes underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and redox homeostasis, impacting overall cellular function and organismal health (Spiegel2013Deleterious).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FDX2 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting muscle and neurological function. A notable condition linked to FDX2 mutations is mitochondrial myopathy, characterized by symptoms such as proximal muscle weakness, recurrent myoglobinuria, and lactic acidosis. These symptoms are due to deficiencies in respiratory chain complexes I, II, and III, which are crucial for energy production in cells (Spiegel2013Deleterious). 

The FDX2 gene is also implicated in a condition known as Episodic mitochondrial myopathy with or without optic atrophy and reversible leukoencephalopathy (MEOAL). This condition is marked by episodic muscle weakness and may include optic atrophy and reversible leukoencephalopathy, highlighting the gene's role in neurological health (Camponeschi2022Molecular). 

Alterations in FDX2 expression or its interactions can disrupt iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress. This disruption can contribute to the pathogenesis of various neuromuscular disorders, underscoring the clinical significance of maintaining proper FDX2 function (Camponeschi2022Molecular).

## Interactions
FDX2, a mitochondrial ferredoxin, plays a crucial role in electron transfer processes, particularly in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. It interacts with the core iron-sulfur cluster assembly complex, which includes proteins such as ISCU2 and the NFS1-ISD11-ACP1 subcomplex. FDX2 binds to NFS1 through a conserved arginine patch, forming salt bridges with acidic residues on FDX2 helix F. This interaction is essential for the stabilization of FDX2's C terminus and the positioning of its [2Fe-2S] cluster for efficient electron transfer to the ISCU2 FeS cluster assembly site (Steinhilper2024Structural).

FDX2 also competes with frataxin (FXN) for binding sites on NFS1, which may have implications for understanding the effects of FXN expression in conditions like Friedreich's ataxia (Steinhilper2024Structural). In addition to its role in the core ISC complex, FDX2 is involved in the reductive fusion of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters on the ISCA1-ISCA2 complex, a process that requires the presence of IBA57. This interaction is crucial for the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, such as aconitase (Weiler2020Mitochondrial).
