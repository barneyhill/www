# EGR1

## Overview
EGR1 (early growth response 1) is a gene that encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein product of EGR1, also known as early growth response 1, functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator by binding to GC-rich promoter sequences of target genes. It plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of tumor suppressor genes and is implicated in processes such as apoptosis, ribosomal RNA transcription, and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. EGR1 is subject to complex regulation through post-translational modifications and interactions with co-activators and corepressors, which modulate its activity in response to cellular stimuli. Dysregulation of EGR1 expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, myeloid disorders, and neuropsychiatric diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Duclot2017The; Baron2005The; Desterke2021EGR1).

## Structure
EGR1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor encoded by two exons on human chromosome 5. Its primary structure includes several domains: a strong activation domain at the N-terminus (amino acids 1-281), an inhibitory domain (amino acids 281-315), a highly conserved DNA-binding domain with three Cys2-His2 type zinc-fingers (amino acids 338-418), and a weak activation domain at the C-terminus (amino acids 420-543) (Woodson2022Examining). The DNA-binding domain is crucial for its function, allowing EGR1 to bind to GC-rich promoter sequences (Woodson2022Examining).

EGR1 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by casein kinase II and AKT, acetylation by the CBP/p300 complex, sumoylation, and ubiquitination, which influence its transcriptional activity (Woodson2022Examining). A notable splice variant, EGR1 Δ141-278, results from a splicing event that removes part of the N-terminal activation domain, affecting its transcriptional activation capability (Aliperti2019Identification). This isoform retains the ability for nuclear translocation but shows altered stability and activity due to the absence of regulatory elements like the PPxY motif and Lysine 272, which are involved in sumoylation and phosphorylation (Aliperti2019Identification).

## Function
EGR1 (early growth response 1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of multiple tumor suppressor genes, including PTEN, p53, TGFβ1, and fibronectin, which are crucial for maintaining normal cell growth and preventing tumor development (Baron2005The). EGR1 enhances the expression of PTEN, which inhibits the Akt signaling pathway, promoting apoptosis and preventing the survival of unattached cells, a process known as anoikis (Baron2005The).

EGR1 also localizes to the nucleolus, where it is involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. It colocalizes with nucleolar markers and is linked to the suppression of ribosomal precursor synthesis, suggesting a role in regulating ribosome production (Ponti2014The). EGR1's presence in the nucleolus is influenced by serum conditions and is partially dependent on ongoing rRNA transcription (Ponti2014The).

In hematopoietic stem cells, EGR1 is implicated in myeloid lineage differentiation and is involved in regulating the homeostasis of these cells. It contributes to the transcriptional control of monocytic differentiation and is associated with increased quiescence in older HSCs, protecting against myeloid malignancies (Desterke2021EGR1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EGR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, EGR1 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to the progression from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to carcinoma. This overexpression is often accompanied by the downregulation of its corepressor NAB2, leading to increased transcriptional activity of EGR1 target genes such as TGF-β1 and PDGF-A, which are associated with tumor progression and invasiveness (Virolle2003Egr1; Abdulkadir2001Impaired).

In myeloid disorders, EGR1 haploinsufficiency, where a single allele is lost, predisposes individuals to conditions like T-cell lymphoma and myeloproliferative disorders. This suggests that EGR1 acts through haploinsufficiency rather than mutations, with secondary mutations in other genes necessary for disease progression (Joslin2007Haploinsufficiency).

EGR1 also plays a role in skin diseases, with decreased expression observed in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), while it is elevated in psoriasis. This differential expression suggests that EGR1 may help restrain hyperproliferation in epidermal cells, potentially preventing malignant transformation (Fang2007Evidence).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, EGR1 is involved in stress-related mood disorders and schizophrenia. Its expression is upregulated following antidepressant treatments, indicating a potential role in therapeutic responses (Duclot2017The).

## Interactions
EGR1 (early growth response 1) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that interacts with several proteins to regulate gene expression. It binds to GC-rich consensus sequences in the promoter regions of various genes, influencing transcriptional activity. EGR1 interacts with transcriptional co-activators such as cAMP-response-element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300, enhancing gene transcription. These interactions were demonstrated using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase fusion-protein binding, and co-immunoprecipitation/Western-blot studies. The N- and C-terminal domains of CBP interact with the transcriptional activation domain of EGR1, suggesting a mechanism for gene activation through recruitment of CBP/p300 (SILVERMAN1998cAMPresponseelementbindingproteinbinding).

EGR1 also interacts with NAB1 and NAB2, which are corepressors that modulate its transcriptional activity. NAB1 and NAB2 bind to the R1 domain of EGR1, repressing its ability to activate transcription. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by the disruption of NAB2's repression through a point mutation in the EGR1 R1 domain (Svaren1996NAB2; Russo1995Identification). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving EGR1 and its role in cellular responses to external stimuli.
