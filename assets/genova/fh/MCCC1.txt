# MCCC1

## Overview
The MCCC1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the enzyme 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), which is a biotin-dependent carboxylase involved in the catabolism of the essential amino acid leucine. This enzyme plays a critical role in the mitochondrial metabolic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a key step in leucine degradation (L2016Biochemical; Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The MCCC1 protein is characterized by its biotin carboxylase (BC) domain and biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain, which are essential for its enzymatic function and structural integrity (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). Beyond its metabolic role, MCCC1 is also involved in the innate immune response, interacting with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins to enhance antiviral and inflammatory pathways (Cao2016MethylcrotonoylCoA). Mutations in the MCCC1 gene can lead to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, a metabolic disorder with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA; Zhao2020SNPs).

## Structure
The MCCC1 protein is a biotin-containing enzyme involved in leucine catabolism. It is part of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family and contains specific domains crucial for its function. The primary structure of MCCC1 includes a biotin carboxylase (BC) domain and a biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain, which is covalently bound with a biotin prosthetic group (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The BC domain is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity, and mutations within this domain can significantly impact protein function (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

The tertiary structure of MCCC1 is characterized by its ability to form ionic interactions, such as the one between Glu288 and Arg444, which is crucial for maintaining structural integrity (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of MCCC1 into a heteromeric complex, specifically an α6β6 dodecamer, indicating its role in forming a functional enzyme complex with multiple subunits (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and function are critical for its role in metabolic pathways, and disruptions can lead to metabolic disorders.

## Function
The MCCC1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of leucine, an essential amino acid. This enzyme is a biotin-dependent carboxylase that catalyzes the carboxylation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a key step in the leucine degradation pathway (L2016Biochemical; Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The MCCC1 gene product contains the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain, which are essential for the enzyme's function and structural integrity (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

In healthy human cells, the MCCC1 protein, along with the MCCC2 gene product, is targeted to the mitochondria, where it participates in the breakdown of leucine. This process is vital for maintaining normal metabolic function and energy homeostasis (L2016Biochemical). The activity of MCC is crucial for preventing the accumulation of metabolites such as 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and 3-methylcrotonylglycine, which can indicate MCC deficiency when present in elevated levels (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The enzyme's function is integral to energy production and maintaining metabolic balance within the cell.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCCC1 gene are associated with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) deficiency, a metabolic disorder affecting leucine catabolism. This condition is characterized by a highly variable clinical phenotype, ranging from severe neurological symptoms in neonates to asymptomatic adults. Common biochemical markers include elevated levels of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 3-methylcrotonylglycine, and 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine in blood and urine (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA; Nguyen2011Novel). 

The disorder is caused by mutations in the MCCC1 gene, which encodes the α subunit of the MCC enzyme. These mutations can lead to a deficiency in enzyme activity, resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The clinical presentation can include metabolic crises triggered by infections or a protein-rich diet, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, seizures, and metabolic acidosis (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

In addition to MCC deficiency, alterations in the MCCC1 gene have been studied in relation to Parkinson's disease (PD). The SNP rs2270968 in MCCC1 has been associated with an increased risk of PD in certain populations, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhao2020SNPs).

## Interactions
MCCC1 (methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase subunit 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in the innate immune response. It interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and is a component of the MAVS signalosome, which is essential for antiviral and inflammatory responses. MCCC1 enhances the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting the MAVS complex, promoting the phosphorylation of IκBα, leading to NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation (Cao2016MethylcrotonoylCoA).

MCCC1 also interacts with MAVS-associated factors such as TRAF6 and TRADD, but not with TRAF3, indicating its specific role in the MAVS-TRAF6 signaling pathway. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and confocal microscopy, which show the colocalization of MCCC1 with MAVS and TRAF6 (Cao2016MethylcrotonoylCoA). These interactions suggest that MCCC1 is a positive regulator of virus-induced interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, contributing to the host's antiviral response (Cao2016MethylcrotonoylCoA).
