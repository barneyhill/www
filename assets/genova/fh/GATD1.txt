# GATD1

## Overview
GATD1 is a gene that encodes the protein glutamine amidotransferase class 1 domain containing 1, which is a component of the FERRY complex, a novel Rab5 effector involved in intracellular mRNA transport and localization. This protein plays a significant role in linking early endosomes with the translation machinery, particularly in neurons where mRNA spatial localization is crucial for function. GATD1 is characterized by its amidotransferase activity, contributing to nitrogen metabolism and processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis, which are essential for cell growth and proliferation. The protein is expressed with a non-cleavable N-terminal hexa-histidine tag for research purposes, facilitating its study in both bacterial and insect cell systems (Schuhmacher2021The; Quentin2021Structure).

## Structure


## Function
The GATD1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the FERRY complex, a novel Rab5 effector involved in linking early endosomes with the translation machinery. This complex plays a crucial role in intracellular mRNA transport and localization, particularly in neurons where mRNA spatial localization is critical for function. The FERRY complex, including GATD1, interacts with mRNA, suggesting a role in translational control and mRNA specificity, although the binding efficacy varies among different mRNAs (Schuhmacher2021The; Quentin2021Structure).

GATD1, also known as Fy-5, is expressed with a non-cleavable N-terminal hexa-histidine tag in both bacteria and insect cells for study purposes. While specific functions of GATD1 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its involvement in the FERRY complex suggests a significant role in mRNA transport processes and possibly in the regulation of Rab5 activity (Quentin2021Structure). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm is associated with amidotransferase activity, contributing to nitrogen metabolism and processes like nucleotide biosynthesis, which are essential for cell growth and proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
The GATD1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to glioblastoma (GBM) and dermatomyositis (DM). In the context of GBM, GATD1 is one of the genes included in a logistic regression model designed to differentiate between control and GBM samples. The expression of GATD1, along with other genes, is associated with an increased probability of GBM, suggesting that changes in its expression levels are relevant in the context of this aggressive brain tumor (Mukherjee2020Quiescent).

In dermatomyositis, particularly among patients with anti-TIF1-Î³ antibodies, the presence of additional autoantibodies, including anti-GATD1, is associated with a decreased frequency of cancer emergence. This suggests a potential protective role of these autoantibodies against cancer in DM patients. The study highlights that DM patients with a broader range of autoantibody specificities, including anti-GATD1, tend to have a lower risk of developing cancer, indicating that GATD1 may play a role in modulating immune responses that affect cancer risk (Fiorentino2022Immune).

## Interactions
GATD1, also known as Fy-5, is a subunit of the human FERRY Rab5 effector complex, which is involved in mRNA transport and localization within cells. The FERRY complex is composed of five subunits: Tbck (Fy-1), Ppp1r21 (Fy-2), C12orf4 (Fy-3), Cryzl1 (Fy-4), and Gatd1 (Fy-5). This complex acts as a molecular link between mRNA and early endosomes, facilitating intracellular mRNA distribution. Within the FERRY complex, GATD1 contributes to the binding of mRNA, working in conjunction with the coiled-coil domains of Fy-2, which serve as the primary RNA binding site (Quentin2021Structure).

Although GATD1 alone does not bind RNA, it plays a stabilizing role in the complex, supporting the proper conformation necessary for RNA interaction. The coiled-coil domains of Fy-2 are crucial for RNA binding, with Fy-4 and Fy-5 acting as stabilizers (Quentin2021Structure). The FERRY complex shows specificity for different mRNAs, suggesting that GATD1 may participate in selective mRNA transport processes (Schuhmacher2021The). However, specific interactions of GATD1 with other proteins or nucleic acids outside of the FERRY complex are not detailed in the available literature.
