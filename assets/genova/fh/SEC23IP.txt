# SEC23IP

## Overview
SEC23IP is a gene that encodes the SEC23 interacting protein, a crucial component in the cellular machinery responsible for vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. The protein, also known as p125, is involved in the formation of COPII vesicles, which are essential for the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi. It is characterized by several structural domains, including a sterile alpha motif (SAM) and a DDHD domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and lipids at ER exit sites (ERES) (Du2024Sec23IP; Aridor2018COPII). SEC23IP plays a significant role in the ER export of procollagen, a process vital for collagen biogenesis, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including acute steroidogenesis in Leydig cells (Du2024Sec23IP; Aghazadeh2019Identification). Mutations in the SEC23IP gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including autosomal recessive intellectual disability and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment and cellular transport (Zayats2016Exome; Mir2019Advances).

## Structure
SEC23IP, also known as p125, is a protein involved in the COPII vesicle formation process. It contains several structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein features an N-terminal (NT) region, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a DDHD domain. The NT region is crucial for its interaction with the VAB domain of VPS13B, particularly with the sixth repeat (R6) of the VAB domain (Du2024Sec23IP). The SAM domain is involved in protein oligomerization and forms a selective lipid-recognition module that binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), supporting membrane localization at ER exit sites (ERES) (Aridor2018COPII).

SEC23IP also contains a lipid-binding domain essential for its function in COPII-dependent ERES function (McCaughey2018COPII-dependent). The protein is part of the phospholipase A1 family and contains a Sec23 PPP interaction motif, which is involved in PI4P-mediated regulation of COPII budding at ERES (Hutchings2019Coat). The interaction with Sec23 is crucial for the recruitment and linking of the COPII coat outer layer to the inner layer, facilitating vesicle budding (Aridor2018COPII). The protein's role in the ER export of procollagen and its interaction with VPS13B are essential for the formation of ERES-Golgi interfaces (Du2024Sec23IP).

## Function
SEC23IP, also known as SEC23 interacting protein, plays a crucial role in the early secretory pathway by facilitating the interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) and the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in the recruitment of the Cohen syndrome factor VPS13B/COH1 to the ERES-Golgi interface, which is essential for the formation of tubular ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) (Du2024Sec23IP). This interaction is vital for proper vesicle trafficking and Golgi function, as it helps maintain the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus (Du2024Sec23IP).

SEC23IP also plays a role in the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of procollagen, a critical process in collagen biogenesis. It promotes the ER export of procollagen, which is essential for proper collagen secretion and is implicated in maintaining the organization of ER exit sites (Du2024Sec23IP). In addition to its role in protein trafficking, SEC23IP is involved in acute steroidogenesis in MA-10 Leydig cells, where it regulates the production of steroid hormones such as progesterone (Aghazadeh2019Identification). This indicates its broader role in cellular processes related to development and physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEC23IP gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. Homozygous and truncating mutations in SEC23IP are associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID), suggesting a link between SEC23IP dysfunction and neurodevelopmental disorders (Mir2019Advances). SEC23IP is also involved in the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of procollagen, and its depletion significantly inhibits procollagen export, which is relevant to Cohen syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by joint hypermobility, developmental delays, and intellectual disability, and is linked to defects in collagen biogenesis and secretion (Du2024Sec23IP).

In the context of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (aADHD), SEC23IP has shown significant associations with the condition. Gene expression studies indicate high expression of SEC23IP in specific brain regions, such as the cortex and basal ganglia input nuclei, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of aADHD (Zayats2016Exome). Additionally, rare variants in SEC23IP have been identified that are predicted to be deleterious, potentially affecting protein function and regulatory DNA elements (Zayats2016Exome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SEC23IP in various disorders related to its role in cellular transport and neurodevelopment.

## Interactions
SEC23IP, also known as p125, is involved in several protein interactions critical for cellular processes. It interacts with VPS13B at the ER exit site (ERES)-Golgi interface, a connection mediated by the VAB domain of VPS13B, which binds to the N-terminal region of SEC23IP. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of VPS13B to ERES and is confirmed through GFP-trap assays and in vitro pulldown assays (Du2024Sec23IP). SEC23IP also interacts with Sec31A via its N-terminal region, allowing it to simultaneously bind both VPS13B and Sec31A at ERES, suggesting a role in mediating interactions at the ERES-Golgi interface (Du2024Sec23IP).

In the context of COPII vesicle formation, SEC23IP interacts with Sec23, a component of the COPII complex, through its N-terminal proline-rich domain. This interaction is crucial for recruiting SEC23IP to ER exit sites and is enhanced by Sar1-GTP. SEC23IP also binds to the Sec13/31 complex, facilitating the interaction between the inner and outer COPII coat layers, which is essential for vesicle budding (D’Arcangelo2013Vesiclemediated; Aridor2018COPII).

SEC23IP is also part of the 14-3-3γ protein network, playing a role in regulating acute steroidogenesis in MA-10 Leydig cells. It interacts with 14-3-3γ proteins, with this interaction being crucial for steroidogenesis (Aghazadeh2019Identification).
