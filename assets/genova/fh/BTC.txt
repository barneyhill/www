# BTC

## Overview
Betacellulin (BTC) is a gene that encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, specifically the protein betacellulin. This protein is initially produced as a membrane-anchored precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to release a soluble form that functions as a ligand for the EGF receptor (EGFR) and other ErbB family receptors. Betacellulin plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, by activating several intracellular signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the differentiation and proliferation of pancreatic β-cells, contributing to glucose homeostasis, and has potential implications in diabetes treatment. Additionally, betacellulin is involved in angiogenesis and neurogenesis, suggesting its utility in regenerative therapies. Alterations in BTC expression have been linked to various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or contribute to therapy resistance, depending on the context (Dunbar2000Structurefunction; Shen2022BTC; Dahlhoff2014The).

## Structure
Betacellulin (BTC) is a protein encoded by the human BTC gene located on chromosome 4. The BTC protein is initially synthesized as a 178 amino acid-long membrane-anchored precursor. This precursor includes several domains: a signal peptide (amino acids 1-31), an extracellular region (amino acids 32-118) containing an EGF-like domain (amino acids 65-105), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 119-139), and a cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 140-178) (Dahlhoff2014The). The EGF-like domain is characterized by six conserved cysteine residues forming three disulfide-bonded loops, with an additional cysteine pair unique to BTC (Dunbar2000Structurefunction).

Post-translational modifications of BTC include glycosylation, with N- and O-linked glycosylation sites identified at Asn 34, Thr 36, and possibly Asn 42. These modifications are not essential for biological activity but may influence BTC secretion or processing (Dunbar2000Structurefunction). BTC undergoes ectodomain shedding mediated by metalloproteases like ADAM10, releasing a soluble growth factor, while the remaining fragment is cleaved by γ-secretase (Dahlhoff2014The).

BTC can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. One splice variant, BTC-P, lacks the C-loop of the EGF motif and the transmembrane domain, resulting in a shorter protein that retains the cytoplasmic tail (Dunbar2000Identification).

## Function
Betacellulin (BTC) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and functions as a ligand for the EGF receptor (EGFR) and other ErbB family receptors. It is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing to release a soluble form, which can engage in autocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine signaling (Dunbar2000Structurefunction; Dahlhoff2014The). BTC is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It activates several intracellular signaling pathways, such as p38MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JNK, which are crucial for these cellular functions (Dahlhoff2014The).

In healthy human cells, BTC plays a significant role in the differentiation and proliferation of pancreatic β-cells, contributing to glucose homeostasis and potentially ameliorating diabetes (Dahlhoff2014The). It also promotes angiogenesis by activating MAPK and PI3K pathways in endothelial cells, enhancing DNA synthesis, migration, and survival, which are essential for blood vessel formation (Suk2002Betacellulin). In the neural stem cell niche, BTC stimulates neurogenesis and maintains the proliferation of neural stem cells, suggesting its potential in regenerative therapies for neurodegenerative diseases (Gómez-Gaviro2012Betacellulin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BTC gene have been implicated in various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), BTC acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Low expression of BTC is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis in OSCC patients. Overexpression of BTC in OSCC cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in inhibiting malignant progression. BTC's involvement in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is crucial for its tumor-suppressive effects in OSCC (Shen2022BTC).

In glioblastoma, BTC contributes to therapy resistance. The inhibition of STAT3 leads to increased BTC expression, which activates the EGFR:NF-κB signaling axis, reducing the effectiveness of STAT3 blockade. Neutralizing BTC with antibodies has been shown to make glioma cells more sensitive to STAT3 inhibition, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy involving the combined inhibition of STAT3 and EGFR (Fan2019Betacellulin).

BTC is also linked to poor outcomes in breast cancer and is overexpressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer, indicating its role in tumor growth and progression (Dahlhoff2014The).

## Interactions
Betacellulin (BTC) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and interacts primarily with the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. BTC is known for its ability to bind to ErbB-1 (EGFR) and ErbB-4 homodimers, as well as all possible heterodimeric combinations of ErbB receptors, including the oncogenic ErbB-2–ErbB-3 complex (Dunbar2000Structurefunction). This binding leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, creating docking sites for proteins with SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains, such as Shc, Grb2, and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which activate downstream signaling pathways (Dunbar2000Structurefunction).

BTC and EGF have similar binding avidities to EGFR, indicating that BTC exerts its effects through EGFR interaction. Ligand competition assays have shown that BTC and EGF compete equally for binding sites on A431 cells, a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (Watanabe1994Recombinant). BTC does not bind to c-erbB-2 but rather to EGFR, as evidenced by competition assays where EGF effectively quenched BTC binding (Watanabe1994Recombinant). BTC's interaction with ErbB-4 is distinct from other EGF-family ligands, as it can induce different patterns of ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and recruit different intracellular signaling proteins (Dunbar2000Structurefunction).
