# CLEC7A

## Overview
CLEC7A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 7A, commonly referred to as Dectin-1. Dectin-1 is a type II transmembrane receptor belonging to the C-type lectin family, characterized by its ability to recognize carbohydrate structures. This receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of myeloid cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, where it plays a critical role in the immune system's response to fungal pathogens by recognizing β-glucans present in fungal cell walls (Asamaphan2016Dectin1; Romani2011Immunity). Upon ligand binding, Dectin-1 initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) pathway, which are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Willment2008Ctype; Jia2014CARD9). Genetic variations in CLEC7A have been linked to increased susceptibility to fungal infections and certain inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Ferwerda2009Human; Legaki2023Polymorphisms).

## Structure
The CLEC7A gene encodes the Dectin-1 protein, a type II transmembrane receptor that is part of the C-type lectin family. The protein structure includes a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), a stalk region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence, YXXL, which is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways (Asamaphan2016Dectin1). The extracellular domains of Dectin-1 have several putative N- and O-glycosylation sites, with N-glycosylation being important for cell surface expression and function (Asamaphan2016Dectin1).

Dectin-1 is expressed as a monomer on the surface of myeloid cells and lymphocytes, and it undergoes alternative splicing to produce two major isoforms, A and B, and several minor isoforms (C-H). Isoform A includes a surface C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) attached to an intracellular ITAM via a stalk and transmembrane region, while isoform B lacks the stalk (Kalia2018A). The receptor is known for recognizing β-1,3-glucans, which are found in fungal cell walls, although the exact mechanism of recognition is not fully understood (Asamaphan2016Dectin1).

## Function
CLEC7A, also known as Dectin-1, is a C-type lectin receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune response to fungal pathogens. It is primarily expressed on the surface of myeloid cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Dectin-1 recognizes β-glucans, which are major components of fungal cell walls, and upon binding, it initiates several intracellular signaling pathways (Willment2008Ctype; Romani2011Immunity).

The receptor activates the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) pathway and the RAF pathway, which work together to induce both canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. This leads to the expression of cytokine genes and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 (Romani2011Immunity). Dectin-1 also mediates the respiratory burst, activation of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase 2, and the production of cytokines and chemokines like TNF, IL-2, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-23 (Willment2008Ctype).

In healthy human cells, Dectin-1 is crucial for the recognition and phagocytosis of fungal pathogens, contributing to the clearance of infections and maintaining immune homeostasis (Ferwerda2009Human). Its role in antifungal immunity is significant, as genetic deficiencies in Dectin-1 can lead to increased susceptibility to fungal infections (Romani2011Immunity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLEC7A gene, also known as Dectin-1, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis (UC), has been associated with polymorphisms in the CLEC7A gene. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs2078178 and rs16910631 are linked to an increased risk of UC, with the rs2078178 AA genotype being more frequent in UC patients (Legaki2023Polymorphisms).

In the context of immunodeficiency, mutations in CLEC7A have been identified in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, a condition characterized by persistent fungal infections. These mutations can impair the immune response, contributing to the disease phenotype (Dinwiddie2013Combined).

CLEC7A expression is also relevant in the context of gliomas, a type of brain tumor. Elevated CLEC7A expression is associated with poorer prognosis and is linked to the presence of M2 macrophages, which promote an immunosuppressive environment in gliomas. This suggests that CLEC7A may play a role in tumor progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target (Wang2024CLEC7A).

## Interactions
CLEC7A, also known as Dectin-1, is a C-type lectin receptor that plays a crucial role in the immune response by recognizing β-glucans on fungal cell walls. Upon ligand binding, CLEC7A undergoes phosphorylation of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like motif, which leads to the recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). This interaction is essential for downstream signaling pathways that include the activation of NF-κB and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Asamaphan2016Dectin1; Tam2014Dectin1–Dependent).

CLEC7A also interacts with the adaptor protein CARD9, which is crucial for linking Ras-GRF1 to H-Ras, facilitating ERK activation. This interaction is important for the immune response against fungal pathogens like Candida albicans (Jia2014CARD9). The receptor is involved in the recruitment of LC3 to phagosomes, enhancing fungicidal activity in macrophages. This process is dependent on Syk-mediated signaling and involves other autophagy-related proteins such as beclin-1 and p62 (Tam2014Dectin1–Dependent).

CLEC7A can also interact with endogenous ligands, such as the intermediate filament protein vimentin, and is involved in processes like lipid oxidation in atherosclerosis and reverse transcytosis of IgA-antigen complexes (Asamaphan2016Dectin1).
