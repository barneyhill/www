# CD99L2

## Overview
CD99L2, or CD99 molecule like 2, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell adhesion and migration. The protein product of CD99L2 is predominantly expressed on endothelial cells and various leukocytes, including neutrophils, T cells, and B cells. It plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in facilitating the transendothelial migration of neutrophils, a key step in immune surveillance and inflammation. CD99L2 is concentrated at cell-cell contacts in endothelial cells, indicating its involvement in intercellular interactions and cell adhesion (Bixel2010CD99; Bixel2007A). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and interactions within the cellular environment. CD99L2's role in leukocyte diapedesis and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases and certain cancers underscore its clinical significance (Sun2022Loss; Samus2018CD99L2).

## Structure
CD99L2 (CD99 molecule like 2) is a type I transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and migration. The primary structure of CD99L2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. The secondary structure of the protein may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its role in cellular processes. 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are known to occur in CD99L2. These modifications can significantly affect the protein's function and localization within the cell. Glycosylation, in particular, may influence the protein's stability and its interactions with other cellular components. 

CD99L2 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can lead to variations in its functional properties. These isoforms result from alternative splicing of the CD99L2 gene, potentially giving rise to proteins with distinct roles in cellular activities. The presence of multiple isoforms allows for a diverse range of functions and regulatory mechanisms within the cell.

## Function
CD99L2 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on endothelial cells and various leukocytes, including neutrophils, T cells, and B cells. It plays a significant role in leukocyte extravasation, particularly in the transendothelial migration of neutrophils, a critical step in immune surveillance and inflammation. CD99L2 is involved in the diapedesis process, facilitating the movement of leukocytes through the endothelial barrier and the underlying basement membrane, but it does not participate in the initial docking of leukocytes to the vessel wall (Bixel2010CD99; Bixel2007A).

The protein is concentrated at cell-cell contacts in endothelial cells and is present on the entire cell surface, suggesting its involvement in cell adhesion and intercellular interactions (Bixel2007A). CD99L2 supports the recruitment of neutrophils into inflamed tissue but does not mediate lymphocyte extravasation, despite its expression on lymphocytes (Bixel2007A). In neuroinflammatory disorders, CD99L2 is implicated in the entry of leukocytes into the central nervous system by supporting their diapedesis through the endothelial basement membrane of blood vessels at the blood-brain barrier (Samus2018CD99L2). Blocking CD99L2 can inhibit leukocyte diapedesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases (Samus2018CD99L2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD99L2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, CD99L2 is associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ). Knockdown of CD99L2 in GBM cell lines increases resistance to TMZ, while overexpression enhances sensitivity, suggesting that CD99L2 expression levels could serve as a biomarker for TMZ resistance. Additionally, higher CD99L2 expression in GBM patients correlates with longer progression-free survival, indicating its potential role in patient prognosis (Sun2022Loss).

In the context of neuroinflammatory diseases, CD99L2 plays a role in leukocyte diapedesis through the blood-brain barrier. CD99L2 deficiency in endothelial cells reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, by inhibiting leukocyte entry into the central nervous system. This suggests that CD99L2 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in neuroinflammatory conditions (Samus2018CD99L2).

In murine models of B cell lymphoma, downregulation of CD99L2 leads to impaired tumor growth and altered immune responses, indicating its involvement in tumorigenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (LIU2013Effect).
