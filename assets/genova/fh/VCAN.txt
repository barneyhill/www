# VCAN

## Overview
The VCAN gene encodes versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that plays a pivotal role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of various tissues. Versican is categorized as a proteoglycan due to its extensive glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which contribute to its highly anionic nature and functional versatility. The protein is involved in critical cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and is essential for tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis, particularly in cardiac development (Islam2020Versican:). Versican's structure, characterized by multiple domains including G1 and G3, facilitates interactions with hyaluronic acid and other ECM components, forming large complexes that influence cell adhesion and matrix assembly (Foulcer2014Isolation; Zimmermann1989Multiple). The gene's expression and the resulting protein isoforms are tightly regulated, with specific variants playing distinct roles in different tissues and developmental stages (Islam2020Versican:).

## Structure
Versican (VCAN) is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with a complex molecular structure. The core protein of versican is composed of 2389 amino acids, including a 20-residue signal peptide, and has a molecular weight of approximately 265,048 Da (Zimmermann1989Multiple). The primary structure includes multiple domains: an N-terminal G1 domain, which binds hyaluronic acid, and a C-terminal G3 domain, which contains epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a lectin-like sequence, and a complement regulatory protein-like domain (Zimmermann1989Multiple; Nandadasa2014The).

Versican exists in several splice variants, including V0, V1, V2, V3, and V4, each differing in the presence of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment domains, specifically GAGα and GAGβ (Islam2020Versican:; Foulcer2014Isolation). The V0 variant contains both GAGα and GAGβ domains, while V1 and V2 contain only one of these domains, and V3 lacks both (Nandadasa2014The). The G1 domain includes link protein-like sequences that facilitate hyaluronic acid binding, while the G3 domain interacts with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrillin-1 and tenascin (Foulcer2014Isolation).

Post-translational modifications of versican include extensive glycosylation, with 20 potential N-glycosylation sites and several O-linked oligosaccharide chains (Zimmermann1989Multiple). These modifications contribute to the protein's highly anionic nature and its role in the extracellular matrix (Foulcer2014Isolation). Versican's structure allows it to form large complexes with hyaluronan, influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration (Foulcer2014Isolation).

## Function
The VCAN gene encodes versican, a large chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of healthy human cells. Versican is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation, by providing structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells (Islam2020Versican:). It is a crucial component in tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis, particularly in cardiac development, where it aids in forming the cardiac wall and facilitates the migration and differentiation of myocardial cells (Islam2020Versican:).

Versican exists in multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing, each with specific roles. The V0 and V1 variants are typically expressed during rapid tissue formation or remodeling, while V2 is more restricted to the adult central nervous system (Islam2020Versican:). The G1 domain of versican binds to hyaluronic acid (HA), forming stable proteoglycan aggregates that contribute to a rich pericellular matrix, crucial for maintaining ECM structure and function (Islam2020Versican:).

In the dermis, versican plays a role in fibroblast proliferation and collagen fiber formation. It is also involved in inflammation, where it is expressed in activated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, potentially regulating inflammation by binding to hyaluronan or mediating cytokine signaling (Islam2020Versican:).

## Interactions
Versican, encoded by the VCAN gene, is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that participates in various interactions within the extracellular matrix (ECM). It contains multiple domains that facilitate binding with a range of ECM components and cell surface proteins. The amino-terminal domain of versican binds hyaluronic acid, which is crucial for its role in cell adhesion and matrix assembly (Zimmermann1989Multiple).

The C-terminal domain of versican, particularly the G3 domain, interacts with β1-integrin, a cell surface receptor. This interaction is calcium- and manganese-dependent and activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), enhancing cell adhesion and providing resistance to apoptosis (Wu2002β1Integrinmediated).

Versican also interacts with fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 through its C-type lectin domain. These interactions are calcium-dependent and involve high-affinity binding, contributing to the formation of multiprotein complexes within the ECM (Olin2001The; Aspberg1999Fibulin1). The lectin domain of versican specifically binds to tenascin-R, a glycoprotein in the ECM, in a calcium-dependent manner, highlighting its role in assembling ECM complexes (Aspberg1995The).
