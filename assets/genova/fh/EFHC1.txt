# EFHC1

## Overview
EFHC1 is a gene that encodes the protein EF-hand domain containing 1, also known as myoclonin 1, which is characterized by its EF-hand motif, a calcium-binding domain, and its association with microtubules. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and plays a crucial role in calcium signaling, neuronal migration, and cell division (Léon2010Distribution). Myoclonin 1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, and testis, with higher expression levels during embryonic development. It is involved in regulating intracellular calcium mobilization and interacts with microtubule structures, influencing mitotic spindle organization and neuronal development (Suzuki2024Epilepsy; Grisar2012Myoclonin1/EFHC1). Mutations in EFHC1 are linked to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), highlighting its clinical significance in neurological disorders (Bailey2017EFHC1).

## Structure
The EFHC1 gene encodes a protein known as myoclonin 1, which is characterized by the presence of three DM10 domains and one EF-hand motif, a calcium-binding domain (Léon2010Distribution). The EF-hand motif contributes to the protein's ability to bind calcium ions, which is crucial for its role in calcium signaling. EFHC1 is considered a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and is implicated in neuronal migration (Léon2010Distribution).

The protein is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels found in the lung and testis, and is also present in the brain. Its expression is higher during embryonic stages compared to adulthood (Léon2010Distribution). EFHC1 has been shown to have a pro-apoptotic effect in vitro, which is reduced by mutations associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) (Léon2010Distribution). It enhances calcium currents through the Ca v 2.3 voltage-dependent calcium channel (Léon2010Distribution).

EFHC1 is orthologous to Rib72, an axonemal protein, and is expressed in tissues with motile cilia or flagella, suggesting a role in the properties of these organelles (Léon2010Distribution). The subcellular distribution of EFHC1 varies during the cell cycle, being present in the cytoplasm and nucleus during interphase and localized at spindle poles and the midbody during mitosis, indicating a role in cell division and brain development (Léon2010Distribution).

## Function
The EFHC1 gene encodes the protein myoclonin1, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. Myoclonin1 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) mobilization, interacting with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors to modulate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is crucial for maintaining ER-Ca2+ homeostasis, particularly in cells with motile cilia, such as those in the choroid plexus and ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles (Suzuki2024Epilepsy).

EFHC1 is also associated with microtubule-based structures, such as the mitotic spindle, and is involved in cell division processes, including mitotic spindle organization and M phase progression. It interacts directly with α-tubulin, a component of microtubules, indicating a high affinity for these structures (Grisar2012Myoclonin1/EFHC1). The protein is crucial for proper mitotic spindle organization, and its impairment can lead to defects such as monopolar spindles and chromosome misalignment (Grisar2012Myoclonin1/EFHC1).

In the brain, EFHC1 is essential for neuronal migration and synapse/dendrite formation, influencing the proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitors and the radial migration of post-mitotic neurons (Grisar2012Myoclonin1/EFHC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFHC1 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), a common form of genetic epilepsy. These mutations can lead to disruptions in calcium signaling and neuronal function, contributing to seizure susceptibility. Specifically, EFHC1 mutations have been linked to myoclonic and grand mal clonic-tonic-clonic convulsions, which are characteristic of JME (Bailey2017EFHC1). The gene encodes the protein myoclonin1, which is implicated in the development of epileptic phenotypes, and mutations in EFHC1 are found in 3% to 9% of families with JME (von2015Predictive).

Studies have identified several EFHC1 variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic, with some variants causing severe mitotic spindle defects and impairing neuroblast migration, indicating damage to gene function (Bailey2017EFHC1). The presence of EFHC1 mutations in healthy individuals, depending on their ancestry, suggests that the pathogenicity of these mutations may vary based on genetic background (Subaran2014Pathogenic). Additionally, EFHC1 mutations have been associated with increased R-type Ca2+ currents and apoptosis in neuronal cultures, supporting their role in the pathogenesis of JME (JaraPrado2012Novel). These findings highlight the gene's role in predisposing individuals to epilepsy, particularly JME.

## Interactions
EFHC1, a protein associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, is known to physically interact with the TRPM2 channel. This interaction occurs at both the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of TRPM2, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293 cells. EFHC1 enhances TRPM2-mediated calcium ion responses to oxidative stress and ADP-ribose, indicating a regulatory role in TRPM2 activity. This interaction is significant in the context of oxidative stress and cell death, with EFHC1 potentiating TRPM2's effects, which can be reversed by certain juvenile myoclonic epilepsy mutations (Katano2012The).

In addition to its interaction with TRPM2, EFHC1 is involved in modulating dopamine signaling at the synapse and cilium. In C. elegans, EFHC1 localizes to cilia and synapses, where it partially overlaps with synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptobrevin and RAB-3, and the active zone protein ELKS-1. This suggests a role in regulating neuronal output and dopamine release, potentially influencing neuronal excitability and mechanosensory transduction (Loucks2019EFHC1).
