# CXCR3

## Overview
The CXCR3 gene encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the migration of T cells to sites of inflammation, thereby contributing to immune surveillance and response. CXCR3 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, including Th1 cells, regulatory T cells, and memory CD8+ T cells, and is activated by interferon-inducible chemokines such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Groom2011CXCR3; Metzemaekers2018Overview). The receptor's interactions and expression are tightly regulated, influencing various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders (Satarkar2022Evolution; Reynders2019The).

## Structure
The CXCR3 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of the GPCR family. The primary structure of CXCR3 includes a sequence that is highly conserved among chemokine receptors, with specific regions crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (Trotta2009Modelling). The secondary structure of CXCR3 is predicted to consist of well-conserved transmembrane helices, with minor variations in helix length (Trotta2009Modelling).

The tertiary structure of CXCR3 was modeled using bovine rhodopsin as a template, resulting in a model that aligns well with experimental data, as indicated by a Prosa Z-score of -3.47 and 96.2% of residues in favored regions (Trotta2009Modelling). This model highlights the presence of three extracellular loops, which are important for receptor activation and interaction with chemokines such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Trotta2009Modelling).

Post-translational modifications of CXCR3 include predicted phosphorylation sites located in the N-terminal, loop 3, and C-terminal regions, which may play roles in receptor regulation and signaling (Trotta2009Modelling). The receptor's quaternary structure involves forming complexes with its chemokine ligands, with CXCL11 showing the highest binding affinity and activity (Trotta2009Modelling).

## Function
The CXCR3 gene encodes a chemokine receptor that plays a significant role in the immune system by directing the migration of T cells to sites of inflammation. This receptor is primarily expressed on activated T cells, including Th1 cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and memory CD8+ T cells, and is rapidly induced on naïve T cells following activation (Groom2011CXCR3; Metzemaekers2018Overview). CXCR3 is activated by interferon-inducible ligands such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which facilitate T cell trafficking and function (Groom2011CXCR3).

In healthy human cells, CXCR3 is involved in the regulation of leukocyte migration, which is crucial for immune surveillance and response. It is expressed on various cell types, including activated lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells, and is involved in the trafficking of activated lymphocytes to inflammatory sites (GarcíaLópez2001CXCR3). The receptor's expression is tightly regulated, increasing the specificity of leukocyte binding to the endothelium, which is essential for the immune system's ability to respond to inflammation (GarcíaLópez2001CXCR3).

CXCR3 also plays a role in the differentiation and maturation of memory CD8+ T cells, influencing their migration and function in immune responses. High expression of CXCR3 on memory CD8+ T cells is associated with their ability to produce cytokines like IL-2 and IFN-γ, which are crucial for immune responses (Kobayashi2006Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The CXCR3 gene is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In cancer, CXCR3 expression is associated with both anti-tumoral and pro-tumoral activities. It is involved in immune cell recruitment to the tumor microenvironment, influencing tumor progression and metastasis. CXCR3-A expression on tumor cells can promote proliferation and metastasis, as seen in glioma and colorectal cancer (Reynders2019The). In renal cell carcinoma, CXCR3 expression is linked to therapy response, with high levels associated with a favorable prognosis (GudowskaSawczuk2020The).

In neurological diseases, CXCR3 is involved in multiple sclerosis through the infiltration of CXCR3-positive T cells into the central nervous system, contributing to lesion formation (Satarkar2022Evolution). In Alzheimer's disease, CXCR3 interactions with its ligand CXCL10 are implicated in neuronal injury and inflammation (Satarkar2022Evolution).

CXCR3 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, where its overexpression is linked to inflammation and disease progression (Schroepf2010Strong; Kuo2018The). In inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the CXCR3 axis is overexpressed, contributing to colonic inflammation (Schroepf2010Strong).

## Interactions
CXCR3, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with several chemokines, including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which are crucial for immune and inflammatory responses. Among these, CXCL11 exhibits the highest binding affinity to CXCR3, forming multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, particularly involving the N-terminal and N-loop regions of the chemokine and the receptor (Palladino2012The; Trotta2009Modelling). The interaction between CXCR3 and CXCL11 is characterized by electrostatic interactions, with specific residues playing a significant role in binding (Palladino2012The).

CXCR3 also forms heteromeric complexes with the CXCR4 receptor. This interaction is ligand-independent and has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (trFRET) experiments. These heteromers can influence ligand-binding kinetics and signaling pathways, such as the recruitment of b-arrestin2, which is facilitated when both receptors are in active conformations (Watts2013Identification). The formation of CXCR3-CXCR4 heteromers suggests potential functional roles in immune cell migration and cancer progression (Watts2013Identification).
