# TMEM232

## Overview
TMEM232 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 232, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including immune system regulation and potentially in the pathogenesis of several diseases. The gene has been studied for its role in inflammatory and allergic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, as well as its involvement in immune-related disorders like multiple sclerosis. Additionally, TMEM232 has been investigated in the context of cancer, particularly bladder cancer, where its expression levels may serve as a biomarker for disease progression (Piliszek2022Computational; Zheng2021Confirming; Portelli2014Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM232 gene has been implicated in several diseases, particularly atopic dermatitis (AD), a common inflammatory skin disorder. Studies have confirmed the association of TMEM232 with AD, especially in the Chinese Han population, where the H15 haplotype showed a strong link to the disease (Zheng2021Identification; Zheng2021Confirming). The gene's variant rs17132261 has been associated with AD in infants, with the presence of the C allele linked to a higher risk of developing the condition (Choi2023Effects). 

TMEM232 has also been associated with allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and IgE sensitization to grass, indicating its broader role in allergic responses (Portelli2014Genetic). In addition to its role in allergic conditions, TMEM232 has been linked to multiple sclerosis and immune-related disorders, suggesting its involvement in immune system regulation (Riggio2024A).

In the context of cancer, TMEM232 expression patterns have been studied in bladder cancer, where its expression is higher in low-risk cancers, indicating its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression (Piliszek2022Computational).
