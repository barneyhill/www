# H2BC9

## Overview
H2BC9 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 9, which is a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are fundamental components of chromatin, playing a critical role in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene regulation. The H2B clustered histone 9 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin silencing, and cell differentiation. It is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where its expression has been linked to tumor progression and immune modulation, especially in glioma. The protein's interactions within a complex network of proteins underscore its role in cell cycle regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Jia2022H2B).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
H2BC9, a member of the histone H2B family, has been implicated in various cancers, particularly glioma. High expression levels of H2BC9 are associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients, correlating with increased tumor grade and malignancy (Jia2022H2B). The gene is linked to immune cell infiltration, promoting an immunosuppressive environment that aids tumor progression. Specifically, H2BC9 expression is positively correlated with immune cells such as macrophages, Th2 cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, while inversely correlated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Jia2022H2B).

H2BC9 is also involved in tumor immune escape mechanisms, showing a positive correlation with immune checkpoint markers like PDCD1, IL10, and CD70, which are associated with poor outcomes in glioma (Jia2022H2B). In addition to glioma, H2BC9 expression alterations have been linked to genomic instability in other cancers, such as giant cell tumor of bone, where downregulation of H2BC9 increases genomic instability (Ragusa2023Contribution). These findings suggest that H2BC9 plays a significant role in cancer progression through its impact on immune interactions and genomic stability.

## Interactions
H2BC9, a member of the H2B histone family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions and plays a significant role in chromatin structure and gene regulation. It is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network comprising 74 proteins, indicating its involvement in transcriptional misregulation, chromatin silencing, and cell differentiation (Jia2022H2B). The interactions of H2BC9 are crucial for its role in the cell cycle, as experimental data have shown that knockdown of H2BC9 in glioma cell lines leads to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, suggesting its role in accelerating the cell cycle and contributing to glioma progression (Jia2022H2B).

H2BC9 is also implicated in immune responses and cancer progression, with its expression positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including macrophages, Th2 cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, while inversely correlated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Jia2022H2B). These interactions suggest that H2BC9 may contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive environment in glioma, promoting tumor proliferation and immune escape (Jia2022H2B). The involvement of H2BC9 in these processes highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in glioma and other cancers.
