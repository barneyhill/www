# FASTKD2

## Overview
FASTKD2 is a gene that encodes the FAST kinase domains 2 protein, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and translation. The protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in the maturation and stability of mitochondrial mRNAs, particularly those encoding components of the respiratory chain (Popow2015FASTKD2). Despite its name, FAST kinase domains 2 does not exhibit typical kinase activity due to the absence of conserved kinase motifs (Das2014Fas). The protein's structure includes several distinct domains, such as the FAST1, FAST2, and a putative RNA-binding domain (RAP), which are integral to its function in mitochondrial RNA metabolism (Das2014Fas; Popow2015FASTKD2). Mutations in the FASTKD2 gene have been linked to mitochondrial disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both mitochondrial function and disease pathology (Fang2019FASTKD2; Boczonadi2018Mitochondrial).

## Structure
FASTKD2 is a protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and translation. It contains several distinct domains, including the FAST1 and FAST2 domains, and a putative RNA-binding domain (RAP) near its C-terminus (Das2014Fas; Popow2015FASTKD2). The FAST2 domain, consisting of 81 amino acids, is particularly significant for its role in apoptosis, as it can initiate the apoptotic cascade independently of mitochondrial localization (Das2014Fas). Despite being termed kinase-like, the FAST1 and FAST2 domains do not exhibit typical kinase activity due to the absence of conserved kinase motifs (Das2014Fas).

The RAP domain is structurally related to the PD-(D/E)-XK nuclease superfamily, suggesting potential endonuclease activity (Ohkubo2021The). FASTKD2 is part of a family of proteins that share these domains, which are involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism (Popow2015FASTKD2). The protein's structure facilitates its role in RNA metabolism, although the exact biological functions of these domains are not fully understood (Das2014Fas). FASTKD2 has been associated with mitochondrial diseases, indicating its critical role in mitochondrial function (AstnerRohracher2023A).

## Function
FASTKD2 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial RNA processing and translation. It is involved in the maturation and stability of mitochondrial mRNAs, particularly those encoding components of the respiratory chain, such as complex III subunit CYB and cytochrome c oxidase subunits COX1 and COX2 (Popow2015FASTKD2). FASTKD2 interacts with mitochondrial precursor transcripts, especially near mature mitochondrial transcripts, and is essential for the processing or assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, notably affecting the 16S rRNA (Popow2015FASTKD2).

In healthy human cells, FASTKD2 is crucial for efficient mitochondrial translation, as its depletion leads to a significant reduction in global mitochondrial protein synthesis. This results in impaired mitochondrial translation and cellular respiration, evidenced by decreased respiration rates and a shift towards glycolysis to compensate for energy deficits (Popow2015FASTKD2). FASTKD2 is also involved in the exonucleolytic processing of the ND6 transcript, influencing the fate of its mature forms (Popow2015FASTKD2).

The protein is localized in the mitochondrial inner compartment and is believed to be anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane, projecting towards the inner mitochondrial compartment (Ghezzi2008FASTKD2). Its activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in healthy human cells (Popow2015FASTKD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FASTKD2 gene are linked to several mitochondrial disorders, most notably mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. This condition is characterized by developmental delay, hemiplegia, convulsions, asymmetrical brain atrophy, and low cytochrome c oxidase activity in skeletal muscle (Boczonadi2018Mitochondrial). Specific mutations, such as c.1246C > T (p.Arg416X) and compound heterozygous mutations like p.Arg205X and p.Leu255Pro, have been identified in patients with MELAS-like syndrome, which includes symptoms such as seizures, stroke-like episodes, and optic atrophy (Lopez2021Human).

FASTKD2 mutations have also been associated with neurodegenerative conditions, including cerebellar ataxia, where a patient exhibited symptoms like mild spastic paraplegia and nystagmus due to a c.535delT pathogenic variant (Benkirane2021High). In cancer, FASTKD2 is implicated in promoting tumor growth and invasion, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis (Fang2019FASTKD2). The gene's role in cancer is linked to its regulation of c-Myc expression, a known oncogene (Fang2019FASTKD2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FASTKD2 in both mitochondrial and oncological diseases.

## Interactions
FASTKD2 is known to participate in several interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the mitochondrial context. It is part of a protein complex that includes RPUSD3, RPUSD4, NGRN, WBSCR16, and PTCD1, which is involved in the pseudouridylation of the 16S rRNA, a crucial step in mitochondrial RNA processing (Ohkubo2021The). FASTKD2 interacts with specific mitochondrial transcripts, including 16S ribosomal RNA (RNR2) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) mRNA, as identified through iCLIP, a technique that maps RNA-protein crosslink sites (Popow2015FASTKD2). These interactions are essential for the proper processing and translation of mitochondrial RNAs.

In the context of cancer, FASTKD2 has been shown to interact with BRD4, a protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation. This interaction is part of the mechanism by which FASTKD2 upregulates c-Myc expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Fang2019FASTKD2). Additionally, protein-protein interaction network analyses have identified FASTKD2's interactions with several proteins, including UBC, MRPL4, and MRPL58, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial physiology and cancer signaling pathways (MagranerPardo2021Systematic).
