# FAM167B

## Overview
FAM167B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 167 member B. This protein is implicated in various biological processes, particularly in immune regulation and inflammation. While the specific molecular function of the FAM167B protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is recognized for its role in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The gene's expression has been identified in aorta-specific endothelial cells, suggesting a potential involvement in vascular biology and the unique molecular characteristics of these cells (Feng2019Single). Research into FAM167B continues to explore its broader implications in health and disease, particularly its potential impact on cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions (Chilunga2021Genomewide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the FAM167B gene have been associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Research has identified DNA methylation variations in the FAM167B gene linked to inflammatory traits, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (Chilunga2021Genomewide). These methylation changes are also associated with C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular disease risk, although no direct association with specific cardiovascular conditions was established (Chilunga2021Genomewide).

In addition to its role in inflammation, FAM167B has been identified as a marker gene for aorta-specific endothelial cells, indicating its involvement in vascular biology. This specific expression pattern suggests that FAM167B may play a role in the unique molecular signatures of endothelial cells in the aorta, although the clinical implications of this finding are not fully understood (Feng2019Single).

Overall, the FAM167B gene's involvement in immune regulation and inflammation highlights its potential significance in autoimmune diseases and possibly in cardiovascular health, warranting further investigation to elucidate its clinical impact.
