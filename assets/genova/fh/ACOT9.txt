# ACOT9

## Overview
ACOT9 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 9, which is part of the TE7 family of thioesterases. This enzyme is characterized by a double hotdog domain structure and is involved in the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA, playing a crucial role in lipid and amino acid metabolism within mitochondria (Tillander2013AcylCoA; Swarbrick2020Structure). The protein is predominantly active in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, where it regulates the levels of activated fatty acyl-CoAs, thus maintaining energy homeostasis (Tillander2013AcylCoA). ACOT9's activity is modulated by NADH and CoA, which act as inhibitors, indicating its role in sensing and adapting to the mitochondrial metabolic state (Tillander2013AcylCoA). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including congenital anomalies, although its precise role in disease pathogenesis requires further investigation (Kolvenbach2021Exome).

## Structure
ACOT9 is a mitochondrial enzyme that is part of the TE7 family of thioesterases, characterized by a double hotdog domain structure (Swarbrick2020Structure). The protein is composed of 439 amino acids and includes a 20-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (Kirkby2010Functional). Sequence analysis suggests that ACOT9 contains two thioesterase domains, with only one active site (site II) being functional, which is necessary for its enzymatic activity (Tillander2013AcylCoA). 

The tertiary structure of ACOT9 likely forms a hexamer, or a "trimer of dimers," similar to ACOT7, supported by size-exclusion chromatography data (Tillander2013AcylCoA; Swarbrick2020Structure). This hexameric assembly is thought to accommodate multiple substrate binding sites for short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl-CoAs (Tillander2013AcylCoA). A putative active site residue, Asp 150, is positioned in the central α-helix and may play a role in catalysis (Swarbrick2020Structure).

ACOT9 is subject to regulation by NADH and CoA, which act as inhibitors, suggesting a role in sensing intra-mitochondrial CoA levels (Tillander2013AcylCoA; Swarbrick2020Structure). The protein is expressed widely in human tissues, with the highest activity in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria (Swarbrick2020Structure).

## Function
ACOT9 (acyl-CoA thioesterase 9) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid and amino acid metabolism within mitochondria. It hydrolyzes acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA, which is crucial for regulating intracellular levels of these molecules and maintaining energy homeostasis (Tillander2013AcylCoA; Kirkby2010Functional). ACOT9 is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it influences metabolic pathways by modulating the concentrations of activated fatty acyl-CoAs (Kirkby2010Functional).

The enzyme exhibits broad substrate specificity, acting on short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl-CoAs, with a preference for hydrophobic acyl-CoAs (Tillander2013AcylCoA). It is particularly active in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, where it is suggested to be the main enzyme responsible for short- and medium-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase activity (Tillander2013AcylCoA). ACOT9's activity is regulated by NADH and CoA, indicating its role in adapting to the mitochondrial metabolic state (Tillander2013AcylCoA).

ACOT9 is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids, potentially linking these pathways by regulating the levels of acyl-CoA intermediates, which are crucial for processes like the Krebs cycle (Tillander2013AcylCoA). This regulatory function is essential for maintaining efficient mitochondrial metabolism and energy production.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACOT9 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. A novel hemizygous missense variant in ACOT9 (c.953G>A; p.(Arg318Gln)) was identified in an individual with sacral hypoplasia, anal atresia with recto-prostatic fistula, atrial septal defect, and left renal dysplasia. This variant was inherited from an unaffected mother and is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) according to the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines (Kolvenbach2021Exome). The ACOT9 gene has also been suggested as a candidate gene in the context of VATER/VACTERL phenotypes, which include a range of congenital anomalies such as vertebral defects, anorectal malformations, and renal malformations (Kolvenbach2021Exome).

The enzyme encoded by ACOT9 is involved in mitochondrial metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs. Its activity is crucial for maintaining efficient mitochondrial function and preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites like propionyl-CoA, which can inhibit key enzymes in the Krebs cycle. This suggests a potential role for ACOT9 in metabolic disorders such as propionic acidemia (Tillander2013AcylCoA). However, the clinical significance of ACOT9 in these contexts remains speculative, and further research is needed to confirm its role in disease pathogenesis (Kolvenbach2021Exome).

## Interactions
ACOT9, also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 9, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, although specific physical interactions are not extensively detailed in the literature. Initial studies identified ACOT9 as a 48-kDa polypeptide that co-precipitated with a GST-Eps15 fusion protein in murine and human cell lysates, suggesting a potential interaction with the Eps15 protein. However, a functional link or in vivo interaction between Eps15 and ACOT9 could not be established (Tillander2013AcylCoA).

The regulation of ACOT9 activity is influenced by NADH and CoA, which act as potent inhibitors. This regulation is thought to occur through allosteric and competitive mechanisms, although the structural basis for these interactions is not fully determined (Tillander2013AcylCoA). Despite these insights, there is no specific information on ACOT9's physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in the context provided. The enzyme's role in mitochondrial metabolism and its regulation by metabolic state suggest it may participate in broader metabolic networks, but direct interactions remain to be elucidated (Tillander2013AcylCoA).
