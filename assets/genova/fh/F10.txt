# F10

## Overview
The F10 gene encodes coagulation factor X, a crucial serine protease in the blood coagulation cascade. This gene is responsible for producing a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in hemostasis by facilitating the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, a key step in clot formation. Factor X is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen, which is activated to factor Xa through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The active form, factor Xa, is integral to the prothrombinase complex, which catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, ultimately leading to fibrin clot formation. Beyond its role in coagulation, factor X is involved in cellular signaling pathways, influencing processes such as inflammation and vascular remodeling. Mutations in the F10 gene can result in factor X deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in both bleeding and thrombotic conditions (Ruf2003Specificity; Camire2021Blood; Spronk2003The).

## Structure
The F10 gene encodes coagulation factor X, a serine protease involved in the blood coagulation cascade. The primary structure of factor X consists of a polypeptide chain with 488 amino acids, synthesized as a pre-pro protein in the liver. The mature protein is composed of a light chain of 139 amino acids and a heavy chain of 306 amino acids, connected by a disulfide bond (Camire2021Blood; peyvandi2002gene).

The secondary structure includes specific domains such as the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, which contains 10 Gla residues essential for calcium binding, and two epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains in the light chain. The heavy chain contains a serine protease domain, homologous to chymotrypsin-like enzymes, with a catalytic triad of His 236, Asp 282, and Ser 379 (Camire2021Blood; peyvandi2002gene).

Post-translational modifications are crucial for factor X's function, including gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, which is necessary for its activity. The protein also undergoes glycosylation and other modifications during maturation (Camire2021Blood; Miao1992Liverspecific).

Factor X circulates in plasma as a two-chain protein, with the light and heavy chains linked by a disulfide bond, forming its quaternary structure (Sun2016A).

## Function
The F10 gene encodes coagulation factor X, a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the blood coagulation cascade. Factor X is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen. It is activated to factor Xa by both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation. In its active form, factor Xa is a serine protease that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of factor Va, calcium ions, and phospholipid surfaces, forming the prothrombinase complex (Camire2021Blood; Leytus1984Characterization; Spronk2003The).

Factor Xa's activity is crucial for the generation of thrombin, which subsequently converts fibrinogen to fibrin, leading to the formation of a stable blood clot. This process is essential for hemostasis, preventing excessive bleeding following vascular injury (Elvezia2020Rare; Spronk2003The). Factor X also plays a role in cellular signaling through its interaction with protease-activated receptors (PARs), particularly PAR-1 and PAR-2, which are involved in inflammation and vascular remodeling (Ruf2003Specificity). The regulation of factor X and its activation to factor Xa is vital for maintaining the balance between coagulation and anticoagulation in the body (Spronk2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F10 gene, which encodes coagulation factor X, lead to factor X deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. This condition is characterized by severe bleeding symptoms, including hemarthroses, muscle hematomas, and intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in neonates (Ferrarese2019Missense; Peyvandi2002Gene). The disorder is classified into type I and type II deficiencies. Type I involves parallel reductions in factor X coagulant activity (FX:C) and antigen levels (FX:Ag), while type II is marked by dysfunctional FX molecules with normal FX:Ag but low FX:C levels (Peyvandi2002Gene).

Over 100 mutations in the F10 gene have been identified, with a significant proportion being missense mutations affecting the N-terminal light chain or the C-terminal heavy chain of the protein (Hu2017Genome). These mutations can lead to severe bleeding disorders, necessitating frequent replacement therapy (Millar2000Molecular). The genetic diversity and complexity of FX deficiencies underscore the need for comprehensive genetic analysis in affected individuals (Karimi2008Phenotype).

Alterations in F10 expression or function can also contribute to thrombotic disorders, as the gene plays a critical role in the coagulation cascade (BROWN2008Diagnosis).

## Interactions
Coagulation factor X (F10) is a key component in the blood coagulation cascade, participating in several critical interactions. It is activated to factor Xa (FXa) by the intrinsic Xase complex, which includes factors VIIIa and IXa, and by the extrinsic Xase complex, composed of tissue factor (TF) and factor VIIa (FVIIa) (vanden2011novel). Once activated, FXa forms the prothrombinase complex with factor Va (FVa), anionic phospholipids, and calcium ions, which is essential for converting prothrombin to thrombin (Camire2021Blood; vanden2011novel).

FXa interacts with specific surface regions of the Xase and prothrombinase complexes, such as the acidic '34-40' loop and a cluster of negatively charged residues, which are involved in prothrombin activation (vanden2011novel). The Gla domain of FX is responsible for its membrane-binding properties, localizing the coagulation response to sites of vascular injury (vanden2011novel). FXa also interacts with antithrombin, particularly through the autolysis loop within its catalytic domain, which is crucial for inhibitor recognition (vanden2011novel).

In addition to its role in coagulation, FXa has been shown to have tumor evasive functions in the tumor microenvironment, where it is expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (Graf2019Myeloid). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of F10 in both hemostasis and pathological conditions.
