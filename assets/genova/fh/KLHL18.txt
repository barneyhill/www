# KLHL18

## Overview
KLHL18 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 18, which is part of the BTB-Kelch family known for its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. The KLHL18 protein functions primarily as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Ingham2021Inner). Structurally, KLHL18 contains a BTB domain, a BACK domain, and six kelch repeats, which enable it to interact with various substrates and participate in diverse cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Jiang2020KLHL18). The protein is notably involved in the modulation of photoreceptor function in the retina and has been implicated in auditory and visual dysfunctions when mutated (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18; Ingham2021Inner).

## Structure
KLHL18 is a protein that belongs to the kelch-like family and is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK domain, and six kelch repeats. The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the ubiquitination process, as it binds to cullin 3 (CUL3) to form a ubiquitin ligase complex (Jiang2020KLHL18; Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18). The kelch repeats form a beta-propeller structure, which is common in proteins that participate in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Jiang2020KLHL18).

KLHL18's role in ubiquitination is significant, as it targets specific proteins for degradation, such as Aurora-A and PI3Kp85α, influencing processes like mitotic entry and cancer cell proliferation (Jiang2020KLHL18; Ingham2021Inner). The protein's structure allows it to interact with multiple substrates, and its function can be modulated by post-translational modifications and splice variants, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Jiang2020KLHL18).

## Function
KLHL18 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. This protein is part of the BTB-Kelch family, which is known for its role in protein-protein interactions. KLHL18 facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, a process crucial for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ingham2021Inner).

In the context of retinal photoreceptor cells, KLHL18 is involved in modulating the translocation of rod transducin (Ta) during light-dark adaptation. It achieves this by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of Unc119, a protein that interacts with the transducin a-subunit. This process is essential for the proper localization of Ta, which is crucial for photoreceptor function and adaptation to changing light conditions (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18).

KLHL18 is predominantly expressed in the outer nuclear layer of the retina, where photoreceptor cells are located, and plays a significant role in rod photoreceptors, although it does not significantly affect cone photoreceptors (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm influences processes such as cell cycle regulation and response to oxidative stress (Ingham2021Inner).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL18 gene have been associated with specific auditory and visual dysfunctions. In mice, mutations in KLHL18 lead to inner hair cell dysfunction, resulting in progressive low-frequency hearing loss. This condition is characterized by abnormalities in the stereocilia of inner hair cells, particularly in the apical turn of the cochlea, and is inherited in a recessive manner (Ingham2021Inner). The KLHL18 lowf allele, a missense mutation, causes a Val55Phe amino acid change in the BTB domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, potentially disrupting its function and leading to hearing impairment (Lewis2021Collateral).

KLHL18 also plays a role in retinal photoreceptor function. In KLHL18-deficient mice, there is a decrease in light response in rod photoreceptor cells under scotopic conditions, although cone photoreceptor function remains unaffected. This deficiency is linked to the mislocalization of transducin in rod photoreceptors, which affects the light response and may contribute to photoreceptor damage (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18). Alterations in KLHL18 function could potentially impact conditions related to photoreceptor damage or dysfunction, such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18).

## Interactions
KLHL18 is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with cullin 3 (CUL3) to form a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, which is crucial for ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. This interaction is facilitated by the BTB domain of KLHL18, which is necessary for binding to CUL3 (Jiang2020KLHL18). KLHL18 also interacts with the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PI3Kp85α, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is mediated by the non-BTB domain of KLHL18 and is essential for its tumor-suppressing functions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Jiang2020KLHL18).

In the context of photoreceptor cells, KLHL18 interacts with Unc119, a lipid-binding protein, as part of the Cul3-Klhl18 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of Unc119, which is crucial for the proper localization of rod transducin during light-dark adaptation (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18). The interaction between KLHL18 and Unc119 is direct, involving the Kelch repeat domain of KLHL18, and is modulated by the phosphorylation state of Unc119 (Chaya2019Cul3‐Klhl18).
