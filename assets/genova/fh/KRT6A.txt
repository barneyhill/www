# KRT6A

## Overview
KRT6A is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 6A, a type II intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues. Keratin 6A plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin and its appendages. It is rapidly upregulated in response to skin injury, facilitating wound healing by modulating keratinocyte growth and migration. The protein's structural features, including its α-helical rod domain and ability to form heterodimers with type I keratins, are essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support to cells (Ho2022Update; Chamcheu2011Keratin). Mutations in the KRT6A gene are linked to pachyonychia congenita, a genetic disorder characterized by nail dystrophy and skin abnormalities, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Wilson2011A; McLean2011The).

## Structure
Keratin 6A (KRT6A) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central α-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The rod domain is organized into heptad repeats that facilitate the formation of coiled-coil motifs, essential for the protein's secondary structure (Ho2022Update; Chamcheu2011Keratin). 

The tertiary structure of KRT6A involves the assembly into intermediate filaments, which are critical for maintaining cell structure and integrity (Ho2022Update). In terms of quaternary structure, KRT6A forms heterodimers with type I keratins, which then align to form tetramers and eventually mature into keratin intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update; Chamcheu2011Keratin).

Post-translational modifications of KRT6A may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Wang2018Keratin). The gene also exhibits splice variants, leading to different isoforms that may have distinct functional properties (Ho2022Update). These structural features and modifications are vital for KRT6A's role in cellular organization and response to stress.

## Function
Keratin 6A (KRT6A) is a type II intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, KRT6A is primarily expressed in ectoderm-derived epithelial appendages, such as the skin and hair follicles, and is rapidly induced near wounds to replace the K1/K10 keratin pair during terminal differentiation. This suggests its significant role in modulating keratinocyte growth, migration, and the expression of inflammatory mediators, which are essential for wound repair and maintaining skin integrity (Wang2018Keratin).

KRT6A is involved in regulating keratinocyte migration by influencing cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. It interacts with and stabilizes myosin IIA, a protein crucial for focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. The absence of KRT6A leads to enhanced keratinocyte migration, associated with increased Src kinase activity and altered focal adhesion dynamics (Wang2018Keratin). KRT6A also plays a role in mitochondrial organization and function within skin keratinocytes, impacting mitochondrial dynamics, respiration, and redox homeostasis. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular energy production and minimizing oxidative stress (Steen2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT6A gene are primarily associated with pachyonychia congenita (PC), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. This condition is characterized by nail dystrophy, painful palmoplantar keratoderma, oral leukokeratosis, and epidermal cysts. KRT6A mutations lead to fragility in epithelial cells due to disruption of the keratin cytoskeleton, affecting the mechanical resilience of these cells (Wilson2011A; McLean2011The). 

The most common mutations in KRT6A are heterozygous missense mutations within the helix boundary motif regions, which are crucial for keratin filament formation. These mutations often result in a dominant-negative gain-of-function effect, similar to other keratinizing disorders (Wilson2011A). Specific mutations, such as the K6a p.N172del, have been identified in multiple families, and unusual mutations like a 1-bp insertion in exon 9 can cause frameshifts leading to premature stop codons (Wilson2011A).

Clinical manifestations of PC-K6a include thickened nails, plantar keratoderma, and oral leukokeratosis, often appearing within the first year of life. These symptoms significantly impact the quality of life, with plantar pain being particularly debilitating (Eliason2012A; Samuelov2020Revisiting).

## Interactions
Keratin 6A (KRT6A) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as migration and adhesion. KRT6A interacts with myosin IIA, a motor protein involved in cell migration and adhesion. This interaction stabilizes myosin IIA, which is crucial for focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. The absence of KRT6A leads to reduced levels of myosin IIA, affecting cell-cell adhesion and resulting in increased gaps between migrating keratinocytes (Wang2018Keratin).

KRT6A also interacts with desmoplakin (DP), a protein essential for cell-cell adhesion. The absence of KRT6A results in reduced DP levels, correlating with weakened cell-cell adhesion and increased keratinocyte migration. Overexpression of DP in KRT6A-null keratinocytes reduces their migration area, indicating that DP levels influence keratinocyte migration (Wang2018Keratin).

In the context of cancer, KRT6A is involved in the regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway through interactions with the MYC family members c-MYC/MYCN, which upregulate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This interaction promotes cell proliferation and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Che2021KRT6A).
