# FOXE3

## Overview
FOXE3 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box E3 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family, which is characterized by a conserved winged helix DNA-binding domain. This protein plays a pivotal role in ocular development, particularly in the formation and differentiation of the lens. The FOXE3 protein is essential for maintaining lens epithelial cells in a proliferative state and preventing their premature differentiation, thereby ensuring proper lens development and function (Blixt2000A; Plaisancié2018FOXE3). Mutations in the FOXE3 gene are linked to various ocular developmental disorders, including Peters anomaly, cataracts, and anterior segment anomalies, as well as non-ocular conditions such as thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (Reis2021Comprehensive; Kuang2016FOXE3). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in these conditions, highlighting the importance of FOXE3 in both eye development and broader physiological processes (Reis2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
The FOXE3 protein is a transcription factor that belongs to the forkhead family, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the winged helix DNA-binding domain (WHD). This domain typically consists of three α-helices, three β-strands, and two loops resembling wings, which facilitate DNA binding (Yaklichkin2007Prevalence). The FOXE3 protein is composed of 319 amino acids, with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) located in the N terminus, crucial for its import into the nucleus (Khan2016FOXE3).

The FOXE3 protein does not have detailed information available regarding its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures in the provided context. However, it is known that the WHD forms a helix-turn-helix motif, which is a common structural feature among forkhead proteins (Katoh2013Cancer). The presence of the engrailed homology-1 (eh1) motif, which mediates interactions with transcriptional corepressors of the TLE/Groucho family, is noted in many Fox proteins, although specific details for FOXE3 are not provided (Yaklichkin2007Prevalence). The protein's role in transcriptional regulation is linked to its ability to bind DNA and interact with other regulatory proteins, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the context.

## Function
The FOXE3 gene encodes a forkhead transcription factor that plays a critical role in eye development, particularly in the formation and differentiation of the lens. FOXE3 is specifically expressed during lens development in humans, where it is essential for maintaining lens cells in a proliferative state and preventing their premature differentiation into lens fiber cells (Plaisancié2018FOXE3). The protein contains a DNA-binding domain known as the forkhead domain, which allows it to regulate the expression of genes necessary for lens cell proliferation and survival (Plaisancié2018FOXE3).

FOXE3 acts as a downstream target of the master gene PAX6 and influences the expression of DNAJB1, which is crucial for the development and maintenance of lens transparency (Plaisancié2018FOXE3). In the cellular context, FOXE3 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate transcriptional activity, ensuring the proper expression of genes involved in lens development (Blixt2000A). The gene's function is vital for the closure of the lens vesicle and the proliferation of lens epithelial cells, which are necessary for normal lens formation and function (Blixt2000A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXE3 gene are associated with a variety of ocular developmental disorders. Recessive mutations often result in severe conditions such as corneal opacity, aphakia, and microphthalmia, although some cases may present with milder symptoms like isolated cataracts (Reis2021Comprehensive). Aniridia, iris hypoplasia, and optic nerve anomalies are also common in recessive cases (Reis2021Comprehensive). Dominant mutations in FOXE3 are typically linked to cataracts and anterior segment anomalies, but can also cause microphthalmia, aphakia, or sclerocornea, which are more typical of recessive disease (Reis2021Comprehensive).

In addition to ocular conditions, FOXE3 mutations have been implicated in thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAADs). Specific mutations within the forkhead DNA-binding domain of FOXE3 are pathogenic for familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, although these mutations do not typically result in eye abnormalities (Kuang2016FOXE3).

The clinical significance of FOXE3 mutations is underscored by their impact on protein stability and function. Recessive variants exhibit variable effects, while dominant alleles often show severe impairment and dominant-negative characteristics (Reis2021Comprehensive). These mutations disrupt normal FOXE3 functions, leading to the diverse phenotypes observed in affected individuals (Reis2021Comprehensive).

## Interactions
FOXE3 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in ocular development, particularly through its interactions with the DNAJB1 gene. FOXE3 directly binds to the promoter region of DNAJB1, specifically the 5' untranslated region (UTR), to regulate its transcriptional activity. This interaction was confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, which demonstrated FOXE3's binding to the DNAJB1 promoter (Khan2016FOXE3). The transcriptional regulation by FOXE3 is crucial for maintaining proper expression levels of DNAJB1, which is associated with Peters anomaly, a developmental disorder affecting the eye (Khan2016FOXE3).

Mutations in FOXE3, such as E103K, N117K, and C240*, result in reduced transcriptional activity at the DNAJB1 promoter, highlighting the importance of FOXE3's DNA-binding domain for its regulatory function (Khan2016FOXE3). Additionally, FOXE3 is part of a nucleoprotein complex with DNAJB1, indicating its involvement in a larger transcriptional regulatory network (Khan2016FOXE3). The presence of the engrailed homology-1 (eh1) motif in FOXE3 suggests potential interactions with TLE/Groucho corepressors, which are involved in transcriptional repression (Yaklichkin2007Prevalence).
