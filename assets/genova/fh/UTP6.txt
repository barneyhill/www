# UTP6

## Overview
UTP6 is a gene that encodes the UTP6 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to the biogenesis of ribosomes in eukaryotic cells. The UTP6 protein is a part of the UTPB subcomplex within the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is crucial for the early stages of assembling the 90S pre-ribosome, a precursor to the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) (Champion2008A; Zhang2016Integrative). Characterized by its half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat (HAT) domain, UTP6 plays a vital role in pre-rRNA processing and cell growth by mediating specific protein-protein interactions, particularly with Utp21 (Champion2008A). Mutations in the UTP6 gene can lead to defects in ribosome assembly and have been associated with various diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular health and function (Champion2008A; Champion2009A).

## Structure
The UTP6 protein is a component of the UTPB complex, which is involved in the assembly of eukaryotic small ribosomal subunits. The primary structure of UTP6 includes three HAT (half-a-tetratricopeptide) repeats located in its central region, spanning residues 86-196 in the ctUtp6 variant (Zhang2016Integrative). These HAT repeats are characterized by two antiparallel helices, A and B, and are known to form a superhelix or solenoid structure, which is a common feature of HAT domain structures (Champion2009A; Zhang2016Integrative).

The tertiary structure of UTP6 includes a deviant HAT domain (dHAT) that, despite lacking the conserved HAT sequence motif, folds into a HAT-like helical structure. This dHAT domain contributes to the overall superhelical structure of the protein (Zhang2016Integrative). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as Utp21, facilitated by the HAT domain, which is essential for the function of the SSU processome (Champion2008A).

Mutations in the HAT domain, such as G99E, can disrupt interactions with Utp21 and affect yeast growth, indicating the functional importance of this domain in protein-protein interactions (Champion2008A; Zhang2016Integrative).

## Function
The UTP6 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex involved in ribosome biogenesis. UTP6 is part of the UTPB subcomplex, which plays a vital role in the early stages of assembling the 90S pre-ribosome, a precursor to the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) (Champion2008A; Zhang2016Integrative). The UTP6 protein contains a half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat (HAT) domain, which is essential for efficient pre-rRNA processing and cell growth. This domain interacts specifically with a peptide in Utp21, a crucial interaction for the function of the SSU processome (Champion2008A).

In the nucleolus, UTP6 contributes to the maturation of pre-rRNA by ensuring proper cleavage at specific sites, which is necessary for the formation of 18S rRNA, a component of the small ribosomal subunit (Champion2008A; Zhang2016Integrative). Mutations in the HAT domain of UTP6 can lead to defects in pre-rRNA processing and growth, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal ribosome function and cellular health (Champion2008A; Champion2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UTP6 gene, which encodes a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome involved in ribosome biogenesis, have been linked to various diseases. Specifically, a subset of neurofibromatosis patients has been found to have a heterozygous deletion of HCA66, the human homolog of UTP6. This deletion may lead to haploinsufficiency and inefficient ribosome biogenesis, potentially contributing to the severity of the disease (Champion2008A).

Mutations in the HAT domain of Utp6, such as G99E, L114D, and W147A, have been shown to disrupt pre-rRNA processing and lead to growth defects in yeast models. These mutations affect the interaction between Utp6 and Utp21, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the SSU processome (Champion2008A). The G99E mutation, in particular, significantly reduces binding to a specific peptide in Utp21, highlighting its critical role in protein-protein interactions necessary for ribosome assembly (Champion2008A).

The clinical significance of UTP6 mutations is underscored by their potential impact on ribosome biogenesis, which is essential for proper cellular function. Disruptions in this process can lead to developmental abnormalities and may contribute to certain cancers (Champion2008A).

## Interactions
UTP6 is a component of the UTP B subcomplex within the small subunit processome, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis. UTP6 interacts directly with Utp18, forming a heterodimer that is essential for the assembly of a trimeric complex with Utp21. This trimeric complex, Utp21-Utp6-Utp18, can form independently of Pwp2, but Utp21 is necessary to recruit Pwp2 to the UTP B core complex. Utp6 does not show a stable interaction with Pwp2 in the absence of Utp21, highlighting the specificity of these protein-protein interactions (Pöll2014In).

The HAT domain of Utp6 is critical for its interaction with Utp21. Mutations in the HAT domain, such as G99E, disrupt the interaction with Utp21 but not with Utp18, indicating that the HAT domain mediates specific interactions necessary for the assembly and function of the SSU processome (Champion2008A). The interaction between Utp6 and Utp21 is essential for efficient pre-rRNA processing, with a specific peptide sequence in Utp21 required for binding to the Utp6 HAT domain (Champion2008A). These interactions are crucial for the assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome and the processing of pre-rRNA (Zhang2016Integrative).
