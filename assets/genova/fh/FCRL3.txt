# FCRL3

## Overview
FCRL3, or Fc receptor-like 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly within B cells. The protein, also referred to as Fc receptor-like 3, is part of the Fc receptor-like family and is characterized by its ability to modulate B-cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signaling pathways. This dual functionality is facilitated by the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) within its structure (Davis2007Fc; Kochi2009FCRL3). FCRL3 is primarily expressed on mature and memory B-cell subsets and plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis by influencing B-cell receptor signaling and plasma cell differentiation (Li2013FCRL3). Alterations in FCRL3 expression and function have been associated with various autoimmune diseases, underscoring its clinical significance in immune regulation (Lin2016FCRL3; Piotrowski2013The).

## Function
The FCRL3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of B-cell activity and immune responses. FCRL3 is part of the Fc receptor-like family and is primarily expressed on B cells, particularly on mature and memory B-cell subsets, including marginal zone, IgM-only, and double-negative populations (Li2013FCRL3). The protein contains both immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), allowing it to have dual signaling functions—both activating and inhibitory (Davis2007Fc; Kochi2009FCRL3).

FCRL3 modulates B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling by recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, which can inhibit signaling pathways, or kinases like Syk and Zap-70, which promote activation (Davis2007Fc). It enhances B-cell proliferation and survival in response to TLR9 stimulation but inhibits plasma cell differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion by augmenting ERK pathway activation, which suppresses BLIMP1, a key regulator of plasma cell differentiation (Li2013FCRL3). This regulatory role suggests that FCRL3 acts as a checkpoint in the transition from B cells to plasma cells, influencing immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Li2013FCRL3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FCRL3 gene have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases. The FCRL3 -169T>C polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly in Asian populations, where individuals with the CC genotype have a higher risk of developing RA (Swainson2010Expression; Lin2016FCRL3). This polymorphism is also linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune thyroid diseases, although associations can vary across different ethnic groups (Piotrowski2013The; CHEN2010Disease).

In IgA nephropathy (IgAN), certain FCRL3 polymorphisms, such as rs11264794, are associated with disease susceptibility and progression, with protective alleles linked to better clinical outcomes (Zhong2019Association). The gene's expression is also associated with regulatory T cell dysfunction, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (Zhong2019Association).

FCRL3 is involved in B cell regulation, and its altered expression can lead to increased production of autoantibodies, contributing to conditions like Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves' disease, and autoimmune infertility in women (Kochi2009FCRL3; Piotrowski2013The). These findings highlight the gene's role in modulating immune responses and its potential impact on autoimmune disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
FCRL3 (Fc receptor-like 3) is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a dual regulatory role in immune signaling pathways. It is known to be tyrosine phosphorylated and can associate with SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are protein tyrosine phosphatases, as well as with Syk and Zap-70, which are tyrosine kinases (Davis2007Fc; Li2013FCRL3). These interactions suggest that FCRL3 can engage in both activating and inhibitory signaling pathways due to the presence of ITAM-like and ITIM sequences in its cytoplasmic tail (Davis2007Fc).

Mutations at specific tyrosine sites in FCRL3 have shown that individual mutations to the two distal tyrosines result in a loss of SHP-1 interaction but maintain Zap-70 binding, indicating specific recruitment relationships (Davis2007Fc). FCRL3's ability to dock SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, as well as Syk and ZAP-70 kinases, supports its role in modulating downstream immune responses (Li2013FCRL3). These interactions are crucial for its function in immune regulation, particularly in B-cell responses and signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK (Li2013FCRL3).
