# IRX4

## Overview
IRX4, or Iroquois homeobox 4, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly within cardiac and retinal tissues. The IRX4 protein is categorized as a transcription factor, primarily functioning in the nucleus to influence the transcription of target genes. It plays a pivotal role in cardiac development by regulating ventricular-specific gene expression, which is essential for proper cardiac function and protection against various heart diseases. Additionally, IRX4 is implicated in neurogenesis within the retina, contributing to the formation of specific retinal cells. Beyond its developmental roles, IRX4 is also involved in various pathological conditions, including prostate cancer and congenital heart defects, where its expression and interaction with other proteins can significantly impact disease progression and patient outcomes (Ha2012IRX4; Vitharanage2024Role; Fernando2021Identification).

## Function
The IRX4 gene, also known as Iroquois homeobox protein 4, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the heart. In healthy human cells, IRX4 is predominantly expressed in the cardiac ventricles, where it regulates ventricular chamber-specific gene expression. It activates the ventricular myosin heavy chain-1 (VMHC1) gene and suppresses the atrial myosin heavy chain-1 (AMHC1) gene, supporting cardiac contractile function and providing protection against cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and congenital heart disease (Vitharanage2024Role; Fernando2021Identification).

IRX4 is also involved in neurogenesis in the retina, where it regulates the expression of Slit1, contributing to the formation of retinal ganglion cells and cones in the photoreceptor cell layer (Vitharanage2024Role). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to influence the transcription of target genes, impacting cell fate and tissue patterning (Fernando2021Identification). The gene's expression and function are crucial for maintaining normal physiological processes, particularly in cardiac and retinal tissues (Fernando2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IRX4 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, IRX4 is implicated as both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter, depending on the isoform expressed. The gene is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues compared to normal prostate tissues, and its expression is linked to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Specific polymorphisms, such as an insertion-deletion (INDEL) upstream of IRX4, affect its expression and are associated with prostate cancer risk and prognosis, particularly in the context of androgen deprivation therapy (Batra2023Unravelling; Vitharanage2024Role).

In congenital heart disease, particularly ventricular septal defects, two novel mutations in IRX4, p. Asn85Tyr and p. Glu92Gly, have been identified. These mutations disrupt the interaction between IRX4 and RXRA, a protein involved in cardiac gene regulation, potentially affecting cardiac morphogenesis (Cheng2011Two).

IRX4 is also involved in other cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with cancer progression and patient survival. In pancreatic cancer, hypermethylation of the IRX4 promoter region leads to downregulation of its expression, contributing to tumorigenesis (Vitharanage2024Role; Fernando2021Identification).

## Interactions
IRX4, a transcription factor, is known to interact with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in prostate cancer cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where Myc-tagged VDR was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged IRX4, indicating a physical interaction between these proteins. However, IRX4 does not interact with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in these cells (Ha2012IRX4). The interaction between IRX4 and VDR is significant in their reciprocal transcriptional regulation, where IRX4 regulates VDR expression and vice versa. Knocking down IRX4 in LNCaP cells reduces VDR mRNA levels, while overexpression of VDR suppresses IRX4 expression, suggesting a feedback loop in their transcriptional regulation (Ha2012IRX4).

In the context of retinal development, IRX4 regulates the expression of the Slit1 gene, which is crucial for axonal pathfinding. Although the study did not directly address physical interactions of the IRX4 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids, it implies a regulatory mechanism at the gene expression level, suggesting that IRX4 may act indirectly through another transcription repressor (Jin2003Irx4mediated).
