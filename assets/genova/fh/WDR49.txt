# WDR49

## Overview
WDR49 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 49 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the WD repeat domain 49 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its ability to form multi-protein complexes. The specific functions of WDR49 and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, but proteins with WD repeat domains are often implicated in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. The gene and its protein product are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
