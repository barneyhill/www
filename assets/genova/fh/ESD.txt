# ESD

## Overview
Esterase D (ESD) is a gene that encodes the enzyme esterase D, a cytoplasmic hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of ester bonds. This enzyme plays a significant role in detoxification processes and various metabolic pathways, particularly in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. ESD is ubiquitously expressed across multiple human tissues, including red blood cells, liver, and brain, and is characterized by its specificity for methylumbelliferyl esters. The gene is genetically polymorphic, with its locus located on chromosome band 13q14, making it a valuable genetic marker for conditions such as retinoblastoma and Wilson's disease. The enzyme's interaction with FK506 binding protein 25 (FKBP25) and its involvement in modulating mTORC1 activity further underscore its biological significance. Additionally, mutations and altered expression of the ESD gene have been implicated in various medical conditions, including cancer and Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its importance in genetic studies (Sparkes1980Regional; Yang2021Esterase; Kluska2018Whole‐exome; HOPKINSON1973Esterase).

## Function
Esterase D (ESD) is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of ester bonds, playing a role in detoxification processes and metabolic pathways. It is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. ESD is also used as a genetic marker for retinoblastoma and Wilson's disease.

Esterase D (ESD) is an enzyme that is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, including red blood cells, leucocytes, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, brain, gonad, intestine, and skeletal muscle, as well as in cultured human fibroblasts and lymphocytoid cells (HOPKINSON1973Esterase). The enzyme is characterized by its specificity for methylumbelliferyl esters as substrates and its distinct electrophoretic mobility, which differentiates it from other esterases (Sparkes1980Regional). ESD is genetically polymorphic, with three common phenotypes determined by the codominant expression of two alleles, EsD 1 and EsD 2 (Sparkes1979Evidence).

The biological function of ESD in healthy human cells remains largely unknown, although its presence in multiple tissues and stability under various conditions suggest a fundamental role in cellular processes (HOPKINSON1973Esterase). The enzyme's activity is used as a marker for genetic studies related to retinoblastoma, as its locus is located at chromosome band 13q14, which is associated with a predisposition to this disease (Sparkes1980Regional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ESD gene have been implicated in various medical conditions. In the context of Wilson's disease (WD), rare allelic variants in the ESD gene have been found to significantly increase the likelihood of a neurological phenotype. This association is likely due to the gene's proximity to ATP7B, the primary gene involved in WD, suggesting that ESD may act as a modifier gene influencing the disease phenotype (Kluska2018Whole‐exome).

ESD has also been linked to cancer, where its expression levels may serve as a biomarker. Changes in ESD expression have been observed in certain cancer types, although the specific mechanisms and implications of these changes require further investigation (Kluska2018Whole‐exome).

Additionally, ESD is associated with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by ichthyosis, neurological symptoms, and intellectual disability. The role of ESD in this condition is not fully understood, but it is believed that mutations affecting the enzyme's function contribute to the syndrome's pathogenesis (Kluska2018Whole‐exome). The complexity of ESD's interactions and its involvement in these conditions highlight the need for comprehensive genetic and environmental analyses to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
Esterase D (ESD) is known to interact with FK506 binding protein 25 (FKBP25), a member of the immunophilin family with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid assay and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence in HeLa cells. The interaction is mediated by the N-terminus domain (1-90 amino acids) of FKBP25. The activity of ESD, particularly the Lys213 residue, is crucial for this interaction, as a mutant ESD-K213A showed significantly reduced interaction with FKBP25 compared to the wild type (Yang2021Esterase).

ESD stabilizes cytoplasmic FKBP25 by reducing its K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, promoting FKBP25 to bind more mTORC1, thereby suppressing mTORC1 activity and inhibiting tumor cell growth through autophagy. This interaction is enhanced by the ESD activator FPD5, which promotes the interaction between ESD and FKBP25 (Yang2021Esterase). The interaction between FKBP25 and mTORC1 is crucial for the suppression of mTORC1 activity, as knockdown of FKBP25 abolishes the effect of FPD5 on mTORC1 activity (Yang2021Esterase). There is no evidence of ESD interacting directly with nucleic acids (Yang2021Esterase).
