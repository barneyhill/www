# MITD1

## Overview
The MITD1 gene encodes the microtubule interacting and trafficking domain containing 1 protein, which is integral to the process of cytokinesis, particularly during the abscission phase. This protein is characterized by its microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain, which facilitates interactions with components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-III), playing a critical role in stabilizing the intercellular bridge during cell division (Wenzel2022Comprehensive; Lee2012MITD1). The MITD1 protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes beyond cytokinesis, including endosomal sorting, due to its ability to bind multiple ESCRT-III components with high promiscuity (Stoten2018ESCRTdependent). Clinically, alterations in MITD1 expression have been associated with various cancers, where it may act as a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the cancer type, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy (Chen2021Prognostic; Dong2022Pan-Cancer).

## Structure
The MITD1 protein is a 249-amino acid protein characterized by an N-terminal MIT domain, which is crucial for its interaction with ESCRT-III proteins and its recruitment to the midbody during cytokinesis (Lee2012MITD1). The MIT domain interacts with the MIM domains of ESCRT-III subunits such as CHMP1B, CHMP2A, and IST1, facilitating its role in cellular processes (Lee2012MITD1). The protein also dimerizes through its C-terminal domain, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its function (Lee2012MITD1).

MITD1's interaction with ESCRT-III proteins is mediated by specific structural interfaces, and mutations in the MIT domain can disrupt these interactions, highlighting the importance of certain residues (Lee2012MITD1). The protein's ability to self-assemble is supported by residues 88-123, which are necessary for its oligomerization (Lee2012MITD1). While the primary structure and specific post-translational modifications are not detailed, the protein's role in cytokinesis and its interactions suggest a complex structural organization that supports its function in cell division (Lee2012MITD1). The MIT domain's interaction with ESCRT-III proteins is similar to that of VPS4 with CHMP2/Vps2, suggesting a conserved mechanism (Lee2012MITD1).

## Function
The MITD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis, particularly during the abscission phase, which is the final step of cell division where the intercellular bridge is severed to separate daughter cells. MITD1 is recruited to the midbody by the ESCRT-III complex, where it stabilizes the intercellular bridge, preventing abscission failure and ensuring proper cell division (Stoten2018ESCRTdependent; Wenzel2022Comprehensive). The protein contains a microtubule interacting and trafficking domain, which allows it to interact with several ESCRT-III components, including CHMP1A, CHMP1B, CHMP2A, and IST1, facilitating its role as an ESCRT-III-membrane tether (Stoten2018ESCRTdependent).

MITD1's interactions with ESCRT-III components are characterized by binding promiscuity, which is essential for its function in stabilizing the midbody bridge and promoting proper cytokinetic abscission (Wenzel2022Comprehensive). The protein's ability to bind membranes is crucial for its role in abscission, and it is involved in the recruitment of cofactors necessary for the maturation of ESCRT-III filaments during cell division (Wenzel2022Comprehensive). These interactions and functions highlight MITD1's importance in maintaining cellular integrity during division.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MITD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer (BRCA), MITD1 expression is generally lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Dong2022Pan-Cancer). In contrast, high MITD1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where it correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes (Chen2021Prognostic).

In colorectal cancer (CC), MITD1 is overexpressed, and its knockdown leads to reduced cell viability and increased ferroptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2023Serine). MITD1 also plays a role in bladder cancer, where its downregulation in metastatic tumors suggests it may inhibit metastasis (Chen2020Evaluating).

MITD1 expression is linked to immune cell infiltration in several cancers, including KIRC, where it is associated with CD8+ T cell abundance, highlighting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Chen2021Prognostic). These findings suggest that MITD1 could serve as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
MITD1 is known to interact with various proteins, particularly those involved in the ESCRT-III complex, which plays a crucial role in cytokinesis and endosomal sorting. MITD1 exhibits broad binding promiscuity with ESCRT-III components, including CHMP1A, CHMP1B, CHMP2A, CHMP3, CHMP4A, CHMP4B, CHMP6, and IST1. These interactions are facilitated by the MIT domain of MITD1, which binds to the MIM elements of these ESCRT-III proteins. The binding of MITD1 to CHMP1A has been structurally characterized, revealing the use of the H1/H3 groove for interaction (Wenzel2022Comprehensive).

MITD1's interaction with ESCRT-III proteins is essential for stabilizing the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis, preventing abscission failure. This stabilization is crucial for proper cell division and is indicative of MITD1's role in maintaining cellular integrity during division (Wenzel2022Comprehensive).

In addition to its interactions with ESCRT-III proteins, MITD1 is involved in a network of protein interactions identified through experimental evidence and text mining. This network includes 41 proteins that bind to MITD1, forming a connected network as illustrated using the STRING tool (Dong2022Pan-Cancer). These interactions suggest a broader role for MITD1 in cellular processes beyond cytokinesis.
