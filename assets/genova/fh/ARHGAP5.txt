# ARHGAP5

## Overview
ARHGAP5, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 5, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, which are critical for various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, and migration. The protein encoded by ARHGAP5, p190RhoGAP-B, functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), facilitating the inactivation of Rho GTPases by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. This regulatory activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling pathways (mccormack2013regulation; Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). ARHGAP5 is highly expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in neuroepithelial development and mammary gland morphogenesis (mccormack2013regulation). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, underscore its importance in modulating cell morphology and motility (O’Brien2008Expression). Additionally, ARHGAP5 has been implicated in cancer progression, where its altered expression can contribute to tumor metastasis and serve as a potential prognostic biomarker (Dong2018SIRT1; Tian2020Investigation).

## Structure
The ARHGAP5 gene encodes the p190RhoGAP-B protein, which is characterized by a complex domain organization. The protein includes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding domain (GBD) at the N-terminus, four FF domains, two pseudoGTPase domains (pG1 and pG2), a protrusion localization sequence (PLS), a polybasic region (PBR), and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain at the C-terminus (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). The GBD is a class (ii) pseudo-GTPase domain that binds GTP/Mg2+ but lacks intrinsic catalytic activity, serving primarily in protein-protein interactions (Stiegler2018The). The FF domains are unique to cytoplasmic proteins and interact with proteins like TFII-I and eIF3A, with their activity regulated by phosphorylation (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

The middle domain contains the pseudoGTPase domains pG1 and pG2, which do not bind nucleotides, and the PLS, which is crucial for the protein's localization and regulation (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). The GAP domain at the C-terminus is responsible for the catalytic function, primarily targeting RhoA (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). The protein's structure is stabilized by GTP binding, with mutations in GTP-binding residues often leading to insoluble proteins, highlighting the importance of GTP for structural integrity (Stiegler2018The).

## Function
ARHGAP5, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 5, plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, migration, and cytokinesis. ARHGAP5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which inactivates Rho GTPases by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, effectively switching off the GTPase activity (mccormack2013regulation; Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

In healthy human cells, ARHGAP5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the organization of actin filaments and cell morphology. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell signaling pathways (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). ARHGAP5 is highly expressed in the nervous system and plays a role in the organization of actin in the developing neuroepithelium, as well as in the regulation of mammary gland morphogenesis (mccormack2013regulation).

The protein is also involved in the inactivation of RhoA, RAC, and CDC42, which are critical for controlling cell morphology and motility (O’Brien2008Expression). Through these activities, ARHGAP5 contributes to the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, which are vital for normal cellular function and development (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARHGAP5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ARHGAP5 is overexpressed and associated with disease progression. This overexpression is linked to the downregulation of miR-486-5p, a microRNA that normally suppresses ARHGAP5 expression by binding to its 3′-untranslated region (Wang2013Downregulation). In gastric cancer, ARHGAP5 acts as an oncogene, with its elevated levels correlating with larger tumor size, deeper infiltration, and worse overall survival. It is identified as an independent predictor of survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Dong2018SIRT1).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ARHGAP5 is significantly overexpressed in metastatic tissues, promoting metastasis by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and negatively regulating RhoA activity. Its expression is upregulated by the transcription factor CREB1 and stabilized by decreased levels of miR-137, contributing to CRC progression (Tian2020Investigation). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, ARHGAP5 is a target of miR-744, and its overexpression is associated with advanced clinical stages and lymph node metastasis (Fang2015MiR744). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ARHGAP5 in cancer biology.

## Interactions
ARHGAP5, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 5, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in cellular processes. It is known to interact with RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, modulating their activity and affecting cell morphology and motility (O’Brien2008Expression). The protein contains several domains that facilitate interactions, including a GTP-binding domain and FF domains, which interact with proteins such as the transcription factor TFII-I and the translation preinitiation factor eIF3A. These interactions are regulated by phosphorylation (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

In gastric cancer, ARHGAP5 expression is regulated by SIRT1 through its interaction with the transcription factor c-JUN. SIRT1 deacetylates c-JUN, inhibiting its transcriptional activity and leading to the downregulation of ARHGAP5 (Dong2018SIRT1). This interaction is crucial for suppressing gastric cancer cell migration and invasion (Dong2018SIRT1).

ARHGAP5 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer by negatively regulating RhoA activity. This regulation affects the expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin, which are critical for cell adhesion and migration (Tian2020Investigation). These interactions highlight the role of ARHGAP5 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
