# GOLGA8J

## Overview
GOLGA8J is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member J, which is part of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. These proteins play a critical role in maintaining the structure of the Golgi and facilitating vesicle tethering, essential for proper intracellular protein trafficking. The GOLGA8J gene is located on chromosome 15 and is part of a subfamily that has expanded in humans through segmental duplications, suggesting its involvement in fundamental cellular processes (Bekpen2019Human). Although the specific functions of the golgin A8 family member J protein in healthy human cells are not fully understood, it is predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasm, similar to other golgin proteins (Bekpen2019Human). The gene is expressed at low levels across various tissues, with the highest expression in the testis, and its expression has been linked to genomic instability and potential clinical implications, particularly in cancer (Bekpen2019Human; Sadeque2012Identification).

## Function
The GOLGA8J gene is part of the golgin family, which encodes coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. These proteins are involved in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating vesicle tethering, which is crucial for proper protein trafficking within the cell. Although the specific function of GOLGA8J in healthy human cells is not well-defined, it is predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane, and cytoplasm due to its similarity to GM130 (GOLGA2) (Bekpen2019Human). The GOLGA8 subfamily, which includes GOLGA8J, has expanded in humans through segmental duplications along chromosome 15, suggesting a role in basic cellular functions and potential pleiotropic effects (Bekpen2019Human).

GOLGA8J is ubiquitously expressed at low levels across human tissues, with the highest expression observed in the testis (Bekpen2019Human). The integration of repetitive transposable elements and unrelated promoters during the duplication process has broadened its expression to more tissues, although the functional consequences of this expression remain largely unexplored (Bekpen2019Human). Despite its involvement in genomic instability and potential links to various disorders, the specific molecular activities of GOLGA8J in healthy cells require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
GOLGA8J, a member of the golgin family, has been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Higher expression levels of GOLGA8J have been linked to lower survival rates in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting a potential negative impact on GBM prognosis (Sadeque2012Identification). This association indicates that GOLGA8J may play a role in tumor progression or resistance to treatment in GBM.

While specific mutations in GOLGA8J have not been extensively documented, the gene is part of the broader GOLGA family, which is known for its involvement in genomic instability. The GOLGA8 core duplicons, related to GOLGA8J, are implicated in promoting genomic instability and structural rearrangements, particularly in the 15q13.3 region of chromosome 15. These rearrangements are associated with various syndromes and microdeletions, such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes and 15q24 microdeletions, although direct involvement of GOLGA8J in these conditions is not explicitly detailed (Antonacci2014Palindromic).

Overall, alterations in GOLGA8J expression and its potential role in genomic instability highlight its clinical significance, particularly in cancer and possibly in other genetic disorders linked to the GOLGA family.
