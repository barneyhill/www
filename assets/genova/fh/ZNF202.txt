# ZNF202

## Overview
ZNF202 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 202, a transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and its Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) and SCAN domains, which are crucial for transcriptional repression and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Schmitz2004Zinc; Langmann2003ZNF202). ZNF202 plays a significant role in modulating the expression of genes associated with cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, such as ATP binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1), thereby influencing cholesterol transport and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (PorschÖzcürümez2001The; Langmann2003ZNF202). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, and testis, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins (Monaco1998Molecular; Wagner2000A). Variations in ZNF202 have been linked to lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Razzaghi2012PopulationBased; Vrins2013Znf202).

## Structure
The ZNF202 gene encodes a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly in lipid metabolism. The protein consists of 648 amino acids and features several distinct domains, including a SCAN oligomerization domain, a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) repression domain, and eight C2-H2 zinc finger motifs (Schmitz2004Zinc; Langmann2003ZNF202). The SCAN domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the KRAB domain is responsible for transcriptional repression, requiring the corepressor KRAB-associated protein-1 (KAP-1) for its function (Schmitz2004Zinc). The zinc finger motifs facilitate DNA binding, allowing ZNF202 to act as a transcriptional repressor by binding to specific DNA sequences, such as the consensus sequence GnT (5'-GGGGT-3') (Schmitz2004Zinc).

ZNF202 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in at least two isoforms: ZNF202m1 and ZNF202m3. The m1 isoform encodes the full-length protein, while the m3 isoform is shorter, consisting only of the SCAN domain (Schmitz2004Zinc; Langmann2003ZNF202). The protein also contains multiple CK2 and PKC phosphorylation sites, suggesting that its activity may be regulated by phosphorylation (Monaco1998Molecular).

## Function
ZNF202 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, including ATP binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1), which are key regulators of cellular lipid efflux and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (Schmitz2004Zinc; PorschÖzcürümez2001The; Langmann2003ZNF202). ZNF202 represses the expression of these genes by binding to specific promoter sequences, thereby modulating cholesterol transport and HDL homeostasis (PorschÖzcürümez2001The; Wagner2000A).

The protein contains several conserved domains, including eight C2H2 zinc finger motifs, a Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, and a SCAN motif, which facilitate its function as a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator (Wagner2000A). The KRAB domain mediates transcriptional repression by recruiting corepressors like KAP-1, while the SCAN domain is involved in protein interactions that influence ZNF202's regulatory activities (Schmitz2004Zinc; PorschÖzcürümez2001The).

ZNF202 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the heart, lung, liver, and testis, and is active in the nucleus where it modulates gene expression related to lipid homeostasis (Schmitz2004Zinc; Wagner2000A). Its regulatory functions are critical for maintaining cholesterol balance and preventing foam cell formation, which is essential for cardiovascular health (Langmann2003ZNF202).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF202 is implicated in several lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular conditions due to its role as a transcriptional repressor. Alterations in ZNF202 expression have been linked to hypoalphalipoproteinemia, a condition characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (Vrins2013Znf202; PorschÖzcürümez2001The). Overexpression of ZNF202 has been shown to lead to hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypotriglyceridemia in hyperlipidemic mice, suggesting its significant impact on lipid homeostasis (Vrins2013Znf202).

Genetic studies have identified several variants in the ZNF202 gene, such as A154V and K259E, which are associated with ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction, particularly in women (Razzaghi2012PopulationBased). A promoter SNP, -660A/G, has been linked to severe atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease risk, reducing ZNF202 expression by 60% in homozygous individuals (Razzaghi2012PopulationBased). Despite these associations, some studies have not found a direct correlation between ZNF202 genetic variations and HDL cholesterol levels in the general population, indicating the complexity of its role in lipid metabolism (Stene2006Zinc).

## Interactions
ZNF202 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression. It binds to specific DNA motifs within the promoters of target genes, such as ABCA1 and ABCG1, using its zinc finger motifs to exert its repressive function (PorschÖzcürümez2001The). The protein contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which recruits the corepressor KAP1, facilitating transcriptional repression by preventing promoter activation (Schmitz2004Zinc; PorschÖzcürümez2001The).

ZNF202 also contains a SCAN domain, which allows it to oligomerize and interact with other SCAN domain-containing proteins, such as ZNF191 and SDP1. These interactions can modulate its DNA binding and transcriptional repression capabilities (Schmitz2004Zinc; PorschÖzcürümez2001The). SDP1, in particular, can disrupt the ZNF202-KAP1 interaction, thereby abolishing its repressive function (Schmitz2004Zinc).

In addition to protein-protein interactions, ZNF202's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as PU.1, which binds to the Ets motif in the ZNF202 promoter, influencing its expression in monocytic cells (Langmann2003ZNF202). These interactions highlight ZNF202's role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.
