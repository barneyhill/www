# ACAA2

## Overview
ACAA2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2, which is a key player in the β-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in catalyzing the conversion of acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, a critical step for energy production in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the liver and muscle (Wu2022ACAA2). Beyond its metabolic functions, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation, as well as transcriptional regulation through interactions with histone variants and transcription start sites (Choi2019Oxoglutarate; Yang2018MiR152). The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, with alterations linked to conditions such as renal cell carcinoma and dairy traits in livestock (Li2023Metabolic; Miltiadou2017Variants).

## Structure


## Function
ACAA2 (acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the final step of the β-oxidation pathway. This process involves the conversion of acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, which is essential for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the liver and muscle (Wu2022ACAA2). ACAA2 is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility in healthy cells.

In addition to its metabolic functions, ACAA2 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation. It interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein BNIP3, counteracting apoptosis and promoting cell survival (Yang2018MiR152). ACAA2 also plays a role in the regulation of triglyceride production, where its overexpression can inhibit triglyceride synthesis and induce apoptosis (Yang2018MiR152).

ACAA2 is also implicated in transcriptional regulation. It associates with transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes bound by the histone variant H2A.Z, suggesting a role in histone modifications and transcriptional control (Choi2019Oxoglutarate). This association indicates that ACAA2 may influence gene expression by providing acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation, linking metabolic processes to epigenetic regulation (Yang2021Histone).

## Clinical Significance
The ACAA2 gene, encoding the enzyme acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2, plays a significant role in fatty acid metabolism. Alterations in its expression have been linked to various conditions. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ACAA2 expression is notably lower in tumor samples compared to normal kidney tissues, suggesting a potential anti-tumor role. Overexpression of ACAA2 in RCC cells has been shown to inhibit growth and increase tumor immune infiltration, particularly of CD8+ T cells, indicating its potential as an immunotherapeutic target (Li2023Metabolic).

In sheep, a polymorphism in the 3′ untranslated region of the ACAA2 gene is associated with dairy traits, affecting milk yield and protein percentage. The T allele of the g.2982T > C SNP is linked to increased expression of the gene, particularly in the udder, suggesting a regulatory role that could influence energy metabolism during lactation (Miltiadou2017Variants). While these findings highlight the gene's impact on metabolic processes, the clinical significance of ACAA2 gene mutations in humans, particularly in terms of diseases or conditions, is not directly addressed in the available literature (NsiahSefaa2016Combined).

## Interactions
ACAA2, also known as acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in metabolic pathways. ACAA2 interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRb1) in cardiac tissue, forming a complex that acts as a thyroid hormone-dependent coactivator. This interaction is direct and occurs through multiple sites on TRb1, particularly between amino acids 420 and 461. ACAA2 enhances the transactivation activity of TRb1 without affecting its binding to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) (Wang2021ACAA2).

ACAA2 also associates with transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes in the heart, particularly those bound by the histone variant H2A.Z. This association is selective and involves higher levels of transcriptional activity markers such as RNA polymerase II and CDK9. ACAA2's binding to TSSs overlaps with other factors like H2A.Z, OGDH, and TFIIB, suggesting a complex interaction network at these sites (Choi2019Oxoglutarate).

In the context of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, ACAA2 interacts with SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase. HCMV infection disrupts this interaction, leading to increased acetylation of ACAA2, which plays a role in regulating mitochondrial integrity and metabolism (Sheng2021The).
