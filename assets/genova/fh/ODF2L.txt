# ODF2L

## Overview
ODF2L, or outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2 like, is a gene that encodes a protein primarily involved in the structural composition of sperm tails. The protein, categorized as a structural component, plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of the outer dense fibers within the flagellum of sperm cells, which are essential for sperm motility and male fertility. Beyond its reproductive functions, ODF2L has been implicated in various biological processes, including neurobehavioral responses to sleep deprivation and gene expression regulation influenced by specific genetic variants (Uyhelji2018Exploring; He2017Identification). The gene's involvement in cryptic splicing events associated with neurological conditions further underscores its potential significance in disease mechanisms (Udine2024Abundant).

## Structure


## Function
ODF2L, or outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of sperm tails. The protein is primarily active in the flagellum of sperm cells, where it contributes to the formation and stabilization of the outer dense fibers. These fibers are crucial for sperm motility, providing the necessary structural support for the flagellum to function effectively during movement. This role is essential for the proper motility of sperm, which is a critical factor in male fertility, as it enables sperm to swim and fertilize an egg.

In addition to its role in sperm cells, ODF2L has been identified as a gene of interest in studies exploring gene expression changes under various conditions. For instance, it was noted as one of the up-regulated transcript clusters in response to total sleep deprivation, suggesting a potential role in neurobehavioral processes (Uyhelji2018Exploring). The gene's expression and regulation may be influenced by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as indicated by its association with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (He2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The ODF2L gene has been implicated in various transcriptomic alterations, particularly in the context of neurological conditions associated with the C9orf72 repeat expansion. In patients with this expansion, ODF2L exhibits cryptic splicing events, which are of interest due to their dysregulation in the ALS/FTLD disease spectrum (Udine2024Abundant). These cryptic splicing events have been validated through cDNA sequencing, confirming their presence in affected individuals. Although the study does not specifically address the clinical significance of ODF2L mutations, the splicing alterations suggest a potential role in the pathology of C9orf72-related conditions (Udine2024Abundant).

Additionally, research has identified a correlation between ODF2L mRNA expression and the transcription factor POU2F1, indicating that ODF2L could be a target gene of POU2F1. A specific SNP, rs12072450, may exert a trans-effect on ODF2L through its cis-regulation on POU2F1, suggesting a complex regulatory network that could influence ODF2L expression and function (He2017Identification). While the clinical implications of these findings are not fully understood, they highlight the importance of ODF2L in gene expression regulation and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
