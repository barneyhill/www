# MAGOH

## Overview
MAGOH is a gene that encodes the mago homolog, exon junction complex subunit, a critical component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. The protein encoded by MAGOH is characterized by its RNA-binding domain and its ability to form a stable heterodimer with RBM8A, another EJC component, which is essential for the complex's stability and function (Rehman2021The; Shi2003Crystal). The mago homolog protein plays a pivotal role in mRNA splicing, export, translation, and degradation, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that prevents the accumulation of faulty mRNA transcripts (Woodward2016The; Boehm2016Exon). MAGOH is also implicated in neurodevelopment and cancer, with its expression levels influencing cell cycle regulation, neural progenitor differentiation, and tumor progression (Xiao2023MAGOH; Asthana2022The).

## Structure
MAGOH is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which plays a crucial role in mRNA splicing and transport. The primary structure of MAGOH includes a conserved RNA-binding domain, which is essential for its function within the EJC (Rehman2021The). The secondary structure of MAGOH consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and interaction capabilities (Shi2003Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, MAGOH forms a stable heterodimer with RBM8A, another EJC component. This interaction is characterized by extensive protein-protein contacts, including hydrophobic, van der Waals, and charge interactions, which stabilize the complex (Shi2003Crystal). The quaternary structure of MAGOH within the EJC involves its association with other proteins such as eIF4AIII and Y14, forming a tetrameric complex that is crucial for the EJC's function in mRNA processing (Andersen2006Structure).

MAGOH undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. The principal isoform is 146 amino acids long, while an alternate isoform is 109 amino acids, differing in 37 residues. These isoforms suggest an evolutionarily conserved function across vertebrates (Rehman2021The). Common post-translational modifications of MAGOH include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions within the EJC.

## Function
MAGOH is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. It is involved in mRNA splicing, export, translation, and degradation processes. MAGOH forms a stable heterodimer with RBM8A, which is essential for the stability and function of the EJC on mRNA transcripts (Boehm2016Exon). This complex is assembled at exon-exon junctions during splicing and is critical for efficient mRNA metabolism, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons (Woodward2016The; Boehm2016Exon).

MAGOH is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression by influencing the temporal order of splicing and alternative splicing products (Asthana2022The). It also plays a role in maintaining proper cell cycle function, as its depletion can lead to defects in microtubule organization and spindle orientation (Woodward2016The). In humans, MAGOH is particularly important for neurodevelopment, as evidenced by its involvement in cortical development and the regulation of neural progenitor differentiation (Woodward2016The; Asthana2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MAGOH gene, a component of the exon junction complex (EJC), have significant clinical implications. MAGOH is crucial for neurodevelopment, and its haploinsufficiency is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as microcephaly. This condition is associated with disrupted embryonic neurogenesis and is mediated through the p53 signaling pathway, leading to increased apoptosis and altered neuron distribution (Mao2016Haploinsufficiency). In mouse models, haploinsufficiency of MAGOH results in aberrant splicing and mRNA degradation, contributing to early brain development defects (Mao2016Haploinsufficiency).

In cancer, MAGOH expression is implicated in tumor progression. In lower-grade glioma (LGG), high MAGOH expression correlates with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and increased tumor mutation burden. It also affects immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint protein expression, suggesting a role in tumor immunity (Xiao2023MAGOH). In gastric cancer, MAGOH is upregulated and associated with advanced tumor stages and lymphatic metastasis, promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Yu2024MAGOH). These findings highlight MAGOH as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in various cancers.

## Interactions
MAGOH is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which plays a crucial role in mRNA splicing, transport, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Within the EJC, MAGOH interacts with other core proteins, including RBM8A (also known as Y14), eIF4AIII, and CASC3 (MLN51), forming a stable complex that is deposited on mRNA during splicing (Blazquez2018Exon). This complex is essential for the regulation of mRNA splicing and the repression of recursive splicing (RS), as it stabilizes eIF4A3 binding to RNA and prevents the inclusion of cryptic microexons (Blazquez2018Exon).

MAGOH also participates in the regulation of nonsense-mediated decay, a process that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful truncated proteins (Soederberg2022MAGOH). The interaction of MAGOH with other EJC components is vital for its role in NMD, as knockdown of MAGOH leads to decreased NMD activity and increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins like GADD45A, which is regulated by NMD (Soederberg2022MAGOH). These interactions highlight MAGOH's importance in post-transcriptional gene regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
