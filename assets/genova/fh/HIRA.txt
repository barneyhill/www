# HIRA

## Overview
The HIRA gene encodes a histone chaperone protein that is integral to chromatin assembly and remodeling processes. This protein, known as the histone cell cycle regulator, is involved in the replication-independent deposition of the histone variant H3.3, playing a crucial role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. As a histone chaperone, HIRA is part of a complex that includes UBN1 and ASF1a, facilitating nucleosome dynamics essential for transcriptional activation and heterochromatin formation. The protein's interactions with various histones and transcription factors underscore its multifaceted role in chromatin dynamics. HIRA is also implicated in cell cycle regulation, interacting with cyclin-cdk2 kinases to influence progression through the S phase. Clinically, mutations in the HIRA gene are associated with developmental disorders, including 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and congenital heart defects, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Jeanne2021Haploinsufficiency; Hall2001HIRA; Esteves2021HIRA).

## Structure
The HIRA protein is a histone chaperone involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling. It is composed of 1017 amino acids and contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region of HIRA includes seven WD40 repeats, which form a beta-propeller structure essential for protein-protein interactions and replication-independent nucleosome assembly (Zhu2017The; Ahmad2003WD). The WD40 domain is particularly important for interacting with histone-binding proteins such as UBN1 and p48, and the first three repeats (WD1 to WD3) are crucial for nucleosome assembly (Zhu2017The).

The B-domain of HIRA, located between residues 439-475, is critical for binding to ASF1a, another histone chaperone. This interaction is stabilized by β-sheet, salt bridge, and van der Waals interactions, forming a complex that is essential for specialized chromatin structures (Tang2006Structure). The C-terminal region of HIRA, known as the Hir domain, is necessary for chromatin binding, likely through interaction with CABIN1 (Zhu2017The).

HIRA's structure is evolutionarily conserved, with similarities to yeast proteins Hir1p and Hir2p, despite differences in genomic organization (Lorain1996Structural). The protein's exon structure does not align with the boundaries of the WD repeats, indicating a conserved structural aspect across species (Lorain1996Structural).

## Function
The HIRA gene encodes a histone chaperone protein that plays a critical role in chromatin assembly and remodeling, particularly through the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 into chromatin. This process is independent of DNA replication and is essential for maintaining the functional organization of the eukaryotic genome (RayGallet2002HIRA). HIRA is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with core histones such as H2B and H4, suggesting its involvement in chromatin structure and transcription regulation (Lorain1998Core).

HIRA functions as part of a histone chaperone complex, which includes UBN1, ASF1a, and CABIN1, facilitating the deposition of H3.3 at transcription start sites and gene bodies of actively transcribed genes. This activity is crucial for nucleosome dynamics associated with transcription activation and heterochromatin formation (Rai2011Human). In muscle cells, HIRA is essential for maintaining the expression of myogenic genes during differentiation by depositing H3.3 in regulatory regions, thereby sustaining the chromatin landscape necessary for muscle cell lineage identity (Esteves2021HIRA).

HIRA's role in cell cycle regulation is highlighted by its interaction with cyclin-cdk2 kinases, which phosphorylate HIRA during the S phase, influencing cell cycle progression (Hall2001HIRA). This phosphorylation is necessary for HIRA's function in modulating the cell cycle, particularly in restraining or facilitating progression through the S phase (Hall2001HIRA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HIRA gene are associated with several developmental disorders and conditions. HIRA is located within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) region, a genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of phenotypic expressions, including congenital heart defects, immune deficiencies, intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, and psychiatric conditions such as ADHD and schizophrenia. Haploinsufficiency of the HIRA gene contributes to the neurodevelopmental phenotype of 22q11DS by impairing neuronal differentiation and maturation, leading to abnormal neurodevelopment and impaired dendritic outgrowth (Jeanne2021Haploinsufficiency).

In the context of heart development, HIRA is implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital heart defects, particularly conotruncal defects like tetralogy of Fallot. Lower expression levels of HIRA in the myocardium have been observed in patients with these defects, suggesting its role in cardiac development (Dilg2016HIRA; Ju2016HIRA). Additionally, HIRA is essential for normal embryonic development, with mutations leading to gastrulation defects and early embryonic lethality (Roberts2002Targeted).

HIRA also plays a role in chromatin regulation and cellular senescence. Its inactivation can lead to enhanced cell proliferation and impaired senescence, contributing to oncogene-induced neoplasia (Rai2014HIRA).

## Interactions
The HIRA protein is a key component of a histone chaperone complex that includes UBN1 and ASF1a, known as the HIRA/UBN1/ASF1a complex. This complex is involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling, particularly in the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 into chromatin (Pchelintsev2013Placing). HIRA interacts with core histones H2B and H4, with specific binding domains identified within its structure. The H2B-binding domain is located between amino acids 593 to 826, while the H4-binding domain spans amino acids 738 to 1017 (Lorain1998Core). 

HIRA also forms interactions with other proteins, such as CABIN1, through its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for the stability and assembly of the HIRA complex (Rai2011Human). It interacts with transcription factors like Pax3 and Pax7, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure modification (Magnaghi1998HIRA). HIRA's interaction with Pax3 involves two independent binding domains located C-terminal to its WD repeat region (Magnaghi1998HIRA). These interactions highlight HIRA's multifaceted role in chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation.
