# APC

## Overview
The APC gene, located on chromosome 5q21-q22, encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, a crucial tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of the WNT signaling pathway. This protein is a multifunctional entity that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and chromosomal stability. As a key regulator of the WNT signaling pathway, the APC protein forms a destruction complex that targets β-catenin for degradation, thereby preventing its accumulation and the subsequent activation of transcription factors that drive cell proliferation (Aoki2007Adenomatous; Nelson2013Interactions). The APC protein also interacts with microtubules and actin, influencing cytoskeletal architecture and mitotic spindle formation (Nelson2013Interactions). Mutations in the APC gene are strongly associated with colorectal cancer, particularly familial adenomatous polyposis, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Zhang2017Multiple; Minde2011Messing).

## Structure
The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a large, multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the WNT signaling pathway. The primary structure of APC includes heptad repeats at the amino-terminal end, which are crucial for homodimer formation (M.2000The). The secondary structure features a domain homologous to the Drosophila armadillo protein, which binds to the APC-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Asef) and influences cell adhesion and motility (M.2000The).

The tertiary structure of APC includes motifs that interact with β-catenin, specifically through imperfect repeats of 15 and 20 amino acids. These repeats contain an SXXXS consensus site for glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification (M.2000The). The quaternary structure involves microtubule binding via a region between amino acids 2200-2400, and the C-terminus interacts with the microtubule-associated protein EB1, hDLG, and PTP-BL via a VTSV amino acid motif (M.2000The).

APC is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with molecular weights ranging from approximately 90-300 kDa (M.2000The). These structural features enable APC to play a critical role in cellular processes such as cytoskeleton organization and cell migration (M.2000The).

## Function
The APC gene encodes a multifunctional tumor suppressor protein that plays a critical role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. In healthy human cells, APC forms a destruction complex with axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) to promote the degradation of β-catenin, preventing its accumulation in the nucleus and subsequent activation of transcription factors that drive cell proliferation (Aoki2007Adenomatous; Nelson2013Interactions). 

APC is also involved in cell adhesion by stabilizing β-catenin at adherens junctions, linking E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell structure and function (Rubinfeld1993Association; Fodde2002The). The protein interacts with microtubules, influencing cytoskeletal architecture and processes such as cell migration and mitotic spindle formation (Aoki2007Adenomatous; Nelson2013Interactions). 

APC's role extends to chromosome segregation during mitosis, where it localizes to kinetochores and centrosomes, ensuring proper chromosomal stability and preventing genetic instability (Aoki2007Adenomatous; Fodde2002The). These functions underscore APC's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the APC gene are strongly associated with colorectal cancer, particularly familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by numerous colorectal adenomas that can progress to cancer (Zhang2017Multiple; Minde2011Messing). APC mutations are found in about 80% of sporadic colorectal tumors and are often the first step in the malignant transformation of these cancers (Rowan2000APC; Aghabozorgi2019Role). These mutations typically occur in the mutation cluster region (MCR) of the gene, leading to truncated proteins that fail to regulate β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Zhang2017Multiple; Aghabozorgi2019Role).

In addition to colorectal cancer, APC mutations are implicated in other conditions such as attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC), which presents with fewer adenomas and a later onset of cancer compared to classical FAP (Soravia1998GenotypePhenotype). Missense mutations in APC are also linked to worse outcomes in invasive urothelial carcinomas (Minde2011Messing). The gene's role in cell migration and chromosome instability further contributes to its involvement in cancer development (Zhang2017Multiple).

## Interactions
The APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein is a key player in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and interacts with a variety of proteins, influencing numerous cellular processes. APC forms a complex with axin, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and casein kinase, which targets β-catenin for degradation, thereby regulating Wnt signaling and preventing tumorigenesis (Nelson2013Interactions). APC interacts with β-catenin through 15-amino-acid repeats at the beginning and 20-amino-acid repeats in the middle of the APC molecule (Nelson2013Interactions). This interaction is crucial for controlling β-catenin levels and is modulated by phosphorylation events (Erdmann2000The).

APC also binds to microtubules and actin, affecting cell migration and division, and maintaining mitotic spindle integrity (Nelson2013Interactions). The C-terminal region of APC contains microtubule binding sites, and phosphorylation by GSK3β enhances β-catenin binding while inhibiting microtubule binding (Nelson2013Interactions).

In addition to its cytoplasmic roles, APC interacts with nuclear transcription factors such as TCF7, JUN, FOSL1, and SOX17, suggesting a role in regulating nuclear β-catenin levels and Wnt signaling (AlThani2022Identifying). APC also interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL via a PDZ domain, potentially influencing cytoskeletal dynamics (Erdmann2000The).
