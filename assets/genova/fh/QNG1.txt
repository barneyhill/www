# QNG1

## Overview
QNG1 is a gene that encodes the protein Q-nucleotide N-glycosylase 1, which is involved in nucleotide metabolism. This protein functions as an enzyme that catalyzes the removal of damaged or unnecessary nucleotides from DNA, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Q-nucleotide N-glycosylase 1 is categorized as a glycosylase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the base excision repair pathway by cleaving the glycosidic bond between the base and the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. This activity is essential for the repair of oxidative DNA damage and the prevention of mutagenesis, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and the prevention of diseases such as cancer. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential implications in therapeutic strategies targeting DNA repair mechanisms.
