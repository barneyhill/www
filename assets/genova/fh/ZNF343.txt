# ZNF343

## Overview
ZNF343 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 343, a member of the KRAB-C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its 12 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate specific DNA binding and play a crucial role in gene regulation. Zinc finger protein 343 is involved in modulating transcriptional activity within the nucleus by recognizing specific DNA motifs, such as the 6-nucleotide sequence GAAGCG, and is implicated in epigenetic modulation, particularly in the recognition of transposable elements (Zuo2019Quantitative). The protein's activity is essential for various cellular processes, including differentiation and proliferation, and it has been observed to be downregulated in low-quality human 8-cell embryos, indicating a potential role in early embryonic development (Wang2023Evaluate). Despite its recognized functions, the full spectrum of ZNF343's roles in cellular physiology and its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids remain areas of active research.

## Structure
ZNF343, or zinc finger protein 343, is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding. These proteins typically have a primary structure rich in cysteine and histidine residues, forming zinc finger motifs. The secondary structure often includes alpha helices and beta sheets. Tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to create a stable DNA-binding domain. Quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. Post-translational modifications like phosphorylation can affect function, and splice variants may exist, altering the protein's structure and function.

## Function
ZNF343, a member of the KRAB-C2H2 zinc finger protein family, functions as a transcription factor involved in gene regulation. It contains 12 zinc finger motifs that enable it to bind DNA and influence the expression of target genes (Zuo2019Quantitative). ZNF343 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional activity by recognizing specific DNA motifs. The protein exhibits a recognition pattern that involves a 6-nucleotide motif, GAAGCG, which is likely recognized by its zinc fingers (Zuo2019Quantitative). This recognition is dependent on the presence of an intact core site, which is necessary for the proper recognition of flanking sites (Zuo2019Quantitative).

ZNF343 may also play a role in epigenetic modulation, potentially influencing the recognition of transposable elements over non-transposable elements, a function that may be common among KRAB-family zinc finger proteins (Zuo2019Quantitative). The protein's activity is crucial for cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation, and its expression is downregulated in low-quality human 8-cell embryos, suggesting a role in early embryo development (Wang2023Evaluate). However, the full extent of ZNF343's functions in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF343, a zinc finger protein, is involved in complex interactions with nucleic acids, primarily through its DNA-binding capabilities. It is a 12-finger long KRAB-ZFP that recognizes specific DNA motifs, with its recognition patterns being dependent on the presence of a core motif. This core motif facilitates the recognition of upstream flanking sites, indicating a dependent recognition mechanism (Zuo2019Quantitative). The recognition of nucleic acid sequences by ZNF343 is modulated by flanking sequences, suggesting that traditional models may not fully capture its specificity profiles (Zuo2019Quantitative).

The protein's interactions are not limited to DNA binding. ZNF343 is also implicated in recognizing transposable elements, with its additional zinc fingers potentially modulating specificity and sensitivity to methylation (Zuo2019Quantitative). This modulation suggests that ZNF343 may participate in broader regulatory networks, possibly influencing gene expression through interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids.

Despite these insights, the specific interactions of ZNF343 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand its role in multiprotein complexes or transient interactions that may impact cellular processes (Wang2023Evaluate).
