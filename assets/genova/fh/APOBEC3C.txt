# APOBEC3C

## Overview
APOBEC3C is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3C, which is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. This protein plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by catalyzing the deamination of cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA, thereby restricting the replication of retroviruses and retrotransposons. Structurally, APOBEC3C is characterized by a zinc-dependent deaminase domain and functions as a dimer, which is essential for its antiviral activity (Chen2021Insights). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus and is expressed in various human tissues, including lymphoid and myeloid cells (Yu2004APOBEC3B). While APOBEC3C is known for its role in inhibiting simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication, its impact on HIV-1 is less pronounced (Yu2004APOBEC3B). Beyond its antiviral functions, alterations in APOBEC3C expression have been implicated in cancer, where its mutagenic activity can contribute to genomic instability and tumor development (Butler2023APOBEC3mediated).

## Structure
APOBEC3C (A3C) is a single-domain protein that belongs to the APOBEC3 family, characterized by a zinc-dependent deaminase domain. This domain features a conserved motif crucial for its catalytic activity (Kitamura2011Structural). The primary structure of A3C includes a critical residue, R122, which is essential for RNA-dependent packaging into virions (Stauch2009Model). 

The secondary structure of A3C is composed of a mixed alpha-beta fold, typical of APOBEC proteins, with a core structure of five beta-strands and six alpha-helices (Chen2021Insights). The tertiary structure reveals a significant binding pocket that modulates RNA interaction, necessary for encapsidation into viral particles (Stauch2009Model). This pocket is distinct from the zinc-coordinating deaminase motif and is hypothesized to bind nucleic acids, such as 5.8S RNA (Stauch2009Model).

A3C functions as a dimer, which is necessary for its antiviral activity. The dimerization is thought to enhance the protein's ability to scan single-stranded DNA or increase processivity, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Chen2021Insights). The protein can form aggregates in the absence of arginine, indicating a propensity to self-oligomerize (Chen2021Insights).

## Function
APOBEC3C is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, which are enzymes that catalyze the deamination of cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the protein's role in innate immunity, where it restricts the replication of retroviruses and retrotransposons. APOBEC3C is expressed in various human tissues, including lymphoid and myeloid cells, which are natural targets of lentiviruses, as well as in the human heart and small intestine (Yu2004APOBEC3B). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the defense against viral infections and maintaining genomic stability.

In the context of viral infections, APOBEC3C is known to inhibit the replication of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) by inducing G to A mutations in the viral reverse transcripts, a process known as deamination (Yu2004APOBEC3B). This mutational activity is a mechanism of antiviral defense, although its impact on HIV-1 is less pronounced (Yu2004APOBEC3B). The expression of APOBEC3C in healthy human cells is part of a broader antiviral response, although specific functions outside of its antiviral activity are not detailed in the available literature (Koning2009Defining).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the APOBEC3C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of viral infections and cancer. APOBEC3C is part of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, which are known for their role in antiviral defense by inducing mutations in viral DNA. In the context of HIV-1, APOBEC3C can inhibit viral replication, although it is less potent than other family members like APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G. The HIV-1 Vif protein can counteract this restriction by binding to APOBEC3C and promoting its degradation, which allows the virus to evade the host's immune response (Langlois2005Mutational; Albin2010Interactions).

In cancer, APOBEC3C and other APOBEC3 enzymes contribute to mutagenesis, which can drive oncogenesis by activating oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressors. Overexpression of APOBEC3C has been observed in certain cancers, such as primary effusion lymphoma, suggesting a role in tumor development (Butler2023APOBEC3mediated). The mutagenic activity of APOBEC3 enzymes, including APOBEC3C, is associated with increased genomic instability, which can lead to cancer progression and therapy resistance (Butler2023APOBEC3mediated).

## Interactions
APOBEC3C (A3C) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its antiviral activity. A3C forms dimers, a process essential for its antiviral function, with specific residues such as F55 and W74 playing a crucial role in this dimerization. Mutations at these sites can disrupt dimer formation and reduce antiviral activity (Stauch2009Model).

A3C interacts with nucleic acids through a large binding pocket on its surface, which is significant for its encapsidation into viral particles. This pocket is involved in RNA-dependent interactions, particularly with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) nucleocapsid (NC). The R122 residue within this pocket is critical for RNA binding, and mutations at this site can lead to decreased RNA interaction and loss of binding to 5.8S RNA, which is necessary for A3C's incorporation into viral particles (Stauch2009Model).

A3C also interacts with the Bet protein from the prototype foamy virus (PFV), which inhibits A3C's antiviral activity by preventing its dimerization. This interaction is RNA-independent and occurs at the predicted dimerization site of A3C, blocking its incorporation into viral particles (Perković2009Speciesspecific).
