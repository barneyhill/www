# PPM1B

## Overview
PPM1B is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1B, a serine/threonine phosphatase that is part of the PPM family. This protein is characterized by its requirement for magnesium or manganese ions to perform its catalytic functions. PPM1B is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, which are crucial for immune response, inflammation, and cellular senescence. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as N-myristoylation, which influence its localization and substrate interactions. PPM1B's role in dephosphorylating key proteins like IKKβ, PPARγ, and TBK1 underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Tasdelen2013The; Chida2013NMyristoylation; Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Structure
PPM1B is a serine/threonine phosphatase that belongs to the PPM family, characterized by its dependency on Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions for catalytic activity (Tasdelen2013The). The primary structure of PPM1B includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues such as Arg-33, Gln-37, Asp-60, and Gly-61 being critical for its catalytic activity and substrate binding (Lu2020Identification). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins in this family, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of PPM1B involves a catalytic domain that binds metal ions, essential for its phosphatase activity (Tasdelen2013The). PPM1B may form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, although this is not explicitly detailed in the context. Post-translational modifications such as N-myristoylation are crucial for its function, affecting substrate recognition and membrane localization (Chida2013NMyristoylation).

PPM1B has several splice variants with identical catalytic domains but differing N- and C-terminal domains, which influence its localization and substrate specificity (Tasdelen2013The). These structural features enable PPM1B to participate in various cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
PPM1B is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes by dephosphorylating specific proteins. It is involved in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway by acting as an IKKβ phosphatase, which leads to the termination of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. This regulation is crucial for controlling inflammation and immune responses (SUN2009PPM1A). PPM1B also interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway and is involved in cellular senescence. It negatively regulates key transcription factors such as p53 and NF-κB, which are important in the gene expression program of cellular senescence (Park2014PPM1B).

In adipocytes, PPM1B enhances PPARγ-mediated transcription by dephosphorylating PPARγ at Ser112, which is important for adipogenesis and metabolism (Tasdelen2013The). PPM1B also plays a role in the antiviral response by dephosphorylating TBK1 and IRF3, thereby suppressing interferon β production and enhancing virus replication (Kamada2020Metaldependent). In erythropoiesis, PPM1B regulates the stability and activity of EKLF, affecting the transcription of erythroid-specific genes (Yien2012Functional). These activities highlight PPM1B's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
The PPM1B gene is associated with several clinical conditions due to its role in various cellular processes. Mutations or deletions involving PPM1B are linked to congenital disorders, such as the homozygous 2p21 deletion syndrome. This syndrome results in the loss of PPM1B along with other genes, leading to symptoms like cystinuria, neonatal seizures, hypotonia, severe developmental delay, facial dysmorphisms, and lactic acidemia. However, the exact contribution of PPM1B to these symptoms is not fully understood, as some patients with similar symptoms do not have deletions affecting PPM1B (Vaneynde2022The).

Alterations in PPM1B expression are also implicated in cancer. The gene's expression is often downregulated in bladder cancer due to miR-186, and its overexpression can suppress tumor progression by dephosphorylating RhoGDI1, affecting the activation of RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42. In sarcoma cells, PPM1B depletion suppresses proliferation via the p38-RB1-E2F1 pathway, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer treatment (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

PPM1B also plays a role in regulating the antiviral response and inflammatory processes, which can impact immune responses and potentially contribute to inflammatory diseases (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Interactions
PPM1B, also known as protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1B, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate various cellular processes. It interacts with IκB kinase β (IKKβ), where it acts as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate IKKβ, thereby terminating NF-κB activation. This interaction is crucial for regulating NF-κB signaling pathways, which are involved in inflammatory responses and cancer progression (Yang2015miR186; SUN2009PPM1A).

PPM1B also interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARγ, where it dephosphorylates PPARγ at Ser 112, modulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction plays a role in metabolic processes and adipocyte differentiation (Tasdelen2013The).

In cancer biology, PPM1B interacts with Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 1 (RhoGDI1), leading to the dephosphorylation of RhoGDI1. This interaction affects the activation of Rho GTPases, which are involved in cell motility and invasiveness, thereby influencing cancer cell migration and invasion (Cho2018Protein).

PPM1B also acts as a phosphatase for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), dephosphorylating it and terminating TBK1-mediated activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon-β (IFNβ) gene expression, which are important in antiviral responses (Yang2015miR186).
