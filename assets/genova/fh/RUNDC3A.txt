# RUNDC3A

## Overview
RUNDC3A is a gene that encodes the protein RUN domain containing 3A, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The RUNDC3A protein is characterized by its RUN domain, which is implicated in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. It plays a significant role in the regulation of synapse-related pathways, particularly through its interaction with SNAP25, a protein essential for synaptic function. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the AKT protein, a key player in cell survival and proliferation, thereby influencing tumor growth and chemoresistance in neuroendocrine neoplasms, including gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (Chen2022RUNDC3A; Lin2022RUNDC3ASNAP25Akt). RUNDC3A's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in various cancers, as well as its broader implications in cancer progression and prognosis (Sun2017Identification; PérezRamírez2017Pediatric).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
RUNDC3A has been implicated in various cancers, particularly neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (GNEC). It acts as an upstream regulator of SNAP25, influencing its expression and stabilizing the Akt protein through monoubiquitination. This stabilization is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance in GNEC, suggesting that the RUNDC3A/SNAP25/Akt signaling axis could be a potential therapeutic target (Chen2022RUNDC3A; Lin2022RUNDC3ASNAP25Akt).

In gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma, RUNDC3A is upregulated and affects cell proliferation by regulating SNAP25. Knockdown of RUNDC3A in GNEC cell lines results in reduced proliferation and tumor growth, indicating its role in promoting cell proliferation via SNAP25 (Chen2022RUNDC3A). RUNDC3A expression is also correlated with SNAP25 expression in various cancer types, including lung and pancreatic cancers, suggesting a broader role in cancer proliferation (Chen2022RUNDC3A).

RUNDC3A has also been identified as a potential biomarker for rectal carcinoma (RC) progression and prognosis. It is part of a diagnostic model that distinguishes between localized and non-localized RC, with its expression levels significantly associated with pathological stage and overall survival (Sun2017Identification). Additionally, RUNDC3A is involved in pediatric pineal germinomas, where it shows deletion, hypomethylation, and under-expression, potentially affecting neuronal processes (PérezRamírez2017Pediatric).

## Interactions
RUNDC3A is involved in significant protein interactions, particularly in the context of gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (GNEC). It acts as an upstream regulator of SNAP25, a protein central to synapse-related cellular functions. RUNDC3A's regulation of SNAP25 is crucial for the stability of the AKT protein, which is achieved through SNAP25-mediated monoubiquitination. This interaction prevents AKT from undergoing proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby promoting tumor growth and chemoresistance in GNEC cells (Chen2022RUNDC3A; Lin2022RUNDC3ASNAP25Akt).

The RUNDC3A/SNAP25/AKT signaling axis is not only relevant to GNEC but also extends to other neuroendocrine neoplasms, including those in the intestinal tract, lungs, and pancreas. This axis is implicated in tumor progression and chemoresistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2022RUNDC3ASNAP25Akt). RUNDC3A's interaction with SNAP25 and its subsequent effect on AKT stability underscores its role in the regulation of synapse-related pathways, which are often dysregulated in neuroendocrine cancers (Chen2022RUNDC3A). These interactions suggest that targeting the RUNDC3A/SNAP25/AKT axis could be a promising strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in these cancers.
