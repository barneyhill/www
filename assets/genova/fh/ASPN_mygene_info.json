leucine-rich proteoglycan family. The encoded protein may regulate chondrogenesis by inhibiting transforming growth factor-beta 1-induced gene expression in cartilage. This protein also binds collagen and calcium and may induce collagen mineralization. Polymorphisms in the aspartic acid repeat region of this gene are associated with a susceptibility to osteoarthritis, and also with intervertebral disc disease. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014].", "symbol": "ASPN", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1423015"}, "unigene": "Hs.435655", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "Q9BXN1", "TrEMBL": ["Q5TBF2", "Q6P528", "A0A494C1J0", "A0A494C084"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Asporin"}}
