# SH2D4B

## Overview
SH2D4B is a gene that encodes the SH2 domain-containing protein 4B, which is part of the SH2 domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain, which is known for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly in signal transduction pathways. The SH2 domain allows the protein to bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in cellular signaling processes. Although the specific biological functions of SH2D4B are not fully elucidated, proteins with SH2 domains are generally involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and immune responses. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of SH2D4B in health and disease.
