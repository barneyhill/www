# SUZ12

## Overview
The SUZ12 gene encodes the SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit, a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. This protein plays a significant role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by facilitating the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression. SUZ12 is integral to maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and regulating developmental pathways, including Wnt, TGFb, BMP, and FGF, which are essential for proper cell differentiation and development (Lee2006Control; Pasini2004Suz12). The protein's interactions with other PRC2 components, such as EZH2 and EED, and its involvement in various cellular processes underscore its importance in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer and overgrowth syndromes (Cyrus2019Rare; Glancy2021Structural).

## Structure
The SUZ12 protein is a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. It contains several domains that contribute to its function, including the N-terminal (NT), Zinc Finger-Binding (ZnB), WD40-Binding 1 (WDB1), C2, Zinc finger (Zn), WD40-Binding 2 (WDB2), and VEFS domains (Liu2022PRC2). The VEFS domain, in particular, is crucial for the catalytic activity of PRC2, interacting with the SET domain of EZH2 to facilitate histone methylation (Ciferri2012Molecular; Jiao2015Structural).

The SUZ12 protein adopts a complex tertiary structure, with its C2 domain forming an eight-strand β-sandwich structure, similar to classical C2 domains that bind phospholipids (Liu2022PRC2). This domain is involved in PRC2 dimerization, enhancing chromatin binding (Liu2022PRC2). The zinc-finger domain of SUZ12 interacts with cofactors such as AEBP2 and JARID2, contributing to the stability and function of the PRC2 complex (Kasinath2018Structures).

In terms of quaternary structure, SUZ12 forms a ternary complex with EZH2 and EED, which is essential for the enzymatic function of PRC2 (Liu2022PRC2). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions within the complex (Kasinath2018Structures).

## Function
The SUZ12 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a vital role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing through histone methylation. Specifically, SUZ12 is involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression of target genes (Lee2006Control; Pasini2004Suz12). This activity is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells by repressing genes that promote differentiation, thereby keeping them in a poised state for activation upon receiving differentiation signals (Lee2006Control).

In healthy human cells, SUZ12 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the establishment and maintenance of repressive chromatin states. It occupies promoters of developmental regulators and is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways such as Wnt, TGFb, BMP, and FGF, which are important for both embryonic development and stem cell maintenance (Lee2006Control). SUZ12's role in PRC2 is essential for the transcriptional repression necessary for proper cell differentiation and development, as well as for the maintenance of stem cell identity (Lee2006Control; Pasini2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SUZ12 gene, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SUZ12 is upregulated, correlating with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stages. Knockdown of SUZ12 in NSCLC cell lines reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as an oncogene and potential therapeutic target (Liu2014SUZ12).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), increased SUZ12 expression is associated with regional lymph node metastases, primary tumor size, and poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Liu2014Expression). SUZ12 mutations are also implicated in the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), particularly in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, where these mutations contribute to the malignant transformation of benign neurofibromas (Zhang2014Somatic).

Rare germline variants of SUZ12 are linked to overgrowth syndromes, characterized by features such as macrocephaly, tall stature, and developmental delays. These variants often disrupt SUZ12's interaction with other PRC2 components, leading to clinical manifestations similar to Weaver and Cohen-Gibson syndromes (Cyrus2019Rare). In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), SUZ12 inactivation cooperates with JAK3 mutations, activating pathways that may be targeted by specific inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Broux2019Suz12).

## Interactions
SUZ12 is a core component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is essential for chromatin modification and gene repression. It interacts with other core components of PRC2, including EZH2 and EED, to form a catalytic lobe responsible for histone methylation at lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me1/2/3) (Glancy2021Structural). SUZ12 also interacts with RNA independently of other PRC2 subunits like EZH2 and EED, maintaining a consistent RNA binding profile even in their absence (Beltran2016The).

The N-terminal region of SUZ12 interacts with RBBP4/7 and various accessory proteins, which define the PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 subcomplexes. PRC2.1 includes polycomb-like proteins and either PALI1/2 or EPOP, while PRC2.2 includes JARID2 and AEBP2 (Glancy2021Structural). These interactions are crucial for the targeting and enzymatic activity of PRC2 at repressed gene promoters. SUZ12's interactions with accessory proteins such as AEBP2 and PCL homolog proteins are mutually exclusive, indicating that these proteins bind to nonidentical sites on SUZ12 (Youmans2018Livecell).

In gastric cancer cells, SUZ12 interacts with USP3, which stabilizes SUZ12 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby increasing its half-life (Wu2019Ubiquitin-specific).
