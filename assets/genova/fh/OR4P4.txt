# OR4P4

## Overview
The OR4P4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily P member 4, which belongs to the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are responsible for detecting odorant molecules and initiating the neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The OR4P4 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a common feature of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane and interact with intracellular signaling pathways. This gene is part of a large and diverse family of olfactory receptors, which are crucial for the sense of smell in humans and other vertebrates. The olfactory receptor family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and importance of olfactory signaling (Qiu2020aarFDC).
