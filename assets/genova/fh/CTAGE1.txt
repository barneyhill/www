# CTAGE1

## Overview
CTAGE1 is a gene that encodes the protein cutaneous T cell lymphoma-associated antigen 1, which is primarily associated with various cancer types, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), gastric adenocarcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The protein is characterized by its tumor-specific expression, making it a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Notably, CTAGE1 is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its expression is significant in distinguishing malignant tissues from normal or benign conditions. The regulation of CTAGE1 expression appears to be independent of p53 mutations, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms such as epigenetic modifications (Litvinov2014Ectopic). Its differential expression in cancers like gastric adenocarcinoma and bladder carcinoma further highlights its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Ajani2020Proteogenomic; Yin2012Expression).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CTAGE1, also known as cutaneous T cell lymphoma-associated antigen 1, is implicated in various cancers, particularly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). In CTCL, CTAGE1 is robustly expressed in patient samples and cell lines, distinguishing it from normal skin and benign inflammatory conditions, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Litvinov2014Ectopic). The expression of CTAGE1 is not dependent on p53 mutations, indicating that its regulation might involve other pathways, such as epigenetic modifications (Litvinov2014Ectopic).

In gastric adenocarcinoma, CTAGE1 is identified as a differentially expressed protein, particularly in peritoneal metastases, and is considered a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Ajani2020Proteogenomic). Its expression pattern in gastric cancer suggests it could be involved in tumor progression and immune evasion.

In transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, CTAGE1 shows a tumor-specific expression pattern, absent in normal bladder mucosa, highlighting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Yin2012Expression). The gene's expression in these cancers underscores its clinical significance as a target for therapeutic interventions and as a diagnostic marker.
