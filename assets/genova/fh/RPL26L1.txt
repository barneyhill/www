# RPL26L1

## Overview
RPL26L1 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L26-like 1, which is a component of the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal protein and is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA binding and metabolism. RPL26L1 has been implicated in several neurological and autoimmune conditions, such as major depressive disorder and systemic lupus erythematosus, due to its role as a hub protein in protein-protein interaction networks. Its high connectivity with other proteins suggests that it may play a critical role in the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases (Vuong2019Proteome; Feng2019Seeking; Yang2019Bioinformatics).

## Structure


## Interactions
RPL26L1 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other neurological conditions. It has been identified as a significant hub protein in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, with a degree of 13, indicating its high connectivity with other proteins. This suggests that RPL26L1 may play a crucial role in the molecular mechanisms underlying MDD (Feng2019Seeking). 

In human embryonic stem cells, RPL26L1 is part of endogenous retrotransposon-associated complexes. It is one of the proteins identified with an abundance ratio of at least 2.0, and it clusters into three networks with other proteins involved in RNA binding and metabolism (Vuong2019Proteome). 

RPL26L1 also shows significant interactions in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where it has the highest node degree in a PPI network constructed for differentially expressed genes. This indicates a substantial number of interactions within the network, although specific interactions with other proteins are not detailed (Yang2019Bioinformatics). 

These interactions highlight the potential of RPL26L1 as a biomarker and its involvement in various cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
