# GPBAR1

## Overview
The GPBAR1 gene encodes the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, also known as TGR5, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helices, a hallmark of the rhodopsin-like class A GPCRs, and is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and immune modulation (Fiorucci2021Bile; Di2019Structural). GPBAR1 is activated by bile acids and is expressed in several tissues, such as the liver, intestine, and immune cells, where it plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways (Fiorucci2021Bile; Perino2021Molecular). The receptor's interactions with signaling molecules like β-arrestin2 and its involvement in pathways such as cAMP and NF-κB underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2022Therapeutic; Wang2011The). Mutations in the GPBAR1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including primary sclerosing cholangitis and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Guan2022The; Hov2010Mutational).

## Structure
The GPBAR1 protein, also known as TGR5, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane (TM) α-helices, which are connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops. The N-terminus of the protein is oriented towards the extracellular side, while the C-terminus is directed towards the intracellular side (Kirchweger2018In; Di2019Structural). The receptor is encoded by a single exon located on chromosome 2 in humans and consists of 330 amino acids (Di2019Structural).

The secondary structure of GPBAR1 includes these seven TM α-helices, which are typical of the rhodopsin-like class A GPCRs (Di2019Structural). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these helices, although the exact 3D structure has not been experimentally determined. Instead, homology models have been created using templates from other GPCRs, such as the adenosine receptor A2A and rhodopsin, due to their sequence similarity (Macchiarulo2013Probing; Di2019Structural).

GPBAR1 can form homodimers and higher-order oligomers, with specific transmembrane α-helices involved in stabilizing these oligomer interfaces, indicating a quaternary structure (Di2019Structural). Key residues such as Asn93, Glu169, and Tyr89 are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (Macchiarulo2013Probing; Di2019Structural).

## Function
GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by bile acids, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, GPBAR1 is involved in energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. It is expressed in tissues such as the liver, intestine, and immune cells, where it influences bile acid signaling and thermogenesis. Activation of GPBAR1 in adipocytes and muscle cells enhances energy expenditure by increasing the activity of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase, a thermogenic protein, and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (Fiorucci2021Bile; Perino2021Molecular).

In the immune system, GPBAR1 modulates inflammatory responses. It is expressed in immune cells like monocytes and macrophages, where its activation shifts macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, increasing IL-10 expression and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fiorucci2021Bile; Perino2021Molecular). GPBAR1 also plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis by influencing the release of GLP-1 from intestinal L cells, which promotes insulin synthesis and secretion (Fiorucci2021Bile; Perino2021Molecular). These functions highlight GPBAR1's critical role in maintaining metabolic and immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPBAR1 gene, also known as TGR5, have been implicated in various diseases. In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), several nonsynonymous mutations in GPBAR1, such as W83R, A153V, V178M, and S272G, have been identified exclusively in patients, suggesting a potential role in disease susceptibility (Hov2010Mutational). The gene is also associated with ulcerative colitis, with significant associations found at the SNP rs11554825 locus (Hov2010Mutational).

In liver diseases, GPBAR1 mutations have been linked to cholestatic conditions like benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). These mutations result in reduced TGR5 protein expression, indicating a potential predisposition to cholestatic liver diseases (Huynh2019Clinical). TGR5 deficiency has been shown to enhance liver carcinogenesis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting STAT3 signaling, which is crucial for cancer development (Chen2013Deficiency).

In cancer, GPBAR1 expression levels correlate with prognosis in various cancers. High expression is linked to poor outcomes in glioblastoma multiforme and other cancers, while low expression is associated with poor prognosis in cervical and other cancers (Guan2022The). These findings highlight GPBAR1's potential as a biomarker for tumor staging and prognosis.

## Interactions
GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function and signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with β-arrestin2, a multifunctional signaling molecule. GPBAR1 activation enhances the interaction between β-arrestin2 and the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, which inhibits NF-κB activity. This interaction is crucial for GPBAR1's role in modulating inflammation, as it suppresses NF-κB-mediated transcription activity and its target gene expression (Wang2011The).

GPBAR1 also interacts with the cAMP signaling pathway. Upon activation by bile acids, GPBAR1 increases cAMP production, which can activate protein kinase A (PKA). This activation leads to the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α, while maintaining anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. This mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of liver inflammation and cholestatic diseases (Zhang2022Therapeutic).

Additionally, GPBAR1 is involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, although reports on whether it inhibits or activates this inflammasome are conflicting. GPBAR1's interaction with β-catenin signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway also plays a role in controlling inflammation (Zhang2022Therapeutic).
