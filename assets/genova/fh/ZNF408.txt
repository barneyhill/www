# ZNF408

## Overview
ZNF408 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 408, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities. The protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, playing a significant role in the development and maintenance of retinal vasculature. It contains ten C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate its interaction with DNA, and a putative SET domain that may be involved in chromatin-mediated gene expression regulation. ZNF408 is predominantly expressed in the retina, underscoring its importance in eye development and function. Mutations in ZNF408 have been linked to retinal diseases such as familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Karjosukarso2018An; Habibi2017Exome; Collin2013ZNF408).

## Structure
The ZNF408 gene encodes a protein that is part of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. The primary structure of ZNF408 consists of 720 amino acids, including ten C2H2-type zinc finger domains, each containing two cysteine and two histidine residues essential for DNA binding (Collin2013ZNF408). These zinc finger motifs are arranged in a tandem array located at the C-terminal half of the protein, suggesting a role in high-affinity DNA binding and possibly other functions (Collin2013ZNF408).

The protein also contains a putative SET domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and chromatin-mediated gene expression regulation (Collin2013ZNF408). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding necessary for its function as a transcription factor, but specific folding patterns are not detailed. There is no information on the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications of ZNF408 in the provided context. The expression of ZNF408 is highest in the retina, indicating its significant role in eye development (Collin2013ZNF408).

## Function
ZNF408 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the development of vasculature. It is part of the C2H2 zinc finger protein class and contains ten zinc finger domains, which are essential for DNA binding and gene regulation (Collin2013ZNF408). In healthy human cells, ZNF408 is primarily localized in the nucleus, consistent with its function as a transcriptional regulator (Collin2013ZNF408). The protein is highly expressed in the retina, indicating its significant role in eye development and homeostasis (Collin2013ZNF408).

ZNF408 is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, likely through interactions with genomic regulatory regions. It is hypothesized to regulate genes involved in nucleosome assembly, protein processing, and angiogenesis (Karjosukarso2018An). In particular, ZNF408 appears to promote vasculature development by downregulating genes that inhibit angiogenesis, thereby contributing to normal vascular development (Karjosukarso2018An). The protein's proper nuclear localization is crucial for its function, as mutations that disrupt this localization can lead to impaired vascular development (Collin2013ZNF408).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF408 gene are associated with several retinal diseases, most notably familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). FEVR is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by abnormal retinal vasculature, which can lead to retinal detachment and severe visual impairment. Specific mutations, such as the p.His455Tyr missense mutation, have been identified in families with autosomal dominant FEVR, causing the ZNF408 protein to mislocalize in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus, suggesting a dominant-negative effect (Karjosukarso2020Modeling; Collin2013ZNF408). Zebrafish models with ZNF408 mutations exhibit retinal vascular abnormalities similar to those seen in FEVR patients, highlighting the gene's role in retinal vasculature development (Karjosukarso2020Modeling).

ZNF408 mutations have also been implicated in retinitis pigmentosa, a condition characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. A novel homozygous mutation in ZNF408 was identified in a Tunisian family with RP, underscoring the gene's involvement in this disease (Habibi2017Exome). Additionally, compound heterozygous mutations in ZNF408 have been linked to late-onset pigmentary retinopathy, a condition distinct from FEVR, characterized by preserved central retina and peripheral retinal changes (Nadelmann2021Compound). These findings suggest that ZNF408 mutations contribute to a spectrum of retinal dystrophies.

## Interactions
ZNF408 is a zinc finger protein that primarily functions in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It contains ten C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its interaction with DNA. The p.His455Tyr mutation in ZNF408, associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), significantly reduces its DNA-binding ability, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-SEQ) experiments. This mutation leads to a decrease in the number of DNA binding sites compared to the wild-type protein, affecting the expression of genes involved in vasculature development, such as HMOX1 and ITGA4 (Karjosukarso2018An).

The p.His455Tyr mutation also causes mislocalization of ZNF408 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting a disruption in its normal function as a transcriptional regulator. This mislocalization indicates potential oligomerization between the wild-type and mutant proteins, which may interfere with ZNF408's role in transcription regulation (Collin2013ZNF408). The mutation's impact on protein localization and function highlights the importance of ZNF408's interactions with DNA and possibly other proteins in maintaining normal cellular processes. However, specific protein interactions involving ZNF408 are not detailed in the available context.
