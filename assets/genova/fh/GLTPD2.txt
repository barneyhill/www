# GLTPD2

## Overview
GLTPD2 is a gene that encodes the glycolipid transfer protein domain containing 2, a member of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the intracellular transport of glycolipids, particularly sphingolipids, and is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney. The GLTPD2 protein features a GLTP-domain that shares structural similarities with ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) and ACD11, suggesting a role in sphingolipid headgroup recognition and transfer (Mishra2020Emerging). Notably, GLTPD2 contains a unique N-terminal transmembrane helix, which may facilitate its interaction with membranes at contact sites (Mishra2020Emerging). The gene's function in lipid metabolism has implications for cardiovascular health, as variations in GLTPD2 have been associated with altered sphingomyelin levels and atherosclerosis risk (Montasser2022An). Despite its potential significance, further research is needed to fully understand the physiological and pathological roles of GLTPD2 (Mishra2020Emerging).

## Structure
The human GLTPD2 protein is encoded by the GLTPD2 gene located on chromosome 17 and consists of 4 exons encoding a 291 residue protein. The GLTP-domain of GLTPD2 comprises the final 211 residues coded by exons 3 and 4 (Mishra2020Emerging). Structural homology modeling indicates that the GLTP-fold of GLTPD2 resembles C1P-specific CPTP and ACD11 more closely than glycolipid-selective GLTPs, particularly at key interaction positions in the sphingolipid headgroup recognition center (Malinina2015Sphingolipid; Mishra2020Emerging). 

The N-terminal 80 residue region preceding the GLTP-like domain contains a 20 residue stretch predicted to be a transmembrane helix, which is unique among human GLTP superfamily members. This helix may stabilize membrane interaction by GLTPD2, allowing it to function near membrane contact sites, although experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking (Mishra2020Emerging). 

The GLTP-fold is characterized by an all-α-helical, two-layer 'sandwich' architecture, which is a common feature among GLTP superfamily members, allowing for specific lipid headgroup selectivity (Mishra2020Emerging). The GLTPD2 protein's structural features suggest a role in sphingolipid recognition and transfer, similar to other proteins in the GLTP superfamily.

## Function
The GLTPD2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily, which is involved in the intracellular transport of glycolipids. This protein is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney and plays a role in the intermembrane transfer of glycolipids, but not neutral or phospholipids (Montasser2022An). The GLTPD2 protein contains a GLTP-domain similar to ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) and ACD11, suggesting a potential role in sphingolipid headgroup recognition (Mishra2020Emerging). The N-terminal region of GLTPD2 includes a predicted transmembrane helix, which may stabilize interactions with membranes and allow the protein to function at membrane contact sites (Mishra2020Emerging).

GLTPD2 is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the regulation of sphingomyelin levels. A missense variant in the promoter of GLTPD2 has been associated with lower levels of sphingomyelin and reduced atherosclerosis, indicating its potential role in cardiovascular health (Montasser2022An). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum contributes to membrane dynamics and homeostasis, influencing cellular communication and lipid metabolism (Mishra2020Emerging). However, experimental evidence for GLTPD2's specific function in healthy cells is still lacking, and further studies are needed to clarify its role (Mishra2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
The GLTPD2 gene, a member of the human glycolipid transfer protein superfamily, has been linked to several health conditions due to its role in lipid metabolism. It is highly expressed in liver tissue and liver cancer, indicating a potential role in hepatic diseases (Mishra2020Emerging). GLTPD2 is among the top genes upregulated during necrotizing enterocolitis in neonatal mice, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory conditions (Mishra2020Emerging). 

A gene-wide association study has connected GLTPD2 to cardiovascular disease risk, particularly through its influence on sphingomyelin (SM) levels. A specific genetic variant involving an intronic substitution in GLTPD2 is associated with decreased SM levels, which may indicate a reduced risk of atherosclerosis (Mishra2020Emerging). This suggests that alterations in GLTPD2 expression or function could impact cardiovascular health.

Despite these associations, the precise clinical implications of GLTPD2 mutations or expression changes remain under investigation. Experimental challenges in studying the protein's function have limited the understanding of its role in disease, necessitating further research to elucidate its potential as a therapeutic target (Mishra2020Emerging).
