# CARS2

## Overview
CARS2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is classified as a ligase, specifically responsible for the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA with cysteine, a crucial step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins. The proper function of cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2 is essential for the assembly and operation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, which are vital for cellular energy production and respiration. Beyond its role in protein synthesis, CARS2 is involved in cysteine polysulfidation, contributing to mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular redox signaling. The enzyme's activity is critical for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, impacting cellular metabolism and health (Coughlin2015Mutations; Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

## Structure
The CARS2 gene encodes a mitochondrial cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase involved in the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA. The protein consists of 564 amino acids, including a 62 amino acid mitochondrial targeting peptide (Coughlin2015Mutations). The primary structure of CARS2 includes highly conserved residues within its ligase domain, which are crucial for its function. Mutations such as p.Glu217del and p.Pro251Leu affect these conserved residues, leading to structural changes that impact the protein's function (Coughlin2015Mutations).

The secondary structure of CARS2 includes 24 α-helices and 16 β-sheets. Specific mutations, like p.Ala219Thr, can induce changes in the secondary structure, such as converting α9 into a loop and altering the α16-α17 loop (Abdulkareem2023Whole). The tertiary structure involves the catalytic cysteine-tRNA ligase domain and an anticodon binding domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Coughlin2015Mutations).

CARS2 is a major producer of persulfides in human cells, and its activity is dependent on pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding to specific lysine residues, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA). The protein's structural integrity is vital for its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics and cysteine polysulfidation (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

## Function
The CARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis within mitochondria. This enzyme is responsible for the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA with cysteine, a critical step in translating mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins. This process is vital for the proper assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, which are crucial for cellular energy production and respiration (Coughlin2015Mutations; Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

CARS2 also plays a significant role in cysteine polysulfidation, contributing to mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular redox signaling. It is involved in the production of cysteine persulfide (CysSSH) and glutathione persulfide (GSSH), which are important for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. These persulfides act as antioxidants and redox signaling intermediates, supporting mitochondrial health and energy metabolism (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

In healthy human cells, CARS2-derived cysteine persulfides are crucial for the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria, impacting cellular bioenergetics and morphology. The enzyme's activity is essential for sustaining mitochondrial membrane potential and efficient electron transport, which are necessary for overall cellular metabolism and function (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARS2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with several severe neurological disorders. These include epileptic encephalopathy, complex movement disorders, and combined mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies. Patients with CARS2 mutations often present with symptoms such as neurological regression, intractable seizures, and complex movement disorders, including chorea, dystonia, and myoclonus (Coughlin2015Mutations). 

Specific mutations, such as compound heterozygous mutations and a homozygous splice-site mutation, have been linked to severe progressive myoclonic epilepsy and conditions resembling MERRF syndrome (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers) (Hallmann2014A). These mutations can lead to defects in mitochondrial translation, resulting in decreased aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA and impaired mitochondrial function (Coughlin2015Mutations).

The CARS2 gene has also been implicated in Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 27, characterized by severe muscle weakness, developmental delays, seizures, and autistic behavior. A pathogenic variant, c.655G>A, has been identified as causing severe myoclonic epilepsy and other neurological impairments (Abdulkareem2023Whole). These findings underscore the critical role of CARS2 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its impact on neurological health.

## Interactions
Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (CARS2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of cysteine to its corresponding tRNA. While specific physical interactions of CARS2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its functional integration with mitochondrial processes suggests potential interactions with various biomolecules. CARS2 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics and morphology, indicating possible interactions with proteins involved in these pathways, such as Drp1, a major mediator of mitochondrial fission, which is extensively polysulfidated and affected by CARS2 activity (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

CARS2 also plays a role in the production of cysteine polysulfides, which are important for cellular processes like redox signaling and mitochondrial function. This suggests that CARS2 may interact with components of the electron transport chain and other proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA). The enzyme's activity in cysteine polysulfidation and its impact on mitochondrial bioenergetics imply that CARS2 could engage in transient interactions essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA). However, specific interaction partners are not detailed in the provided context.
