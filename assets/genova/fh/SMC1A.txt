# SMC1A

## Overview
SMC1A is a gene that encodes the structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A (SMC1A) protein, a critical component of the cohesin complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in chromosome segregation, 3D genome organization, and gene expression regulation. As a member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family, SMC1A is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is essential for its function in the cohesin complex. The cohesin complex, which includes SMC1A, is vital for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during cell division, thereby ensuring accurate mitosis and meiosis. Additionally, SMC1A is involved in the DNA damage response, where it is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, contributing to genome stability and repair. Mutations in the SMC1A gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Musio2020The; Mannini2010The; Yazdi2002SMC1).

## Structure
The SMC1A protein is a structural component of the cohesin complex, essential for chromosome segregation, 3D genome organization, and gene expression. It is composed of five distinct regions: two coiled-coil domains, a hinge domain, and N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain includes a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding motif, known as the P-loop or Walker A box, responsible for ATP binding, while the C-terminal domain contains the DNA binding domain, known as the DA box or Walker B (Mannini2010Spectrum; Musio2020The).

The coiled-coil domains, each about 300 to 400 amino acids, are crucial for the protein's rod-shaped conformation and interaction with SMC3, forming a V-shaped heterodimer. The hinge domain, approximately 115 to 150 amino acids, allows for dimerization and contributes to the flexibility of the protein (Mannini2010Spectrum; Musio2020The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, regulate the function of SMC1A. Phosphorylation clusters, including residues S957 and S966, are linked to the DNA damage response (Matityahu2017A). The SMC1A gene has six transcripts, five of which are protein-coding, although the biological role of some transcripts remains unclear (Musio2020The).

## Function
The SMC1A gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the cohesin complex, which plays a vital role in maintaining genome stability and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. This complex is essential for holding sister chromatids together from the S phase until their separation in anaphase, facilitating accurate mitosis and meiosis (Musio2020The; Mannini2010The). SMC1A, along with SMC3, forms a V-shaped structure through dimerization, which is crucial for the cohesin complex's function (Mannini2010The).

SMC1A is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it is phosphorylated by ATM and ATR kinases in response to DNA damage, aiding in genome stability and repair (Yazdi2002SMC1; Musio2020The). This phosphorylation is necessary for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint, ensuring that cells do not proceed through the cell cycle with damaged DNA (Yazdi2002SMC1).

Beyond its role in chromosome cohesion, SMC1A is involved in regulating gene expression and genome organization. It participates in the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs), which facilitate chromosomal domain structure and transcriptional regulation (Musio2020The). The protein is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and genome integrity (Musio2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMC1A gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its role in the cohesin complex, which is crucial for chromosome segregation and gene expression regulation. One of the primary disorders linked to SMC1A mutations is Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a rare developmental disorder characterized by growth retardation, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. Most SMC1A variants in CdLS are missense or small in-frame deletions, which often result in a milder clinical phenotype compared to mutations in other genes associated with CdLS, such as NIPBL (Mannini2010Spectrum; Liu2009SMC1Aexpression; Borck2007Incidence).

SMC1A mutations have also been identified in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, where they may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting chromosome segregation and gene expression. These mutations can lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, by disrupting the cohesin complex's function in maintaining genome stability and DNA repair (Mannini2010Spectrum; Musio2020The). The gene's role in DNA repair and genome stability underscores its involvement in cancer, as alterations in SMC1A can impair the DNA damage response pathway, leading to defective DNA repair mechanisms (Musio2020The).

## Interactions
The SMC1A protein is a core component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion. It forms a heterodimer with SMC3, creating a coiled-coil structure with ATPase activity crucial for cohesin's function (Musio2020The). The cohesin complex also includes RAD21 and SA1/SA2 subunits, which interact with SMC1A (Musio2020The). SMC1A interacts with several other proteins, such as NIPBL, ESCO2, PDS5A, and PDS5B, which contribute to its function. NIPBL is required for cohesin loading onto chromatin, while ESCO2 is necessary for establishing physical bridges between sister chromatids during the S phase (Mannini2010Spectrum).

SMC1A is involved in chromatin interactions, particularly in enhancer-promoter interactions, and often co-localizes with the insulator protein CTCF, which can block enhancer-promoter communication (DeMare2013The). It also interacts with various splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins, such as SF3B1 and RBM10, which are crucial for mitotic progression (Kim2019Systematic). These interactions occur in the chromatin fraction and do not require DNA or RNA, as demonstrated by experiments involving RNase and DNase treatments (Kim2019Systematic). SMC1A's interactions with RAD21 and nucleotides are mediated by specific conformational dynamics and interface plasticity, which are crucial for its ATPase activity (Gomes2022The).
