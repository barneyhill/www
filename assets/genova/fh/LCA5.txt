# LCA5

## Overview
The LCA5 gene encodes the protein lebercilin, which is integral to the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Lebercilin is a non-globular protein characterized by its coiled-coil domains and its role as a molecular scaffold in intraflagellar transport (IFT), a critical process for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in photoreceptors. The protein facilitates the proper localization and trafficking of essential phototransducing proteins, such as rhodopsin, by interacting with components of the IFT machinery. Mutations in the LCA5 gene are linked to Leber congenital amaurosis, a severe retinal dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Faber2023Gene; Boldt2012Disruption).

## Structure
The LCA5 protein, also known as lebercilin, is encoded by the LCA5 gene and plays a crucial role in photoreceptor function. The primary structure of LCA5 consists of 697 amino acids, encoded by seven exons, and includes two coiled-coil domains (Qu2019Knocking). These coiled-coil regions contribute to the secondary structure of LCA5, which is characterized by a high helical content and the ability to form coiled coils independently (Szaniszló2022The).

In terms of tertiary structure, LCA5 lacks globular domains and is composed of long disordered segments interspersed with coiled-coil regions. The most conserved part of LCA5 corresponds to the Lebercilin PFAM family, overlapping with the N-terminal coiled-coil region, while the C-terminal part is largely disordered (Szaniszló2022The).

LCA5 exhibits quaternary structure through its ability to form oligomeric complexes. It naturally forms low-order oligomers, and its oligomerization is enhanced by interaction with the dynein light chain LC8, which stabilizes coiled-coil interactions and promotes higher-order oligomer formation (Szaniszló2022The). The minimal oligomeric form of LCA5 is tetrameric, and LC8 interconnects LCA5 units in a non-saturated, multivalent binding mode (Szaniszló2022The).

## Function
The LCA5 gene encodes the protein lebercilin, which is crucial for the function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. In healthy human cells, lebercilin is localized at the cilium that connects the inner and outer segments of photoreceptors, playing a significant role in intraflagellar transport (IFT) (Boldt2012Disruption). This transport system is essential for the bidirectional movement of protein complexes along ciliary microtubules, facilitating the transport of proteins and membrane vesicles necessary for the assembly and maintenance of cilia (Boldt2012Disruption). Lebercilin interacts with IFT complex B and some IFT complex A proteins, ensuring the proper formation and function of photoreceptor outer segments and preventing the mislocalization of phototransducing proteins (Boldt2012Disruption).

Lebercilin acts as a molecular scaffold, connecting the IFT core machinery to proteins involved in selecting and recruiting cargo, which is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of photoreceptor cells (Boldt2012Disruption). It is also involved in the proper localization and trafficking of rhodopsin, a key protein in photoreceptor function, and regulates the trafficking of IFT-B proteins at the bulge region, essential for rhodopsin transport and outer segment membrane disc formation (Faber2023Probing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LCA5 gene, which encodes the protein lebercilin, are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe form of inherited retinal dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness. These mutations disrupt the function of photoreceptors, particularly affecting the trafficking of intraflagellar transport proteins and the formation of photoreceptor outer segments, resulting in rapid photoreceptor degeneration (Uyhazi2020Treatment; Faber2023Gene). LCA5 mutations are a rare cause of LCA, accounting for approximately 2% of cases, and are specifically linked to a severe form of LCA Type II (Mackay2013Screening; Gerber2007Mutations).

The clinical manifestations of LCA5-related LCA include severe visual impairment from birth, nystagmus, and extensive peripheral field loss. Fundus examinations often reveal widespread retinal atrophy and peculiar white dots at the retinal pigment epithelium level (Mackay2013Screening). Gene augmentation therapy has shown potential in partially restoring photoreceptor structure and function, suggesting a therapeutic approach for LCA5-related retinal diseases (Faber2023Gene). However, the therapy's efficacy is limited by incomplete targeting of all photoreceptors and variability in outcomes (Faber2023Gene).

## Interactions
LCA5, also known as lebercilin, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in ciliary function and photoreceptor maintenance. It physically interacts with LC8 (DYNLL2), a dynein light chain, through two short linear motifs within LCA5. This interaction enhances the oligomerization of LCA5, forming higher-order oligomers that are important for the structural organization of the ciliary-centrosome system (Szaniszló2022The). The binding of LC8 to LCA5 is mediated by motifs containing VQT and CQS tripeptides, with the VQT motif aligning with the standard LC8 binding motif (Szaniszló2022The).

LCA5 also interacts with intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins, which are essential for photoreceptor cilia function. Mutations in LCA5 disrupt these interactions, leading to defects in IFT and associated proteins, which are critical for maintaining photoreceptor cilia function (Boldt2012Disruption). Additionally, LCA5 interacts with proteins such as PCM1, CEP290, and RP1, which are associated with photoreceptor function and ciliary structure. These interactions suggest that LCA5 is integral to the organization and function of photoreceptor cells (Faber2023Probing).
