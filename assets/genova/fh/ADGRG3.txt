# ADGRG3

## Overview
ADGRG3 is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G3 (GPR97), a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and a large extracellular region containing the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is essential for receptor activation through autoproteolysis (Pohl2023Structural; Langenhan2019Adhesion). GPR97 is primarily expressed in human granulocytes and plays a significant role in immune responses, particularly in regulating antimicrobial activity and inflammation (Hsiao2018The). The receptor is involved in complex signaling pathways that enhance the production of reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes, contributing to its function in immune cell activation and tissue homeostasis (Chu2022GPR97). Additionally, GPR97 is implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, due to its role in modulating immune cell function and signaling pathways (Zhao2021The).

## Structure
The ADGRG3 protein, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G3, is characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain structure typical of the GPCR family. It features a large extracellular region that includes the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is crucial for receptor autoproteolysis and activation (Pohl2023Structural; Langenhan2019Adhesion). The GAIN domain consists of two subdomains: an N-terminal subdomain A with α-helices and a C-terminal subdomain B with β-strands arranged in a twisted β-sandwich (Maser2020Adhesion). This domain facilitates the cleavage of the receptor into an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF), which can remain non-covalently attached (Maser2020Adhesion).

The transmembrane domain of ADGRG3 is noted for its unique arrangement, where TM6 and TM7 are positioned closer together, creating additional space for ligand binding. The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) forms a flap over these transmembrane segments, acting as a lid for the ligand-binding site (Ping2021Structures). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common, potentially affecting receptor function and localization (Folts2019Adhesion). Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, which can influence the receptor's functional properties (Folts2019Adhesion).

## Function
The ADGRG3 gene encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor GPR97, which is primarily expressed in human granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. GPR97 plays a crucial role in regulating antimicrobial activity within these cells. It is a proteolytically processed, N-glycosylated receptor that is upregulated during systemic inflammation. Upon activation, GPR97 enhances neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and proteolytic enzyme activity, which are associated with increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and IκBα. This signaling pathway involves a switch from Gαs/cAMP-mediated signal transduction to a Gαi-induced reduction in cAMP levels, along with an increase in downstream effectors of Gβγ, such as SRE and NF-κB, thereby enhancing the bacteria uptake and killing activity of neutrophils (Hsiao2018The).

GPR97 is also involved in the formation of a macromolecular complex with CD177, PAR2, and CD16b, which is crucial for the activation of membrane proteinase 3 (mPR3) in neutrophils. This complex triggers strong inflammatory responses and antimicrobial activities, highlighting GPR97's role in immune responses and tissue homeostasis (Chu2022GPR97). Additionally, GPR97 is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, where it regulates cell migration and adhesion, potentially influencing lymphangiogenesis (Valtcheva2013The).

## Clinical Significance
ADGRG3, also known as GPR97, is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in immune cell function and signaling pathways. Alterations in ADGRG3 expression have been linked to immune system disorders, particularly in the context of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, the absence of GPR97 leads to increased activation of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in extensive demyelination and heightened CD4+ T cell infiltration in the central nervous system. This exacerbates the disease condition, as evidenced by a severe increase in the Th1/Th17 ratio and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-6 (Zhao2021The).

In granulocytes, ADGRG3 expression is induced during systemic inflammation, such as in pneumonia or endotoxemia. Its activation enhances reactive oxygen species production and proteolytic enzyme activity via NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways, suggesting a role in regulating antimicrobial functions (Morgan2019The). These findings indicate that dysregulation of ADGRG3 can contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating such diseases.
