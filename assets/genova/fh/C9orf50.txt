# C9orf50

## Overview
C9orf50, or chromosome 9 open reading frame 50, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is currently categorized as an uncharacterized protein. The protein is known to interact with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in human testis, suggesting a potential regulatory role in cellular processes through its PP1 binding motif (Fardilha2011Identification). Although the specific functions of the C9orf50 protein remain largely unexplored, its involvement in cancer-related processes, particularly colorectal cancer, has been highlighted in recent studies. The gene's methylation status has been proposed as a biomarker for early detection of colorectal cancer, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity (Cao2021KCNQ5). Despite its emerging significance in cancer research, further investigation is required to fully elucidate the biological roles and clinical implications of C9orf50 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C9orf50 has been investigated for its potential role in cancer, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown that methylation of C9orf50 in stool DNA is significantly higher in CRC patients compared to those with no evidence of disease, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early CRC detection (Cao2021KCNQ5). The sensitivity and specificity of detecting CRC using methylated C9orf50 alone are 85.9% and 95.0%, respectively, indicating its clinical utility in distinguishing CRC from other conditions like advanced adenomas and small polyps (Cao2021KCNQ5).

C9orf50 is also frequently mentioned in the context of cancer-related studies, appearing in at least six publications that associate it with malignant transformation. It is often included in transcriptomic or methylation signatures that correlate with disease prognosis, highlighting its potential prognostic significance in cancer (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, specific details on the clinical significance of C9orf50 beyond its use as a biomarker for CRC are not well-documented. The gene's role in other diseases or conditions remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to understand its broader clinical implications.

## Interactions
C9orf50 is identified as a protein that interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in human testis. It contains a canonical PP1 binding motif (RVRF), which suggests its role as a PP1 binding protein. This motif indicates that C9orf50 may participate in interactions with PP1, potentially influencing various cellular processes through this binding (Fardilha2011Identification). However, specific details about the physical interactions of C9orf50 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available literature. The focus has been primarily on identifying potential PP1 interacting proteins and the presence of PP1 binding motifs in these proteins, rather than detailing the interactions of C9orf50 beyond its binding motif (Fardilha2011Identification).

In the context of cancer research, C9orf50 is frequently mentioned in cancer-related publications, suggesting its potential involvement in cancer-related processes. However, the specific physical interactions of C9orf50 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The current research emphasizes the prognostic significance of ORF genes like C9orf50, but detailed interaction studies remain unexplored.
