# ATXN3L

## Overview
ATXN3L is a gene that encodes the protein ataxin 3-like, which is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. This protein is involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it functions to remove ubiquitin moieties from specific substrates, thereby influencing their stability and degradation. Ataxin 3-like shares structural and functional similarities with ataxin-3, a protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Machado-Joseph disease. The ATXN3L gene has been studied for its involvement in various cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it plays a role in modulating cell proliferation and survival outcomes. Its potential as a therapeutic target is under investigation due to its significant impact on cellular processes and disease pathogenesis (Zhou2022MJDs; Ge2015Ataxin3).

## Clinical Significance
ATXN3L has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein homeostasis and interactions with other proteins. In breast cancer, ATXN3L acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme for Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), stabilizing it and promoting cancer cell proliferation. Knockdown of ATXN3L leads to decreased KLF5 levels and reduced cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer (Ge2015Ataxin3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ATXN3L expression is associated with better survival outcomes, including disease-specific survival and overall survival. Lower promoter methylation levels of ATXN3L in HCC tissues correlate with higher mRNA expression, indicating a potential protective role in this cancer type (Zhou2022MJDs).

ATXN3L is also linked to neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinocerebellar ataxias, due to its similarity to ataxin-3, which is involved in protein aggregation and cellular stress responses. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, ATXN3L's dysfunction may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Zeng2020MachadoJoseph; Felício2023Functional). The gene's role in regulating PTEN transcription in lung cancer cells further highlights its clinical significance (Sacco2013The).
