# ZNF468

## Overview
ZNF468 is a gene located on chromosome 19q13 that encodes the zinc finger protein 468, a member of the C2H2 type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its 11 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding and are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation (Sun2005A). ZNF468 exists in two splice variants, ZNF468.1 and ZNF468.2, with the former containing a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain that is involved in transcriptional repression through interactions with corepressor proteins such as TIF1β (Sun2005A). The absence of the KRAB domain in ZNF468.2 suggests functional divergence between the isoforms. ZNF468 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, and has been associated with oncogenic activities in several cancers, notably breast cancer, where it influences tumor growth and chemoresistance (Jia2024Zinc).

## Structure
The ZNF468 protein is a member of the human C2H2 type zinc finger protein gene family, characterized by the presence of 11 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at the C-terminal region, which are involved in DNA binding (Sun2005A). These motifs are defined by conserved cysteine and histidine residues that form a ββα fold, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and zinc ion chelation (Sun2005A). 

ZNF468 has two splice variants, ZNF468.1 and ZNF468.2. The ZNF468.1 variant includes a double Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain near the N-terminal, consisting of KRAB boxes A and B, which is absent in ZNF468.2 due to an additional exon (Sun2005A). The KRAB domain is known for its role in transcriptional repression through interactions with corepressor proteins like TIF1β (Sun2005A). The linker region between the KRAB domain and the zinc finger motifs provides flexibility, enhancing independent interactions with target DNA and corepressors (Sun2005A).

The molecular mass of ZNF468.1 is approximately 60.5 kDa, while ZNF468.2 is about 51.0 kDa (Sun2005A). The absence of the KRAB domain in ZNF468.2 suggests functional differences between the two isoforms (Sun2005A).

## Function
ZNF468 is a zinc finger protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. It is part of the C2H2 type zinc finger protein family and is located on chromosome 19q13. ZNF468 has two splice variants, ZNF468.1 and ZNF468.2, which are co-expressed in various tissues except the heart and brain (Sun2005A). ZNF468.1 contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is a transcriptional repressor domain involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression. This domain is evolutionarily conserved and interacts with corepressors like TIF1β, indicating its potential involvement in transcriptional regulation (Sun2005A). In contrast, ZNF468.2 lacks the KRAB domain due to an additional exon, which may alter its repressive function (Sun2005A).

The C2H2-type zinc finger motifs present in both variants are known for their DNA-binding capabilities, which are crucial for the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells (Sun2005A). The exact biological functions of ZNF468 in healthy cells are not fully understood, but KRAB-containing proteins like ZNF468 are thought to be involved in processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Sun2005A).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF468 has been implicated in the progression and treatment resistance of several cancers, most notably breast cancer (BC). Overexpression of ZNF468 is observed in BC patients and is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Jia2024Zinc). In breast cancer cells, ZNF468 promotes proliferation, growth, and migration, while also reducing sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (Jia2024Zinc). This resistance is mediated through the up-regulation of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) gene, which ZNF468 directly activates by binding to its promoter (Jia2024Zinc). The ZNF468/TFAM axis is crucial for the malignant growth and cisplatin resistance of BC cells, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Jia2024Zinc).

Beyond breast cancer, ZNF468 is overexpressed in other cancer types, including bladder cancer, cervical cancer, glioma, and lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its broader role in oncogenesis (Jia2024Zinc). The clinical significance of ZNF468 in these cancers remains an area of active research, with its expression levels potentially serving as a diagnostic marker or predictor of treatment response.

## Interactions
ZNF468, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence its function as a transcription factor. The ZNF468.1 variant contains KRAB A and B domains, which are known to mediate transcriptional repression through protein-protein interactions. The KRAB A domain, in particular, is highly conserved and interacts with TIF1β, a corepressor, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression (Sun2005A). In contrast, the ZNF468.2 variant lacks the KRAB domain due to an additional exon, indicating it may not participate in the same repressive interactions as ZNF468.1 (Sun2005A).

In the context of breast cancer, ZNF468 has been shown to interact with the promoter of the TFAM gene, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells and contributes to cisplatin resistance (Jia2024Zinc). The ZNF468/TFAM axis is identified as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer, highlighting the significance of ZNF468's interaction with TFAM in cancer progression (Jia2024Zinc). These interactions underscore the diverse roles of ZNF468 in cellular processes and disease states.
