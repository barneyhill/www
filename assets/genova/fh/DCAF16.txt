# DCAF16

## Overview
DCAF16, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a crucial component of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is primarily involved in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation via the proteasome, thereby regulating protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. DCAF16 acts as an adaptor protein within this complex, recognizing and binding specific substrates to facilitate their ubiquitination. Notably, DCAF16 plays a significant role in the degradation of BRD4, a member of the BET family of proteins, through its interaction with molecular glue degraders such as GNE11 and TMX1. The protein's structure, characterized by a helix-loop-helix motif, is essential for its interaction with DDB1 and BRD4 BD2, forming a ternary complex that is critical for the ubiquitin-proteasome system's function (Li2024Templateassisted).

## Function
DCAF16 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16) is a protein that functions as part of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is crucial for regulating protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. DCAF16 acts as an adaptor within this complex, recognizing specific substrates for ubiquitination (Li2024Templateassisted).

In the context of molecular glue degraders, DCAF16 is involved in the degradation of BRD4, a member of the BET family of proteins. This degradation is facilitated by compounds such as GNE11 and TMX1, which induce BRD4 degradation via a ubiquitin-proteasome system mechanism. DCAF16 is essential for this process, as its knockout prevents BRD4 degradation (Li2024Templateassisted). The protein's structure, characterized by a helix-loop-helix motif, allows it to interact with DDB1 and BRD4 BD2, forming a significant interface area necessary for the stabilization of the ternary complex required for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation (Li2024Templateassisted).

DCAF16's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences various cellular processes through its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Li2024Templateassisted).

## Interactions
DCAF16 is involved in several key protein interactions, primarily as part of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It forms a ternary complex with BRD4 BD2 and MMH2, which has been structurally characterized using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In this complex, DCAF16 is anchored to DDB1 through a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif, distinct from canonical DCAFs. The amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions of DCAF16 form a four-helix bundle stabilized by a zinc atom, creating the primary interface with BRD4 BD2. This interaction involves major contacts contributed by α1, α7, and the loop between α7 and α8, with a total interface area of 560 Å² (Li2024Templateassisted).

The interaction between DCAF16 and BRD4 BD2 is crucial for the activity of molecular glue degraders, which facilitate the covalent modification of DCAF16 at Cys58. This modification is necessary for the stabilization of the ternary complex and subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation of BRD4 (Li2024Templateassisted). DCAF16 also interacts with other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, such as DDB1, RBX1, and CUL4A, to facilitate the degradation of BRD4 in the presence of compounds like TMX1 and GNE11 (Li2024Templateassisted).
