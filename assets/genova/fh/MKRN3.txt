# MKRN3

## Overview
MKRN3 (makorin ring finger protein 3) is a gene located on chromosome 15q11-q13, known for its critical role in the regulation of puberty onset. It encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Li2020MKRN3). The protein product of MKRN3 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, particularly affecting the stability and translation of GNRH1 mRNA, a key hormone in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that controls the initiation of puberty (Li2021MKRN3mediated). MKRN3's activity is primarily localized in the hypothalamus, where it helps maintain prepubertal status by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (Naulé2023MKRN3). Mutations in MKRN3 are associated with central precocious puberty, highlighting its clinical significance in the timing of pubertal development (Abreu2013Central).

## Structure


## Function
MKRN3 (makorin ring finger protein 3) is a maternally imprinted gene located on chromosome 15q11-q13, known for its role as an inhibitor of puberty onset. It encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is crucial for the regulation of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Li2020MKRN3). In healthy human cells, MKRN3 mediates the ubiquitination of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), affecting mRNA stability and translation, particularly for GNRH1 mRNA, a key hormone in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis that controls puberty (Li2021MKRN3mediated).

MKRN3's ubiquitination activity influences the formation of the translation initiation complex by affecting the interaction between PABPC1 and EIF4G1, thereby regulating the stability and translation of GNRH1 mRNA (Li2021MKRN3mediated). This process is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of GNRH1 mRNA levels, which in turn regulates the timing of puberty initiation (Li2021MKRN3mediated).

MKRN3 also interacts with methyl-DNA binding protein 3 (MBD3) to epigenetically silence GNRH1 transcription, further influencing puberty onset (Li2020MKRN3). The gene's activity is primarily located in the hypothalamus, where it helps maintain prepubertal status by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (Naulé2023MKRN3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MKRN3 gene are significantly associated with central precocious puberty (CPP), a condition characterized by the early onset of puberty. These mutations are typically paternally inherited due to the gene's imprinted nature, where only the paternal allele is expressed. Loss-of-function mutations in MKRN3 lead to premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in early pubertal development, advanced bone age, and accelerated growth in affected individuals (Abreu2015A; Abreu2013Central).

MKRN3 mutations include frameshift, nonsense, and missense variants, many of which are located in critical protein domains such as the zinc finger and RING finger motifs. These mutations disrupt the gene's function as an inhibitor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, leading to the early onset of puberty (Abreu2020MKRN3; Maione2020Makorin). The gene's role in inhibiting the reproductive axis is mediated through its actions in kisspeptin-expressing neurons, where it represses the promoter activity of KISS1 and TAC3, genes involved in GnRH regulation (Abreu2020MKRN3).

The clinical significance of MKRN3 mutations is underscored by their presence in approximately 9% of CPP cases, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in families with a history of precocious puberty (Maione2020Makorin).

## Interactions
MKRN3, a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in regulating puberty onset. One of its primary interactions is with the MBD3 protein, which MKRN3 ubiquitinates. This ubiquitination affects MBD3's ability to bind to the GNRH1 promoter, thereby influencing the expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and delaying puberty onset (Li2020MKRN3). 

MKRN3 also interacts with IGF2BP1, a protein involved in mRNA regulation. This interaction is significant for maintaining hypothalamic plasticity and development, which are essential for the timing of puberty. The interaction with IGF2BP1 suggests a role for MKRN3 in regulating mRNA translation and protein levels in the hypothalamus (Naulé2023MKRN3).

Additionally, MKRN3 has been shown to interact with several other proteins, including those involved in RNA and DNA processes, cytoskeleton function, and ubiquitination. These interactions highlight MKRN3's role in complex regulatory networks that influence puberty timing (Naulé2023MKRN3). Despite these interactions, some studies suggest that MKRN3 does not directly influence GNRH1 expression (Yellapragada2019MKRN3).
