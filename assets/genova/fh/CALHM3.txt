# CALHM3

## Overview
CALHM3, or calcium homeostasis modulator 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of calcium ion homeostasis and neurotransmission. The protein forms a hetero-hexameric channel complex with CALHM1, which is crucial for its function in taste perception. This channel is a non-selective, fast-activating voltage-gated channel that is permeable to large molecules, including ATP, and is primarily located in the basolateral membrane of type II taste bud cells. The CALHM1/CALHM3 channel mediates the release of ATP in response to taste stimuli, thereby activating gustatory nerves and contributing to the perception of taste. The protein's structure includes four transmembrane domains, with specific intracellular regions that contain conserved sorting motifs, although additional non-canonical signals may also play a role in its localization (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3).

## Structure
The CALHM3 protein is characterized by its predicted membrane topology, which includes four transmembrane domains. Both the carboxyl terminus (Cter) and amino terminus (Nter) are located intracellularly, with specific regions identified as M1-E16 for the Nter, R72-D91 for the intracellular loop, and P203-V348 for the Cter (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The protein forms part of a hetero-hexameric channel with CALHM1, where each subunit contains these four transmembrane domains (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3).

The quaternary structure of CALHM3 involves its assembly into a channel complex with CALHM1, which is sorted to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, including taste cells (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The channel's sorting is influenced by intrinsic signals within the Cter and Loop regions, which contain conserved basolateral sorting motifs such as tyrosine-based and dileucine motifs (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). Despite mutations in these motifs, the basolateral delivery remains unchanged, indicating the presence of additional sorting signals (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The study of CALHM3's structure primarily focuses on its transmembrane topology and intracellular domains, with no detailed information on its secondary or tertiary structures provided.

## Function
CALHM3, or calcium homeostasis modulator 3, is a protein that forms part of a heteromeric channel with CALHM1, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to calcium ion homeostasis and neurotransmission. This channel is a non-selective, fast-activating voltage-gated channel that is permeable to large molecules, including ATP. It is primarily located in the basolateral membrane of type II taste bud cells (TBCs), where it is crucial for neurotransmitter release, particularly in taste perception (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3).

The CALHM1/CALHM3 channel mediates the release of ATP in response to taste stimuli, which subsequently activates gustatory nerves, contributing to the perception of taste (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The channel's localization to the basolateral membrane is regulated by specific motifs in its structure, such as a dileucine motif in the Loop and a tyrosine-based motif in the C-terminal region, which are responsible for its sorting (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). Although these motifs are functional, they are not essential for the basolateral delivery of the CALHM1/CALHM3 channel complex, suggesting the presence of non-canonical sorting signals (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3).

## Interactions
CALHM3 forms a hetero-hexameric channel complex with CALHM1, which is essential for its function in taste perception. This channel is a non-selective, fast-activating voltage-gated channel that is permeable to large molecules, including ATP. The CALHM1/CALHM3 channel is localized in the basolateral membrane of type II taste bud cells, where it plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release by interacting with P2X2/3R ion channels on gustatory nerves (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The interaction between CALHM1 and CALHM3 is direct, as they form a heteromeric complex, which is critical for the channel's sorting to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The study identifies canonical basolateral sorting signals, such as tyrosine-based and dileucine motifs, in both CALHM1 and CALHM3, which are involved in their localization, although non-canonical signals may also contribute (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). While the study provides insights into the sorting and localization of the CALHM1/CALHM3 complex, it does not specifically address other physical interactions of CALHM3 with proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in forming this channel complex (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3).
