# DNAAF3

## Overview
DNAAF3, or dynein axonemal assembly factor 3, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the assembly and function of motile cilia. The protein, also named dynein axonemal assembly factor 3, is categorized as a molecular chaperone involved in the cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dynein arms, which are essential motor protein complexes for ciliary and flagellar movement (Smith2022The). DNAAF3 is part of a broader network of dynein axonemal assembly factors that facilitate the proper folding, stabilization, and transport of dynein components into the ciliary axoneme, ensuring the functional integrity of cilia (Smith2022The). Mutations in the DNAAF3 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder that impairs ciliary motility and leads to various clinical manifestations, including respiratory complications and situs inversus totalis (Brennan2021Emerging; Guo2019Clinical).

## Function
DNAAF3 (dynein axonemal assembly factor 3) is a crucial protein involved in the assembly and function of cilia, which are essential for cellular motility and various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, DNAAF3 plays a significant role in the cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dynein arms, which are motor protein complexes necessary for the movement of motile cilia and flagella (Smith2022The). These dynein arms are critical for the proper function of cilia, which are involved in respiratory function and embryonic development.

DNAAF3 is part of a network of dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs) that facilitate the folding, stabilization, and transport of dynein components into the ciliary axoneme (Smith2022The). It interacts with other DNAAFs, such as DNAAF1 and DNAAF2, to form complexes that are essential for the assembly of both outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs) (Smith2022The). These interactions suggest that DNAAF3 may act as an adaptor or specificity factor in recruiting dynein chain clients to chaperone complexes, ensuring the proper assembly and function of dynein arms in cilia (Smith2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAAF3 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by defects in the structure and function of motile cilia. These mutations lead to impaired ciliary motility, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms including recurrent respiratory infections, neonatal respiratory distress, and chronic sinusitis (Guo2019Clinical). Patients with DNAAF3 mutations often exhibit reduced nasal nitric oxide levels and immotile respiratory cilia due to defects in the dynein arms, which are crucial for ciliary movement (Guo2019Clinical).

PCD can also present with situs inversus totalis, a condition where the major visceral organs are mirrored from their normal positions, due to the role of cilia in determining organ laterality during embryonic development (Brennan2021Emerging; Guo2019Clinical). The genetic heterogeneity of PCD is notable, with DNAAF3 being one of the many genes implicated in the disorder (Guo2019Clinical). The identification of novel DNAAF3 mutations through genetic analysis, such as whole-exome sequencing, has expanded the mutation spectrum, aiding in better genetic diagnosis and counseling for affected individuals (Guo2019Clinical).
