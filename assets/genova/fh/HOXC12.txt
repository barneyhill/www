# HOXC12

## Overview
The HOXC12 gene is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene family, which plays a crucial role in regulating the development of anatomical structures during embryogenesis. It encodes the homeobox C12 protein, a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of gene expression, morphogenesis, and differentiation. As a transcription factor, homeobox C12 binds to specific DNA sequences, influencing the expression of target genes that are essential for proper developmental processes. The HOXC12 gene is part of the HOXC gene cluster located on chromosome 12, and its expression is tightly regulated during development. Alterations in HOXC12 expression have been linked to congenital malformations and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease states (Alvarado2016Deletions; Brotto2020Contributions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HOXC12 gene have been associated with various congenital and pathological conditions. In the context of congenital lower limb malformations, deletions in the 5' HOXC gene cluster, including HOXC12, have been linked to conditions such as clubfoot and vertical talus. These deletions can lead to defects in limb morphogenesis, including shortened and overlapping toes and peroneus muscle hypoplasia. The study by Alvarado et al. identified microdeletions in chromosome 12q13.13 affecting the 5' HOXC genes in families with these malformations, suggesting a potential role of HOXC12 in their etiology (Alvarado2016Deletions).

In cancer, HOXC12 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene. It is inactivated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lymphomas due to somatic mutations and alterations in DNA methylation. The methylation of a CpG island between HOXC11 and HOXC12 correlates with increased HOTAIR lncRNA expression, which is associated with cancer progression and poor outcomes in breast cancer patients. Although the precise role of HOXC12 in DNA repair and genomic instability is not fully understood, it is involved in cellular proliferation and epigenetic modifications (Brotto2020Contributions).
