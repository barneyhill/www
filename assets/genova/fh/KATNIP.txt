# KATNIP

## Overview
KATNIP, encoded by the KIAA0556 gene, is a protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and ciliary function. It is categorized as a ciliary-base protein and is known for its interaction with katanin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, which underscores its involvement in microtubule organization and endosomal trafficking. The protein's structure includes specific functional domains, such as the Gli-binding domain and the Nephronophthisis-1-interacting domain, which are essential for its interactions and functions (Niceta2020Cooccurrence). Mutations in the KIAA0556 gene have been linked to Joubert syndrome, a condition characterized by neurological abnormalities, highlighting the clinical significance of KATNIP in human health (Niceta2020Cooccurrence). Research has also demonstrated KATNIP's interaction with CFAP161, a component of motile cilia, further emphasizing its role in ciliary and microtubule-related processes (Beckers2021The).

## Structure
The KATNIP protein, encoded by the KIAA0556 gene, is involved in ciliary function and is associated with Joubert syndrome when mutated. The molecular structure of KATNIP includes 1618 amino acid residues and features specific functional domains such as the Gli-binding domain and the Nephronophthisis-1-interacting domain (Niceta2020Cooccurrence). These domains are crucial for its interaction with other proteins and its role in microtubule organization. A truncating variant in the KIAA0556 gene has been identified, which is predicted to cause premature protein termination, affecting the protein's function (Niceta2020Cooccurrence).

KATNIP is a ciliary-base protein, and its interaction with katanin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, suggests its involvement in microtubule dynamics. The protein's structure is essential for maintaining microtubule function and regulating endosomal trafficking, as indicated by studies on adaptive traits in cold environments (Greco2023Comparative). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of functional domains highlights its complex structural organization. The protein's role in ciliary function is further supported by knockout mouse models showing a brain-restricted phenotype associated with Joubert syndrome (Niceta2020Cooccurrence).

## Function


## Interactions
KATNIP, also known as KIAA0556, is a protein that interacts with katanin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, and plays a role in microtubule dynamics. It is involved in maintaining microtubule function, promoting their repair in case of damage, and regulating endosomal trafficking (Greco2023Comparative). KATNIP has been identified as a significant interaction partner of CFAP161, a component of motile cilia, through mass spectrometry. This interaction was validated using yeast-two-hybrid analysis, suggesting a role for KATNIP in microtubule organization or function (Beckers2021The). 

KATNIP is also implicated in Joubert syndrome, where mutations in the KIAA0556 gene, which encodes KATNIP, have been associated with the condition. These mutations are predicted to be damaging, leading to premature protein termination, which may affect its interactions and functions (Niceta2020Cooccurrence). Despite these findings, specific details on the physical interactions of KATNIP with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its interaction with CFAP161 are not extensively documented in the available literature.
