# FBXW10B

## Overview
FBXW10B is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 10B, which is a member of the F-box protein family. These proteins are characterized by an F-box motif, approximately 40 amino acids in length, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. The F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein), which plays a pivotal role in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box and WD repeat domain containing 10B protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation, by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase due to its role in the ubiquitination pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
