# TNFSF8

## Overview
TNFSF8, also known as CD30 ligand, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, specifically categorized as a type II transmembrane protein. The protein, TNF superfamily member 8, is characterized by its intracellular N terminus and extracellular C terminus, which includes a TNF homology domain crucial for its function (Wiens2011Origin). This domain facilitates the formation of a homotrimeric structure, enabling interaction with its receptor, CD30, and initiating signaling pathways such as MAP kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB, which are vital for cell differentiation and apoptosis (Wei2011Association; Wu2022Molecular). TNFSF8 is predominantly expressed in immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, and plays a significant role in immune regulation and cell signaling, particularly in lymphoid tissues (Wei2011Association). The gene's involvement in various diseases, such as lung cancer and inflammatory disorders, underscores its clinical significance (Fava2014Association; Wei2011Association).

## Structure
TNFSF8, also known as CD30 ligand, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. It is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by an intracellular N terminus and an extracellular C terminus. The protein contains a TNF homology domain (THD) located in the C terminus, which is a common feature among TNF superfamily ligands (Wiens2011Origin). This domain is composed of 10 β-strands that form a homotrimeric structure, allowing for interaction with its receptor, CD30 (Wu2022Molecular). The trimeric formation is crucial for initiating signaling pathways, such as those involving the MAP kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB, which are important for cell differentiation and apoptosis (Wei2011Association).

TNFSF8 is primarily expressed in immune cells, including T cells, B cells, neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and is upregulated in certain tumor cells (Wei2011Association). The protein's structure is similar to other TNF superfamily members, such as TNFα, TNFβ, CD40 ligand, and FAS ligand, indicating a conserved structural motif within this family (Wei2011Association). Specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of TNFSF8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The TNFSF8 gene, also known as CD30 ligand or CD153, encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in T cells, B cells, neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, and macrophages under non-pathological conditions (Wei2011Association). TNFSF8 functions as the exclusive ligand for the CD30 receptor, and upon binding, it activates the CD30 receptor, which subsequently engages the MAP kinase in the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. This interaction is crucial for processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and immune response (Wei2011Association).

In healthy human cells, TNFSF8 is involved in immune regulation and cell signaling, playing a significant role in T-cell activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is active in lymphoid tissues, where it contributes to the regulation of immune responses (Wei2011Association). The protein's interaction with CD30 suggests its involvement in immune-mediated inflammation and apoptosis, particularly in lung tissue, although its specific roles in healthy cells are less well-documented (Wei2011Association). Despite the presence of ligand-independent CD30 expression in some cell lines, TNFSF8 remains a key regulator of CD30 function (Wei2011Association).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFSF8 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of lung cancer, a novel functional promoter variant, rs2075533, in the TNFSF8 gene has been linked to lung cancer risk. This variant affects transcription factor binding, specifically disrupting the activator protein 1 binding site, which leads to decreased promoter activity and potentially influences lung cancer susceptibility (Wei2011Association). 

In leprosy patients, TNFSF8 regulatory variants have been associated with Type 1 reactions (T1R), characterized by excessive inflammatory responses. These variants are not linked to leprosy itself but contribute to the risk of T1R, highlighting the gene's role in immune response regulation (Fava2014Association).

The TNFSF8 gene has also been implicated in spondylarthritis (SpA), an inflammatory rheumatic disorder. A rare intronic SNP, rs3181357, in TNFSF8 has shown a significant association with SpA, suggesting that genetic predisposition to this condition involves non-MHC genetic components (Zinovieva2011Systematic).

Additionally, TNFSF8 genetic variants, such as rs3181366 and rs2295800, have been associated with an increased risk of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, potentially affecting mRNA transcription and immune response (Fu2021Genetic).

## Interactions
TNFSF8, also known as CD30 ligand, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and primarily interacts with the CD30 receptor. This interaction plays a significant role in immune regulation, influencing T-cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wei2011Association). TNFSF8 is involved in the TNFSF8/AMPK/JNK signaling pathway, where it interacts with proteins such as AMPK and JNK. Upregulation of TNFSF8 inhibits AMPK activation and increases JNK activity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis (Zhang2022Neuroprotective). 

The interaction between TNFSF8 and miR-483-5p is also notable. miR-483-5p targets the 3′-UTR of TNFSF8, leading to decreased mRNA and protein levels of TNFSF8, which is associated with reduced apoptosis and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis (Zhang2022Neuroprotective). This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where miR-483-5p modulates TNFSF8 expression to exert neuroprotective effects (Zhang2022Neuroprotective). 

Additionally, TNFSF8 interacts with other proteins such as Caspase 6, ATN1, and USP25, indicating its involvement in multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms (Zhang2022Neuroprotective). These interactions highlight the complex role of TNFSF8 in cellular stress responses and immune regulation.
