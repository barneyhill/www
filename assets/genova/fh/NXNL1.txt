# NXNL1

## Overview
The NXNL1 gene encodes two distinct protein products, Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor (RdCVF) and its longer form, RdCVFL, through alternative splicing. RdCVF is a truncated thioredoxin-like protein that, despite lacking enzymatic activity, plays a pivotal role in promoting the survival of cone photoreceptors, particularly under conditions of retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (Elachouri2015Thioredoxin). In contrast, RdCVFL retains thioredoxin enzymatic activity and is involved in protecting photoreceptors from oxidative damage by reducing oxidized cysteines in proteins (AïtAli2022The). These proteins are integral to the maintenance of photoreceptor health, with RdCVF enhancing glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in cones, while RdCVFL interacts with proteins like TAU to prevent oxidative stress (Fridlich2009The). The NXNL1 gene's products are thus crucial for cellular redox balance and photoreceptor viability, making them significant targets for therapeutic strategies in retinal degenerative diseases and potentially other conditions involving oxidative stress.

## Structure
The NXNL1 gene encodes two protein products through alternative splicing: Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor (RdCVF) and a longer form, RdCVFL. RdCVF is a truncated thioredoxin-like protein that lacks enzymatic activity but plays a crucial role in promoting cone survival, particularly in the context of retinal degenerative diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (Elachouri2015Thioredoxin). RdCVFL, on the other hand, retains thioredoxin enzymatic activity and is involved in protecting photoreceptors from oxidative damage (Elachouri2015Thioredoxin). 

The primary structure of RdCVFL includes a complete thioredoxin fold domain, which suggests potential thiol oxidoreductase activity, although this has not been demonstrated in humans (Fridlich2009The). The active site of RdCVFL contains two cysteines (CXXC), which are characteristic of thioredoxin proteins and are involved in catalyzing the reduction of disulfide bonds in targeted proteins (Fridlich2009The). RdCVFL interacts with the microtubule-associated protein TAU, inhibiting its phosphorylation and protecting it against oxidative stress, which may involve an enzymatic activity that controls the redox status of cysteine residues in TAU (Fridlich2009The). The NXNL1 gene's products are part of a broader antioxidant system that includes thioredoxin proteins, which help maintain cellular redox balance and prevent apoptosis (Elachouri2015Thioredoxin).

## Function
The NXNL1 gene encodes proteins that play a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina, particularly cones. One of its key products, the rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF), is essential for cone survival and function. RdCVF enhances glucose uptake by interacting with the basigin-1 (BSG1)/GLUT1 complex on the surface of cones, stimulating aerobic glycolysis, which is vital for the daily renewal of photoreceptor outer segments (AïtAli2022The; IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is). This process helps prevent oxidative damage and secondary cone degeneration, which is particularly important in conditions like retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (AïtAli2022The).

In addition to RdCVF, the NXNL1 gene also produces a thioredoxin-related protein, RdCVFL, which protects photoreceptors against oxidative damage by reducing oxidized cysteines in proteins (AïtAli2022The). This redox regulation is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor integrity and function. The expression of NXNL1 is regulated by circadian rhythms, suggesting its role in protecting photoreceptors from photooxidative damage, which increases with light exposure (WOLLOSCHECK2015Transcriptional). These functions highlight the gene's importance in retinal health and its potential as a target for treating retinal degenerations.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NXNL1 gene are linked to several retinal degenerative diseases, most notably retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP is characterized by the progressive loss of rod photoreceptors, followed by cone degeneration, leading to severe vision impairment. The NXNL1 gene encodes two key proteins, RdCVF and RdCVFL, which play crucial roles in protecting cone photoreceptors from oxidative stress and maintaining their viability. The loss of RdCVF expression, due to rod degeneration, disrupts metabolic and redox signaling between rods and cones, contributing to cone vision loss in RP (Léveillard2010RodDerived; Clérin2020Metabolic; IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is).

In addition to its role in retinal diseases, altered expression of NXNL1 has been associated with breast cancer. Increased expression of NXNL1 correlates with a favorable prognosis and is linked to higher levels of immune cell infiltration in breast cancer tissues. This suggests that NXNL1 may serve as a prognostic marker and influence the tumor immune microenvironment (Gao2022Increased). The gene's involvement in both retinal and cancer pathologies highlights its broader significance in disease processes related to oxidative stress and cellular viability.

## Interactions
The NXNL1 gene encodes two proteins, RdCVF and RdCVFL, which participate in various interactions crucial for photoreceptor cell maintenance. RdCVF interacts with basigin-1 (BSG1) on cone surfaces, forming a complex with the glucose transporter GLUT1. This interaction enhances glucose uptake, promoting aerobic glycolysis and cone survival, particularly in the context of retinitis pigmentosa (Clérin2020Metabolic; AïtAli2015RodDerived). RdCVF's interaction with basigin-1 is essential for its role in cone survival, as demonstrated by experiments showing that silencing basigin expression reduces RdCVF-mediated cone survival (AïtAli2015RodDerived).

RdCVFL, a thioredoxin-like protein, interacts with the microtubule-associated protein TAU in the retina. This interaction inhibits TAU phosphorylation, which is significant because hyperphosphorylated TAU is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. RdCVFL's ability to prevent oxidative damage to TAU suggests a protective role against oxidative stress in neuronal tissues (Fridlich2009The; Mei2016The). RdCVFL also interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) to maintain glycolytic flux in cones, further protecting them from oxidative stress (AïtAli2022The). These interactions highlight the importance of NXNL1 gene products in maintaining photoreceptor health and function.
