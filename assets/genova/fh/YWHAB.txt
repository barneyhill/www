# YWHAB

## Overview
The YWHAB gene encodes the 14-3-3 beta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its ability to form homo- or heterodimers, facilitating interactions with a wide array of phosphorylated target proteins. The 14-3-3 beta protein is involved in numerous cellular processes, including the regulation of gluconeogenesis, glucose metabolism, and cellular stress responses. It achieves these functions through its interaction with key signaling molecules and transcription factors, such as the glucagon receptor and FOXO1, thereby influencing metabolic pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Xu2019YWHA1433; Ji2021The). Additionally, YWHAB has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is associated with cell proliferation and survival pathways (Zhou2023YWHAB; Xu2020MiR1295p).

## Structure
The YWHAB gene encodes the 14-3-3 beta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family involved in signal transduction. The primary structure of the YWHAB protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a conserved dimerization domain. Its secondary structure is characterized by nine antiparallel α-helices, which contribute to the formation of a horseshoe-shaped dimer with a canonical fold (Xu2019YWHA1433). 

The tertiary structure of YWHAB includes an amphipathic target-binding groove formed by helices αC, αE, αG, and αI, which is crucial for its interaction with phosphorylated peptides, such as the TFEB p-S211-peptide. This groove accommodates both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with a large hydrophobic pocket formed by residues I168, L174, L218, I219, L222, F119, and V48 (Xu2019YWHA1433). 

In terms of quaternary structure, YWHAB typically forms homo- or heterodimers, allowing it to bind two phosphorylated peptides simultaneously (Xu2019YWHA1433). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating its function and interactions with other proteins (Xu2019YWHA1433). The protein's ability to recognize diverse phosphorylated targets highlights its regulatory role in various cellular processes (Xu2019YWHA1433).

## Function
The YWHAB gene encodes the 14-3-3 beta protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes through its involvement in signal transduction pathways. In healthy human cells, YWHAB is involved in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, particularly in the context of glucagon signaling. It interacts with the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and the transcription factor FOXO1 to inhibit glucagon-stimulated glucose production in the liver. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and does not alter the binding affinity or expression of GCGR on the cell membrane. YWHAB reduces the expression of key gluconeogenesis enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase 1 (Pcx1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in hepatocytes, thereby negatively regulating gluconeogenesis (Ji2021The).

YWHAB also plays a role in glucose metabolism by affecting FOXO1 activity. It reduces FOXO1 expression and prevents its nuclear localization, which is crucial for its activity in gluconeogenesis. This regulation occurs independently of glucagon presence, highlighting YWHAB's direct impact on FOXO1 (Ji2021The). Additionally, YWHAB is involved in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by experiments with Ywhab knockout mice, which showed impaired glucose regulation (Ji2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YWHAB gene, which encodes the 14-3-3β protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colon cancer, YWHAB is upregulated, and its knockdown has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and promote apoptosis. This effect is mediated through the interaction with the PIK3R2 gene, which is part of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Zhou2023YWHAB).

In glioblastoma, depletion of 14-3-3β leads to increased cellular senescence through the ERK/SKP2/p27 pathway, suggesting its role in cell cycle regulation and potential implications in cancer biology. This indicates that 14-3-3β may help glioblastoma cells escape senescence, supporting its oncogenic potential (Seo20171433β).

In lung cancer, YWHAB is identified as a direct target of miR-129-5p, a microRNA that is downregulated in cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-129-5p enhances apoptosis in lung cancer cells by reducing YWHAB expression, suggesting that YWHAB contributes to cancer progression and is associated with a worse prognosis (Xu2020MiR1295p).

## Interactions
YWHAB, also known as 14-3-3 beta, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) to inhibit glucagon-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, affecting the glucagon signaling pathway and reducing the expression of key gluconeogenesis enzymes (Ji2021The).

In the context of viral infections, YWHAB interacts with the ORF5 protein of Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2). This interaction inhibits PCV2 replication and alleviates virus-induced cellular responses, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy. The interaction was confirmed through various assays, including yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation (Guo2020A).

YWHAB also plays a role in cervical cancer by interacting with SND1, which affects its interaction with YWHAB. This interaction is significant in regulating cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in cervical cancer (Zhang2021Circ).

Additionally, YWHAB binds to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues in proteins, as demonstrated in its interaction with TFEB, where it recognizes a noncanonical binding mode (Xu2019YWHA1433).
