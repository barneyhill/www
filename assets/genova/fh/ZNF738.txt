# ZNF738

## Overview
ZNF738 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 738, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its function as a transcription factor involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Predominantly active in the nucleus of healthy human cells, zinc finger protein 738 interacts with other proteins to modulate transcriptional activity, influencing cellular differentiation and development. This regulatory function is critical for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, as it ensures the precise control of gene expression patterns necessary for normal cellular function and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
ZNF738, a member of the zinc finger protein family, plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription processes. This protein is characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable it to bind to DNA, functioning primarily as a transcription factor. In healthy human cells, ZNF738 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate transcriptional activity. Through these interactions, ZNF738 influences cellular differentiation and development, impacting various cellular and organismal functions.

The protein's involvement in chromatin remodeling is essential for regulating gene expression, as it helps in the structural reorganization of chromatin, making specific genes accessible for transcription. By facilitating or inhibiting the transcription of target genes, ZNF738 contributes to the precise control of gene expression patterns necessary for normal cellular function and development. Its activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of cellular processes, ensuring that cells differentiate and develop appropriately in response to physiological cues. The modulation of transcriptional activity by ZNF738 underscores its importance in the broader context of cellular and organismal homeostasis, highlighting its role in the intricate network of gene regulation.
