# CT47C1

## Overview
CT47C1 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 47 member C1, which is part of a group of proteins known as cancer/testis antigens (CTAs). These proteins are typically expressed in the testis and various cancer types, making them of particular interest in cancer research and immunotherapy. The CT47C1 protein is implicated in several cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Due to its restricted expression pattern, CT47C1 is being investigated as a potential target for cancer vaccines and other therapeutic strategies aimed at exploiting its tumor-specific expression (Qiu2020aarFDC).
