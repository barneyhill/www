# ZWILCH

## Overview
ZWILCH is a gene that encodes the zwilch kinetochore protein, a crucial component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. The zwilch kinetochore protein plays a significant role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), ensuring proper chromosome alignment and attachment to spindle microtubules, thereby preventing aneuploidy and maintaining genomic stability (Altenfeld2015Complex; Williams2003Zwilch). As a part of the RZZ complex, zwilch kinetochore protein is essential for recruiting cytoplasmic dynein to kinetochores, facilitating chromosome movement and SAC silencing upon correct microtubule attachment (Gama2017Molecular). Mutations in the ZWILCH gene can lead to mitotic defects, such as lagging chromosomes, and have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autism spectrum disorder (Du2020Nonrandom; Williams2003Zwilch).

## Structure
The ZWILCH protein is a component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which plays a crucial role in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during cell division. The primary structure of ZWILCH includes conserved residues that are essential for its function, such as E433 and E437, which are critical for recruiting Spindly to kinetochores (Gama2017Molecular). These residues are located in the αJ helix of domain 2, analogous to human E422 and D426, which participate in protein-protein interactions (Gama2017Molecular).

ZWILCH interacts with other proteins in the RZZ complex, particularly through a bipartite interaction involving the Zwilch-ROD-1 β-propeller module and the Spindly C-terminal domain (Gama2017Molecular). The N-terminal β-propeller domain of Rod is necessary for interaction with Zwilch, highlighting its role in the quaternary structure of the complex (Gama2017Molecular). The RZZ complex, including ZWILCH, is essential for the recruitment of dynein to kinetochores, with the Rod β-propeller-Zwilch module acting as the kinetochore receptor for the dynein adaptor Spindly (Gama2017Molecular).

## Function
The ZWILCH gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which plays a vital role in kinetochore function during mitosis. This complex is essential for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a surveillance mechanism that ensures proper chromosome alignment and attachment to spindle microtubules before anaphase onset, thereby preventing aneuploidy and ensuring genomic stability (Altenfeld2015Complex; Williams2003Zwilch).

ZWILCH is involved in recruiting cytoplasmic dynein to kinetochores, facilitating the movement of chromosomes and the silencing of the SAC upon correct microtubule attachment (Gama2017Molecular; Altenfeld2015Complex). The protein localizes to kinetochores during mitosis, specifically from prophase through metaphase, and is part of a conserved complex with hROD and hZW10 in humans (Williams2003Zwilch).

Mutations in ZWILCH can lead to mitotic defects such as lagging chromosomes and premature sister chromatid separation, highlighting its role in maintaining proper chromosome segregation (Williams2003Zwilch). The interaction between Zwilch and other components of the RZZ complex is crucial for the recruitment of Spindly and the subsequent attachment of dynein to kinetochores, which is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Gama2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZWILCH gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer, a heterozygous mutation in ZWILCH affecting a splice acceptor site is predicted to cause premature truncation of the Zwilch RNA, contributing to chromosomal instability (CIN) and cancer progression (Wang2004Three). ZWILCH is also associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where de novo mutations in the gene have been identified in patients, suggesting its role in the disorder's genetic architecture (Du2020Nonrandom).

In breast cancer, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZWILCH, such as rs3087660, have been studied for their association with cancer risk and clinical outcomes. Although no significant association with breast cancer susceptibility was found, certain genotypes were more frequently associated with specific tumor characteristics, such as estrogen receptor-positive tumors (Brendle2009Single). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, ZWILCH expression is linked to shorter patient survival, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis (Rozengurt2018Yesassociated).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZWILCH in various cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring the importance of further research to understand its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
ZWILCH is a component of the RZZ complex, which also includes ROD and ZW10. This complex is essential for kinetochore functions during mitosis. ZWILCH directly binds to the ROD protein, specifically interacting with the ROD β-propeller domain, without requiring ZW10 as a bridging factor (Çivril2010Structural). The interaction between ZWILCH and ROD has been confirmed through co-purification experiments, where they elute together during size exclusion chromatography (Çivril2010Structural).

ZWILCH is involved in recruiting the adaptor protein Spindly to kinetochores, which is crucial for dynein recruitment. This recruitment involves a bipartite interaction between the ZWILCH-ROD β-propeller module and the Spindly C-terminal domain (Gama2017Molecular). Mutations in conserved residues of ZWILCH, such as E433A and E437A, disrupt its interaction with Spindly, affecting dynein recruitment to kinetochores (Gama2017Molecular; McHugh2017Dynein).

ZWILCH, ROD, and ZW10 form a stable complex that is conserved across species, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in both human and Drosophila cells (Williams2003Zwilch). This complex is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint functions (Williams2003Zwilch).
