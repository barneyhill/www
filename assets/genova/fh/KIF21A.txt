# KIF21A

## Overview
KIF21A is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 21A, a motor protein involved in intracellular transport and microtubule dynamics. As a member of the kinesin superfamily, KIF21A is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, enabling the protein to transport cellular cargo along microtubule tracks. The protein also contains coiled-coil domains and WD40 repeats, which are essential for dimerization and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Shen2008Interaction; Kakinuma2009A). KIF21A plays a significant role in neuronal development, particularly in axon growth and guidance, and is prominently expressed in the central nervous system (Cheng2014Human). Mutations in the KIF21A gene are linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM), a disorder affecting eye movement, highlighting its clinical significance (Ying2013Inherited; Xia2022Congenital).

## Structure
KIF21A is a kinesin motor protein characterized by several structural domains, including a motor domain, coiled-coil domains in the stalk region, and WD40 repeats. The motor domain is responsible for microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis, facilitating intracellular transport (Shen2008Interaction). The coiled-coil domains in the stalk region are crucial for dimerization and interaction with other proteins, such as KANK1, which primarily interacts through the fourth coiled-coil domain (Kakinuma2009A). The WD40 repeats in the C-terminal tail are involved in protein-protein interactions (Shen2008Interaction).

The regulatory stalk domain of KIF21A forms an intramolecular antiparallel coiled coil, which is essential for autoinhibition. This coiled coil binds directly to the motor domains and is sufficient for autoinhibition, with mutations in this region linked to congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1) (Bianchi2016Structural). The antiparallel coiled coil is stabilized by residues at heptad repeat positions and potential salt bridges, as revealed by the crystal structure determined at 2.5 Å resolution (Bianchi2016Structural).

KIF21A forms homodimers, likely through coiled-coil regions located N-terminal to the antiparallel coiled coil, as confirmed by single-molecule GFP-counting experiments (Bianchi2016Structural). The protein's oligomeric state is dimeric, and cysteine crosslinking experiments demonstrate that the regulatory antiparallel coiled coil is formed in the context of the dimeric KIF21A stalk (Bianchi2016Structural).

## Function
The KIF21A gene encodes a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport and the regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics. In healthy human cells, KIF21A functions as a cortical microtubule growth inhibitor, particularly at the cell periphery, where it restricts MT growth without causing disassembly. This regulation is essential for maintaining stable MT arrays, which are important for cell morphology, polarization, and motility (van2013CFEOM1Associated).

KIF21A is prominently expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in neuronal development, particularly in the growth and guidance of axons. It achieves this by regulating microtubule interactions through a mechanism of autoinhibition, ensuring that its activity is tightly controlled and allowing it to bind to microtubules only when necessary (Bianchi2016Structural; Cheng2014Human).

The protein is also involved in the transport of cellular cargo, such as organelles and protein complexes, along microtubule tracks. This transport is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell-cycle dynamics and the organization of polar cells during organogenesis (Falb2021Bi-allelic). KIF21A's activity is characterized by its processive movement along microtubules towards their plus ends, contributing to intracellular transport within neurons (Marszalek1999Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF21A gene are primarily associated with Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles (CFEOM), a group of ocular motor disorders characterized by restricted eye movement and drooping eyelids. CFEOM1, the most common type, is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in KIF21A, leading to bilateral blepharoptosis and the inability to elevate the eyes above the horizontal midline (Ying2013Inherited; Xia2022Congenital). The R954W mutation is particularly prevalent and results in a gain-of-function phenotype by disrupting the autoinhibitory interactions within the KIF21A protein, enhancing its motility along microtubules (van2013CFEOM1Associated; Cheng2014Human).

These mutations affect the development of the oculomotor nerve, leading to axon stalling and branching defects, which contribute to the clinical manifestations of CFEOM1 (Cheng2014Human). Additionally, KIF21A mutations can enhance the interaction with Kank1, affecting actin polymerization and cell movement, which may further contribute to the pathogenesis of CFEOM1 (Kakinuma2009A). In some cases, KIF21A mutations are also linked to CFEOM3, which shows variable clinical features and incomplete penetrance (Ying2013Inherited).

## Interactions
KIF21A, a kinesin motor protein, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport. It directly interacts with the brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG1). This interaction is significant for the transport of cargo molecules in BIG1-associated vesicles, which may require both microtubule and actin transport via motors like KIF21A and myosin IXb. The interaction occurs through the tail domain of KIF21A, which contains WD-40 repeats involved in protein-protein interactions (Shen2008Interaction).

KIF21A also interacts with the scaffold protein KANK1. This interaction is mediated by the ankyrin repeat domain (ANKRD) of KANK1, which binds to specific sites on KIF21A. Mutations in these sites can disrupt the binding, affecting the recruitment of KIF21A to focal adhesions, which is essential for microtubule-focal adhesion crosstalk (Pan2018Structural).

In the context of congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1), KIF21A mutations enhance its interaction with Kank1, particularly through the third and fourth coiled-coil domains. These mutations increase the translocation of Kank1 to the membrane, potentially disrupting neuronal development (Kakinuma2009A).
