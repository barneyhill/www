# SLAMF7

## Overview
SLAMF7, or Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 7, is a gene that encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein, also known as CD319, CS1, or CRACC. This protein is a member of the SLAM family of receptors, which are integral to immune cell signaling and function. SLAMF7 is predominantly expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and some B cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, including cytotoxicity and inflammatory regulation. The protein is characterized by its extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, with the latter containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) essential for downstream signaling. SLAMF7's interactions with proteins such as SHIP1 and TRAF6 are vital for its function in immune regulation, particularly in conditions like polymicrobial sepsis and multiple myeloma, where it serves as a potential therapeutic target (Wu2023SLAMF7; Loyal2020SLAMF7; Chu2023SLAMF7).

## Structure
SLAMF7, also known as CS1, CRACC, or CD319, is a 66 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein that is part of the SLAM family of receptors. It is composed of three main domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. The extracellular domain is approximately 24 kDa and contains two immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily domains: an amino terminal Ig variable domain and a carboxy terminal constant 2 domain (IgC2), both of which have N-glycosylation sites. There are seven glycosylation consensus motifs, with N98, N142, and N148 being the most conserved (Chu2023SLAMF7).

The transmembrane domain anchors SLAMF7 to the cell surface, while the cytoplasmic domain contains four tyrosine residues and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs), which are crucial for signaling downstream molecules. SLAMF7 has two isoforms: SLAMF7-L, which has a long cytoplasmic domain and is the activating isoform, and SLAMF7-S, which has a short cytoplasmic domain and lacks two ITSM-like sequences, preventing interaction with EAT-2 (Chu2023SLAMF7).

SLAMF7 can form homodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure. It interacts with proteins such as SHIP1 and TRAF6, which are involved in inflammatory response regulation (Wu2023SLAMF7). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in immune cell signaling and function.

## Function
SLAMF7, also known as CD319, is a receptor that plays a significant role in immune cell function and regulation. In healthy human cells, SLAMF7 is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and some B cells, where it contributes to the modulation of immune responses. It is involved in the regulation of cytotoxic T cells, particularly memory CD8+ T cells, by delineating cytotoxic from helper T cells. SLAMF7 expression is associated with cytotoxic characteristics, such as degranulation and IFN-γ secretion, which are crucial for antiviral immunity, especially against cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Loyal2020SLAMF7).

SLAMF7 also plays a role in macrophages, where it regulates inflammatory responses. It interacts with signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and NF-κB, inhibiting cytokine production and reducing inflammation. This function is particularly relevant during conditions like polymicrobial sepsis, where SLAMF7 expression is elevated and correlates with disease severity (Wu2023SLAMF7). SLAMF7's interaction with SHIP1 and TRAF6 further modulates inflammatory signaling, highlighting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Wu2023SLAMF7). These activities underscore SLAMF7's importance in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in immune-related diseases.

## Clinical Significance
SLAMF7 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune regulation. In multiple myeloma (MM), SLAMF7 is highly expressed on myeloma cells and is involved in their interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment, promoting tumor growth and survival. The soluble form of SLAMF7 (sSLAMF7) is associated with aggressive clinical characteristics and shorter progression-free survival in MM patients. Elotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting SLAMF7, enhances NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MM cells and is used in treatment (Chu2023SLAMF7).

In the context of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), SLAMF7 modulates B cells and adaptive immunity. SLAMF7-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS, indicating its protective role. SLAMF7 influences immune cell interactions and cytokine responses, affecting disease severity (O’Connell2022SLAMF7).

SLAMF7 also plays a role in inflammatory responses during polymicrobial sepsis. Its activation reduces mortality and inflammation, while SLAMF7 knockout leads to exacerbated inflammation and higher mortality, highlighting its regulatory role in sepsis (Wu2023SLAMF7).

## Interactions
SLAMF7, also known as CD319 or CS1, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate immune responses. It interacts with SHIP1 and TRAF6 in macrophages, forming a complex that plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses during polymicrobial sepsis. SLAMF7 inhibits TRAF6 K63 ubiquitination, which is essential for NF-κB activation, by cooperating with SHIP1. This interaction suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL1B, and IL6 (Wu2023SLAMF7).

In natural killer (NK) cells, SLAMF7 interacts with the adaptor protein EAT-2, enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity. Unlike other SLAM family receptors, SLAMF7 does not recruit SAP but relies on EAT-2 for its function in NK cell activation (Claus2019SLAM). SLAMF7 also engages in homotypic interactions, binding to itself on adjacent cells, which can modulate immune responses (Pazina2019Enhanced).

SLAMF7 is critical for the phagocytosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by macrophages, particularly in the presence of anti-CD47 antibodies. It operates through a novel SAP adaptor-independent mechanism involving Src, Syk, and Btk kinases, and associates with integrin proteins CD11b and CD18, which form Mac-1 (Chen2017SLAMF7).
