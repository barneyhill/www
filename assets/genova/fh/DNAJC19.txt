# DNAJC19

## Overview
DNAJC19 is a gene that encodes the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C19, a mitochondrial chaperone protein integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is involved in the ATP-dependent transport of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix, playing a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Zhou2021Targeting). DNAJC19 is homologous to yeast Pam18/Tim14 and interacts with the mitochondrial prohibitin complex, which is essential for phospholipid homeostasis and the structural integrity of mitochondrial cristae (Zhou2021Targeting). The protein's function is vital for proper protein folding and assembly within mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy production and homeostasis (Ojala2012New). Mutations in DNAJC19 are linked to clinical conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome and have implications in non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Zhou2021Targeting; Ojala2012New).

## Function
The DNAJC19 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it functions as a mitochondrial chaperone. This protein is involved in the ATP-dependent transport of transit proteins from the inner cell membrane to the mitochondrial matrix, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Zhou2021Targeting). DNAJC19 is homologous to yeast Pam18/Tim14 and interacts with the mitochondrial prohibitin complex, which is vital for regulating phospholipid homeostasis and maintaining the structural integrity of mitochondrial cristae (Zhou2021Targeting).

In healthy human cells, DNAJC19 plays a significant role in ensuring proper protein folding and assembly within mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy production and homeostasis (Ojala2012New). The protein's activity is critical for the functional integrity of mitochondria, as disruptions in its function can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various clinical manifestations (Zhou2021Targeting). DNAJC19's role in maintaining mitochondrial function underscores its importance in cellular and organismal health, particularly in tissues with high energy demands.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC19 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (DCMA), also known as 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type V. This syndrome is characterized by a combination of symptoms including dilated and noncompaction cardiomyopathy, microcytic anemia, ataxia, male genital anomalies, and elevated levels of methylglutaconic acid in urine (Ojala2012New). The specific mutation identified in some cases is a homozygous single nucleotide deletion in exon 6 of the DNAJC19 gene, leading to premature termination of the peptide and a lack of DNAJC19 protein expression (Ojala2012New).

DNAJC19 is also implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poorer progression-free survival in patients. DNAJC19 promotes NSCLC cell growth and metastasis by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2021Targeting). The gene's role in mitochondrial protein import and integrity is crucial, and its dysfunction can contribute to the development and progression of various diseases (Zhou2021Targeting).

## Interactions
DNAJC19 is involved in several interactions within the cell, particularly related to its role in mitochondrial function. It is a component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery and interacts with the mitochondrial prohibitin complex. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function by affecting phospholipid homeostasis and altering mitochondrial cristae structure (Zhou2021Targeting). DNAJC19 is also part of the mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase complex, where it interacts with proteins such as TIMM8A and TIMM13. This complex is essential for the translocation of proteins into the mitochondria, highlighting DNAJC19's role in mitochondrial protein import and maintenance.

In the context of viral pathogenesis, DNAJC19 has been identified as interacting with CETN3 as part of the ciliary protein interactome. This interaction is one of the novel predicted interactions that connect host proteins to ciliary proteins, suggesting a potential role in viral pathogenesis (Karunakaran2020Interactome). These interactions underscore DNAJC19's involvement in critical cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and response to viral infections. However, specific details on the physical interactions of DNAJC19 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these contexts are not extensively documented in the provided sources.
