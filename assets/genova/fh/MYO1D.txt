# MYO1D

## Overview
MYO1D is a gene that encodes the protein myosin ID, a member of the class I myosins, which are actin-based motor proteins. Myosin ID is characterized by its ability to bind ATP and interact with actin filaments, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport. The protein is involved in critical functions such as maintaining epithelial barrier integrity, regulating planar cell polarity, and anchoring receptor tyrosine kinases at the plasma membrane. These functions are essential for processes like cell migration, proliferation, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mutations in MYO1D have been linked to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Alsafwani2021Novel; Ko2019MYO1D; McAlpine2018The).

## Structure
The MYO1D protein is a member of the myosin superfamily and is composed of 1,006 amino acids with a molecular weight of 116 kDa. Its primary structure includes a highly conserved Myosin Motor Domain spanning 671 amino acids, a calmodulin-binding motif of 20 amino acids, and a basic C-terminal Tail Homology 1 (TH1) domain consisting of 197 amino acids (Alsafwani2021Novel). The motor domain is responsible for ATP binding and actin interaction, which are crucial for its function as a molecular motor (Saydmohammed2018Vertebrate).

The TH1 domain is involved in interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, and plays a role in tethering the plasma membrane to actin filaments (Ko2019MYO1D). This domain contains a β-meander motif with five consecutive β-sheets, which are critical for binding with the EGFR family (Ko2019MYO1D). The MYO1D protein's structure is essential for its biological functions, including actin-dependent ATPase activity and microfilament motor activities (Alsafwani2021Novel).

A specific missense mutation, Pro765Ser, located between the Myosin TH1 and calmodulin-binding domains, has been identified as affecting the protein's structural integrity and function, leading to laterality defects (Alsafwani2021Novel).

## Function
MYO1D (myosin ID) is a class I myosin that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in maintaining cellular structure and function. In the intestinal epithelium, MYO1D acts as a molecular link between membrane lipids and the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. It binds to specific membrane lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, and associates with the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to epithelial barrier integrity and cell migration (McAlpine2018The).

In the tracheal epithelium, MYO1D is involved in maintaining planar cell polarity (PCP) by ensuring the proper orientation of ciliary basal bodies, which is critical for coordinated ciliary beating and effective airway clearance (Hegan2015Myosin). MYO1D's role in PCP is further supported by its involvement in the asymmetric localization of PCP core proteins, which is necessary for maintaining the directionality of ciliary movement (Hegan2015Myosin).

MYO1D is also implicated in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the plasma membrane, where it anchors these receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), to maintain their downstream signaling pathways, which are important for cell proliferation and migration (Ko2019MYO1D).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MYO1D gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. In the case of IBD, mutations in MYO1D, such as missense mutations, have been associated with increased susceptibility to colitis. These mutations lead to a colitis phenotype characterized by weight loss, colonic shortening, and increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The mutations affect protein stability and disrupt the epithelial barrier function, contributing to defective intestinal homeostasis (McAlpine2018The).

In cancer, MYO1D is upregulated in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) stages and is associated with enhanced tumorigenesis. It interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting its activity and facilitating cancer cell invasion and metastasis. MYO1D overexpression is linked to increased motility and viability of colorectal and breast cancer cells, suggesting its role as a novel oncogene. This makes MYO1D a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers with high EGFR expression (Ko2019MYO1D; Naydenov2021Myosin).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MYO1D expression is associated with poor overall survival and increased neutrophil infiltration, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2024Identification).

## Interactions
MYO1D interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through its tail homology 1 (TH1) domain. This interaction is essential for anchoring these receptors to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for their activation and subsequent signaling pathways (Ko2019MYO1D). MYO1D's interaction with EGFR helps maintain its presence on the cell surface, facilitating downstream signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and migration (Ko2019MYO1D).

MYO1D also interacts with the ErbB4/KITENIN complex, anchoring it to the plasma membrane. This interaction is important for maintaining the complex's stability and preventing its degradation, which is associated with proteasomal pathways (Ko2019MYO1D). The MYO1D TH1 domain can act as a decoy peptide, competing with wild-type MYO1D for binding to EGFR, which affects cell proliferation and invasiveness (Ko2019MYO1D).

In the context of left-right asymmetry in zebrafish, MYO1D interacts with the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway component Vangl2. This interaction is crucial for controlling the orientation of cilia in the left-right organizer, affecting the establishment of directional flow necessary for proper asymmetry (Juan2018Myosin1D).
