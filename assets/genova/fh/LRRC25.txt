# LRRC25

## Overview
LRRC25 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 25, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in immune regulation, particularly through modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. The LRRC25 protein contains leucine-rich repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in immune signaling and host-pathogen interactions. It also features an F-box domain that interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a role in ubiquitination and autophagic degradation processes. These structural features enable LRRC25 to participate in various cellular functions, including apoptosis, autophagy, and nuclear mRNA transport. The protein's regulatory functions are significant in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammation, with implications in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections like foot-and-mouth disease (Feng2017LRRC25; Liu2017LRRC25; Sheng2023LRRC25).

## Structure
The LRRC25 protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions and form a horseshoe-shaped structure (Sheng2023LRRC25). The protein is composed of 305 amino acids and includes four leucine-rich repeats at the N-terminus, which may play a role in host-pathogen interactions (Liu2017LRRC25). These LRR domains are crucial for the protein's function, particularly in the context of immune signaling pathways (Feng2017LRRC25).

LRRC25 also contains several potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that can affect protein folding and stability (Liu2017LRRC25). At the C-terminus, the protein features two tyrosine-based motifs: one for interaction with phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase (YENM) and another that is a 'closet' ITIM within an ITAM, which could mediate inhibitory signaling under certain conditions (Liu2017LRRC25).

The protein's structure includes an F-box domain that interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, participating in ubiquitination processes (Sheng2023LRRC25). This domain is significant for the protein's role in modulating immune responses, particularly through the autophagic degradation of specific signaling proteins (Feng2017LRRC25).

## Function
LRRC25 (leucine rich repeat containing 25) is a protein involved in regulating immune responses, particularly through its role in modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, LRRC25 functions as an inhibitor of NF-κB activation, which is crucial for controlling inflammatory responses. It achieves this by promoting the autophagic degradation of p65/RelA, a key component of the NF-κB complex, thereby preventing excessive NF-κB signaling and the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Feng2017LRRC25).

LRRC25 is primarily active in immune cells, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by inhibiting the overactivation of inflammatory pathways. This regulation is essential for preventing chronic inflammation and associated pathologies. The protein is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family, known for mediating protein-protein interactions, which are critical for its function in immune modulation (Feng2017LRRC25).

In addition to its role in inflammation, LRRC25 is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, ubiquitination, and nuclear mRNA transport, highlighting its multifaceted role in cell biology (Sheng2023LRRC25).

## Clinical Significance
LRRC25 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), LRRC25 is down-regulated in myeloid leukemia cells but is highly expressed in mature myeloid cells. Its expression is upregulated during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation, which is crucial for the treatment of APL. Knockdown or knockout of LRRC25 impairs this differentiation process, suggesting its significant role in leukemia pathogenesis and treatment response (Liu2017LRRC25).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), LRRC25 expression is increased in iPSC-derived neurons from AD patients, as well as in AD mouse models and patient brains. This suggests a potential role in AD pathogenesis, possibly through its involvement in autophagic processes. The increased levels of LRRC25 in AD models indicate it may be a response to toxic protein accumulation, although it may not fully counteract the reduced autophagic-lysosomal pathway function observed in AD (Devadoss2024LRRC25).

LRRC25 is also involved in the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The FMDV 3A protein interacts with G3BP1, leading to its degradation via autophagy, which is mediated by the upregulation of LRRC25. This interaction promotes FMDV replication, highlighting LRRC25's role in viral pathogenesis (Yang2020Foot-and-Mouth).

## Interactions
LRRC25 is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in modulating immune responses. It interacts with the p65/RelA component of the NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting its degradation through autophagy. This interaction is facilitated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of LRRC25, which binds to the Rel Homology domain (RHD) of p65/RelA. The degradation process is mediated by the autophagy pathway, where LRRC25 enhances the interaction between p65/RelA and p62/SQSTM1, a cargo receptor in autophagy (Feng2017LRRC25).

LRRC25 also interacts with G3BP1, a protein involved in stress granule assembly and immune response. In the context of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection, the viral 3A protein upregulates LRRC25, leading to the degradation of G3BP1 and inhibition of the G3BP1-mediated RIG-I-like helicase signaling pathway. This interaction facilitates FMDV replication by modulating host protein interactions (Yang2020Foot-and-Mouth).

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, LRRC25 interacts with ISG15, p62, and RIG-I, forming a complex that mediates the selective autophagy of ISG15 and inhibits the type I IFN signaling pathway, thereby negatively regulating anti-tuberculosis immunity (Sheng2023LRRC25).
