# HELT

## Overview
HELT is a gene that encodes the helt bHLH transcription factor, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in neural development, particularly in the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells. As a transcriptional repressor, the helt bHLH transcription factor is instrumental in promoting the development of GABAergic neurons by inhibiting the expression of neurogenin genes, which are crucial for glutamatergic neuronal differentiation. The gene's expression is predominantly observed in progenitor domains that lead to the formation of GABAergic neurons, highlighting its essential function in maintaining the GABAergic pathway during neural development (Nakatani2007Helt).

## Function
HELT (helt bHLH transcription factor) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a critical role in neural development by influencing the fate of neuronal progenitor cells. In the developing mesencephalon, HELT functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily targeting the neurogenin (Ngn) genes, Ngn1 and Ngn2, which are associated with glutamatergic neuronal differentiation. By repressing these genes, HELT promotes the development of GABAergic neurons over glutamatergic neurons (Nakatani2007Helt).

HELT is expressed in progenitor domains that give rise to GABAergic neurons, and its activity is crucial for maintaining the GABAergic pathway. In the absence of HELT, there is an ectopic expression of Ngn genes, leading to a shift from GABAergic to glutamatergic neuron production. This shift is evidenced by the increased expression of glutamatergic markers such as Brn3a in HELT-deficient embryos (Nakatani2007Helt).

HELT's role in promoting GABAergic differentiation is independent of other bHLH factors like Mash1, which is also involved in GABAergic differentiation but is not affected by HELT's activity (Nakatani2007Helt). This specificity underscores HELT's unique function in determining neurotransmitter phenotype during neural development.
