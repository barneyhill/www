# RRAGC

## Overview
The RRAGC gene encodes the Ras-related GTP binding protein C, a member of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a pivotal role in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein is integral to cellular nutrient sensing and growth regulation, primarily through its involvement in mTORC1 activation. RRAGC forms heterodimers with other Rag proteins, such as RagA or RagB, facilitating the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane in response to amino acid availability. The protein's structure includes a GTPase domain and C-terminal CRD domains, which are essential for its function and interaction with mTORC1. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, further regulate its activity. Mutations in RRAGC have been linked to various diseases, including syndromic dilated cardiomyopathy and follicular lymphoma, underscoring its clinical significance (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture; Sambri2024Ragopathies; Cui2023Structure).

## Structure
The RRAGC gene encodes a protein that is part of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in mTORC1 activation. The protein forms heterodimers with other Rag proteins, such as RagA or RagB, contributing to its quaternary structure (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). The Rag GTPases, including RRAGC, have an archaeal origin and are related to the Arf family of Ras-like GTPases (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture).

Structurally, RRAGC contains a GTPase domain, which is a common feature among Ras-like GTPases. This domain is involved in binding and hydrolyzing GTP, a critical function for its role in cellular signaling (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). The GTPase domains of RagA and RagC exhibit a fold similar to other Ras-like GTPases, indicating a conserved structural motif (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture).

The protein also includes C-terminal CRD domains, which are involved in the structural dynamics and interactions necessary for mTORC1 binding (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of RRAGC, influencing its role in mTORC1 signaling pathways (Cui2023Structure). These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's function in nutrient sensing and cellular growth regulation.

## Function
The RRAGC gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Rag GTPases, which are essential for the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, RRAGC forms heterodimers with RagA or RagB, facilitating the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane, where it becomes activated in response to amino acid availability (Sambri2024Ragopathies; Cui2023Structure). This activation is crucial for the phosphorylation of downstream targets such as S6K and 4E-BP1, which are involved in protein synthesis and cell growth (Sambri2024Ragopathies).

The nucleotide state of RagC, specifically its GDP-bound form, is critical for mTORC1 binding and activation. This state promotes the phosphorylation of TFEB, a transcription factor that regulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, thereby maintaining cellular nutrient status and regulating autophagic and lysosomal clearance capacity (Tsun2013The; Cui2023Structure). The activity of RRAGC is modulated by Folliculin (FLCN), a GTPase-activating protein that regulates the nucleotide state of RagC, ensuring proper mTORC1 signaling in response to nutrient levels (Tsun2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RRAGC gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to their impact on the mTORC1 signaling pathway. A notable mutation, S75Y, has been identified in a fetus with syndromic dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to enhanced S6K phosphorylation during fasting and dysregulation of the mTORC1 pathway. This mutation is linked to clinical manifestations such as brain cortical dysplasia, hepatic dysfunction, ocular abnormalities, and metabolic issues like lactic acidosis and hyperammonemia (Sambri2024Ragopathies). 

In follicular lymphoma, somatic mutations in RRAGC are found in 9 to 17% of patients, suggesting a specific pathogenic role. These mutations, often missense, result in gain-of-function effects, particularly affecting the nucleotide-binding domain, and are associated with increased S6K phosphorylation (Sambri2024Ragopathies). 

Alterations in RRAGC expression are also implicated in liver cancer. The euchromatin histone methyltransferase II (EHMT2) regulates RRAGC expression, and its inhibition leads to upregulation of RRAGC in hepatic cell carcinoma cell lines, affecting stress-response pathways (Hwang2020Euchromatin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RRAGC mutations and expression alterations in various diseases.

## Interactions
RRAGC, a Ras-related GTP binding protein, is a key component in the mTORC1 signaling pathway, primarily interacting with other proteins to regulate cellular responses to amino acid availability. RRAGC forms a heterodimer with either RRAGA or RRAGB, which is essential for recruiting mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, a critical step for its activation. This interaction is dependent on the nucleotide state of the Rag heterodimers, with the RagA GTP/RagC GDP configuration being necessary for mTORC1 binding (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture).

The folliculin (FLCN) tumor suppressor, in complex with FNIP1/2, acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RRAGC, promoting GTP hydrolysis and facilitating the binding of mTORC1 to the Rag heterodimer. This interaction is crucial for mTORC1 activation in response to amino acid levels (Tsun2013The). FLCN's role is particularly significant in the context of amino acid starvation, where it localizes to the lysosomal surface to regulate RRAGC activity (Tsun2013The).

RRAGC also interacts with SLC38A9, a lysosomal membrane protein, as part of the Rag-Ragulator complex. This interaction is involved in the regulation of mTORC1 activity, highlighting RRAGC's role in amino acid sensing and signaling (Jung2015Amino).
