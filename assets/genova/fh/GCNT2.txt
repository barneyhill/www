# GCNT2

## Overview
The GCNT2 gene encodes the enzyme glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates. This enzyme is pivotal in the glycosylation process, specifically in the formation of I-branched glycans, which are crucial for the expression of the I blood group antigen on red blood cells. The enzyme's activity is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to galactose residues on poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains, impacting various cellular functions such as cell signaling, protein stability, and immune response (Borck2011An; Sweeney2018Loss). Mutations in the GCNT2 gene can lead to clinical conditions like congenital cataracts and the adult i blood group phenotype, highlighting its significance in human health and development (Irum2016Deletion; Yu2003The).

## Function
The GCNT2 gene encodes the enzyme glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2, which plays a crucial role in the glycosylation process by adding N-acetylglucosamine to galactose residues on poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. This enzymatic activity is essential for the formation of I-branched glycans, which are important for the expression of the I blood group antigen on the surface of red blood cells (Borck2011An; Sweeney2018Loss). In healthy human cells, such as normal melanocytes and erythrocytes, GCNT2 is expressed at higher levels, contributing to the presence of I-branched glycans that regulate cell signaling pathways, including those mediated by growth factor receptors and integrins (Sweeney2018Loss).

The I-branched glycans produced by GCNT2 are involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation, particularly in the developing lens, where they play a role in maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataract formation (Happ2016Case; Irum2016Deletion). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, impacting cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune response (Sweeney2018Loss). The proper function of GCNT2 is critical for normal cellular functions and organismal outcomes, such as maintaining the adult I blood group phenotype and preventing congenital cataracts (Irum2016Deletion; Borck2011An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GCNT2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably congenital cataracts and the adult i blood group phenotype. Congenital cataracts, a condition characterized by clouding of the lens in the eye, can result from various mutations in GCNT2, including missense, nonsense, and large genomic deletions (Happ2016Case; Irum2016Deletion). These mutations disrupt the normal function of the enzyme encoded by GCNT2, which is crucial for lens development and transparency (Irum2016Deletion).

The adult i blood group phenotype is another condition linked to GCNT2 mutations. This phenotype is characterized by a low level of I antigen and a high level of i antigen on red blood cells. It is often associated with congenital cataracts, particularly in Asian populations (Lin2006A; Yu2003The). The adult i phenotype results from mutations affecting the GCNT2 gene, which impair the enzyme's ability to convert the fetal i antigen to the adult I antigen (Yu2003The).

The GCNT2 gene is prone to genomic rearrangements due to its richness in Short INterspersed Elements (SINE repeats), which can lead to microdeletions or microduplications, further contributing to these conditions (Borck2011An).
