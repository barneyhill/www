# RIPK3

## Overview
RIPK3, or receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in the regulation of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis. The RIPK3 protein plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses and immune regulation by interacting with other proteins such as RIPK1 and MLKL to form the necrosome complex, which is essential for necroptotic signaling (Meng2021Human; Zhou2024RIPK3). Beyond its role in necroptosis, RIPK3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of NF-κB signaling, autophagy, and mitochondrial metabolism (Zhou2024RIPK3). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions (Afonso2020RIPK3; Zhou2024RIPK3).

## Structure
The human RIPK3 protein is a kinase involved in the necroptosis cell death pathway. Its molecular structure includes a kinase domain that interacts with the MLKL pseudokinase domain, crucial for necroptotic signaling. The primary structure of RIPK3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone, with specific residues like S227 and T224 playing significant roles in its function and interactions (Meng2021Human).

In terms of secondary structure, RIPK3 features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the kinase domain facilitating its enzymatic activity. The tertiary structure of RIPK3 is characterized by an overall 3D shape stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds. The C-lobe of RIPK3, which includes residues 97-316, is similar to that of mouse RIPK3, with many C-lobe residues conserved or semi-conserved, contributing to MLKL binding (Meng2021Human).

RIPK3 forms a quaternary structure through its interaction with MLKL, maintaining MLKL in an inactive conformation prior to necroptosis. This interaction involves a face-to-face arrangement mediated by parallel N-lobe:N-lobe and C-lobe:C-lobe contacts (Meng2021Human). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at S227, are critical for forming the basal RIPK3:MLKL complex, a precursor to necroptotic activation (Meng2021Human).

## Function
RIPK3 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3) is a crucial protein involved in necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis. In healthy human cells, RIPK3 is activated in response to various cellular stress stimuli, interacting with specific ligands and receptors such as TNF, FASLG, and TRAIL. These interactions lead to the formation of the necrosome complex, essential for necroptosis induction (Newton2015RIPK1; Zhou2024RIPK3).

Beyond its role in necroptosis, RIPK3 is involved in several non-necroptotic functions. It regulates NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for expressing pro-inflammatory and pro-survival factors. RIPK3 can both promote and inhibit NF-κB activation through different pathways, depending on the cellular context (Zhou2024RIPK3). It also plays a role in autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1, necessary for alternative autophagy, and influences cell metabolism by regulating mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis (Zhou2024RIPK3).

RIPK3 is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production, which can occur independently of necroptosis. This process requires RIPK3 along with ROS production and can be influenced by caspase-8 and MLKL (Morgan2022Roles). These diverse roles highlight RIPK3's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
RIPK3 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in necroptosis and inflammation. In ischemic injuries such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, elevated RIPK3 expression contributes to cell death and inflammation, while its inhibition can reduce damage and improve outcomes (Zhou2024RIPK3). In neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, RIPK3 is involved in necroptosis, with its deficiency showing potential in improving neurological outcomes (Zhou2024RIPK3).

In cancer, RIPK3 has dual roles. It can suppress tumors by inducing necroptosis and immune surveillance, but it can also promote tumor growth by creating an immunosuppressive environment (Zhou2024RIPK3). In malignant mesothelioma, RIPK3 is often epigenetically silenced, contributing to chemoresistance and poor prognosis (Tan2021Somatic). In melanoma, the loss of RIPK3 expression correlates with resistance to necroptosis, potentially aiding tumor survival (Geserick2015Absence).

RIPK3 is also involved in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where its overexpression exacerbates inflammation (Zhou2024RIPK3). In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, increased RIPK3 levels are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, and its deficiency can ameliorate these conditions (Afonso2020RIPK3).

## Interactions
RIPK3 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3) is a crucial component in necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. It interacts with RIPK1 through their RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains to form the necrosome complex, which is essential for necroptosis signaling (Cho2009Phosphorylation-Driven; Weber2018Nuclear). This interaction is stabilized by phosphorylation events that are critical for the assembly of the pronecrotic complex II, facilitating the recruitment of RIP1 to the complex (Cho2009Phosphorylation-Driven).

RIPK3 also interacts with MLKL, a key effector in necroptosis. The translocation of RIPK3 and MLKL from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is necessary for necrosome formation and subsequent necroptotic cell death (Weber2018Nuclear). RIPK3's interaction with MLKL is crucial for the execution of necroptosis, as MLKL is phosphorylated by RIPK3, leading to its activation and translocation to the plasma membrane (Wu2014Distinct).

In addition to its role in necroptosis, RIPK3 can influence apoptosis. It interacts with caspase-8 and FADD, contributing to TNF-induced apoptosis under certain conditions, such as when cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1/2) are depleted or TGF-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is inhibited (Dondelinger2013RIPK3; Newton2014Activity). These interactions highlight RIPK3's versatile role in regulating cell death pathways.
