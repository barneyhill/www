# KRT81

## Overview
KRT81 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 81, a type II hair keratin, which is a member of the keratin family of intermediate filament proteins. Keratin 81 is predominantly expressed in hair follicles, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair fibers. The protein is characterized by a central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain, which facilitates the formation of intermediate filaments through interactions with other keratins, such as KRT83 and KRT86 (Schweizer2007Hair; Chamcheu2011Keratin). These intermediate filaments are essential for the structural framework of epithelial cells, providing mechanical support and protection against stress (Ramot2009Endocrine; Ho2022Update). Beyond its primary role in hair, KRT81 has been implicated in various cancers, where alterations in its expression and genetic variations can influence cancer progression and patient prognosis (Nanashima2017Hair; Campayo2011A).

## Structure
Keratin 81 (KRT81) is a type II hair keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair. The protein is organized into a head-rod-tail structural domain, with a central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain composed of four helical segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) interrupted by non-helical linkers (Chamcheu2011Keratin). This rod domain features heptad repeats essential for coiled-coil formation, which is critical for the protein's stability and function. The helix initiation and termination motifs are highly conserved and are known mutation hotspots in keratin disorders (Chamcheu2011Keratin).

KRT81 forms heterodimers through coiled-coil associations, which align to form tetramers and eventually keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Chamcheu2011Keratin). These filaments provide mechanical support to hair fibers. The protein is expressed in the mid-cortex region of hair, where it is coexpressed with other keratins like K86 and K83 (Schweizer2007Hair).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the assembly and function of KRT81 filaments, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The molecular structure of KRT81 is integral to its role in maintaining hair structure and resilience.

## Function
KRT81, or keratin 81, is a type II hair keratin primarily expressed in hair follicles, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of hair by forming a fibrous network. This protein is part of the keratin family, which forms intermediate filaments in epithelial cells, providing mechanical support and protection against stress (Ramot2009Endocrine; Ho2022Update).

In healthy human cells, KRT81 is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for the structural framework of cells. These filaments help epithelial cells withstand mechanical stress and maintain their integrity. The central α-helical coiled-coil rod domain of KRT81 is crucial for the formation of these intermediate filaments, allowing the protein to assemble into a stable structure (Chamcheu2011Keratin).

While KRT81 is predominantly associated with hair, its expression has also been observed in other tissues, although at lower levels. The specific function of KRT81 in these tissues is not fully understood, but it is believed to contribute to the cytoskeletal organization and possibly to regulatory roles in transcription and signaling pathways (Nanashima2017Hair).

## Clinical Significance
KRT81, a type II hair keratin gene, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic variations. In breast cancer, KRT81 is expressed in both normal and cancerous cells, contributing to the invasiveness of cancer cells. Knockdown of KRT81 in breast cancer cell lines results in decreased expression of invasion-related genes and reduced cell migration and invasion abilities, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Nanashima2017Hair).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the KRT81 rs3660 genotype is associated with recurrence and survival outcomes. The CC genotype is linked to shorter time to recurrence in squamous cell carcinoma, a subtype of NSCLC, and is considered an independent prognostic marker (Campayo2011A). Similarly, in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the rs3660 GG genotype is associated with shorter survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Xie2014A).

In breast cancer, the rs3660 SNP in the 3' untranslated region of KRT81 is associated with a lower risk of the disease. The CC genotype correlates with reduced KRT81 expression, which inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sha2020A).

## Interactions
KRT81, or keratin 81, is a type II hair keratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair fibers. It interacts with other keratins, such as KRT83 and KRT86, to form intermediate filaments, which are essential for the mechanical resilience and stability of hair. These interactions are primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the structural integrity and strength of hair fibers (Cruz2017Peptide—protein). The study by Cruz et al. highlights the importance of physicochemical properties, such as cysteine content, in determining the binding affinity of peptides to keratins, suggesting that disulfide bonds play a significant role in these interactions (Cruz2017Peptide—protein).

KRT81 is also involved in the formation of heterodimers through coiled-coil associations, which align to form tetramers and eventually keratin intermediate filaments (Chamcheu2011Keratin). These interactions contribute to the assembly and stability of the keratin network, which is vital for maintaining the structural properties of hair. The interactions of KRT81 with other keratins are essential for the proper formation and function of hair fibers, highlighting its role in hair-related disorders such as monilethrix (Chamcheu2011Keratin).
