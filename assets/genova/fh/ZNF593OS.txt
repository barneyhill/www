# ZNF593OS

## Overview
ZNF593OS is a gene that encodes the ZNF593 opposite strand protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The ZNF593 opposite strand protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein, a type of protein known for its role in binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with nucleic acids. The specific functions and interactions of ZNF593OS and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding gene regulation and potential clinical significance.
