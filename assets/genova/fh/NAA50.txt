# NAA50

## Overview
The NAA50 gene encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 50, also known as the NatE catalytic subunit, which is a crucial component of the N-terminal acetylation machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein belongs to the GNAT (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) family and is involved in both N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) and lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activities. NAA50 plays a significant role in the acetylation of nascent polypeptides, influencing protein stability and function, and is also implicated in chromatin modification through histone acetylation. The protein forms part of the NatA complex, interacting with other subunits such as NAA10 and NAA15, to enhance catalytic efficiency. In addition to its enzymatic functions, NAA50 is involved in critical cellular processes such as chromosome segregation during mitosis and has been identified as a significant biomarker in cancer prognosis, with its expression levels correlating with outcomes in various cancers (Evjenth2009Human; Deng2019Structure; Fang2022Pancancer).

## Structure
The NAA50 protein, also known as the NatE catalytic subunit, is involved in N-terminal acetylation and features a GNAT (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ribeiro2016Naa50Sandependent). The protein's structure includes interactions with other subunits, such as Naa10 and Naa15, forming a complex that enhances its catalytic efficiency in humans (Deng2019Structure). 

In terms of secondary structure, NAA50 contains alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in proteins with GNAT domains. The tertiary structure of NAA50 is characterized by its dynamic association within the NatA complex, as indicated by the poorly resolved electron density of Naa50 compared to NatA in crystal structures (Deng2019Structure). 

The quaternary structure involves NAA50 forming a complex with NatA, where it interacts with Naa15 through loop-loop interactions and with Naa10 through electrostatic interactions (Deng2019Structure). This interaction is crucial for the catalytic functions of the complex, particularly in humans, where NAA50 enhances substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency (Deng2019Structure). 

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, are significant for NAA50's function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested, which may lead to variations in activity or localization, but specific isoforms are not described in the context.

## Function
The NAA50 gene encodes the Naa50p protein, which exhibits both N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) and lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activities. Naa50p is involved in the N-terminal acetylation of nascent polypeptides on the ribosome, a modification crucial for protein function and stability (Evjenth2009Human). It specifically acetylates oligopeptides with N-terminal sequences such as Met-Leu-Xxx-Pro and can autoacetylate lysines 34, 37, and 140, which modulates its substrate specificity (Evjenth2009Human). Naa50p also acetylates histone 4, indicating a role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Evjenth2009Human).

Naa50p is a part of the NatA complex, where it enhances the catalytic activities of the complex, although it can also function independently (Deng2019Structure; Ribeiro2016Naa50Sandependent). In human cells, Naa50p plays a significant role in chromosome segregation during mitosis, with its loss linked to chromatid cohesion defects (Ribeiro2016Naa50Sandependent). It is suggested to regulate sister chromatid cohesion by facilitating interactions between cohesin subunits (Ribeiro2016Naa50Sandependent). Naa50p's activity is distinct from other acetyltransferases, highlighting its unique role in protein acetylation and cellular processes (Evjenth2009Human).

## Clinical Significance
The NAA50 gene, also known as N-alpha-acetyltransferase 50, has been identified as a significant biomarker in cancer prognosis and immune infiltration. High expression levels of NAA50 are associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, lower-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. Conversely, increased NAA50 expression is linked to a favorable prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Fang2022Pancancer). Genetic alterations in NAA50, primarily amplifications, are prevalent in most cancers, except for glioma and renal non-clear cell carcinoma, where deletions and mutations are more common (Fang2022Pancancer).

NAA50 expression is significantly associated with immune subtypes and immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T cell NK infiltration, which are linked to poor and good prognosis, respectively (Fang2022Pancancer). In lung adenocarcinoma, NAA50 expression correlates with various immune cells and major histocompatibility complexes, indicating its role in immune response modulation (Fang2022Pancancer). The gene's involvement in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication further underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Fang2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
NAA50, also known as N-alpha-acetyltransferase 50, is a component of the NatA complex, which includes NAA10 and NAA15. This complex is involved in N-terminal acetylation, a common post-translational modification in eukaryotes. NAA50 interacts with NAA15 through a network of hydrophobic interactions, forming a stable binding interface that is crucial for the complex's function. The interaction between NAA50 and NAA15 is mediated by specific non-polar residues, and the TPTLXE motif in the NAA15 loop is conserved across species, indicating a similar binding mode in both yeast and humans (Deng2019Structure).

In humans, NAA50 enhances the catalytic efficiency of the NatA complex by increasing substrate binding affinity, which is not observed in yeast due to the catalytic inactivity of yeast NAA50. This enhancement is attributed to the dynamic association of NAA50 with NatA, involving loop-loop interactions and direct electrostatic interactions with NAA10 (Deng2019Structure). The presence of the regulatory protein HYPK in humans, which is absent in yeast, may also influence NAA50 interactions, suggesting evolutionary differences in the NatE complexes between species (Deng2019Structure).
