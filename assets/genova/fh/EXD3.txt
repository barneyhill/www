# EXD3

## Overview
The EXD3 gene encodes the protein exonuclease 3'-5' domain containing 3, which is a member of the exonuclease family. This protein is characterized by its ability to degrade nucleic acids from the 3' to 5' direction, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and RNA processing. The exonuclease activity of EXD3 is essential for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring the fidelity of genetic information. As a result, EXD3 is implicated in several biological pathways and may have potential clinical significance in the context of genetic disorders and cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
