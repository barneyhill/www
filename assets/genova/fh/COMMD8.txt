# COMMD8

## Overview
COMMD8, or COMM domain containing 8, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is part of the COMMD protein family. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for immune response and inflammation control (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). As a component of the Commander complex, COMMD8 plays a role in cell signaling and receptor trafficking, interacting with other proteins such as CCDC22 and CCDC93 to form a pseudo-symmetric ring structure (Laulumaa2023Structure). Additionally, COMMD8 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is often upregulated, contributing to tumorigenic processes (You2023COMMD). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.

## Function
COMMD8 is a protein that plays a significant role in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating inflammation and immune responses. In healthy human cells, COMMD8 forms a complex with CCDC22, which is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB proteins. This degradation is a critical step for the activation of NF-κB, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes involved in proinflammatory responses (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). The CCDC22-COMMD8 complex is necessary for the proper functioning of the CRL1-βTrCP complex, which facilitates IκB turnover and NF-κB activation (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22).

COMMD8 is also involved in various physiological processes beyond NF-κB signaling. It is part of a conserved family of proteins that influence protein degradation and cellular regulation (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). While specific details about COMMD8's function in healthy cells are limited, its role in maintaining NF-κB signaling highlights its importance in immune function and inflammation control (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22).

## Clinical Significance
COMMD8 is implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In NSCLC, COMMD8 is up-regulated and contributes to tumorigenic processes such as cell proliferation, migration, glycolysis, and the inhibition of apoptosis. This up-regulation is potentially mediated through the MALAT1/miR-613 and LINC00657/miR-26b-5p axes, indicating a carcinogenic role for COMMD8 in this type of lung cancer (You2023COMMD). In HCC, COMMD8 is also overexpressed, which is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, although specific mechanisms in HCC are not detailed (You2023COMMD).

COMMD8, along with other COMMD proteins, is generally upregulated in tumor cells, promoting tumor growth and progression. This suggests that alterations in COMMD8 expression may contribute to the aggressive nature of certain cancers (You2023COMMD). While the context does not provide information on specific mutations in COMMD8, its altered expression and interactions in cancer highlight its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its role and mechanisms in various cancers.

## Interactions
COMMD8 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily forming complexes with other proteins. It interacts with COMMD3 to form the COMMD3/8 complex, which is crucial for the recruitment of GRK6 to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like CXCR4. This interaction is essential for β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways and B cell chemotactic responses (Nakai2019The). The COMMD3/8 complex is recruited to ligand-activated chemoattractant receptors, such as CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR7, and EBI2, and this recruitment is dependent on the receptor's C-terminal tail (Nakai2019The).

COMMD8 is also part of the larger Commander complex, where it interacts with proteins like CCDC22 and CCDC93. Within this complex, COMMD8 forms a pseudo-symmetric ring with other COMMD proteins, contributing to the complex's role in cell signaling and receptor trafficking (Laulumaa2023Structure). The Commander complex is involved in interactions with the WASH complex and other proteins, suggesting a role in endosomal sorting and trafficking (Laulumaa2023Structure).

COMMD8's stability is interdependent with COMMD3, and their interaction is critical for their function and stability, as disruption leads to enhanced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Nakai2019The).
