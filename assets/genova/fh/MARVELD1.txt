# MARVELD1

## Overview
MARVELD1, or MARVEL domain-containing 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, actin organization, and RNA processing. The protein is characterized by a MARVEL domain, which typically features a four-transmembrane-helix architecture, although MARVELD1 is unique in its nuclear localization rather than being membrane-associated (Wang2009Identification). This protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Wang2009Identification). MARVELD1 plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (DDR) network, interacting with key proteins such as PARP1 to maintain genome stability and promote therapy resistance in cancer cells (Sun2023The). Alterations in MARVELD1 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may contribute to oncogenic processes and therapy resistance, making it a potential target for cancer treatment (Sun2023The; Zhang2019MARVELD1).

## Structure
MARVELD1 is a protein characterized by a MARVEL domain, which includes a four-transmembrane-helix architecture with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions, forming an M-shaped topology (Wang2009Identification). This structure is typical of proteins involved in membrane-related functions, although MARVELD1 is unique in its nuclear localization, unlike other MARVEL domain proteins that are membrane-associated (Wang2009Identification). The protein consists of 173 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa (Wang2009Identification).

MARVELD1 is highly conserved across species, with more than 90% similarity to its counterparts in other organisms such as mice, Bos Taurus, Pan troglodytes, and Macaca mulatta (Wang2009Identification). Despite its conservation, MARVELD1 does not share significant amino acid similarity with other MARVEL domain proteins, suggesting distinct biological functions (Wang2009Identification).

The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, as indicated by the presence of predicted PKC phosphorylation sites in its mouse homolog, mMARVELD1 (Zeng2011Identification). These modifications may play a role in its function and regulation. The study of MARVELD1's structure and modifications provides insights into its unique role in cellular processes.

## Function
MARVELD1 (MARVEL domain-containing 1) is a nuclear protein involved in several cellular processes, including cell adhesion, actin organization, and RNA processing. It is characterized by a four-transmembrane-helix architecture and is widely expressed in normal human tissues (Wang2009Identification).

In healthy cells, MARVELD1 regulates integrin β1-mediated cell adhesion and actin organization by inhibiting the pre-mRNA processing of integrin β1. This regulation affects the phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a key player in cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Overexpression of MARVELD1 leads to reduced FAK phosphorylation, while its knockdown increases FAK phosphorylation (Wang2013MARVELD1). MARVELD1 also influences the expression of genes related to focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, and actin cytoskeleton regulation (Wang2013MARVELD1).

MARVELD1 plays a role in nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) by inhibiting the serine phosphorylation of UPF1, a crucial factor in the NMD pathway. This interaction disrupts the binding of SMG5, which is necessary for mRNA degradation, thereby stabilizing NMD targets (Hu2013MARVELD1). MARVELD1's interaction with importin β1 suggests its involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport, affecting its localization and function within the cell (Wang2015Importinβ1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MARVELD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. High levels of MARVELD1 expression are associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including lower-grade glioma (LGG), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), breast cancer (BRCA), bladder cancer (BLCA), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) (Sun2023The). MARVELD1 interacts with PARP1, a key enzyme in the DNA damage response, enhancing cell tolerance to genotoxic stress and contributing to therapy resistance (Sun2023The). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MARVELD1 is epigenetically silenced, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increases metastatic potential (Yao2015MARVELD1). The gene is also downregulated in various cancers due to DNA methylation, which can be reversed by pharmacologic demethylation (Wang2009Identification). In lung cancer, MARVELD1 silencing affects the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Shi2014Biological). 

MARVELD1's role in regulating cell proliferation and migration suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to oncogenic processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer (Zhang2019MARVELD1).

## Interactions
MARVELD1 interacts with several proteins involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) network, playing a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and promoting therapy resistance in cancer cells. One of its primary interactions is with PARP1, a key enzyme in DDR. This interaction is facilitated by the DNA-binding domain or automodification domain of PARP1 and is independent of DNA, as it persists even in the presence of benzonase, which degrades DNA and RNA (Sun2023The). MARVELD1 is PARylated by PARP1, a modification that enhances its nuclear translocation during DDR. This PARylation is crucial for MARVELD1's function in DDR and is reduced by the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Sun2023The).

MARVELD1 also interacts with other DDR proteins, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays (Sun2023The). It forms a ternary complex with PARP1 and NAA50, enhancing PARP1 stability by promoting its acetylation, which decreases PARP1 ubiquitination and prolongs its half-life (Sun2023The). These interactions suggest that MARVELD1 acts as a mediator in the DDR network, binding to multiple DDR sensor molecules, transducers, and effectors, thereby expanding the variety of recruited DDR molecules and improving tolerance to DNA damage (Sun2023The).
