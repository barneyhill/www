# GK3

## Overview
Glycerol kinase 3 (GK3) is a gene that encodes the enzyme glycerol kinase 3, which is a member of the kinase family of proteins. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, signal transduction, and cell regulation. The glycerol kinase 3 enzyme is involved in the phosphorylation of glycerol, a key step in glycerol metabolism, which is essential for energy production and lipid biosynthesis. This enzyme's activity is significant in tissues that utilize glycerol as a substrate for gluconeogenesis and triglyceride synthesis. Mutations or dysregulation of the GK3 gene can have implications in metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
