# CLIC3

## Overview
CLIC3, or chloride intracellular channel 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family, which is part of the larger glutathione S-transferase superfamily. The CLIC3 protein is characterized by its ability to exist in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, facilitating its role in chloride ion transport and cellular homeostasis. It is involved in forming anion-conducting pores or modulating other proteins to facilitate chloride movement, although it lacks some functional elements found in other CLIC family members (Money2007Expression). CLIC3 is highly expressed in the placenta and plays a role in various cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking and integrin recycling, which are crucial for cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (Argenzio2016Emerging). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as ERK7 and transglutaminase 2, underscore its involvement in cell growth regulation and cancer progression (HernandezFernaud2017Secreted; Qian1999Molecular). CLIC3's expression levels have clinical significance, particularly in cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Kawai2020Pathophysiological; Macpherson2014CLIC3).

## Structure
CLIC3, a member of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family, is part of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily. The primary structure of CLIC3 consists of a polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa, consistent with the conceptual translation of its full-length cDNA (Money2007Expression). The secondary structure of CLIC3 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of proteins in this family. The tertiary structure is characterized by a globular shape with a conserved thioredoxin fold, which is a common feature among CLIC proteins (HernandezFernaud2017Secreted).

CLIC3 can exist in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, suggesting potential quaternary structures that allow it to function in different cellular environments (Money2007Expression). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and oxidation, which could influence its function and localization. CLIC3 is also known to have splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (HernandezFernaud2017Secreted).

The protein is involved in forming anion-conducting pores or modulating other proteins to facilitate chloride movement, although it possesses only some of the putative functional elements found in other CLIC family members (Money2007Expression).

## Function
CLIC3 (chloride intracellular channel 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in chloride ion transport and cellular homeostasis. It is part of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family, which is involved in regulating the movement of chloride ions, a critical process for maintaining cell viability (Money2007Expression). In healthy human cells, CLIC3 is highly expressed in the placenta, particularly in syncytiotrophoblast and villous cytotrophoblast cells, where it may facilitate chloride movement across the microvillous membrane, suggesting a role in chloride transport (Money2007Expression).

CLIC3 is also associated with the regulation of cellular processes such as cell growth, as it interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK7, indicating a potential role in cell growth regulation (Money2007Expression). The protein is involved in endosomal trafficking and integrin recycling, particularly the recycling of α5β1 integrins, which are crucial for cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (Argenzio2016Emerging). CLIC3's involvement in these processes suggests it plays a role in maintaining cellular architecture and function. Its activity in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and potentially the nucleus, highlights its diverse functional roles in cell biology (Money2007Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLIC3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor (ER)-negative types, CLIC3 is involved in the trafficking of matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP, which is crucial for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. High CLIC3 expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Macpherson2014CLIC3).

In gastric cancer, CLIC3 expression is negatively correlated with pathological tumor depth, and lower expression levels are linked to poorer prognosis. Knockdown of CLIC3 accelerates cell proliferation, indicating its role in tumor growth regulation (Kawai2020Pathophysiological).

In malignant pleural mesothelioma, CLIC3 is significantly overexpressed, and its expression is positively correlated with CLIC4, suggesting a potential interaction that may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Tasiopoulou2015Transcriptional).

CLIC3 is also upregulated in the stroma of various carcinomas, including ovarian cancer, where it promotes cell invasion and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Its secretion by cancer-associated fibroblasts and cancer cells enhances endothelial cell invasiveness and angiogenesis, contributing to a pro-invasive tumor microenvironment (HernandezFernaud2017Secreted).

## Interactions
CLIC3 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies, suggesting a stable complex formation between CLIC3 and ERK7. Although CLIC3 is not directly phosphorylated by ERK7, their association may influence chloride ion channel conductance or facilitate interactions with other cellular components (Qian1999Molecular).

CLIC3 also interacts with transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), a protein involved in extracellular matrix stabilization. This interaction is significant for cancer progression, as CLIC3 regulates the reduced status of specific cysteines in TGM2, affecting its activity. The interaction between CLIC3 and TGM2 is crucial for promoting cancer cell invasiveness and is dependent on the presence of α5β1 integrin, which enhances cell invasion in response to microenvironmental stiffness (HernandezFernaud2017Secreted).

In the context of integrin recycling, CLIC3 colocalizes with LAMP1 in late endosomes and regulates the recycling of α5β1 integrins in a Rab25-dependent manner, influencing cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Argenzio2016Emerging).
