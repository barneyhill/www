# CC2D1A

## Overview
The CC2D1A gene encodes the coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A protein, which is a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil and C2 domains, as well as four unique DM14 domains, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling pathways, including those involving nuclear factor κB and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). CC2D1A is primarily located in the cytoplasm and functions as a soluble protein, interacting with key components of the ESCRT-III complex, such as CHMP4B, to regulate processes like cytokinesis and virus budding (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). Additionally, it modulates phosphodiesterase 4D activity, impacting cellular cAMP homeostasis (AlTawashi2013Phosphodiesterase). Mutations in the CC2D1A gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its critical role in cognitive and social development (Oaks2016Cc2d1a; Zamarbide2018Loss).

## Structure
The CC2D1A protein is encoded by the CC2D1A gene and is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain and a C2 domain, which are integral to its function. The protein is 950 amino acids long, with a shorter isoform containing 388 amino acids (BaselVanagaite2005The). It belongs to a novel gene family with C2 domains and includes four Drosophila melanogaster 14 (DM14) domains followed by a C2 domain (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). The DM14 domains are unique to this protein family, although their specific roles remain unclear (BaselVanagaite2005The).

The CC2D1A protein acts as a scaffold, facilitating interactions in various cellular pathways, including the TBK-1, nuclear factor κB, and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathways (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). It is involved in centrosome function and cell division, with its activity regulated by phosphorylation (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). The protein is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and is soluble, lacking transmembrane regions or signal peptides, indicating it is not secreted (BaselVanagaite2005The).

At least 12 splice variants of the CC2D1A gene have been identified, which may influence the protein's function and interactions (BaselVanagaite2005The). The protein's interaction with CHMP4B is mediated by a short linear sequence within the third DM14 domain, preventing CHMP4B polymerization (Martinelli2012CC2D1A).

## Function
The CC2D1A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the ESCRT-III complex component CHMP4B. CC2D1A acts as a regulator by interacting with CHMP4B, preventing its polymerization, which is crucial for processes such as cytokinesis and virus budding (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). This interaction is mediated through the third DM14 repeat of CC2D1A, forming a complex with nanomolar affinity, and is essential for regulating CHMP4B polymerization (Martinelli2012CC2D1A).

CC2D1A is also involved in the regulation of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) activity, which is important for maintaining cellular cAMP homeostasis. It binds to PDE4D, reducing its phosphorylation and activation by protein kinase A (PKA), thus preventing excessive PDE4D activity and ensuring proper cAMP signaling (AlTawashi2013Phosphodiesterase).

In the context of endosomal sorting, CC2D1A interacts with CHMP4B polymers on endosomal membranes, playing a role in the degradation of transmembrane receptors like EGFR. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of receptor sorting to intraluminal vesicles and their subsequent lysosomal degradation (Deshar2016CC2D1A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing pathways related to cell survival and proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CC2D1A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and seizures. These conditions often result from loss-of-function mutations, which disrupt cognitive and social development (Oaks2016Cc2d1a; Zamarbide2018Loss). The gene's role in intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, is crucial for maintaining signaling homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (Manzini2014CC2D1A).

CC2D1A mutations are also linked to ciliopathies, which include conditions like heterotaxy, renal dysplasia, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow. These conditions arise from defects in cilia, which are essential for various developmental processes (Ma2020Monoallelic; Kim2024CC2D1A). In particular, heterotaxy involves abnormal left-right body patterning, often due to defective ciliary function (Kim2024CC2D1A).

Animal models have demonstrated that CC2D1A deficiency leads to cognitive and social deficits, hyperactivity, and anxiety, reflecting the human phenotypes associated with its mutations (Oaks2016Cc2d1a; Zamarbide2018Loss). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in neurodevelopment and its potential impact on a broad spectrum of disorders.

## Interactions
CC2D1A is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with CHMP4B, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, forming a 1:1 complex with nanomolar affinity. This interaction involves a specific region within the third DM14 domain of CC2D1A and the N-terminal helical hairpin of CHMP4B. The binding of CC2D1A to CHMP4B prevents CHMP4B polymerization, suggesting that CC2D1A acts as a negative regulator of CHMP4B function (Martinelli2012CC2D1A).

CC2D1A also interacts with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, which is crucial for activating NF-κB through the canonical pathway. This interaction requires the C2 domain of CC2D1A and is negatively regulated by the deubiquitination enzyme CYLD, which cleaves Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Zhao2010CC2D1A).

In the context of HIV-1 budding, CC2D1A interacts with CHMP4B and inhibits the process by affecting the availability of CHMP4 family members. It also blocks the function of ALIX, another protein involved in HIV-1 budding, without altering its expression levels (Usami2012Regulation). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CC2D1A in cellular regulation.
