# CD19

## Overview
CD19 is a gene that encodes the CD19 protein, a critical component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. The CD19 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a unique double immunoglobulin (Ig) domain structure, which is essential for its function in B cell signaling and activation (Youkharibache2021Topological; Susa2021CryoEM). As a signal transduction molecule, CD19 is involved in lowering the activation threshold of B cells, thereby facilitating their activation and subsequent antibody production (van2010CD81). It interacts with other components of the BCR complex, such as CD21 and CD81, to modulate B cell responses (Fujimoto1998CD19). Mutations in the CD19 gene can lead to immune deficiencies and have clinical significance in conditions such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where they may contribute to resistance against targeted therapies (CortésLópez2022Highthroughput).

## Structure
The CD19 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a double immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which is a novel structural innovation. This double Ig domain is composed of two Ig domains with a parallel topology, linked by short linkers, and assembles pseudosymmetrically with an inverted topology (Youkharibache2021Topological). The structure involves a circular permutation of protodomains, resulting in an inverse Ig topology, forming two fused long sheets: (BED)1(DEB)2 vs. (A'|GFCC')1(C'CFG|A)2 (Youkharibache2021Topological). 

The CD19 protein's extracellular region was traditionally thought to consist of two Ig domains of C2 topology in tandem, but recent structural analysis reveals it is composed of a double Ig domain, not two single Ig domains in tandem (Youkharibache2021Topological). This double Ig domain is separated by a long linker structured as a small domain, challenging sequence-based predictions (Youkharibache2021Topological). 

CD19 is a single-pass transmembrane protein, and its interaction with CD81 is crucial for B cell development and activation. The CD19-CD81 complex structure reveals the extracellular domains and transmembrane helices, showing a contact interface between the ectodomains that facilitates complex formation (Susa2021CryoEM).

## Function
The CD19 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, which includes CD21, CD81, and CD225. This complex is essential for lowering the activation threshold of B cells in response to antigens, thereby facilitating B cell activation and antibody production (van2010CD81; van2006An). CD19 is expressed on the surface of B cells from early pre-B-cell development until plasma cell differentiation, playing a significant role in B cell signaling and growth regulation (Zhou1994TissueSpecific).

CD19 functions as a signal transduction molecule and serves as a costimulatory molecule for activation through other B-lymphocyte cell surface molecules. It enhances antigen-driven B-cell activation by linking functionally with surface immunoglobulin (Ig) (Zhou1994TissueSpecific). The cytoplasmic domain of CD19 contains kinase insert regions that mediate the binding and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase when phosphorylated, which is crucial for B-cell signaling (Zhou1994TissueSpecific).

In healthy human cells, CD19 is vital for B cell differentiation and function, appearing early during B-cell differentiation in the bone marrow and remaining present until the B cell becomes a plasma cell (van2006An). Its role in the immune system is underscored by its involvement in the activation of B cells and the production of antibodies, which are essential for effective immune responses (van2010CD81).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD19 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the immune system. CD19 is crucial for B cell function, and its deficiency can lead to antibody-deficiency syndromes. Patients with mutations in the CD19 gene exhibit increased susceptibility to infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired responses to antigenic stimulation, despite having normal numbers of mature B cells. These mutations often result in undetectable or significantly reduced levels of CD19, leading to defective antigenic stimulation of B cells and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (van2006An).

In the context of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), mutations in the CD19 gene can lead to alternative splicing events, resulting in non-functional CD19 proteins. These splicing alterations are associated with resistance to CART-19 therapy, a treatment targeting the CD19 antigen on B cells. Aberrant splicing, such as exon 2 skipping and intron 2 retention, contributes to therapy resistance by producing CD19 isoforms that escape CART-19 recognition (CortésLópez2022Highthroughput).

Additionally, defects in the CD81 gene, which is part of the CD19 complex, can also lead to antibody deficiency. A mutation in CD81 disrupts CD19 complex formation, resulting in similar immunodeficiency conditions as those caused by CD19 mutations (van2010CD81).

## Interactions
CD19 is a critical component of the B cell receptor complex, engaging in various interactions that modulate B cell signaling. It forms a non-covalent complex with CD21, CD81, and Leu-13 on the surface of B cells. CD19 associates independently with CD21 and CD81, while Leu-13 associates with CD81 (Fujimoto1998CD19). The interaction between CD19 and CD81 is particularly significant, as CD81-deficient mice exhibit reduced CD19 expression on the cell surface (Fujimoto1998CD19).

CD19 is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of several downstream signaling molecules. It binds to the Vav adapter protein and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), forming a signaling complex. The p85 subunit of PI3K binds to CD19 via specific tyrosine residues, Y482 and Y513 (Fujimoto1998CD19). CD19 also interacts with Src-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) such as Fyn, Lyn, and Lck, and is a substrate for these kinases (Fujimoto1998CD19).

CD19 cross-linking leads to the formation of a complex with Vav and PI3K, activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in B cell precursors (Weng1994Signaling). This interaction is crucial for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Weng1994Signaling).
