# UPK2

## Overview
Uroplakin 2 (UPK2) is a gene that encodes the protein uroplakin 2, a type I transmembrane protein integral to the structure and function of the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the urinary tract. Uroplakin 2 is a critical component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM), which forms urothelial plaques on the apical surface of urothelial cells, contributing to the bladder's barrier function and structural integrity (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are essential for its proper assembly and function (Hu2005Assembly). Uroplakin 2 interacts with other uroplakin proteins, forming heterodimers that are crucial for the transport and assembly of these proteins into the cell membrane (Tu2002Specific). Mutations or alterations in the UPK2 gene are associated with various urinary tract conditions and have implications in cancer prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhu2021Potential; Carpenter2016Role).

## Structure
Uroplakin 2 (UPK2) is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the structure of urothelial plaques. The protein is synthesized as a precursor with a cleavable signal peptide and a prosequence that includes potential N-glycosylation sites (Tu2002Specific). The mature form of UPK2 is approximately 100 amino acids long and features a single transmembrane domain at its COOH-terminus (Yu1994Uroplakins). This domain anchors the protein in the membrane, while the amino-terminal domain is exposed to the luminal space (Wu1994Mammalian).

UPK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is differentiation-dependent. The pro-UPK2 form contains three potential N-glycosylation sites, all of which are glycosylated, contributing to its sugar content (Hu2005Assembly). The glycosylation state of UPK2 is crucial for its proper assembly into the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) (Hu2005Assembly).

In terms of quaternary structure, UPK2 forms heterodimers with UPIa, a tetraspanin partner, which is essential for its processing and stabilization. This interaction facilitates the exit of UPK2 from the endoplasmic reticulum and its subsequent assembly into urothelial plaques (Hu2005Assembly; Tu2002Specific).

## Function
Uroplakin 2 (UPK2) is a crucial component of the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the urinary tract, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and barrier function of the bladder. UPK2 is part of the uroplakin family, which forms the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) on the apical surface of urothelial cells. This membrane is essential for providing a high-resistance barrier that protects underlying tissues from the toxic effects of urine (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation).

UPK2 forms heterodimers with UPK1a, a member of the tetraspanin family, which is necessary for the assembly and transport of uroplakins to the cell surface. This interaction is critical for the formation of urothelial plaques, which are hexagonally packed structures that contribute to the tightness and elasticity of the urothelium (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation; DeSalle2014Generation). The proper glycosylation of UPK2 is essential for its function, as it undergoes differentiation-dependent glycosylation, allowing it to form stable heterodimers and exit the endoplasmic reticulum (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation).

In healthy cells, UPK2 is involved in maintaining the impermeability and stability of the bladder lining, which is crucial for normal urinary tract function (Matuszewski2018Preliminary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the UPK2 gene, which encodes uroplakin 2, are associated with several urinary tract and renal conditions. UPK2 is crucial for the formation of urothelial plaques, and its deficiency can lead to significant structural and functional abnormalities in the urinary tract. In mice, UPK2 knockout results in vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), hydronephrosis, and ureteral obstruction, which can cause renal dysfunction and failure (Kong2004Roles). These conditions are linked to the disruption of normal plaque formation, leading to impaired urothelial barrier function and hyperplasia (Carpenter2016Role).

In humans, mutations in UPK2 are associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUTs), including malformed ureters and vesicoureteric reflux, sometimes accompanied by dysplastic kidneys (Lopes2021Envisioning). UPK2 expression is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where higher levels of UPK2 mRNA are associated with recurrence and poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for monitoring disease progression (Zhu2021Potential). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UPK2 in both urinary tract development and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
Uroplakin 2 (UPK2) is known for its interactions with other uroplakin proteins, forming essential complexes in the urothelial cell membrane. UPK2, also referred to as UPII, forms both homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with UPIa, a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily. The UPIa/UPII heterodimer is a significant cross-linked product, indicating a strong physiological interaction that is crucial for the structural organization of the urothelial cell membrane (Wu1995Selective). 

UPK2 is also involved in forming heterodimers with UPIb and UPIII, which are necessary for the transport of these proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, contributing to the formation of urothelial plaques (Kong2004Roles). The absence of UPK2 disrupts the formation of these plaques, leading to significant physiological consequences, such as increased urine output and compromised renal function (Kong2004Roles).

The interactions of UPK2 are sensitive to certain detergents, with octyl glucoside disrupting the UPII homodimer formation, suggesting a weaker interaction compared to the UPIa/UPII heterodimer (Wu1995Selective). These interactions highlight the critical role of UPK2 in maintaining the integrity and function of the urothelial barrier.
