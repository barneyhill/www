# KLHL36

## Overview
KLHL36 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 36, which is part of the kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of kelch motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, and BTB domains that facilitate dimerization and interaction with other proteins. KLHL36 functions primarily as a substrate-specific adapter for the Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a critical role in targeting specific proteins for degradation. This process is essential for regulating protein stability and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, transcription, and cytoskeletal remodeling, and is regulated by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation. KLHL36 has been implicated in certain cancers, where its expression levels may serve as a prognostic biomarker, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics; Fu2022Kelchlike).

## Structure
KLHL36 is a protein that belongs to the kelch-like family, characterized by the presence of kelch motifs, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs form a beta-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure. The protein also contains BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domains, which facilitate dimerization and interaction with other proteins. This structural arrangement allows KLHL36 to participate in various cellular processes through its ability to bind and interact with multiple protein partners.

The tertiary structure of KLHL36 is largely defined by the beta-propeller configuration of the kelch motifs, which provides a stable platform for interactions. The BTB domain is crucial for the quaternary structure, as it enables the formation of dimers, enhancing the protein's functional versatility. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of KLHL36, although specific details on these modifications are limited. Information on splice variant isoforms of KLHL36 is also scarce, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate the structural and functional diversity of this protein.

## Function
KLHL36 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, which function as substrate-specific adapters for the Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in targeting specific proteins for degradation, a process essential for regulating protein stability and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). KLHL36 contains characteristic domains such as the Kelch domain for substrate recruitment, the BTB/POZ domain for binding to the Cullin E3 ligase, and the BACK domain, whose function is less understood (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

In healthy human cells, KLHL36 is involved in fundamental cellular processes, including cell signaling, transcription, cell division, cytoskeletal remodeling, response to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The protein's role in these processes is mediated through its ability to facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific substrates, thereby influencing various cellular activities and maintaining proteostasis (Fu2022Kelchlike).

KLHL36's expression is highly tissue-specific and regulated by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and chromatin states, which contribute to its distinct expression patterns in different tissues (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). This regulation is crucial for its function in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
KLHL36 has been identified as having potential clinical significance in certain gastrointestinal cancers. In gastric cancer, KLHL36 expression is decreased, while high expression levels of KLHL36 are associated with favorable outcomes in pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. This suggests that KLHL36 may serve as a prognostic biomarker in these cancers (Fu2022Kelchlike). The expression of KLHL36 can be elevated by TNFα, and it interacts with substrates such as Trim55 and Trim63. Trim55, when highly expressed, can inhibit the migration and invasion of liver cancer cells, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role for KLHL36 in certain contexts (Fu2022Kelchlike).

KLHL36, like other Kelch-like proteins, may influence tumor development in a substrate-dependent manner. If a substrate is a protumor factor, KLHL36 could suppress tumor growth by promoting substrate degradation. Conversely, if a substrate is a tumor suppressor, KLHL36 might restrain antitumor functions, potentially promoting tumor growth. This dual role highlights its potential as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Fu2022Kelchlike). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in KLHL36 are not detailed in the available literature.
