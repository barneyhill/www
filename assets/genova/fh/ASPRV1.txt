# ASPRV1

## Overview
ASPRV1 is a gene that encodes the protein aspartic peptidase retroviral-like 1, which is categorized as a protease. This protein plays a significant role in skin physiology, particularly in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. It is primarily active in the epidermis, where it processes profilaggrin into filaggrin, a crucial component for skin hydration and barrier function (Edqvist2014Expression). ASPRV1 is synthesized as a zymogen and contains a transmembrane domain, becoming active under acidic conditions (Hawkins2017ICAM1+). Beyond its dermatological functions, ASPRV1 is also expressed in neutrophils, where it is implicated in immune responses and inflammation, although its specific substrates in this context are not fully understood (Hawkins2017ICAM1+). Mutations in the ASPRV1 gene have been linked to skin disorders such as ichthyosis, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining epidermal integrity (Boyden2020Mutations).

## Function
The ASPRV1 gene encodes a protein known as aspartic peptidase retroviral-like 1, which functions primarily as a protease involved in skin barrier formation. In healthy human cells, ASPRV1 is active in the epidermis, where it plays a crucial role in processing profilaggrin, a precursor to filaggrin, which is essential for skin hydration and barrier function (Edqvist2014Expression). This processing is vital for maintaining skin integrity and protecting against environmental factors. The protein is synthesized as a zymogen with a transmembrane domain and a catalytic domain, which can be activated under acidic conditions (Hawkins2017ICAM1+).

ASPRV1 is highly expressed in the stratum corneum of the skin, where it contributes to the maintenance of the skin's protective barrier by enhancing hydration (Hawkins2017ICAM1+). The gene is also expressed in neutrophils, where it is implicated in immune responses, although its specific substrates in this context remain unidentified (Hawkins2017ICAM1+). Despite its role in the immune system, ASPRV1's primary function in healthy human cells is related to skin physiology, particularly in epidermal differentiation and the formation of the skin barrier (Edqvist2014Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASPRV1 gene are associated with a dominantly inherited form of ichthyosis, characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and lamellar ichthyosis. This condition manifests as scaling and redness of the skin, with significant morbidity. The mutations identified in ASPRV1 disrupt residues near autocatalytic cleavage sites, impairing the gene's role in filaggrin processing, which is crucial for maintaining epidermal integrity (Boyden2020Mutations). Specific mutations such as c.595A>G (p.Lys199Glu) and c.940C>A (p.Pro314Thr) have been identified in affected individuals, leading to a consistent skin phenotype with large, plate-like scales and hyperkeratosis (Boyden2020Mutations).

In animal models, a de novo missense variant in ASPRV1 was identified in a German Shepherd dog with ichthyosis, suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism. This variant, c.1052T>C, affects a conserved residue near a critical cleavage site, leading to abnormal filaggrin processing and skin physiology (Bauer2017A).

ASPRV1 is also implicated in autoimmune conditions. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis, ASPRV1 is expressed in neutrophils and is necessary for sustaining chronic inflammation. Its role in this context suggests a potential involvement in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (Hawkins2017ICAM1+).

## Interactions
ASPRV1, also known as aspartic peptidase retroviral-like 1, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of skin and immune system functions. In the epidermis, ASPRV1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 (FLG2), specifically binding to its S100 domain. This interaction is crucial for the autoactivation of ASPRV1, also known as SASPase, which is important for the processing of profilaggrin into natural moisturizing factors essential for skin hydration and barrier function (Donovan2020Filaggrin). The interaction between ASPRV1 and FLG2Nter enhances the activity of ASPRV1, suggesting a regulatory role in the epidermis, although the precise mechanism remains unclear (Donovan2020Filaggrin).

In the immune system, ASPRV1 is expressed specifically in neutrophils and is implicated in promoting chronic inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis. While the specific substrates and interaction partners of ASPRV1 in neutrophils are not well-documented, its expression is associated with the progression of inflammation and may involve proinflammatory effects (Hawkins2017ICAM1+). ASPRV1's role in inflammation suggests potential interactions with other immune components, although these interactions require further investigation (Hawkins2017ICAM1+).
