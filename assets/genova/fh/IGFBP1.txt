# IGFBP1

## Overview
IGFBP1, or insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The protein is categorized as a binding protein and is involved in modulating the bioavailability and activity of IGFs, particularly IGF-I and IGF-II, by binding to them and influencing their interaction with IGF receptors. This modulation is crucial for various physiological processes, including cell growth, migration, and differentiation. The protein's function is further regulated by its phosphorylation state, which affects its affinity for IGFs and, consequently, its biological activity. IGFBP1 also interacts with integrins, influencing cell adhesion and migration, and forms complexes with fibrinogen in plasma, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular functions beyond IGF modulation (Jones1991Phosphorylation; Gligorijević2016Interaction; Clemmons1993IGF).

## Structure
IGFBP1, or insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The primary structure of IGFBP1 consists of 259 amino acids, with a mature peptide of 234 amino acids after the removal of a 25 amino acid signal peptide (Lamson1991InsulinLike). The protein is characterized by a conserved IGFBP domain and a thyroglobulin type-1 domain, which is found in the C-terminal region and is responsible for binding Fe2+ ions through a histidine residue (Sala2005Structure).

The secondary structure of IGFBP1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The C-terminal domain adopts a thyroglobulin type I fold, which is crucial for its biological activity, such as stimulating cell migration (Sala2005Structure). IGFBP1 contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in its C-domain, which interacts with integrins, influencing cell adhesion and migration (Forbes2012Insulin-Like).

Post-translational modifications of IGFBP1 include phosphorylation at serine residues, specifically at serines 101, 119, and 169, which enhances its affinity for IGF-I and alters its biological activity (Clemmons2001Use). These modifications are crucial for its function and regulation. IGFBP1 may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
IGFBP1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1) is a key regulator of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), particularly IGF-I and IGF-II, in human cells. It functions by binding to IGFs, modulating their bioavailability and activity. This binding is influenced by the phosphorylation state of IGFBP1, which affects its affinity for IGF-I. Phosphorylated IGFBP1 has a higher affinity for IGF-I, which can inhibit IGF-I's ability to bind to its receptor, thereby modulating its growth-promoting effects (Jones1991Phosphorylation; Clemmons1993IGF).

IGFBP1 is involved in transporting IGFs in the circulation and localizing them to specific cell types, such as the renal tubular epithelium, where it is co-localized with IGFs (Clemmons1993IGF). It plays a significant role in regulating IGF accessibility to extravascular tissues, with its translocation being insulin-dependent, suggesting a role in modulating IGF responsiveness by controlling its distribution and availability (Clemmons1993IGF).

In terms of cellular processes, IGFBP1 can potentiate IGF-I's effects on DNA synthesis in certain cell types, although this is inversely related to its phosphorylation state (Clemmons1993IGF). It is secreted as a soluble protein and does not accumulate intracellularly, indicating its primary activity in the extracellular environment (Clemmons1993IGF).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of IGFBP1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1) are associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. In type 1 diabetes, IGFBP1 levels are increased due to insulin deficiency, while in type 2 diabetes, levels are inappropriately high due to hepatic insulin resistance (Bach201840). Low fasting IGFBP1 levels can predict the development of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes years later (Bach201840). In obese mice, overexpression of IGFBP1 improved insulin sensitivity and reduced atherosclerosis development (Clemmons201840).

IGFBP1 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. High levels during acute coronary events predict increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Clemmons201840). In atherosclerosis, IGFBP1 can either enhance or inhibit the effects of IGF1 on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, depending on its phosphorylation status (Clemmons201840).

In cancer, IGFBP1's role is complex. It may exert tumor suppressive activity by sequestering IGFs, blunting their mitogenic actions (Hoeflich2015Physiology). In ovarian cancer, IGFBP1 is expressed in adenocarcinomas and is elevated in advanced disease, suggesting a potential prognostic value (Hoeflich2015Physiology). However, its role in prostate cancer is considered unlikely to be causative (Hoeflich2015Physiology).

## Interactions
Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. IGFBP1 binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), modulating their activity by affecting their availability and interaction with IGF receptors. This binding is influenced by the phosphorylation state of IGFBP1, with phosphorylated forms showing higher affinity for IGF-I, potentially inhibiting its receptor interaction (Jones1991Phosphorylation).

IGFBP1 also interacts with cell surface integrins, specifically the alpha 5 beta 1 (α5β1) integrin, through its Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence. This interaction is crucial for stimulating cell migration, independent of IGF-I signaling. The binding of IGFBP1 to α5β1 integrin is RGD-dependent, as demonstrated by experiments showing that mutation of the RGD sequence disrupts this interaction (Jones1993Insulinlike).

Additionally, IGFBP1 forms complexes with fibrinogen in human plasma, a unique interaction not observed with other IGFBPs. The physiological role of these complexes is not fully understood, but they may influence IGF activity or cell migration (Gligorijević2016Interaction). These interactions highlight IGFBP1's multifaceted role in cellular functions beyond IGF modulation.
