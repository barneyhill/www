# WIPI2

## Overview
WIPI2 is a gene that encodes the protein WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2, which is a member of the WD-repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, enabling it to interact with phosphoinositides and other proteins, playing a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway (Liang2019Structural; Wilson2014WIPI2b). As a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) effector, WIPI2 is essential for the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, acting as a scaffold that connects PtdIns3P production with LC3 lipidation (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI; Polson2010Mammalian). The protein's interactions, particularly with ATG16L1, are crucial for its function in autophagy, and its dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Almannai2022WIPI; Strong2021Structural).

## Structure
WIPI2 is a protein characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, typical of the WD-repeat protein family. This structure facilitates its role in autophagy by enabling interactions with other proteins and phosphoinositides (Liang2019Structural; Wilson2014WIPI2b). The protein contains two phosphoinositide-binding sites located in blades 5 and 6, which are crucial for its function in autophagosome formation (Liang2019Structural). The FRRG motif, a key feature of WIPI2, is involved in binding phosphoinositides such as PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, which are essential for membrane recruitment during autophagy (Jelani2019A; Wilson2014WIPI2b).

WIPI2 interacts with ATG16L1, a protein critical for autophagosome formation, through a specific electrostatic and hydrophobic groove between blades 2 and 3 (Strong2021Structural). Mutations in this region can significantly impact its binding affinity and autophagic function (Strong2021Structural). WIPI2 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization within the cell (Polson2010Mammalian). These structural features underscore WIPI2's role in the autophagy pathway, linking phosphoinositide binding to protein recruitment and autophagosome biogenesis.

## Function
WIPI2 is a crucial component in the autophagy process, acting as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) effector that is essential for autophagosome formation. It is recruited to early autophagosomal structures, known as omegasomes, where it plays a significant role in the maturation of these structures into autophagosomes (Polson2010Mammalian). WIPI2 interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly PtdIns3P, and is involved in the recruitment of LC3 to forming omegasomes, facilitating LC3 lipidation, a critical step in autophagosome maturation (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI; Polson2010Mammalian).

WIPI2 functions as a scaffold protein, connecting PtdIns3P production with LC3 lipidation by binding to ATG16L1 and recruiting the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex necessary for this process (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI). It is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is particularly active in the heart and skeletal muscle, localizing to ER-associated omegasomes and phagophore membranes (ProikasCezanne2015WIPI). WIPI2's role in autophagy is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses, and its dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders (Almannai2022WIPI).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WIPI2 gene are associated with a range of developmental and neurodevelopmental disorders. A specific homozygous mutation, c.G745A;pV249M, has been linked to global developmental abnormalities, including severe mental retardation, speech and language impairments, and various physical abnormalities such as short stature, thoracic kyphosis, and thumb hypoplasia. This mutation affects the gene's ability to bind phosphoinositides, which is crucial for its role in autophagy, leading to impaired autophagosome formation and autophagic flux (Jelani2019A).

In addition to developmental disorders, WIPI2 mutations have been implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, seizures, and dysmorphic features. These conditions are often accompanied by reduced brain volume and prominent white matter involvement, as well as skeletal and cardiac abnormalities (Almannai2022WIPI; Shimizu2023Comprehensive).

Altered expression of WIPI2 has also been linked to cancer, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). High levels of WIPI2 expression in CRC tissues are associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates. WIPI2's role in CRC involves its interaction with the ferroptosis pathway, suggesting it may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Yu2023WIPI2).

## Interactions
WIPI2 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its role in autophagy. It is known to recruit the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-rich membranes, facilitating the growth of the phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome (Dooley2014WIPI2; Wan2019MTORC1). The interaction between WIPI2 and ATG16L1 is essential for autophagy processes, including LC3 lipidation, which is a critical step in autophagosome formation (Strong2021Structural; Dooley2014WIPI2). 

WIPI2 is also a phosphorylation substrate of MTORC1, which phosphorylates WIPI2 at Ser395. This phosphorylation enhances WIPI2's affinity for HUWE1, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by proteasomes. This regulatory mechanism affects both basal and nutrient deprivation-stimulated autophagy (Wan2019MTORC1). 

Mutations in the WIPI2:ATG16L1 interface, such as H85E and K88E, have been shown to disrupt binding, highlighting the importance of this interaction for autophagosome formation (Strong2021Structural). WIPI2's interaction with ATG16L1 is conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary significance in autophagy (Dooley2014WIPI2).
