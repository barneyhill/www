# MAP1LC3B

## Overview
MAP1LC3B is a gene that encodes the protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B), which plays a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway. As a member of the ATG8 protein family, LC3B is integral to the formation and function of autophagosomes, the vesicular structures responsible for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-like fold and undergoes essential post-translational modifications, such as lipidation, which facilitate its association with autophagic membranes (Tanida2004Human; He2003Posttranslational). LC3B interacts with various proteins, including p62/SQSTM1 and TBC1D5, to mediate selective autophagy processes (Pankiv2007p62/SQSTM1; Popovic2012Rab). The gene's expression and function are implicated in several diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Parkinson's disease, and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021Combined; Fraiberg2020Genetic; Qi2018A).

## Structure
MAP1LC3B, a member of the LC3 family, is involved in autophagy and exhibits a ubiquitin-like fold. This protein undergoes post-translational modifications, notably lipidation, which is crucial for its function in autophagosome formation. The lipidation process involves the conjugation of MAP1LC3B with phosphatidylethanolamine, facilitating its association with autophagic membranes (Tanida2004Human).

The primary structure of MAP1LC3B includes a unique lysine residue at position 122, which is essential for its post-translational modification and distinct from other isoforms like MAP1LC3A and MAP1LC3C (He2003Posttranslational). The protein is cleaved at its carboxyl-terminal Met121 to expose Gly120, a critical step for its lipidation and targeting to autophagosomal membranes (Tanida2004Human).

MAP1LC3B exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in distinct expression patterns across human tissues (He2003Posttranslational). The protein's subcellular localization changes under conditions such as amino acid starvation, indicating its dynamic role in autophagy (He2003Posttranslational). The interaction of MAP1LC3B with autophagy adaptors like FYCO1 highlights its role in linking autophagosomes with the microtubule-based kinesin motor for vesicle transport (Cheng2016Structural).

## Function
MAP1LC3B, also known as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta, is a crucial component of the autophagy process in human cells. It is a member of the ATG8 protein family and is widely used as a marker to evaluate autophagy due to its role in autophagosome biogenesis, from the isolation membrane to the lysosomal stage (Bonam2020Progress). MAP1LC3B is involved in vesicle expansion and membrane curvature, essential for the formation of autophagosomes, which are vesicles that engulf damaged organelles and proteins for degradation and recycling (Baeken2020Novel; Bonam2020Progress).

In healthy human cells, MAP1LC3B is primarily localized in the nucleus but relocates to the cytoplasm under certain conditions, such as treatment with BafA1, where it co-localizes with p62 in autophagosomes, indicating its involvement in cytosolic autophagy (Baeken2020Novel). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which regulate its activity and localization. For instance, acetylation at specific lysine residues confines MAP1LC3B to the nucleus, while deacetylation by sirtuin 1 during stress conditions allows its translocation to the cytosol, making it available for autophagy (Baeken2020Novel; Bonam2020Progress).

MAP1LC3B's function is modulated by its interaction with proteins containing a ubiquitin-binding domain and an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which are involved in selective autophagy processes (Bonam2020Progress). The regulation of MAP1LC3B protein levels is also influenced by BAG3, which modulates its synthesis through a translational mechanism, crucial for maintaining basal autophagy (Rodríguez2016BAG3).

## Clinical Significance
The MAP1LC3B gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a rare variant rs933717 in the MAP1LC3B gene is associated with increased susceptibility, particularly in Chinese populations. This variant correlates with higher MAP1LC3B expression, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis by affecting immune tolerance and the survival of autoreactive T/B cells (Qi2018A).

In Parkinson's disease, a 21-bp insertion variant in the MAP1LC3B promoter enhances promoter activity, potentially contributing to the disease by affecting autophagy, a process crucial for neuronal health (Fraiberg2020Genetic). The gene is also implicated in diabetic nephropathy, where altered MAP1LC3B expression is linked to disrupted autophagy processes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection (Mohamed2018Diabetic).

In cancer, MAP1LC3B mutations and expression changes are observed across various types, including breast cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma, where they are associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Liu2021Combined; Liu2018Map1lc3b). These findings highlight the gene's role in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MAP1LC3B, also known as LC3B, is a key protein in the autophagy process, interacting with various proteins to facilitate autophagosome formation and function. It binds to p62/SQSTM1, a protein that plays a crucial role in aggrephagy, the selective degradation of protein aggregates. This interaction is mediated through the LC3-interacting region (LIR) of p62, which is essential for binding to LC3B and other ATG8 homologues (Pankiv2007p62/SQSTM1).

LC3B also interacts with the retromer complex through TBC1D5, a Rab GTPase-activating protein. TBC1D5 contains LIR motifs that mediate its binding to LC3B, with the N-terminal LIR1 motif being crucial for this interaction (Popovic2012Rab). Additionally, LC3B is involved in the interaction with the Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1), which is essential for maintaining autophagic activity and influences autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Mir2013Progesterone).

FAIM2, a lysosomal protein, interacts with the lipidated form of LC3B (MAP1LC3B-II) through its LIR motif, facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a critical step in autophagy (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic). These interactions highlight the central role of LC3B in autophagy and its involvement in various cellular processes.
