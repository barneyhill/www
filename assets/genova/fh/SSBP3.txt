# SSBP3

## Overview
SSBP3 is a gene that encodes the single-stranded DNA-binding protein 3, which is a crucial component in various cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and neurodevelopment. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind single-stranded DNA and is involved in the stabilization of LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcriptional complexes, which are essential for neuronal development. SSBP3 contains a conserved FOR-WARD/LUFS domain, a proline-rich sequence, and a transcriptionally active C-terminal region, which collectively contribute to its functional roles (Wang2019Crystal; Liu2016Singlestranded). The protein is expressed in excitatory neurons and is implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing brain development and function (Salim2023The). Alterations in SSBP3 expression have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Salim2023The).

## Structure
The SSBP3 protein contains several distinct regions that contribute to its function. At the N-terminal end, it has a well-conserved FOR-WARD/LUFS domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Liu2016Singlestranded). This domain is evolutionarily conserved and shares structural characteristics with the LUFS domain of SSBP2, which forms a homo-tetramer through a conserved hydrophobic interface (Wang2019Crystal). The middle region of SSBP3 features a highly conserved proline-rich sequence, essential for embryonic head development (Liu2016Singlestranded). The C-terminal end of SSBP3 possesses transcriptional activity, indicating its role in gene regulation (Liu2016Singlestranded).

SSBP3 is known to exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with human SSBP3 having three transcripts: SSBP3a, SSBP3b, and SSBP3c (Yin2018SIVA1). These isoforms exhibit distinct expression patterns and stability, with SSBP3a and SSBP3c having half-lives of approximately 6 and 2 hours, respectively (Yin2018SIVA1). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which regulates its stability and degradation (Yin2018SIVA1).

## Function
The SSBP3 gene encodes a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in the stability and function of LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcriptional complexes, which are essential for early neuronal development. SSBP3 interacts with LDB1 and LIM-HD transcriptional factors to form a complex that stabilizes these proteins, preventing their degradation and ensuring proper assembly and dynamics of the LIM-HD/CLIM protein complex in vivo (Yin2018SIVA1). SSBP3 is involved in the assembly of the LIM-HD/CLIM transcriptional protein complex in the nucleus, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Yin2018SIVA1).

SSBP3 is expressed in excitatory neurons and is linked to markers of excitatory glutamatergic neurons and oligodendrocytes, indicating its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Salim2023The). The gene is also part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development and function (Salim2023The). In Drosophila, the ortholog of SSBP3, known as Ssdp, influences brain morphology, synaptic density, and oxidative stress pathways, leading to autism-like behaviors, suggesting a similar role for SSBP3 in humans (Salim2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SSBP3 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). SSBP3 is located in the 1p32.3 chromosomal region and is considered dosage-sensitive, with both haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity being significant factors. Changes in SSBP3 dosage, due to microdeletions or duplications, can lead to developmental delays, macrocephaly, and autism (Salim2023The). 

Research using Drosophila melanogaster models, where the ortholog of SSBP3 is known as Ssdp, has shown that overexpression of Ssdp affects brain development, synaptic density, and oxidative stress pathways, leading to autism-like behaviors. These findings suggest that SSBP3 dosage alterations may contribute to the phenotypes associated with the 1p32.3 microdeletion/duplication region, potentially through mechanisms involving the Wnt signaling pathway and altered gliogenesis (Salim2023The).

The gene is also part of a gene-regulatory network that influences cognition and neurodevelopmental diseases. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has linked multiple allele variants of SSBP3 to altered brain morphology, cortical surface area, and subcortical volume, further implicating its role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Salim2023The).

## Interactions
SSBP3 is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. It is a component of an erythroid DNA-binding complex that includes transcription factors such as TAL1 and GATA-1, as well as LIM domain proteins like Lmo2 and Ldb1. This complex binds to a bipartite E-box-GATA DNA sequence motif, which is essential for transcriptional regulation (Xu2007Singlestranded). SSBP3, along with SSBP2, helps stabilize Ldb1 and LMO proteins by preventing their ubiquitination and degradation, thereby regulating their abundance and stability (Xu2007Singlestranded).

In Drosophila, the ortholog of SSBP3, known as Ssdp, interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, affecting the expression of key proteins such as armadillo and wingless. These interactions are implicated in neurodevelopment and behaviors associated with autism (Salim2023The). Ssdp also influences mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress pathways, which are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (Salim2023The). These findings suggest that SSBP3 and its orthologs participate in complex regulatory networks that impact both transcriptional activity and cellular homeostasis.
