# ACTRT3

## Overview
ACTRT3 is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein T3, a member of the actin family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating motility. Actin-related protein T3 is particularly significant in the context of spermatogenesis, where it forms a complex with profilin III to support the development and motility of sperm cells (Chen2023TranscriptomeWide). Additionally, ACTRT3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell division, and its expression levels have been associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, although no direct correlation with prostate cancer has been established (Chen2023TranscriptomeWide). The protein's role in cell migration is highlighted by its increased expression in cells deficient in MST2, a kinase that regulates cell junctions and mobility (Wang2019Hippo). Despite these insights, the comprehensive functional characterization of ACTRT3 remains an area of active research (Chen2023TranscriptomeWide).

## Function
ACTRT3, or actin-related protein T3, is a member of the actin family, which is integral to cellular structure and motility. In healthy human cells, ACTRT3 is involved in cytoskeletal organization, influencing cell shape and movement. It plays a critical role in regulating sperm nucleus cytomorphology, which is essential for the processing of spermatids into mature motile sperm. This function is facilitated by the formation of a testis-specific profilin III-ACTRT3 complex, which maintains sperm motility in animal models (Chen2023TranscriptomeWide).

ACTRT3 is active in the cytoplasm, contributing to processes such as intracellular transport and cell division, which are vital for overall cellular function and organismal development. The gene's expression is associated with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, although no direct link to prostate cancer risk has been established (Chen2023TranscriptomeWide). In the context of cell migration, ACTRT3 expression is significantly increased in cells lacking MST2, a kinase involved in regulating cell junctions and mobility, suggesting a potential role in enhancing cell migration (Wang2019Hippo). Despite its involvement in these processes, the functional role of ACTRT3 remains poorly characterized and warrants further investigation (Chen2023TranscriptomeWide).
