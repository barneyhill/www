# SIPA1L3

## Overview
SIPA1L3 is a gene that encodes the protein signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 like 3, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific to the Rap family of small GTPases. This protein plays a critical role in cellular processes by facilitating the transition of Rap1 from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, thereby influencing cell growth, differentiation, and cytoskeletal organization (Yang2021Case; Evers2015SIPA1L3). SIPA1L3 is particularly significant in the human lens, where it contributes to lens development and maintenance, and its dysfunction is associated with congenital cataracts (Evers2015SIPA1L3). The protein contains several domains, including a RapGAP domain, a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which are integral to its function in cellular signaling pathways (Evers2015SIPA1L3). Additionally, alterations in SIPA1L3 expression have been implicated in cancer progression, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Zhang2019SIPA1L3).

## Structure
The SIPA1L3 protein is a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for the small GTPases of the Rap family. It consists of 1,781 amino acids and includes several key domains: the Rap GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP) domain, the PDZ domain, and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (Yang2021Case). The RapGAP domain, located between residues 611 and 828, is crucial for the interaction with Rap1, facilitating its transition from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, which is essential for cell growth and differentiation (Yang2021Case). The PDZ domain, spanning residues 966 to 1,042, is involved in protein-protein interactions, although its specific role in SIPA1L3 is not fully understood (Evers2015SIPA1L3). The coiled-coil domain, found at the C-terminal end between residues 1,720 and 1,774, is highly conserved, but its precise function remains unknown (Yang2021Case; Evers2015SIPA1L3).

Mutations in SIPA1L3, such as nonsense or missense variants, can lead to truncated proteins that may disrupt normal protein interactions and signaling pathways, potentially resulting in cataract formation (Yang2021Case; Evers2015SIPA1L3).

## Function
The SIPA1L3 gene encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that specifically interacts with small GTPases of the Rap family, particularly Rap1. This interaction is crucial for converting Rap1 from its active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and cytoskeletal organization (Yang2021Case; Evers2015SIPA1L3). SIPA1L3 contains several domains, including a RapGAP domain, a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling pathways (Evers2015SIPA1L3).

In the human lens, SIPA1L3 is involved in the development and maintenance of lens structure and function, playing a significant role in epithelial cell proliferation and fiber cell differentiation (Evers2015SIPA1L3). The protein's activity is essential for proper lens development, and disruptions in its function can lead to congenital cataracts (Evers2015SIPA1L3). SIPA1L3 is also implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell polarity, and cytoskeletal organization, impacting processes like cell migration and proliferation (Zhang2019SIPA1L3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SIPA1L3 gene have been associated with various eye-related disorders, particularly congenital cataracts. A study identified a homozygous nonsense variant in SIPA1L3 in a consanguineous family, which led to autosomal recessive congenital cataracts. This mutation results in a truncated protein lacking the last 284 amino acids, potentially disrupting normal lens development and causing cataract formation (Evers2015SIPA1L3). Another study in mice found a 16.7 kb deletion in the Sipa1l3 gene, leading to juvenile cataracts. This deletion caused a significant reduction in gene expression due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting a loss of function that contributes to cataract development (Walker2017A).

In humans, a novel missense variant in SIPA1L3 was identified in a Chinese family with a history of cataracts. This variant, c.1871A > G (p.Lys624Arg), is predicted to affect the interaction of SIPA1L3 with Rap GTPases, potentially disturbing Rap signaling during eye development and leading to cataracts (Yang2021Case).

Additionally, alterations in SIPA1L3 expression have been linked to cancer progression. In lung adenocarcinoma, the methylation status of the SIPA1L3 gene can modify the benefits of smoking cessation on patient survival, indicating a complex interaction between epigenetic modifications and environmental factors (Zhang2019SIPA1L3).

## Interactions
The SIPA1L3 gene encodes a protein that contains several domains, including a Rap GTPase-activating protein (Rap-GAP) domain and a PDZ domain, which are involved in protein interactions. The Rap-GAP domain of SIPA1L3 suggests that it acts as a GTPase-activating protein for small G-proteins of the Rap family, converting Rap from its active GTP-bound form to the inactive GDP-bound form. This interaction is significant as Rap GTPases are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization in the human lens (Evers2015SIPA1L3).

In silico network analyses indicate an interaction between SIPA1L3 and 14-3-3ζ (YWHAZ), a key protein in the human lens, suggesting a connection between Rap1 and 14-3-3ζ (Evers2015SIPA1L3). The PDZ domain is predicted to facilitate protein-protein interactions, although its specific role in SIPA1L3 is not fully understood. The PDZ domain of SIPA1L1, a homolog of SIPA1L3, interacts with the renal aquaporine 2 water channel, which is relevant because variants in aquaporine genes can cause cataract formation (Evers2015SIPA1L3). The C-terminal coiled-coil domain may interact with casein kinase I epsilon (CKIε), involved in Wnt signaling, although its function is not fully elucidated (Evers2015SIPA1L3).
