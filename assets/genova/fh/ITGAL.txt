# ITGAL

## Overview
The ITGAL gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha L, a critical component of the integrin family, specifically forming part of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) complex. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a pivotal role in immune cell interactions, particularly in leukocyte adhesion and migration. The integrin subunit alpha L is essential for the immune system's ability to respond to infections and tissue damage by facilitating interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells. It is expressed in various immune cell populations, including T lymphocytes and neutrophils, where it contributes to processes such as inflammation and immune surveillance. The ITGAL gene's expression and function are implicated in several clinical conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022ITGAL; Keum2013Natural; Lu2002Demethylation).

## Structure
The ITGAL gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha L, which is a component of the LFA-1 integrin complex. This protein is involved in cell adhesion and signaling, playing a crucial role in immune cell interactions. The primary structure of ITGAL consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including the I-domain, which is essential for ligand binding (Zhang2022ITGAL). 

The secondary structure of ITGAL includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is critical for its interaction with other molecules. In its quaternary structure, ITGAL associates with the beta-2 integrin subunit to form the LFA-1 complex, facilitating leukocyte adhesion and migration (Zhang2019A).

ITGAL undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, such as Itgal-002 and Itgal-003, which differ in their functional domains and expression patterns, potentially affecting the protein's role in immune responses and disease phenotypes (Keum2013Natural).

## Function
ITGAL, also known as integrin subunit alpha L, encodes a protein that is a component of the integrin family, specifically forming part of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) complex. This complex is crucial for leukocyte adhesion and migration, playing a significant role in immune responses by facilitating interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells (Zhang2022ITGAL). ITGAL is involved in cellular adhesion and signaling processes, contributing to the regulation of the immune microenvironment and immune surveillance (Zhang2022ITGAL).

In healthy human cells, ITGAL is expressed in various immune cell populations, including T lymphocytes and neutrophils, where it aids in processes such as inflammation and immune surveillance (Keum2013Natural). The protein is active at the cell surface, where it pairs with the beta-2 subunit to form the LFA-1 integrin, which is essential for leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation or injury (Keum2013Natural). This interaction is vital for the immune system's ability to respond to infections and tissue damage, highlighting ITGAL's role in maintaining immune homeostasis and facilitating effective immune responses (Keum2013Natural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGAL gene, which encodes the integrin alpha L chain, have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ITGAL expression is downregulated, correlating with poorer prognosis and increased malignancy. This downregulation is associated with reduced immune cell infiltration and shorter overall survival in patients, suggesting ITGAL as a potential biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapy (Wang2023lncRNA).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ITGAL is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis. High ITGAL levels are associated with lower overall survival and are correlated with immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in the immune microenvironment of AML (Li2022ITGAL).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypomethylation of the ITGAL promoter leads to overexpression of CD11a, contributing to T cell autoreactivity and disease activity. This epigenetic alteration is specific to T cells and correlates with disease severity, highlighting its role in SLE pathogenesis (Lu2002Demethylation).

ITGAL mutations also affect susceptibility to infections. A loss-of-function mutation in ITGAL increases susceptibility to Salmonella Typhimurium in certain mouse strains, impacting immune cell populations and T cell activation (Zhang2019A).

## Interactions
ITGAL, also known as integrin subunit alpha L, is a component of the integrin LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) complex. It interacts with ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) on endothelial cells, facilitating leukocyte adhesion and migration. ITGAL forms a heterodimer with the integrin beta-2 subunit (ITGB2), which is crucial for its function in immune cell interactions (Wu2020Integrated). 

In the context of T cell signaling, ITGAL interacts with Zap70, a protein tyrosine kinase, which is part of the signaling cascade following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. This interaction is consistent with ITGAL's role in immune cell activation and adhesion (Roncagalli2014Quantitative). 

ITGAL is also associated with various immune cell markers and plays a role in immune cell infiltration in different cancer types. In gastric cancer, ITGAL is linked with markers of T-cell exhaustion and tumor-associated macrophages, indicating its involvement in immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment (Zhang2022ITGAL). 

These interactions highlight ITGAL's role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer and immune cell signaling.
