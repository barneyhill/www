# CDCA7

## Overview
The CDCA7 gene encodes the cell division cycle associated 7 protein, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation, particularly within centromeric and pericentromeric regions. This protein is characterized by a unique zinc finger domain, zf-4CXXC_R1, which facilitates its binding to hemimethylated DNA, thereby influencing genomic stability and DNA repair processes (Wassing2023CDCA7; Funabiki2023Coevolution). CDCA7 interacts with various proteins, including the nucleosome remodeler HELLS, to form complexes essential for DNA methylation and repair, particularly through the classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway (Unoki2018CDCA7; Wassing2023CDCA7). Clinically, CDCA7 is implicated in several cancers, such as colorectal cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and disease progression (Li2020High; Liu2021High). Additionally, mutations in CDCA7 are associated with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, underscoring its significance in maintaining genomic integrity (Unoki2018CDCA7).

## Structure
The CDCA7 protein is characterized by the presence of a unique zinc finger domain, zf-4CXXC_R1, which is highly conserved across vertebrates. This domain is notable for its distinct cysteine arrangement, CXXCX10CX4CX7CXXCX19CXXCX3CXCXXC, and is involved in recognizing nucleosomes and specific epigenetic marks or DNA sequences (Funabiki2023Coevolution). The zf-4CXXC_R1 domain acts as a sensor for hemimethylated DNA, binding specifically to hemimethylated CpG sites in the major groove of linker DNA (Wassing2023CDCA7). 

CDCA7 interacts with the nucleosome remodeler HELLS through its N-terminal alpha helix, which is crucial for recruiting HELLS to hemimethylated DNA (Wassing2023CDCA7). This interaction forms a bipartite nucleosome remodeling complex, essential for DNA methylation processes (Jenness2018HELLS). 

The protein exists in multiple isoforms, with isoform 1 consisting of 450 amino acids and isoform 2 consisting of 371 amino acids (Funabiki2023Coevolution). CDCA7 also contains a conserved leucine zipper sequence, which facilitates interactions with c-Myc, although it lacks predicted enzymatic domains (Funabiki2023Coevolution). The presence of specific residues, such as R274 and R304, is associated with ICF syndrome when mutated (Wassing2023CDCA7).

## Function
The CDCA7 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, particularly in the context of centromeric and pericentromeric regions. CDCA7 contains a unique DNA-binding domain that recognizes CpG dyads within non-B DNA structures, which is essential for directing DNA methylation to these regions and maintaining genomic stability (Hardikar2023The). In healthy cells, CDCA7 is concentrated in constitutive heterochromatin foci during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it recruits the HELLS protein and DNA methylation machinery to facilitate the methylation of centromeric satellite DNA (Hardikar2023The).

CDCA7 is also involved in the classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway, a critical DNA repair mechanism. It interacts with proteins such as Ku80 and Ku70, which are essential for DNA repair, and HELLS, a chromatin remodeler, to maintain genomic stability (Unoki2018CDCA7). The protein's interaction with these components is crucial for efficient DNA double-strand break repair, particularly in regions with repetitive DNA sequences (Unoki2018CDCA7). CDCA7's role in these processes is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of centromeric regions and ensuring proper chromatin function during DNA replication (Hardikar2023The).

## Clinical Significance
CDCA7 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CDCA7 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and shorter survival times. Its overexpression is associated with clinical features such as invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis, suggesting its involvement in CRC progression (Li2020High).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CDCA7 is overexpressed and serves as an independent prognostic factor. High CDCA7 expression is linked to worse overall survival and higher disease grade and stage. It is also associated with immune infiltration and tumor-related immunosuppressive molecules, indicating a role in cancer immune evasion (Liu2021High).

CDCA7 is also involved in lymphoid tumors, particularly in the migration and invasion of lymphoma cells. Its overexpression is critical for lymphomagenesis, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth without affecting normal cell proliferation. This suggests that targeting CDCA7 could be a therapeutic strategy for controlling lymphoma growth and metastasis (MartínCortázar2019CDCA7; JiménezP2018CDCA7).

Mutations in CDCA7, along with HELLS, are linked to immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome types 3 and 4. These mutations compromise DNA repair pathways, leading to genomic instability and associated clinical features (Unoki2018CDCA7).

## Interactions
CDCA7 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. It forms a complex with the nucleosome remodeler HELLS, which is crucial for DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling activities. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal alpha helices of both proteins, facilitating the recruitment of HELLS to hemimethylated DNA (Wassing2023CDCA7). CDCA7 also coimmunoprecipitates with core histones and C-NHEJ proteins such as Ku70 and Ku80, indicating its involvement in DNA double-strand break repair through the nonhomologous end joining pathway (Unoki2018CDCA7).

The protein interacts with MYC, a transcription factor, through a region containing a bipartite nuclear localization signal and a phosphorylation site at Thr163. This phosphorylation by AKT regulates CDCA7's binding to 14-3-3 proteins, affecting its interaction with MYC and its cellular localization (Gill2013The). CDCA7's interaction with MYC is important for MYC-induced apoptosis and transformation, highlighting its role as a cofactor in MYC-mediated transcriptional regulation (Gill2013The).
