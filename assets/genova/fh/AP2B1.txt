# AP2B1

## Overview
AP2B1 is a gene that encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit beta 1, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2). This protein is integral to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a cellular process essential for the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins, thereby influencing various cellular functions such as nutrient uptake and receptor trafficking (Sanger2019Adaptor). The AP2B1-encoded protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, which interacts with other subunits of the AP-2 complex to form a heterotetrameric structure. This complex is pivotal in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) at the plasma membrane, facilitating the transport of cargo molecules within cells (Partlow2022Structural). AP2B1's role extends beyond endocytosis, as it is involved in modulating signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β signaling pathway, and has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and developmental abnormalities (Luzina2020Fulllength; Swift2023Differential).

## Structure
The AP2B1 gene encodes the beta subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The primary structure of AP2B1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the beta subunit of the AP-2 complex. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Sanger2019Adaptor).

The tertiary structure of AP2B1 is characterized by a beta-sandwich fold, which is a common structural motif that provides a stable framework for protein-protein interactions. This fold is essential for the interaction of AP2B1 with other subunits of the AP-2 complex, facilitating its role in endocytosis (Sanger2019Adaptor).

In terms of quaternary structure, AP2B1 interacts with other subunits of the AP-2 complex, including alpha, mu, and sigma subunits, forming a heterotetrameric complex. This interaction is crucial for the complex's ability to bind to cargo and the plasma membrane, enabling the endocytic process (Partlow2022Structural).

Common post-translational modifications of AP2B1 include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions. The gene may also have splice variant isoforms that could affect its function, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Sanger2019Adaptor).

## Function
AP2B1 encodes the beta subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process is essential for the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins, impacting cellular functions such as nutrient uptake and receptor trafficking (Sanger2019Adaptor). The AP-2 complex, including AP2B1, is located at the plasma membrane and is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). These vesicles facilitate the transport of cargo molecules within cells, ensuring their correct localization (Sanger2019Adaptor).

AP2B1, as part of the AP-2 complex, interacts with cargo proteins through specific motifs in their cytoplasmic tails, such as the tyrosine-based motif YxxΦ and the dileucine motif [D/E]xxxL[L/I]. This interaction is crucial for selecting and packaging cargo proteins into vesicles for transport (Sanger2019Adaptor). The AP-2 complex is recruited to the plasma membrane through interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which induces a conformational change that exposes binding sites for cargo and clathrin, facilitating vesicle assembly (Sanger2019Adaptor).

In healthy human cells, AP2B1 is involved in the regulation of Smad3 phosphorylation, a key step in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This regulation occurs independently of TGF-β but is dependent on the TGFBR receptor, highlighting AP2B1's role in modulating signaling pathways (Luzina2020Fulllength).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AP2B1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Although AP2B1 was not previously identified in genome-wide association studies for nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), recent research suggests that genetic variants in AP2B1 may contribute to the risk of developing NSCL/P. This is due to its role in endocytic trafficking, which is crucial for craniofacial development (Li2018Associations).

AP2B1 is also associated with Char Syndrome, a condition that can present with facial malformations, indicating that mutations in this gene can lead to developmental abnormalities (Li2018Associations).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in AP2B1 expression have been observed in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, AP2B1 is altered in the non-fluent variant of PPA and has been reported to be significantly increased in AD, suggesting its involvement in the early stages of lysosomal dysfunction in these conditions (Swift2023Differential).

Additionally, AP2B1 interacts with circular RNA circNF1-419, which enhances autophagy and may ameliorate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential role in neurodegenerative disease pathways (Diling2019Circular).

## Interactions
AP2B1, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and interacts with various proteins to facilitate cellular trafficking. AP2B1 is part of the AP-2 complex, which includes other subunits such as AP2A1, AP2M1, and AP2S1, and is crucial for the endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins (Tian2013Adaptor). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, AP2B1, along with other AP-2 subunits, interacts with LC3, a protein involved in autophagy, to mediate the degradation of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) (Tian2013Adaptor).

In Arabidopsis, AP2B1 has been identified as interacting with proteins involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, such as clathrin light chain subunit 2 (CLC2) and dynamin-related proteins (Wang2023Adaptor). It is also associated with accessory proteins like AUXILIN-LIKE1 and VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 721 (VAMP721), which are involved in membrane-related interactions (Wang2023Adaptor).

In prostate cancer research, AP2B1 has been found to co-localize with the prostate-specific protein anoctamin 7 (ANO7), suggesting a functional interaction in vesicle-related processes (Kaikkonen2020The). These interactions highlight AP2B1's role in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and vesicle trafficking.
