# MICU1

## Overview
MICU1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 protein, a critical regulator of calcium homeostasis within mitochondria. The protein is a key component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, functioning primarily as a calcium sensor and gatekeeper. It modulates the activity of the MCU channel by forming a heterodimer with MICU2, thereby preventing excessive calcium uptake at low cytosolic calcium levels and ensuring that only significant calcium signals trigger mitochondrial calcium entry (Alevriadou2021Molecular; Murphy2021Regulation). Structurally, MICU1 is characterized by EF-hand motifs essential for calcium binding, and its activity is influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation (Wu2021Structural; Wang2014Molecular). Mutations in the MICU1 gene are linked to various neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its vital role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Musa2018A; Kohlschmidt2021Molecular).

## Structure
MICU1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial calcium uptake. It is approximately 54 kDa in size and contains an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, a transmembrane helix, and a cytosolic C-terminus with two classic EF-hand motifs, which are essential for calcium binding and regulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) channel activity (Wang2014Molecular). The EF-hand domains undergo significant conformational changes upon calcium binding, which are critical for activating the ion pore (Wu2021Structural).

The molecular structure of MICU1 includes four regions: the N-domain, the N-lobe, the C-lobe, and the C-helix. The C-helix is central to the hexameric structure and is crucial for interaction with MCU (Wang2014Molecular). MICU1 forms a hexamer in the absence of calcium, which transforms into multiple oligomers upon calcium binding, indicating its dynamic quaternary structure (Wu2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation affect MICU1's interaction with MCU and its overall activity (Wu2021Structural). The poly-basic domain of MICU1 is important for its localization within the mitochondrial inner boundary membrane, interacting with negatively charged phospholipids like cardiolipin (Gottschalk2019MICU1).

## Function
MICU1 (mitochondrial calcium uptake 1) is a regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in controlling calcium uptake into mitochondria, primarily through its interaction with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. In healthy human cells, MICU1 functions as a calcium sensor, modulating the activity of the MCU channel to maintain calcium homeostasis within the mitochondria. It achieves this by forming a heterodimer with MICU2, which acts as a gatekeeper to prevent calcium entry at low cytosolic calcium levels, thus avoiding excessive mitochondrial calcium load (Alevriadou2021Molecular; Murphy2021Regulation).

MICU1 is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and binds to the MCU's DIME motif, regulating the channel's calcium entry threshold and cooperativity. This regulation is essential for cellular energy production and signaling, as it ensures that only significant calcium signals lead to mitochondrial calcium uptake (Logan2013Lossoffunction; Murphy2021Regulation). The protein's activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and methylation, which affect its stability and interaction with other proteins (Alevriadou2021Molecular).

In the absence of MICU1, cells experience increased resting mitochondrial calcium levels, leading to potential disruptions in processes like muscle contraction and synaptic transmission (Logan2013Lossoffunction). This highlights MICU1's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MICU1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental systems. MICU1 deficiency, resulting from loss-of-function mutations, leads to a mitochondrial disorder characterized by proximal myopathy, learning difficulties, and a progressive extrapyramidal movement disorder. Patients often present with elevated creatine kinase levels, muscle weakness, and developmental delays (Musa2018A; Kohlschmidt2021Molecular). 

The disorder is linked to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which causes altered mitochondrial morphology, reduced ATP levels, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced cell death (Kohlschmidt2021Molecular). In some cases, patients exhibit additional symptoms such as episodic ataxia, skin involvement, ptosis, and peripheral axonal neuropathy (Kohlschmidt2021Molecular). 

A specific founder mutation, c.553C>T (p.Q185*), has been identified in Middle Eastern populations, leading to a complete loss of MICU1 function and associated with developmental delay, learning disabilities, and muscle weakness (Musa2018A). The clinical spectrum of MICU1-related disorders is broad, with some patients experiencing novel phenotypes such as congenital brain malformations and seizures (Wilton2020Developmental). 

Overall, MICU1 mutations disrupt mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, contributing to the pathophysiology of these conditions (Kohlschmidt2021Molecular).

## Interactions
MICU1 interacts with several proteins to regulate mitochondrial calcium uptake. It forms a heterodimer with MICU2, which is crucial for its regulatory function. This interaction is stabilized by a disulfide bond and involves electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Patron2014MICU1; Wu2020The). The MICU1-MICU2 complex acts as a gatekeeper for the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), inhibiting calcium uptake at low cytosolic calcium concentrations and relieving inhibition when calcium levels rise (Kamer2017High‐affinity; Wu2020The).

MICU1 can independently associate with the MCU complex, even in the absence of MICU2, highlighting its role in inhibiting calcium uptake (Kamer2014MICU). The C-terminal domain of MICU1 is essential for its interaction with the MCU complex, and truncation of this domain impairs its function (Kamer2014MICU). MICU1 also interacts with EMRE, another component of the uniporter complex, through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, which is crucial for facilitating calcium uptake (Wu2020The).

The interaction between MICU1 and MICU2 is necessary for the stability of MICU2, as silencing MICU1 leads to a reduction in MICU2 levels, while MICU2 silencing does not affect MICU1 (Patron2014MICU1). This interdependence underscores the complex regulatory role of MICU1 in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis.
