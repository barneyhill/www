# TOX3

## Overview
TOX3 is a gene that encodes the TOX high mobility group box family member 3 protein, which is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its high mobility group (HMG)-box domain, which facilitates DNA binding and interaction with other proteins, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. TOX3 is notably active in neuronal cells, where it participates in calcium-dependent transcriptional pathways and plays a role in cell survival by modulating apoptotic pathways. Additionally, TOX3 is implicated in reproductive biology through its regulation of steroidogenesis-related genes in ovarian granulosa cells. Clinically, TOX3 is significant in breast cancer, where its expression levels and genetic variations, such as the SNP rs3803662, are associated with disease outcomes and risk. The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its interactions with other proteins underscore its importance in both normal cellular function and disease progression (Man2021TOX3; Gudmundsdottir2012The; Dittmer2011TOX3).

## Structure
TOX3 is a protein that belongs to the TOX high mobility group box family, characterized by the presence of a DNA-binding HMG-box domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to interact with DNA, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. The HMG-box domain is a well-conserved feature among proteins in this family, facilitating the bending and unwinding of DNA to regulate transcriptional activity.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can impact its function and interactions within the cell. These modifications are essential for the dynamic regulation of TOX3 activity in response to cellular signals.

TOX3 exists in several splice variant isoforms, which can lead to differences in its function and localization within the cell. These isoforms result from alternative splicing events that modify the protein's structure, potentially altering its interaction with DNA and other proteins. The presence of multiple isoforms allows TOX3 to participate in a variety of cellular processes, adapting its role according to specific cellular contexts. The structural diversity provided by these isoforms underscores the complexity of TOX3's function in gene regulation.

## Function
TOX3 is a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in neurons. It contains a high mobility group (HMG)-box domain, which allows it to interact with DNA and other proteins to regulate gene expression. In healthy cells, TOX3 is involved in calcium-dependent transcriptional pathways, primarily through its interaction with the cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) and CITED1, a transcriptional regulator. This interaction is crucial for the induction of anti-apoptotic transcripts and the repression of pro-apoptotic transcripts, thereby promoting cell survival and protecting against apoptosis induced by stressors such as endoplasmic reticulum stress or BAX overexpression (Dittmer2011TOX3).

TOX3 also plays a role in modifying chromatin structure to facilitate transcriptional regulation, particularly in response to calcium signaling. It is involved in the activation of the BCL-2 promoter, which is associated with cell survival (Dittmer2011TOX3). In addition to its role in neuronal cells, TOX3 has been shown to enhance estrogen production by regulating steroidogenesis-related genes in ovarian granulosa cells, indicating its involvement in reproductive biology (Man2021TOX3). Overall, TOX3's function in healthy cells is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival.

## Clinical Significance
The TOX3 gene is clinically significant in breast cancer, with its expression levels and genetic variations influencing disease outcomes. High TOX3 mRNA expression is associated with poor survival outcomes in breast cancer patients, particularly in estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors of the luminal B subtype, where it correlates with shorter distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival (Gudmundsdottir2012The; Seksenyan2015TOX3). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3803662 in TOX3 is linked to increased breast cancer risk and is associated with lower TOX3 expression in ER-positive tumors (Tajbakhsh2018Significant; Gudmundsdottir2012The). This SNP is also connected to shorter survival in luminal A tumors and is more frequent in lobular tumors (Gudmundsdottir2012The).

TOX3 expression is implicated in breast cancer progression, with high levels correlating with positive lymph node status and poor prognosis in luminal B breast cancers (Seksenyan2015TOX3). The gene's expression influences ER target genes and genes involved in cell cycle and metastasis, potentially explaining the poor prognosis in TOX3-high luminal B breast cancers (Seksenyan2015TOX3). Additionally, TOX3 is involved in regulating BRCA1 expression, and its abnormal expression is linked to increased migration, survival, and proliferation of breast cancer cells (Akhtar2019An).

## Interactions
TOX3, a transcription factor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with the transcriptional activator CITED1, forming a specific protein complex that is crucial for cytoprotective signaling pathways. This interaction is mediated through the HMG domain of TOX3 and the CR2 domain of CITED1, with the presence of the TOX3 N-terminus enhancing the interaction (Dittmer2011TOX3).

TOX3 also interacts with the cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB), particularly its phosphorylated form, to form a complex that is important for transcriptional activity. This interaction is necessary for TOX3's effect on the BCL-2 promoter, a CREB-responsive element, although CITED1 can inhibit this transcriptional activity (Dittmer2011TOX3).

In colorectal cancer, TOX3 is part of a signaling axis with WDR5 and ABCG2, where it recruits WDR5 to the ABCG2 promoter, facilitating histone H3K4 tri-methylation and enhancing ABCG2 transcription. This interaction is significant for maintaining cancer stem-like traits and drug resistance (Hao2023A). These interactions highlight TOX3's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on cancer progression.
