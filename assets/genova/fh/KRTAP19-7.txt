# KRTAP19-7

## Overview
KRTAP19-7 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 19-7, which is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. This protein is primarily involved in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of human hair by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. The KRTAP19-7 protein is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, which facilitates the formation of dimeric and trimeric repeat structures essential for cross-linking keratin filaments. Although its expression is generally weak and heterogeneous within the hair follicle, particularly in the cuticle and cortex regions, KRTAP19-7 plays a crucial role in hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human). Beyond its structural role, KRTAP19-7 has been implicated in psychiatric research as an interactor with the schizophrenia risk candidate protein ZNF804A, suggesting a potential involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Klockmeier2021Schizophrenia). Additionally, alterations in its methylation status have been associated with favorable prognosis in sarcoma, indicating its potential clinical significance in cancer (Smith2021Genomewide).

## Structure
The KRTAP19-7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family, located on chromosome 21q22.1. These proteins are characterized by a high content of glycine (26.9-38.9 mol %) and tyrosine (15.4-23.6 mol %), along with moderate amounts of serine and phenylalanine residues (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP19-7 includes a significant number of dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures, which are crucial for its function in hair and other keratinized tissues (Rogers2006Human).

The secondary structure of KRTAP19-7 likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of keratin-associated proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature in keratin-associated proteins due to their high cysteine content. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with keratin filaments, contributing to the protein's role in the structural integrity of hair (Rogers2006Human).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications for KRTAP19-7 are not detailed in the provided context. The expression of KRTAP19-7 is noted to be weak within the hair follicle, particularly in the cuticle and cortex regions (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP19-7 encodes a keratin-associated protein that plays a role in the structure and function of human hair. These proteins are involved in the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. KRTAP19-7 is part of the KAP19 family, which is characterized by a high glycine and tyrosine content, contributing to the protein's ability to form dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures. These structural features are crucial for the cross-linking of keratin filaments, which influences hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human).

The expression of KRTAP19-7, along with other KAP genes, is generally low and heterogeneous, with some members of the KAP19 family showing weak expression in the hair follicle's cortex/matrix cell region. This expression pattern suggests a role in hair structure and morphology, although the specific function of KRTAP19-7 in healthy human cells remains unclear (Rogers2006Human). Despite its involvement in hair structure, the precise molecular processes and organismal outcomes associated with KRTAP19-7 are not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
KRTAP19-7 has been identified as a gene with potential clinical significance in various conditions. In the context of cancer, methylation of KRTAP19-7 has been associated with favorable prognosis in sarcoma patients, suggesting that alterations in its expression or methylation may correlate with better outcomes in this type of cancer (Smith2021Genomewide).

In schizophrenia research, KRTAP19-7 has been identified as one of the interactors with the ZNF804A protein, a candidate risk protein for schizophrenia. This interaction suggests a potential role for KRTAP19-7 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, as over 60% of ZNF804A's protein-protein interaction partners, including KRTAP19-7, are associated with the condition (Klockmeier2021Schizophrenia).

Additionally, KRTAP19-7 has been noted in studies of structural variations in chimpanzees, where it is associated with a deletion event. While this does not directly relate to human disease, it highlights the gene's involvement in genomic structural variations (Soto2020Identification).

Overall, while direct links between KRTAP19-7 mutations and specific human diseases are not extensively documented, its involvement in cancer prognosis and schizophrenia suggests it may play a role in these conditions.

## Interactions
KRTAP19-7, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is involved in interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers. These interactions typically involve the formation of disulfide bonds with keratins, which influence hair texture and strength (Rogers2006Human).

In the context of schizophrenia research, KRTAP19-7 has been identified as an interactor of the schizophrenia risk candidate protein ZNF804A. This interaction was validated using DULIP and BRET assays, which are methods for detecting protein-protein interactions in cells. Although KRTAP19-7 was not highlighted as one of the highest affinity interactors, it was among the proteins associated with schizophrenia identified through a near genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen (Klockmeier2021Schizophrenia).

The study suggests that over 60% of ZNF804A's protein-protein interaction partners, including KRTAP19-7, are linked to schizophrenia, indicating a potential role in psychiatric disorders. However, specific details on the nature or implications of the KRTAP19-7 interaction with ZNF804A are not provided (Klockmeier2021Schizophrenia).
