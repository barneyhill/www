# ANKS3

## Overview
ANKS3 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 3, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in renal development and ciliary function. The ANKS3 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways (Delestré2015ANKS3; Yakulov2015Anks3). It is part of a complex network involving nephronophthisis proteins and interacts with other proteins such as ANKS6 and Bicaudal-C homologue 1 (Bicc1), playing a significant role in ciliary motility and polarity (Rothé2023Bicc1; Schlimpert2018Metabolic). Mutations in the ANKS3 gene have been linked to nephronophthisis, a renal ciliopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in kidney function and disease (Mahuzier2024The).

## Structure
The ANKS3 protein is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, and a short coiled-coil domain (Ramachandran2015Anks3; Yakulov2015Anks3). The ankyrin repeats are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, while the SAM domain is involved in transcriptional repression, self-assembling scaffolds, and regulation of enzymatic activities (Yakulov2015Anks3). The SAM domain of ANKS3 forms polymers and has a characteristic five α-helical fold, associating via interactions between the mid-loop (ML) and end-helix (EH) surfaces (Leettola2014Characterization). 

ANKS3 interacts with other proteins such as ANKS6 and Bicc1, with the SAM domain playing a crucial role in these interactions (Delestré2015ANKS3; Rothé2023Bicc1). The coiled-coil domain of ANKS3 is significant for binding to Bicc1, and this interaction is modulated by ANKS6 (Rothé2023Bicc1). ANKS3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including increased serine and threonine phosphorylation, primarily within the N-terminal ankyrin repeats (Ramachandran2015Anks3). The protein can give rise to at least five protein-coding isoforms through alternative splicing, all sharing exons 9 and 10 (Rothé2023Bicc1).

## Function
The ANKS3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in renal development and ciliary function. ANKS3 is part of a protein complex that includes nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins such as NPHP2, NPHP3, and NEK8/NPHP9, and it interacts with HIF1AN, an oxygen-sensitive hydroxylase (Yakulov2015Anks3). The protein contains ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Delestré2015ANKS3).

ANKS3 is associated with the primary cilium, a key organelle for cellular signaling and sensing, and is implicated in ciliary motility and polarity (Schlimpert2018Metabolic). It interacts with other proteins such as ANKS6 and Bicaudal-C homologue 1 (Bicc1), which are involved in cellular signaling pathways like Wnt signaling (Schlimpert2018Metabolic). ANKS3's interaction with NPHP1 suggests a role in regulating ciliary function, and its depletion in zebrafish embryos results in nephronophthisis-like manifestations, such as ciliary abnormalities and cyst formation (Yakulov2015Anks3).

ANKS3 also influences metabolic processes, as its depletion affects amino acid and purine/pyrimidine metabolism, indicating a role in balancing the intracellular nucleoside pool and possibly in DNA repair processes (Schlimpert2018Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKS3 gene are associated with nephronophthisis (NPH), a renal ciliopathy characterized by kidney failure and hepatic fibrosis. A specific homozygous missense variant, c.806C>T, resulting in a p.P269L substitution, has been identified in patients with syndromic NPH. This variant affects an evolutionarily conserved amino acid and is predicted to be deleterious. Its pathogenicity has been validated in zebrafish and rat models, where it leads to defects in heart looping and kidney function, respectively, mirroring the clinical symptoms observed in humans (Mahuzier2024The).

ANKS3 mutations disrupt its interaction with BICC1, an RNA-binding protein, leading to the destabilization of NPHP1 transcripts. This disruption affects ciliary biogenesis and function, contributing to the pathophysiology of NPH-related ciliopathies. The ANKS3/BICC1 complex is crucial for maintaining the stability of NPHP1 mRNA, and mutations like P269L impair this regulatory mechanism, resulting in altered ciliary phenotypes (Mahuzier2024The).

ANKS3 also interacts with ANKS6, and mutations affecting this interaction, such as the R823W mutation in ANKS6, are linked to cystic kidney diseases like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Delestré2015ANKS3; Leettola2014Characterization).

## Interactions
ANKS3 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains. It interacts with ANKS6, forming heteromeric complexes that are crucial for its function. This interaction occurs via their SAM domains, with specific residues being essential for binding (Leettola2014Characterization). ANKS3 also interacts with the NIMA-related kinase Nek7, which modifies ANKS3, increasing its molecular weight, although this modification is not due to phosphorylation by Nek7 (Ramachandran2015Anks3).

ANKS3 is part of a complex network involving nephronophthisis proteins (NPHPs), such as NPHP1, NPHP4, and NPHP8, and is associated with ciliary functions (Yakulov2015Anks3). It interacts with Bicc1, an RNA-binding protein, through multiple domains, including the C-terminal coiled coil domain, which competes with RNA for binding to Bicc1's KH domains (Rothé2023Bicc1). ANKS3's interaction with Bicc1 is modulated by ANKS6, which can decrease the binding affinity between ANKS3 and Bicc1 (Rothé2023Bicc1).

ANKS3 is also a substrate for the HIF1AN hydroxylase, which hydroxylates conserved asparagine residues within its ankyrin-repeat domains, influencing its interactions and stability (Yakulov2015Anks3). These interactions highlight ANKS3's role in signaling pathways and structural assemblies within cells.
