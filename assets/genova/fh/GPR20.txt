# GPR20

## Overview
GPR20 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 20, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its ability to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins. Unlike many GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptor 20 exhibits constitutive activity, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways in the absence of a ligand. This receptor primarily couples with Gαi proteins, leading to the inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, and is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and cell migration (Jia2024Upregulation; Ahmad2014Hunting). GPR20 has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, such as early-onset preeclampsia and cardiovascular health, due to its regulatory roles in mitochondrial morphology and signaling pathways (Jia2024Upregulation; DeBoever2019Medical). The receptor's unique constitutive activity and involvement in critical signaling pathways make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases.

## Function
GPR20 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known for its constitutive activity, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways without the presence of a ligand. This receptor is primarily coupled to Gαi proteins, which are involved in inhibiting the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within cells (Ahmad2014Hunting). The constitutive activity of GPR20 allows it to modulate various cellular responses, including those related to mitochondrial function and cell migration.

In the context of early-onset preeclampsia, GPR20 has been shown to play a significant role in regulating mitochondrial morphology and function in trophoblast cells. It is involved in the c-AMP/PKA/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial fitness and function (Jia2024Upregulation). GPR20 expression is upregulated in placental extravillous trophoblasts in preeclampsia, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition (Jia2024Upregulation).

GPR20's activity is also linked to the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it is regulated by Siglec-6. This interaction affects mitochondrial function by altering the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, leading to changes in reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial membrane potential (Jia2024Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
GPR20, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in several medical conditions due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In early-onset preeclampsia (EO-PE), GPR20 is upregulated in extravillous trophoblasts, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction is linked to the inhibition of the c-AMP/PKA/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for mitochondrial health. The overexpression of Siglec-6, which promotes GPR20 expression, leads to a preeclampsia-like phenotype in mouse models, suggesting a significant role for GPR20 in the pathogenesis of EO-PE (Jia2024Upregulation).

GPR20 has also been associated with blood pressure regulation. A missense variant in GPR20, rs34591516 (p.Gly313Ser), has been linked to diastolic blood pressure, indicating a potential role in cardiovascular health (DeBoever2019Medical).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, GPR20 is part of an oligogenic model associated with the age of onset in individuals with the PSEN1 E280A mutation. Although its specific role in Alzheimer's pathology is not detailed, it is noted to be expressed in the brains of affected individuals (Vélez2015APOE*E2).

These findings highlight GPR20's potential as a therapeutic target in various conditions, including preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
GPR20 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that exhibits constitutive activity, meaning it can signal in the absence of a ligand. This activity has been primarily observed through in vitro studies that measure downstream signaling pathways, which can be modulated by inverse agonists (Davenport2013International). The receptor's constitutive activity suggests potential interactions with intracellular signaling proteins, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.

In the context of trophoblast cells, GPR20 expression is upregulated by Siglec-6 through the SHP1/SHP2-NF-κB signaling pathway. Siglec-6 interacts with SHP1 and SHP2 proteins, which are known to prevent downstream NF-κB activation. This interaction leads to a reduction in NF-κB phosphorylation, thereby decreasing its inhibitory effect on GPR20 transcription and resulting in increased GPR20 expression (Jia2024Upregulation). This suggests that GPR20 may be involved in complex signaling networks, although direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated. The study highlights the regulatory role of Siglec-6 in modulating GPR20 expression, indicating a potential indirect interaction through shared signaling pathways.
