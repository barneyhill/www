# SLC26A6

## Overview
SLC26A6 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 6, a transmembrane anion exchanger involved in the transport of various anions, including chloride, bicarbonate, and oxalate, across cell membranes. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining acid-base balance and fluid homeostasis in several tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and kidneys. Structurally, SLC26A6 features a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic STAS domain, facilitating its function as a coupled anion exchanger. The protein's interaction with other proteins, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is essential for its regulatory functions in chloride-bicarbonate exchange. Mutations in the SLC26A6 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including enteric hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Cornière2022Dominant; Seidler2019Slc26; Cao2021Systemic).

## Structure
The SLC26A6 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 26 and functions as a coupled anion exchanger, primarily exchanging chloride (Cl-) with bicarbonate (HCO3-) and possibly oxalate. Its molecular structure includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic STAS domain. The transmembrane domain is organized into two topologically related repeats of seven segments, forming a gate domain and a core domain. The core domain is mobile and shuttles between conformations to expose binding sites to either the cytoplasm or the extracellular environment, facilitating the transport cycle (Tippett2023Structural).

The anion binding site of SLC26A6 is located between short helices α3 and α10, with a conserved arginine (Arg 404) playing a crucial role in stabilizing the bound anion. This site is characterized by a shallower pocket compared to its paralog SLC26A9, allowing it to accommodate HCO3- and oxalate (Tippett2023Structural). The protein functions as a dimer, with interactions mainly through the cytoplasmic parts, suggesting that the transmembrane units function independently (Tippett2023Structural).

Mutations in SLC26A6, such as p.R507W, can affect its stability and function, leading to conditions like enteric hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis (Cornière2022Dominant).

## Function
SLC26A6 is an anion transporter involved in the exchange of multiple anions, including chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), oxalate, formate, sulfate, and nitrate, across cell membranes. It plays a crucial role in maintaining acid-base balance and fluid homeostasis in various tissues, such as the proximal small intestine, pancreatic ducts, and kidneys (Seidler2019Slc26). In the gastrointestinal tract, SLC26A6 is expressed at the apical membrane of enterocytes, where it facilitates the exchange of intracellular oxalate for external chloride, contributing to apical oxalate secretion (Cornière2022Dominant).

The protein is heavily N-glycosylated, which is essential for its proper folding, quality control, and function as a Cl-oxalate exchanger. Glycosylation affects the transporter's trafficking to the plasma membrane and its intrinsic transport activity, with specific glycosylation sites being critical for its function (Thomson2016Nglycosylation). In the pancreas, SLC26A6 may function as a Cl- retrieval mechanism, potentially coupling with CFTR activation, and is crucial for basal duodenal HCO3- secretion in the small intestine (Seidler2019Slc26). The transporter also plays a role in intestinal electrolyte and fluid absorption, impacting processes like fructose-induced fluid absorption and blood pressure regulation (Seidler2019Slc26).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC26A6 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SLC26A6 is identified as an oncogene, with its expression significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. High expression levels of SLC26A6 correlate with poor survival outcomes in HCC patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cao2021Systemic).

SLC26A6 mutations are also associated with enteric hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis. The p.R507W mutation, for instance, leads to defective membrane expression and oxalate transport activity, contributing to increased oxalate absorption and kidney stone formation. This mutation exhibits a dominant negative effect, reducing the function of the wild-type transporter and exacerbating the clinical phenotype (Cornière2022Dominant).

Other polymorphisms, such as D674N and R621G, affect SLC26A6 expression and function, impacting urinary oxalate and citrate levels, which are critical in kidney stone formation. The D674N mutation significantly impairs SLC26A6 function, while R621G retains some transport activity despite reduced expression (Shimshilashvili2020Novel). These findings highlight the gene's role in conditions related to oxalate metabolism and kidney stone disease.

## Interactions
SLC26A6 is known to interact with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), forming a multiprotein complex that is crucial for its function. This interaction is facilitated by PDZ interaction motifs present in both proteins, allowing them to form complexes with other regulatory proteins such as NHERF and E3KARP (Pariano2024Unity). The interaction between SLC26A6 and CFTR is significant in tissues like the pancreas and intestine, where they work together to mediate chloride-bicarbonate exchange, contributing to bicarbonate secretion and chloride absorption (Pariano2024Unity).

The STAS domain of SLC26A6 plays a critical role in its interaction with CFTR. This domain binds to the regulatory domain of CFTR, a process enhanced by phosphorylation, which is essential for the functional activation of CFTR (Pariano2024Unity). Disruptions in this interaction, such as those caused by the F508del mutation in CFTR, can lead to enhanced degradation of SLC26A6, suggesting that maintaining this interaction is important for the stability and function of both proteins (Pariano2024Unity).

SLC26A6 also interacts with the citrate transporter NaDC-1, where it inhibits NaDC-1, and NaDC-1 slightly activates SLC26A6. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance of citrate and oxalate in the urine, impacting kidney stone formation (Shimshilashvili2020Novel).
