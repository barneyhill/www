# TANC2

## Overview
TANC2 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat, and coiled-coil containing 2, which is a large multi-domain adaptor/scaffolding protein primarily involved in neuronal signaling and synaptic function. The TANC2 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a unique N-terminal P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. It plays a critical role in regulating mTOR signaling pathways, particularly mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are essential for cellular growth and neuronal development (Gasparini2017Dynamic; Kim2021Tanc2mediated). TANC2 is highly expressed in the brain and interacts with key synaptic proteins such as PSD-95, influencing synaptic organization and plasticity (Han2010Regulation). Mutations in TANC2 have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, underscoring its significance in brain function and development (Guo2019Disruptive; Kim2021Tanc2mediated).

## Structure
The TANC2 protein is a large scaffold protein consisting of 1,990 amino acid residues. It is part of the TANC protein family, which includes TANC1, sharing 51.9% amino acid identity with it. TANC2 features a multi-domain architecture that includes ankyrin (ANK) and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The ANK domain in TANC2 contains eleven repeats, with a unique negatively charged loop between the fifth and sixth repeat, potentially contributing to TANC2-specific functions (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The TPR domain consists of three repeats, forming a helix-turn-helix structure, and is highly conserved (Gasparini2017Dynamic).

TANC2 also contains a unique N-terminal P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) domain, which includes a conserved NTPase α/β fold and a regulative region known as the helical third domain of STAND (HETHS) (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The C-terminal region of TANC2 includes a PDZ-binding motif, a poly-glutamine region, a proline stretch, and a serine-rich region (SRR), with predicted MAPK and WW binding sites (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as GSK3, MAPK, and NEK2 (Gasparini2017Dynamic). These structural features and modifications suggest TANC2's role in neuronal signaling and synaptic function.

## Function
The TANC2 gene encodes a large multi-domain adaptor/scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in neuronal signaling and development. It is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating mTOR signaling pathways, specifically mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are essential for cellular growth, proliferation, and survival (Kim2021Tanc2mediated). TANC2 inhibits mTOR activity, maintaining a balance between mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, which is crucial for normal neuronal function and development (Kim2021Tanc2mediated).

TANC2 interacts with PSD-95, an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein, and is involved in synaptic organization and plasticity, influencing synaptic strength and plasticity (Han2010Regulation; Gasparini2017Dynamic). It contains tetratricopeptide and ankyrin repeats, facilitating protein-protein interactions, and is active in the postsynaptic density of neurons (Gasparini2017Dynamic). TANC2's role in synaptic localization and interaction with PSD-95 is critical for dendritic spine regulation, impacting learning and memory processes in the brain (Han2010Regulation). TANC2 mutations are linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Kim2021Tanc2mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TANC2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Disruptive mutations in TANC2 have been linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), speech-language delay, and childhood motor delay. Some patients also exhibit features reminiscent of the Rett-like spectrum, along with additional symptoms such as ataxia, strabismus, scoliosis, and facial dysmorphic features (Guo2019Disruptive). TANC2 mutations can also lead to significant psychiatric issues, including mood changes, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, hallucinations, and major depression (Guo2019Disruptive).

A specific case report identified a truncating mutation in TANC2 associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a severe epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting the gene's role in epilepsy and cognitive regression (Tian2021Truncating). Additionally, a de novo microdeletion at 17q23.3 affecting TANC2 has been associated with severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, scoliosis, and absent speech and gait (Tassano202017q23.3). TANC2 mutations are also implicated in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, with the gene's disruption affecting synaptic and neuronal signaling pathways (Gasparini2017Dynamic).

## Interactions
TANC2 is a synaptic scaffolding protein that interacts with multiple postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, playing a crucial role in synaptic signaling and plasticity. It forms complexes with the PSD-95 family of proteins, including PSD-95 itself, PSD-93, and SAP102, through its PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus. This interaction is essential for the synaptic localization of TANC2 in dendritic spines (Han2010Regulation). TANC2 also interacts with mTOR, inhibiting its activity by forming a complex that suppresses mTORC1/2-dependent phosphorylation of substrates such as S6K and Akt. This interaction is regulated by external factors like serum and ketamine, which can weaken the TANC2-mTOR association (Kim2021Tanc2mediated).

TANC2's interaction with mTOR is significant in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, as mutations in TANC2 are linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. These mutations disrupt TANC2's role in regulating dendritic spines and excitatory synapse formation, highlighting its importance in neuronal development (Guo2019Disruptive). TANC2 also interacts with other ASD and neuropsychiatric disorder risk genes, including SHANK1, SYNGAP1, CASK, and GRIN2B, suggesting its involvement in PSD-related pathogenesis (Guo2019Disruptive).
