# EFCAB9

## Overview
EFCAB9 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium-binding domain 9 protein, which is a crucial component in the regulation of sperm motility and male fertility. The protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions, playing a significant role in calcium sensing and regulation. EFCAB9 interacts with the CatSper channel, a vital calcium channel in sperm, through a calcium-sensitive mechanism, thereby influencing sperm motility by modulating calcium entry in response to changes in intracellular pH and calcium levels (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual). The protein is specifically expressed in the testis and localizes to the principal piece of the sperm tail, where it is essential for organizing the CatSper calcium signaling domains (Hwang2018EFCAB9). Mutations or deletions in the EFCAB9 gene can lead to impaired sperm motility and male infertility, underscoring its critical role in reproductive biology (Yahaya2020Genes).

## Structure
EFCAB9 is a protein characterized by the presence of three conserved EF-hand calcium-binding domains, which are helix-loop-helix motifs crucial for calcium ion coordination (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual). These EF-hand domains are structurally similar to those found in other calcium-binding proteins like calmodulin, indicating their role in calcium sensing and regulation (Hwang2018EFCAB9). The EF-hand motifs in EFCAB9 undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, which affects its interaction with the CatSper channel (Hwang2018EFCAB9).

In mammals, EFCAB9 has undergone specific amino acid substitutions in its EF-hand domains, which may influence its calcium and pH sensitivity. For example, in the EF-loop position 12, glutamate is replaced by asparagine, glutamine, or lysine, depending on the species (Hwang2019Dual). These substitutions could contribute to the differential pH sensitivities observed between species (Hwang2019Dual).

EFCAB9 forms a binary complex with CatSperζ, a component of the CatSper channel complex, through a calcium-sensitive interaction mediated by its EF-hand domains (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual). This interaction is essential for the structural organization and function of the CatSper channel, which is crucial for sperm motility (Hwang2019Dual).

## Function
EFCAB9 is a pH-dependent calcium (Ca2+) sensor that plays a crucial role in regulating the CatSper channel activity, which is essential for sperm motility and male fertility. The protein forms a complex with CatSperζ, a component of the CatSper channel, and this interaction is vital for the pH-dependent activation of the channel. EFCAB9 is not required for the formation of the CatSper channel itself but is involved in regulating its activity by modulating calcium entry in response to changes in intracellular pH and Ca2+ levels (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual).

EFCAB9 contains EF-hand motifs, which are common calcium-binding regions, although it has a noncanonical EF-hand that affects its Ca2+ binding affinity. This protein is expressed specifically in the testis and localizes to the principal piece of the sperm tail, where it is crucial for organizing the CatSper Ca2+ signaling domains (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual). The absence of EFCAB9 leads to compromised Ca2+ sensitivity and male subfertility, highlighting its importance in sperm function (Hwang2018EFCAB9). EFCAB9 is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its significant role in the regulation of sperm motility and fertility (Hwang2019Dual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deletions in the EFCAB9 gene can lead to significant disruptions in sperm motility, which is a critical factor in male fertility. The EFCAB9 gene encodes a sperm-specific EF-band domain protein essential for the activation of the CATSPER channel, a key regulator of sperm motility. Disruptions in this gene can impair CATSPER channel signaling, leading to conditions related to male infertility, as proper sperm motility is crucial for successful fertilization (Yahaya2020Genes).

Studies using Efcab9-null mice have demonstrated that the absence of EFCAB9 results in severely impaired fertility in males, despite normal sperm morphology and count. These mice exhibit reduced fertilization rates in vitro and abnormal flagellar movement, indicating a dysfunction in the CatSper-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. The structural continuity of CatSper channels is disrupted without EFCAB9, and the expression of CatSper subunits is reduced, leading to subfertility in males (Hwang2018EFCAB9).

EFCAB9 also forms a complex with CatSperζ, which is crucial for organizing the CatSper Ca2+ signaling domains. Mutations or absence of EFCAB9 lead to a failure in responding to intracellular pH changes, resulting in severe male subfertility (Hwang2018EFCAB9).

## Interactions
EFCAB9 is a pH-dependent Ca2+ sensor that interacts directly with the CatSperζ protein to form a binary complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the CatSper channel, which is essential for sperm motility. The interaction between EFCAB9 and CatSperζ is mediated by the EF-hand domains of EFCAB9, which are sensitive to calcium levels. The presence of Ca2+ stabilizes the EFCAB9-CatSperζ complex, while chelation of Ca2+ leads to dissociation, indicating that Ca2+ is necessary for a stable interaction (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual).

EFCAB9 and CatSperζ are interdependent for their expression, although neither is required for the expression of the CatSper channel itself. Instead, they modulate the protein expression levels and organization of CatSper Ca2+ signaling domains (Hwang2018EFCAB9; Hwang2019Dual). The EFCAB9-CatSperζ complex is necessary for maintaining the structural organization of the CatSper domains, which are important for the hyperactivated motility of sperm (Hwang2019Dual).

EFCAB9 also interacts with the CatSper channel pore, composed of CatSper1, 2, 3, and 4 subunits, but shows little to no interaction with the auxiliary transmembrane subunits (Hwang2019Dual). The interaction between EFCAB9 and CatSperζ is sensitive to pH changes, affecting the gating of Ca2+ through the channel (Hwang2018EFCAB9).
