# OR51G2

## Overview
OR51G2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily G member 2, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in olfactory signal transduction, playing a critical role in the detection and perception of odor molecules. Structurally, OR51G2 is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs and essential for ligand binding and signal initiation. While predominantly active in the olfactory epithelium, OR51G2 has also been identified in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction, such as involvement in reproductive processes (Berwal2024Improving; Corda2022GProtein). Despite its established function in smell, the broader physiological roles and clinical significance of OR51G2 remain areas of ongoing research (Reed2019Differential).

## Structure
The olfactory receptor OR51G2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in olfactory signal transduction. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure of OR51G2 typically includes alpha helices, which are characteristic of GPCRs. These helices are organized into a transmembrane domain, which is a common feature of olfactory receptors (Berwal2024Improving).

The tertiary structure of OR51G2 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming the transmembrane domains TM3, TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM7, which are crucial for ligand binding. The orthosteric sites, where ligand binding occurs, are located within these transmembrane domains, while TM2 is not involved in binding interactions (Berwal2024Improving). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, affecting the receptor's function, although specific modifications for OR51G2 are not detailed in the provided context. The study of OR51G2's structure through hybrid modeling approaches has shown that these models can predict receptor conformations closer to functional states observed in experimental conditions (Berwal2024Improving). 

No quaternary structure is typically associated with GPCRs like OR51G2, as they generally function as monomers.

## Function
OR51G2 is an olfactory receptor that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific ligands, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Berwal2024Improving). The binding pockets of OR51G2 are located within the orthosteric sites, particularly in the transmembrane domains TM3, TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM7, which are essential for ligand interaction and protein function (Berwal2024Improving).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR51G2 has been identified in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond smell. For instance, it is categorized as a peptide receptor in human sperm, indicating a possible involvement in reproductive processes (Corda2022GProtein). However, the specific functions of OR51G2 in healthy human cells outside the olfactory system are not well-documented in the available literature. The receptor's activity in different tissues may contribute to various physiological processes, but further research is needed to elucidate these roles (Reed2019Differential).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR51G2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, is not well-established in terms of specific diseases. However, mutations and altered expression of olfactory receptors, including OR51G2, have been implicated in various conditions. In a study focusing on a parkinsonism/spinocerebellar-ataxia complex, a mutation in the OR51G2 gene (c.907C>G; p.Gln303Glu) was identified, although its clinical significance remains unclear. The mutation was predicted to be damaging by MutationTaster, but the study primarily focused on the CARS gene mutation as the cause of the disease phenotype (Liu2024A).

In another study, OR51G2-like genes were found to be upregulated in turkeys exposed to aflatoxin B1, suggesting a potential role in response to environmental toxins. This indicates that OR51G2 may have broader functional roles beyond olfactory tissues, possibly affecting other physiological processes (Reed2019Differential).

Despite these findings, the specific clinical implications of OR51G2 mutations or expression changes in humans remain largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate their potential impact on health and disease.
