# CRBN

## Overview
The CRBN gene encodes the protein cereblon, which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, functioning as a substrate receptor within the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Cereblon is characterized by its thalidomide-binding domain, which is essential for its interaction with thalidomide and its derivatives, influencing the degradation of specific target proteins. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ion channels and energy metabolism, and is expressed in multiple tissues, highlighting its importance in human physiology. Mutations and alterations in the CRBN gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as intellectual disabilities and drug resistance in multiple myeloma, underscoring its relevance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Hartmann2015Structural; Kim2016Cereblon; Borsi2023High).

## Structure
Cereblon (CRBN) is a protein that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system as part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The CRBN protein contains a thalidomide-binding domain (TBD), also known as the CULT domain, which is crucial for its interaction with thalidomide and its derivatives. This domain is characterized by a β-tent fold structure, consisting of two antiparallel beta sheets oriented at a right angle, stabilized by a structural zinc ion. The binding site for thalidomide is formed by an aromatic cage composed of three invariant tryptophan residues (Akuffo2018Ligandmediated; Hartmann2015Structural).

CRBN undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms. Notably, some isoforms lack the thalidomide-binding domain, which is encoded by exon 10. These isoforms are associated with resistance to immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) in multiple myeloma patients (Borsi2023High).

The N-terminal region of CRBN, comprising amino acids 1-80, is intrinsically disordered and plays a crucial role in the degradation process mediated by proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) (Kim2019Disordered). The structural integrity of CRBN is maintained by zinc coordination involving cysteine residues, and mutations in these residues can lead to protein misfolding (Akuffo2018Ligandmediated).

## Function
Cereblon (CRBN) is a protein that functions as a substrate receptor for the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a critical role in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, CRBN is involved in regulating large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK Ca) channels, which are essential for neuronal activity, learning, and memory. CRBN binds to the α subunit of these channels, suppressing their membrane expression and modulating their assembly and translocation, which is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal function and preventing conditions like epilepsy (Kim2016Cereblon; Jo2005Identification).

CRBN also interacts with voltage-gated chloride channels, such as ClC-2, influencing their structural aspects, although its exact role in chloride conductance is not fully understood (Hohberger2009Cereblon). Additionally, CRBN is involved in energy metabolism by inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, suggesting its role in AMPK-mediated energy metabolism (Kim2016Cereblon). CRBN is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, placenta, retina, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, testis, prostate, and small intestine, indicating its widespread importance in human physiology (Kim2016Cereblon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRBN gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Genetic mutations in CRBN have been linked to autosomal recessive non-syndromic mental retardation (ARNSMR), intellectual disability, and self-mutilating behavior. These mutations can disrupt the function of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, leading to increased expression in the neuronal membrane and potentially causing epilepsy (Kim2016Cereblon; Sheereen2017A). A specific missense mutation, c.1171T>C, resulting in a p.Cys391Arg change, has been identified in a consanguineous Saudi family, correlating with severe intellectual disability and seizures (Sheereen2017A).

In the context of multiple myeloma, CRBN is a critical target for immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Alterations in CRBN, such as mutations, copy number loss, and transcriptomic aberrations, are associated with resistance to these drugs. These genetic changes are linked to poorer outcomes in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients (Gooding2021Multiple; Borsi2023High). High levels of CRBN spliced isoforms lacking the drug-binding domain predict a lack of response to IMiD-based therapy (Borsi2023High). CRBN mutations are also associated with acquired resistance to IMiDs, as seen in patients with refractory multiple myeloma (Kortüm2016Targeted).

## Interactions
Cereblon (CRBN) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as a substrate receptor in the CRL4-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with proteins such as DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), Cullin-4A (CUL4A), and RING-box protein 1 (RBX1), forming a complex that facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Ito2021Exploiting; Watson2022Molecular).

CRBN binds to large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK Ca) channels, specifically the α subunit, modulating their assembly and translocation to the neuronal membrane (Kim2016Cereblon; Jo2005Identification). It also interacts with voltage-gated chloride channels, such as ClC-2, through its Lon domain, potentially influencing their conductance (Hohberger2009Cereblon).

CRBN is a direct target of thalidomide and its derivatives, which alter the substrate specificity of the CRL4-CRBN complex, leading to the degradation of transcription factors like Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3) (Ito2021Exploiting). It also interacts with p53, reducing DNA damage-induced apoptosis by modulating p53's transcription-independent functions (Zhou2019Cereblon). These interactions highlight CRBN's role in regulating various cellular processes through its involvement in protein ubiquitination and degradation.
