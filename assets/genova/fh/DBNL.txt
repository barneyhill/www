# DBNL

## Overview
The DBNL gene encodes the drebrin-like protein, a crucial component in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating various cellular processes. As an actin-binding protein, drebrin-like is involved in modulating actin dynamics, impacting processes such as endocytosis, signal transduction, and cellular motility. The protein's multi-domain structure, including an N-terminal actin depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain, a coiled-coil region, a proline-rich sequence, and a C-terminal SH3 domain, enables it to interact with a variety of proteins and participate in complex cellular functions (Ghosh2020Dimerization). DBNL is particularly significant in neuronal development and immune cell function, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cancer progression, notably in breast cancer, where it may act as a metastasis suppressor (Fish2016Muscleblindlike).

## Structure
The DBNL protein, also known as drebrin-like protein, is characterized by a multi-domain structure that facilitates its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The protein comprises several distinct domains: an N-terminal actin depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain, a coiled-coil region, a proline-rich sequence, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Ghosh2020Dimerization). The ADF-H domain is responsible for binding to F-actin, while the coiled-coil region contributes to dimerization through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Ghosh2020Dimerization). The proline-rich sequence and SH3 domain are crucial for maintaining a stable dimer conformation, which is essential for the protein's interaction with actin filaments (Ghosh2020Dimerization).

DBNL undergoes post-translational modifications, including Src-mediated phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, which is important for its role in podosome rosette formation (Boateng2012Srcmediated). The protein also exists in splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The dimeric structure of DBNL is vital for its biological activity, particularly in its interactions with actin filaments and other proteins (Ghosh2020Dimerization).

## Function
The DBNL (drebrin-like) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating motility. The DBNL protein interacts with actin filaments, influencing various cellular processes such as endocytosis and signal transduction. It is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in neuronal development and immune cell function (Fish2016Muscleblindlike).

In healthy human cells, DBNL is involved in endocytosis pathways, which are essential for the internalization of molecules and cellular signaling. This function is part of a broader network of endocytic and lysosomal activities that help regulate the transmission of signals to the nucleus, potentially affecting cellular responses to external stimuli (Park2021Disruption).

DBNL also plays a role in modulating podosome rosette formation, which are cell protrusions involved in cell invasion by secreting extracellular matrix-degrading factors. This suggests that DBNL may help regulate cellular invasiveness and migration, although its specific function in healthy cells is not fully detailed in the available context (Fish2016Muscleblindlike).

## Clinical Significance
The DBNL gene, encoding the drebrin-like protein, plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer. Alterations in DBNL expression have been linked to increased metastatic potential in breast cancer cells. When the Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) gene, which stabilizes DBNL transcripts, is depleted, the stability and abundance of DBNL decrease, leading to enhanced cell invasiveness and metastatic colonization. This suggests that DBNL acts as a metastasis suppressor in breast cancer (Fish2016Muscleblindlike). 

In metastatic stage IV breast cancer tumors, DBNL expression is lower compared to early-stage tumors, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Fish2016Muscleblindlike). The protein's interaction with actin filaments is crucial for its function, and alterations in its dimerization or interaction with actin can impact cellular processes, potentially contributing to cancer development (Ghosh2020Dimerization). 

While specific diseases directly resulting from DBNL mutations are not detailed, its role as a negative regulator of cancer development and its involvement in actin dynamics suggest its clinical significance in cancer biology (Ghosh2020Dimerization).

## Interactions
DBNL (drebrin-like) is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in cellular functions by connecting the actin cytoskeleton to various biomolecules. It has a multi-domain structure, including an N-terminal ADF-H domain, a coiled-coil region, a proline-rich sequence, and a C-terminal SH3 domain, which facilitate its interactions with several proteins. DBNL interacts with dynamin 1, WASP-interacting protein (WIP), Piccolo, the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Fgd1, and FHL2, enabling it to mediate endocytosis, vesicle recycling, and regulate actin dynamics during the formation of dorsal ruffles, podosomes, and sarcomere contraction (Ghosh2020Dimerization).

The coiled-coil domain of DBNL is crucial for its self-assembly, and the presence of both proline-rich and SH3 domains is essential for maintaining a stable dimer conformation. These domains are important for DBNL's interaction with actin filaments, as demonstrated by FLIM-FRET imaging, which shows that DBNL can efficiently interact with actin filaments only in its native conformation (Ghosh2020Dimerization). The dimerization of DBNL is crucial for its proper interaction with actin filaments, as evidenced by native gel electrophoresis and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) (Ghosh2020Dimerization).
