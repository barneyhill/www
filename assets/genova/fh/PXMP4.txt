# PXMP4

## Overview
PXMP4 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal membrane protein 4, a transmembrane protein involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is located in the peroxisomal membrane and is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. PXMP4 is part of the Tim17 protein family and shares homology with TMEM135, suggesting a role in fatty acid metabolism. Although its precise function in human cells is not fully understood, studies in mice indicate that PXMP4 may influence the metabolism of ether lipids, particularly under conditions that challenge lipid metabolism, such as high-fat diets or fasting. Additionally, PXMP4 has been implicated in various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression levels may affect tumor progression and treatment outcomes (Blankestijn2022Mice; Lismont2019Deciphering; Zhang2020HSD17B4).

## Function
PXMP4, or peroxisomal membrane protein 4, is a ubiquitously expressed protein located in the peroxisomal membrane, involved in lipid metabolism. It is transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a master regulator of lipid metabolism, which is highly expressed in tissues with high rates of fatty acid oxidation (Blankestijn2022Mice). Although the precise function of PXMP4 in healthy human cells remains largely unknown, studies in mice suggest that it may play a role in the metabolism of ether lipids, particularly affecting hepatic levels of alkyldiacylglycerol, a class of neutral ether lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (Blankestijn2022Mice).

PXMP4 is part of the Tim17 protein family and shares homology with TMEM135, a protein associated with fatty acid metabolism (Blankestijn2022Mice). It has been suggested as a candidate for peroxiporin-like properties, which are necessary for hydrogen peroxide permeability across the peroxisomal membrane (Lismont2019Deciphering). Despite its involvement in lipid metabolism, no critical role for PXMP4 has been identified under standard dietary conditions, but its role may become significant under conditions that challenge lipid metabolism, such as high-fat diets or fasting (Blankestijn2022Mice).

## Clinical Significance
PXMP4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and potential mutations. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PXMP4 is significantly down-regulated in both lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This downregulation is associated with poorer differentiation of tumors and may influence tumor growth and immune response, suggesting a role in the disease's progression and prognosis (Zhang2020HSD17B4). PXMP4 expression is also linked to drug sensitivity, with higher expression observed in Topotecan-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, indicating its potential impact on treatment outcomes (Zhang2020HSD17B4).

In mice, PXMP4 deficiency leads to mild changes in hepatic lipid metabolism, particularly under conditions that challenge lipid metabolism, such as high-fat diets or fasting. Although PXMP4's role in tumor development remains unclear, it has been associated with somatic mutations and hypermethylation in various cancers, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor function (Blankestijn2022Mice). Despite these associations, PXMP4 deficiency in mice does not result in significant phenotypic changes under standard conditions, indicating that its function may be redundant or non-essential in certain contexts (Blankestijn2022Mice).
