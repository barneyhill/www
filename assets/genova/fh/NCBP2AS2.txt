# NCBP2AS2

## Overview
NCBP2AS2 is a gene that encodes the NCBP2 antisense 2 (head to head) protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of the NCBP2 antisense 2 protein are not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a non-coding RNA, suggesting a regulatory role in gene expression. The gene has garnered attention due to its involvement in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, where its expression levels are linked to disease severity and inflammatory responses (Badr2022Are). Additionally, NCBP2AS2 has been identified as a driver gene in glioblastoma, indicating its potential influence on tumor behavior and patient outcomes (KałuzińskaKołat2023Molecular). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both infectious and oncological contexts, making it a subject of ongoing research.

## Clinical Significance
NCBP2AS2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, where its expression levels are associated with disease severity. Studies have shown that NCBP2AS2 expression is increased in COVID-19 patients and correlates positively with interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response. This suggests that NCBP2AS2 may contribute to the inflammatory processes observed in severe COVID-19 cases (Badr2022Are). NCBP2AS2-1, a variant of this gene, has been identified as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between severe and moderate COVID-19 infections, with high sensitivity and specificity. It is also associated with the need for mechanical ventilation in severe cases, indicating its potential role in predicting disease outcomes (Badr2022Are).

In addition to its role in COVID-19, NCBP2AS2 has been identified as a driver gene in glioblastoma cell lines, specifically within the DBTRG-05MG cell line. This suggests that alterations in NCBP2AS2 expression may contribute to the distinct molecular profiles observed in certain glioblastoma variants, potentially influencing tumor behavior and patient prognosis (KałuzińskaKołat2023Molecular).
