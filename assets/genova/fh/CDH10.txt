# CDH10

## Overview
CDH10 is a gene that encodes cadherin 10, a type II classical cadherin protein involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Cadherin 10 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in neural tissue, particularly in the brain, where it contributes to synaptic adhesion, axon outgrowth, and guidance. This protein is essential for maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance in cortical neurons by facilitating cell-cell adhesion through adherens junctions (Jinawath2017Alterations; Smith2017Cadherin10). The CDH10 gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and prostate, and is involved in maintaining the blood-brain barrier (An2014Frameshift). Alterations in CDH10 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Casciello2020G9amediated; Jinawath2017Alterations).

## Structure
Cadherin-10, encoded by the CDH10 gene, is a type II classical cadherin involved in cell-cell adhesion. It is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein with a large extracellular domain that facilitates homophilic and heterophilic adhesion, crucial for maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance in cortical neurons (Smith2017Cadherin10). The extracellular domain of cadherin-10 is organized into nanoscale puncta at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, indicating its role in synaptic adhesion and function (Smith2017Cadherin10).

The primary structure of cadherin-10 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, typical of cadherin proteins. The tertiary structure involves the folding of this polypeptide into a stable three-dimensional form, featuring extracellular cadherin repeats that are essential for its adhesive functions (Hulpiau2009Molecular). The quaternary structure is characterized by homophilic interactions with other cadherin molecules, facilitating cell-cell adhesion (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

Cadherin-10 also contains a cytoplasmic domain that mediates downstream signaling, interacting with synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and gephyrin, which are involved in synaptic organization and function (Smith2017Cadherin10). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, may further influence its structure and function. Splice variant isoforms of cadherin-10 can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific variants are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
CDH10, or cadherin 10, is a type II classical cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in maintaining proper cell structure and communication, particularly in neural tissue. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in synaptic adhesions and axon outgrowth and guidance, contributing to the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections (Jinawath2017Alterations). CDH10 is active at the cell membrane, influencing neural network development and function by facilitating cell-cell adhesion through adherens junctions (An2014Frameshift).

In addition to its role in the brain, CDH10 is expressed in normal prostate cells and is involved in maintaining the blood-brain barrier in brain endothelium (An2014Frameshift). The protein's function in cell adhesion is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and proper cellular architecture, which is essential for coordinated cell movement and maintaining structural and functional cell and tissue polarity (Jinawath2017Alterations). CDH10's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in disease when its expression is altered.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CDH10 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), CDH10 has been identified as a driver mutation, with germline alterations observed in familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) patients. These include a balanced translocation affecting CDH10 expression and a missense variant in a highly conserved region, suggesting potential pathogenicity (Jinawath2017Alterations). Somatic mutations in CDH10 are also associated with colorectal, gastric, and lung cancers, with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the CDH10 region observed in sporadic pancreatic tumors (Jinawath2017Alterations).

In breast cancer, CDH10 expression is prognostic, particularly in the ER-subtype, and its loss is associated with increased cancer cell motility and metastasis under hypoxic conditions. CDH10 may act as a tumor suppressor, with its overexpression impacting tumor cell proliferation and motility (Casciello2020G9amediated). In prostate cancer, CDH10 expression is lost in aggressive forms, and a pan-cancer analysis showed that loss of CDH10 is common in various cancer types, often correlating with increased EHMT2 expression (Casciello2020G9amediated).

Frameshift mutations in CDH10 have been found in gastric and colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability, suggesting a role in cancer pathogenesis (An2014Frameshift).

## Interactions
Cadherin-10 (CDH10) is involved in several interactions with synaptic proteins that are crucial for maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in cortical neurons. It forms a complex with PSD-95, a major excitatory synaptic protein, both in vitro and in vivo, indicating a strong association with excitatory synapses (Smith2017Cadherin10). This interaction is significant as the presence of cadherin-10 correlates with larger PSD-95 clusters, suggesting its role in influencing the size and distribution of these synaptic structures (Smith2017Cadherin10).

Cadherin-10 also interacts with gephyrin, an inhibitory scaffold protein, although this interaction is weaker compared to its association with PSD-95. While direct coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) of gephyrin with cadherin-10 was not detected, reverse coIP with gephyrin antibodies did precipitate cadherin-10, indicating its presence at inhibitory synapses (Smith2017Cadherin10). This suggests that cadherin-10 may influence synaptic gephyrin by sequestering it away from GABA A receptors, thereby affecting the E/I ratio (Smith2017Cadherin10).

Cadherin-10's interactions with these synaptic proteins are essential for its function in synaptic regulation, contributing to the maintenance of synaptic structure and balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs (Smith2017Cadherin10).
