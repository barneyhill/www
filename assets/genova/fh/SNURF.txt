# SNURF

## Overview
The SNURF gene, located on chromosome 15q11-q13, is a critical component of the SNURF-SNRPN locus, which plays a significant role in genomic imprinting. This gene encodes the SNURF protein, a small nuclear RING finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of steroid receptor-mediated gene transcription. The SNURF protein is characterized by its nuclear localization and its ability to interact with various steroid receptors, such as the androgen receptor, enhancing transcription from steroid-regulated promoters. It also plays a role in the regulation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs, which are processed from its introns. The SNURF gene is expressed from the paternal allele and is part of a bicistronic transcript with SNRPN, which is essential for the regulation of imprinting in this genomic region (Gray1999An; Chamberlain2012RNAs; Moilanen1998Identification).

## Function
The SNURF gene, part of the SNURF-SNRPN locus on chromosome 15q11-q13, encodes a highly basic 71-amino acid protein that is nuclear-localized and involved in genomic imprinting, a process where genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner (Gray1999An). SNURF is expressed from the paternal allele and is part of a bicistronic transcript with SNRPN, which is significant for the regulation of imprinting in this genomic region (Gray1999An). The SNURF protein contains a RING finger domain, which is implicated in protein-protein interactions and is essential for its role as a coregulator in steroid receptor-mediated gene transcription (Moilanen1998Identification). 

SNURF interacts with androgen receptors and enhances transcription from steroid-regulated promoters, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Moilanen1998Identification). It is also involved in the regulation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs, which are processed from its introns and play roles in modifying RNA molecules (Chamberlain2012RNAs). The SNURF protein's nuclear localization and potential interactions with RNA suggest it may have roles in RNA processing or regulation within the cell (Gray1999An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SNURF gene, located within the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region on chromosome 15, are associated with several clinical conditions. Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as hypotonia, obesity, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. The SNURF gene, along with SNRPN, plays a crucial role in the regulation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), particularly SNORD116, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of PWS. Deletions affecting the SNURF/SNRPN region can lead to a PWS-like phenotype due to the absence of paternally derived SNORD116 snoRNAs (KOUFARIS2016Deletion; Cao2017A).

The SNURF-SNRPN locus is also involved in the transcription of a bicistronic mRNA that encodes the SNURF protein and the SmN splicosomal protein, and it serves as a host for multiple snoRNA genes. Disruptions in this locus may contribute to the PWS phenotype by affecting brain-specific alternative transcripts and the expression of UBE3A through an antisense mechanism (Runte2001The).

In some cases, unique variants in the SNURF-SNRPN gene have been identified in patients with Prader-Willi-like syndrome, suggesting a complex genetic background that may involve multiple autosomal recessive conditions (Pellikaan2021The).

## Interactions
SNURF, a small nuclear RING finger protein, interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in a hormone-dependent manner, enhancing transcription from steroid-regulated promoters. This interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and protein-protein affinity chromatography (Moilanen1998Identification). SNURF also interacts with other steroid receptors, such as the progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), augmenting their transactivation (Moilanen1998Identification).

The RING finger motif of SNURF is involved in protein-protein interactions, although mutations in this region do not affect steroid receptor activation but are crucial for basal transcription activation (Moilanen1998Identification). SNURF interacts with transcription factors like the TATA-binding protein (TBP), Sp1, and AP1, enhancing transcription from promoters containing these elements (Moilanen1998Identification). The interaction with AR involves a region of SNURF encompassing residues 20 to 121, which is essential for interaction but does not include the RING finger domain (Moilanen1998Identification).

SNURF's interaction with TBP is specific, and it does not directly influence AR binding to androgen response elements (AREs) (Moilanen1998Identification). These interactions suggest that SNURF functions as a bridging factor in steroid receptor-mediated transcription, coordinating multiple transcriptional signals.
