# PRKCH

## Overview
The PRKCH gene encodes protein kinase C eta (PKCη), a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family, which is a group of serine/threonine kinases involved in a wide array of cellular processes. PKCη is distinguished by its unique structural features, including a regulatory domain that lacks calcium-binding capability, setting it apart from classical PKC isoforms (Littler2006Structure). This protein plays a significant role in T cell activation and homeostatic proliferation, contributing to immune system regulation (Fu2011Protein). PKCη is also involved in various protein interactions that influence cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling pathways (Basu2019The). Clinically, alterations in PRKCH expression or genetic variations have been linked to diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and ischemic stroke, underscoring its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Porter2017PRKCH; Zhang2014PRKCH; Takata2007Genetic).

## Structure
Protein kinase C eta (PKCη), encoded by the PRKCH gene, is a member of the protein kinase C family characterized by a unique structure that includes both regulatory and catalytic domains. The protein consists of 683 amino acid residues and features a highly conserved catalytic domain at the C-terminal and a regulatory domain at the N-terminal (PAL2014The). The regulatory domain includes the C1 and C2 domains, which are involved in membrane targeting. The C1 domain contains a cysteine-rich region that binds diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol esters, conferring selectivity for phosphatidylserine (PAL2014The).

The C2 domain of PKCη is distinct from classical PKC isoforms as it lacks key aspartic acid residues necessary for calcium binding, making it calcium-insensitive. Instead, the C2 domain is involved in phospholipid sensing and membrane targeting, crucial for PKCη activation (Littler2006Structure). The C2 domain structure includes loop regions C-terminal to two alpha-helices, with autophosphorylation sites Ser-28 and Ser-32 located in helix a1 near the lipid-binding site (Littler2006Structure).

PKCη undergoes phosphorylation at several sites, including the activation loop (Thr-513), turn motif (Thr-655), and hydrophobic domain (Ser-674), with phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) believed to phosphorylate the activation loop (PAL2014The). These modifications play a role in the protein's regulation and function. The C2 domain's unique structural features, such as the presence of histidine residues in place of aspartates, alter its electrostatic properties and potentially its lipid-binding characteristics (Littler2006Structure).

## Function
Protein kinase C eta (PKCη), encoded by the PRKCH gene, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including T cell activation and homeostatic proliferation. PKCη is highly abundant in T cells and is recruited to the immunological synapse, a critical site for T cell activation, upon antigen recognition (Fu2011Protein). It plays a crucial role in the proliferative response of T cells to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, although PKCη-deficient T cells exhibit impaired proliferation and defects in calcium (Ca2+) and NF-κB signaling pathways (Fu2011Protein).

PKCη is not required for the positive or negative selection of thymocytes, but it is essential for the activation of mature CD8+ T cells and their homeostatic proliferation (Fu2011Protein). In healthy human cells, PKCη is necessary for T-cell activation and regulatory T-cell function, influencing immune homeostasis and response to antigens (Porter2017PRKCH). PKCη's role in T cell biology includes involvement in intracellular calcium signaling and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, similar to PKCθ, another PKC isoform (Fu2011Protein). Despite its critical role in T cell function, PKCη is not essential for antiviral immunity or CD8+ T cell activation, as its absence can enhance antiviral responses by affecting regulatory T cells (Liu2020Protein).

## Clinical Significance
The PRKCH gene, encoding protein kinase C eta (PKCη), has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or genetic variations. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PRKCH is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia stem cells (LSCs), particularly in the undifferentiated FAB M0 subtype. Its expression correlates with poor prognosis, TP53 and RUNX1 mutations, and high-risk cytogenetic features, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in AML (Porter2017PRKCH).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), genetic association studies have identified specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the PRKCH gene that are linked to increased RA risk in the Japanese population. These SNPs, such as rs959728 and rs767755, are associated with susceptibility to RA, potentially due to their impact on T cell activation and immune response regulation (Takata2007Genetic).

The PRKCH 1425G/A polymorphism has also been associated with an increased risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and ischemic stroke recurrence. In SSNHL, the 1425A-allele is linked to higher risk, possibly due to vascular pathogenesis (Uchida2011Contribution). In ischemic stroke, the AA genotype is associated with a higher risk of recurrence, particularly among smokers (Zhang2014PRKCH).

## Interactions
Protein kinase C eta (PKCη), encoded by the PRKCH gene, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. PKCη interacts with the tumor suppressor protein Rb and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), forming complexes with cyclin E/Cdk2/p21. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of p21 and dephosphorylation of Cdk2, resulting in G1 arrest in keratinocytes (Basu2019The). In NIH3T3 and MCF-7 cells, PKCη also forms complexes with cyclin E/Cdk2, particularly in serum-starved conditions (Basu2019The).

PKCη interacts with the Src kinase family member Fyn, which is involved in keratinocyte differentiation, and with the small G protein RalA, promoting keratinocyte differentiation (Basu2019The). It also interacts with the Akt and mTOR pathways, although its exact role in Akt signaling is debated (Basu2019The).

In breast cancer cells, PKCη regulates the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 through the ERK signaling pathway, protecting Mcl-1 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. This interaction involves ERK1, which is crucial for maintaining Mcl-1 levels (Pal2017Protein). PKCη's interactions with these proteins and pathways highlight its role in modulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation.
