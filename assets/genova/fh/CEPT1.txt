# CEPT1

## Overview
CEPT1 (choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of key phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). These phospholipids are critical components of eukaryotic cell membranes, and CEPT1 catalyzes the final step in their synthesis via the Kennedy pathway. The protein encoded by CEPT1 is characterized by its dimeric structure, with each protomer containing multiple transmembrane helices that form distinct catalytic and dimerization domains (Wang2023Structural). CEPT1 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes, where it plays a vital role in membrane biogenesis and maintenance (Henneberry2002The). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining the balance of PC and PE, which together constitute a significant portion of cellular phospholipid mass (Henneberry2002The). Alterations in CEPT1 expression have been linked to various metabolic and vascular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Zayed2020CEPT1Mediated).

## Structure
CEPT1 is a dimeric protein, with each protomer containing 10 transmembrane helices (TM1-10) (Wang2023Structural). The primary structure includes a conserved catalytic domain formed by TM1-6 and a dimerization domain formed by TM7-10 (Wang2023Structural). The secondary structure features two N-terminal helices (NH1 and NH2) and a transverse helix (TH) that lies along the cytosolic boundary of the membrane (Wang2023Structural).

The tertiary structure of CEPT1 includes a hydrophobic chamber that accommodates phosphatidylcholine, with specific residues coordinating the lipid molecule (Wang2023Structural). The quaternary structure is characterized by a dimeric assembly, primarily mediated by van der Waals interactions at the luminal side, involving TMs 7 and 9 (Wang2023Structural). The dimerization domain is superimposed with TMs 3-6 of the catalytic domain, resulting in a C2 pseudosymmetry axis at their interface, suggesting evolutionary development from a dimeric ancestor (Wang2023Structural).

CEPT1 contains a CDP-binding motif located at the cytosolic side of TMs 2 and 3, with four conserved aspartates pointing towards a polar cavity, indicating the site of catalysis (Wang2023Structural). The protein uses Mg2+ as a cofactor for its enzymatic activity (Wang2023Structural).

## Function
CEPT1 (choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1) is a dual-specificity enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which are essential components of eukaryotic cell membranes. CEPT1 catalyzes the final step in the Kennedy pathway by transferring a phosphate group from CDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol, resulting in the production of PC and PE (Wang2023Structural). This enzyme is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes, where it contributes to membrane biogenesis and maintenance (Henneberry2002The).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of these two major phospholipids, which together comprise 50-75% of cellular phospholipid mass (Henneberry2002The). CEPT1's dual specificity allows it to utilize both CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine, making it vital for the synthesis of both PC and PE (Wang2023Structural). The enzyme's function is regulated by its interaction with CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CTα), an enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step of PtdCho synthesis, suggesting that their proximity in the nuclear membrane is crucial for the activation of the CDP-choline pathway (Henneberry2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CEPT1 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions, particularly those related to metabolic and vascular health. Elevated CEPT1 expression is observed in the arterial intima of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), suggesting its involvement in these conditions. This increased expression is linked to enhanced fatty acid oxidation through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which is crucial for endothelial cell function and ischemia-induced angiogenesis (Zayed2020CEPT1Mediated).

In mouse models, knockdown of Cept1 results in impaired endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubule formation, leading to reduced perfusion in ischemic conditions. This suggests that CEPT1 is essential for maintaining endothelial function and recovery after ischemic insults (Zayed2020CEPT1Mediated). The therapeutic potential of fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist, has been explored to ameliorate the effects of CEPT1 alterations, particularly in diabetes-related complications (Zayed2020CEPT1Mediated).

In the context of GCK-MODY, a form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, increased CEPT1 levels contribute to atheroprotective lipid profiles, potentially explaining the low incidence of vascular complications in these patients despite chronic hyperglycemia (Wang2021Localized).

## Interactions
CEPT1 (choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1) is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. While specific physical interactions of CEPT1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, several studies suggest potential interactions through colocalization and shared pathways. CEPT1 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear membranes, where it may interact with CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CTα). CTα translocates to the nuclear membrane upon activation, overlapping with CEPT1, which suggests a potential interaction or colocalization, although direct physical interactions remain to be confirmed (Henneberry2002The).

CEPT1 also colocalizes with Rab10 and phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) at dynamic domains of the ER. These domains are enriched with lipid-synthesizing proteins, and the co-localization of CEPT1 with Rab10 and PIS suggests a functional association in ER dynamics and morphology. Rab10 is necessary for the formation and dynamics of these domains, indicating that CEPT1 may participate in regulatory pathways affecting ER extension and fusion (English2012Rab10). However, specific details on direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided.
