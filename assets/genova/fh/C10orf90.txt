# C10orf90

## Overview
C10orf90, also known as the Fragile Site Associated Tumor Suppressor (FATS), is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes a protein involved in crucial cellular processes, including genomic stability and DNA damage response. The protein encoded by C10orf90 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the non-proteolytic polyubiquitination of the tumor suppressor protein TP53, thereby enhancing its stability and activation (Yan2013FATS; Suarez2021Transcriptome). Beyond its role in DNA repair, the C10orf90 protein is implicated in centrosomal functions and the formation of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions (Knorz2010Centriolar). The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with varying risks of colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential significance in cancer prevention and therapy (Song2023Association).

## Function
The C10orf90 gene, also known as Fragile Site Associated Tumor Suppressor (FATS), encodes a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and responding to DNA damage. It is involved in promoting the activation of the tumor suppressor protein TP53, also known as p53, which is crucial for DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation (Yan2013FATS; Suarez2021Transcriptome). C10orf90 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the non-proteolytic polyubiquitination of p53, which enhances its stability and activation. This process is independent of the typical ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and involves K11-, K29-, and K63-linkages (Yan2013FATS).

In addition to its role in DNA damage response, C10orf90 is implicated in centrosomal functions and primary cilium formation. It localizes to the centrosome and is involved in the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia, structures important for cellular signaling and sensory functions (Knorz2010Centriolar). The protein's localization to the centrosome and actin cytoskeleton suggests a role in cell division and structural organization (Knorz2010Centriolar). These functions highlight C10orf90's importance in cellular processes that maintain genomic integrity and proper cell function.

## Clinical Significance
C10orf90, also known as the fragile-site associated tumor suppressor (FATS), has been implicated in the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown that specific polymorphisms in the C10orf90 gene are associated with varying susceptibilities to CRC. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12412320 is significantly associated with a reduced risk of CRC, particularly in individuals over 60, women, non-smokers, and non-drinkers. This SNP is also linked to a lower risk of advanced CRC stages and rectal cancer, suggesting its potential role in CRC prevention (Song2023Association). Conversely, SNPs rs11245008 and rs11245007 are associated with increased CRC susceptibility in certain demographics, such as men and those with advanced cancer stages (Song2023Association).

The gene's involvement in centrosomal functions has also been explored, with studies indicating that C10orf90 may play a role in primary cilium formation or maintenance. However, the clinical significance of these centrosomal functions in relation to specific diseases is not directly addressed in the available literature (Knorz2010Centriolar). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of C10orf90 in various conditions.
