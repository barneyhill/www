# FIGNL2

## Overview
FIGNL2 is a gene that encodes the protein fidgetin-like 2 (FL2), which is a member of the ATP-dependent microtubule-severing enzymes. FL2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, particularly at the cell cortex, where it influences cell motility by modulating the size and distribution of focal adhesion complexes (Charafeddine2015FidgetinLike). The protein's activity is crucial for processes such as cell migration and wound healing, as it severs and depolymerizes microtubules, thereby affecting cytoskeletal organization (Charafeddine2015FidgetinLike). The FIGNL2 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential prognostic role in melanoma and its involvement in colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases (Vicente2022Cutaneous; Triantaphyllopoulos2023Long; R2023Multiomics).

## Function
Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2) is a microtubule-severing enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics within healthy human cells. It is primarily active at the cell cortex, where it suppresses microtubule growth, thereby influencing the size and distribution of focal adhesion complexes, which are essential for controlling cell motility (Charafeddine2015FidgetinLike). FL2's activity involves severing and depolymerizing microtubules, which affects cell migration by modulating the cytoskeletal organization (Charafeddine2015FidgetinLike).

In polarized cells, FL2 localizes to the leading edge, where it regulates microtubule dynamics, impacting processes such as cell migration and wound healing. Its depletion results in increased microtubule polymer mass and bundling, leading to enhanced cell motility (Charafeddine2015FidgetinLike). FL2 is also involved in the regulation of focal adhesion morphology, with its depletion leading to increased focal adhesion area, correlating with faster cell migration (Charafeddine2015FidgetinLike).

FL2's function is further regulated by local translation mechanisms, with its mRNA being localized and translated at the leading edge of cells. This local translation is crucial for its role in cellular motility and response to environmental cues (Birnbaum2023mRNA).

## Clinical Significance
The FIGNL2 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, primarily through alterations in its methylation status and expression levels. In cutaneous melanoma, hypomethylation of specific CpG sites within the FIGNL2 gene has been associated with increased patient survival, particularly in UV-mutant melanoma cases. This suggests a potential prognostic role for FIGNL2 methylation status in melanoma (Vicente2022Cutaneous).

In colorectal cancer, FIGNL2 is identified as one of the top hypermethylated genes in right-sided colorectal cancer (RCRC). This hypermethylation is part of a broader pattern distinguishing RCRC from left-sided colorectal cancer, indicating a potential role for FIGNL2 in the pathobiology of colorectal cancer subtypes (R2023Multiomics).

Additionally, the FIGNL2 gene has been studied in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), where a novel transcript, FIGNL2 Divergent Transcript (FIGNL2-DT), was identified. This transcript is considered a potential biomarker for IBD-related pathologies, highlighting the gene's relevance in inflammatory conditions (Triantaphyllopoulos2023Long).

While specific diseases directly resulting from FIGNL2 mutations are not well-documented, its involvement in these conditions underscores its clinical significance.
