# UBE2M

## Overview
UBE2M, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 M, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the neddylation and ubiquitylation processes, which are critical for protein regulation and degradation in human cells. The protein encoded by UBE2M is categorized as an E2 enzyme, playing a pivotal role in the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target substrates, particularly cullins, which are integral components of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) (Wijk2009The; Zhou2018UBE2M). This enzymatic activity is essential for the activation of CRLs, which are responsible for the ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of a significant portion of cellular proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response (Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating; Zhou2018UBE2M). UBE2M's function is facilitated through its interactions with various E3 ligases and is regulated by post-translational modifications. The protein's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Wijk2009The).

## Structure
UBE2M, also known as UBC12, is a human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the neddylation and ubiquitylation processes. The protein features a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. Structurally, UBE2M exhibits a canonical E2 fold characterized by a four-stranded, anti-parallel curled β-sheet surrounded by α-helical segments. This core structure is highly conserved among E2 proteins, with an average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2Å over aligned Cα atoms, indicating a high degree of structural similarity despite low sequence identity (Sheng2012A).

UBE2M functions as a dual E2 enzyme for both neddylation and ubiquitylation, interacting with various E3 ligases to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin-like proteins to target substrates. It is involved in the neddylation of cullin proteins, which are part of the cullin-RING ligase complexes, essential for protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Kim2021UBE2M; Zhou2018UBE2M).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate UBE2M's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein may also have splice variant isoforms that could influence its function, but these are not explicitly described in the available sources.

## Function
UBE2M, also known as UBC12, is a crucial enzyme involved in the neddylation and ubiquitylation processes in healthy human cells. It functions as a dual E2 enzyme, facilitating the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins, particularly cullins, which are components of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) (Wijk2009The; Zhou2018UBE2M). This neddylation is essential for the activation of CRLs, which regulate the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of approximately 20% of cellular proteins, thereby playing a significant role in protein turnover and cell cycle regulation (Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating; Zhou2018UBE2M).

UBE2M is also involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, where it mediates the neddylation of cullins and non-cullins, influencing the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and maintaining genomic stability (Zhou2023NEDD8conjugating). In regulatory T cells, UBE2M, in conjunction with RBX1, promotes the neddylation of Cullins 1-4, which is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and the suppressive functions of these cells (Wu2022The). UBE2M's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with various E1 and E3 enzymes to execute its functions (Wijk2009The).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2M has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein degradation pathways. In lung cancer, UBE2M acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of UBE2F, leading to the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA, which inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Overexpression of UBE2M results in tumor growth inhibition, while mutations that reduce its function can promote cancer cell growth (Zhou2018UBE2M).

In prostate cancer, UBE2M interacts with NPRL2, enhancing neddylation and stabilizing NPRL2, which reduces the sensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to the PARP inhibitor niraparib. This interaction suggests a role for UBE2M in drug resistance mechanisms (Zhao2021NPRL2).

In breast cancer, UBE2M is involved in the turnover of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Mutations in UBE2M can stabilize ERα, potentially affecting cancer progression and resistance to hormone therapy (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin).

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, high UBE2M expression is associated with shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Knockdown of UBE2M suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis in cancer cells (Lei2023Ubiquitin‑conjugating).

## Interactions
UBE2M, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 M, participates in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in neddylation and ubiquitylation processes. UBE2M interacts with the RBX1 component of Cullin-RING Ligase (CRL) complexes, facilitating the neddylation of Cullins 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is crucial for activating ubiquitin ligase activity and maintaining genome integrity (Cukras2014Inactivating). It also forms a complex with DCN1, a co-E3 ligase, enhancing the activation of CRLs, and this interaction is a potential target for cancer therapy (Zhou2019Potent).

Under stress conditions, UBE2M interacts with the Parkin/DJ-1/PINK1 E3 complex, promoting the ubiquitylation and degradation of UBE2F, which is associated with tumor-suppressive activity in lung cancer (Zhou2018UBE2M). UBE2M also binds to MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, enhancing p53 ubiquitination and degradation, which contributes to cancer progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (Kim2021UBE2M). Additionally, UBE2M interacts with ribosomal protein L11, which modulates the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 (Kim2021UBE2M). These interactions highlight UBE2M's role in regulating protein stability and cellular stress responses.
