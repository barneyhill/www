# PHF10

## Overview
PHF10 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 10, a critical component of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex, which is part of the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes are essential for regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing DNA accessibility to transcription factors. The PHF10 protein is characterized by its unique DPF (double PHD finger) domain, which plays a significant role in histone interaction and chromatin remodeling. PHF10 exists in multiple isoforms, each with distinct roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, mediated through their incorporation into the PBAF complex. The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation has implications in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the context (Chugunov2021Conserved; Fan2024PHF10; Brechalov2014Mammalian).

## Structure
The PHF10 protein is a subunit of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex and is characterized by its unique DPF (double PHD finger) domain. This domain consists of tandem PHD fingers arranged in a face-to-back manner, forming a single structure that interacts with histone N-tails. The DPF domain includes two zinc-finger motifs, with the first Zn2+ ion coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine, and the second by four cysteines (Chugunov2021Conserved). The PHF10 protein exists in four isoforms: PHF10-Pl, PHF10-Ps, PHF10-Sl, and PHF10-Ss, produced through alternative splicing. The PHF10-P isoforms contain the DPF domain, while the PHF10-S isoforms have a phosphorylation-dependent SUMO-1 modification site (PDSM motif) instead (Chugunov2021Conserved; Brechalov2014Mammalian).

The long isoforms, PHF10-Pl and PHF10-Sl, have an additional 46 amino acids at the N-terminus compared to the short isoforms, PHF10-Ps and PHF10-Ss. This structural difference affects phosphorylation patterns, with long isoforms being heavily phosphorylated at the N-terminus and short isoforms at the linker domain (Chugunov2021Conserved). The DPF domain in PHF10-P isoforms prevents phosphorylation of the X-cluster, influencing isoform stability and degradation (Chugunov2021Conserved). The PHF10 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which are crucial for its function and interaction with the PBAF complex (Brechalov2016PHF10; Brechalov2014Mammalian).

## Function
PHF10 (PHD finger protein 10) is a crucial component of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex, which is part of the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. These complexes play a significant role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, thereby influencing DNA accessibility to transcription factors (Chugunov2021Conserved; Tatarskiy2017Stability). PHF10 is expressed in four isoforms, which are incorporated into the PBAF complex and affect transcription differently (Brechalov2016PHF10; Tatarskiy2017Stability).

The PHF10-P isoforms, which contain PHD fingers, are involved in recruiting RNA polymerase II to the promoters of cell cycle genes, thereby enhancing transcription and promoting cell proliferation (Chugunov2021Conserved; Brechalov2014Mammalian). In contrast, the PHF10-S isoforms, which contain a phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif, are involved in maintaining tissue-specific gene transcription in differentiated cells (Sheynov2019Different; Chugunov2021Conserved).

PHF10 is essential for maintaining the stability of the PBAF complex, as its depletion leads to the degradation of other PBAF-specific subunits, destabilizing the complex and affecting chromatin interaction and gene regulation (Tatarskiy2017Stability; Brechalov2014Mammalian). This stability is regulated by phosphorylation, which prevents the degradation of PHF10-S isoforms by the ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP (Tatarskiy2017Stability).

## Clinical Significance
PHF10 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. In gastric cancer (GC), PHF10 is significantly upregulated and is associated with poor differentiation and increased stemness of cancer cells. This is mediated through a feedback loop with E2F1, leading to dysregulated expression and repression of DUSP5, which increases pERK1/2 levels, contributing to cancer progression (Fan2024PHF10). PHF10's interaction with the SWI/SNF complex also plays a role in GC pathogenesis by affecting transcriptional regulation (Fan2024PHF10).

In uveal melanoma (UM), PHF10 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor. Loss of function mutations, including homozygous deletions and frameshift mutations, have been identified in tumors lacking other common UM mutations. These mutations are associated with downregulation of genes involved in adhesion and cell migration, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Anbunathan2019Integrative).

PHF10 is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in other contexts, such as neuronal progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells, where its expression levels are crucial for maintaining tissue-specific gene transcription (Chugunov2021Conserved).

## Interactions
PHF10 (PHD finger protein 10) is a component of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex, a variant of the SWI/SNF complex. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including BRG1, SNF5, and BAF155, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fan2024PHF10). PHF10 is crucial for maintaining the stability of the SWI/SNF complex, although its downregulation does not affect the expression of these proteins (Fan2024PHF10).

PHF10 exists in two isoforms, PHF10-P and PHF10-S, which are incorporated into the PBAF complex in a mutually exclusive manner. PHF10-P contains a double PHD finger domain that interacts with histone tails, while PHF10-S includes a phosphorylation-dependent SUMO-1 modification site (Sheynov2019Different; Brechalov2014Mammalian). These isoforms have distinct roles in cell proliferation, with PHF10-P enhancing proliferation and PHF10-S slightly decreasing it (Brechalov2014Mammalian).

PHF10 also interacts with transcription factors such as MYC and NF-kB, which are crucial for the transcription of proliferation genes and the activation of tissue-specific genes (Chugunov2021Conserved). In gastric cancer cells, PHF10 is involved in the E2F1-PHF10-DUSP5-pERK1/2 pathway, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation (Fan2024PHF10).
