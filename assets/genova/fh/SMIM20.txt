# SMIM20

## Overview
SMIM20, or small integral membrane protein 20, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein localized primarily in the mitochondrial membrane. This protein is integral to maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Pałasz2021Modulatory). SMIM20 is notably the precursor to the neuropeptide phoenixin (PNX), which is derived from its C-terminal region. Phoenixin exists in several isoforms, with the 14- and 20-amino acid variants being the most prevalent and evolutionarily conserved (Billert2020Phoenixin:). The neuropeptide is expressed in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it plays a significant role in reproductive hormone regulation and other physiological processes (Billert2020Phoenixin:; Suszka‐Świtek2019The). Through its interaction with various signaling pathways, phoenixin influences reproductive functions, mitochondrial biogenesis, and insulin secretion, underscoring the multifaceted roles of SMIM20 and its encoded protein in cellular and systemic physiology (Liang2022Regulation; Billert2019Phoenixin14).

## Function
SMIM20, also known as small integral membrane protein 20, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. The protein is localized in the mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular energy balance and homeostasis (Pałasz2021Modulatory).

SMIM20 is the precursor to the neuropeptide phoenixin (PNX), which is involved in several physiological processes. PNX is derived from the C-terminal of SMIM20 and exists in several isoforms, with the 14- and 20-amino acid amidated peptides being the most common. These isoforms are highly conserved across species, indicating an evolutionarily significant function (Billert2020Phoenixin:). PNX is expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, and in peripheral tissues such as the heart, ovaries, and pancreatic islets (Billert2020Phoenixin:).

In the context of reproduction, SMIM20 is implicated in the regulation of reproductive hormones and is suggested to have a stimulatory effect on reproductive function (Suszka‐Świtek2019The). It is involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, influencing the secretion of reproductive hormones such as LH, FSH, and testosterone (Billert2020Phoenixin:). Additionally, SMIM20 is associated with the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase, stabilizing the COX1 subunit, which is essential for mitochondrial function (Billert2020Phoenixin:).

## Interactions
Phoenixin, derived from the SMIM20 gene, interacts with various proteins and pathways, influencing multiple physiological processes. It acts as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor 173 (GPR173), activating signaling pathways such as the cAMP/PKA pathway, which leads to CREB phosphorylation and increased expression of genes related to reproductive and metabolic functions (Liang2022Regulation). Phoenixin also interacts with the KCNQ1OT1/miR-183-3p/CTNNB1 axis, regulating vascular smooth muscle cells and providing protective effects in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury (Liang2022Regulation).

In the brain, phoenixin interacts with nesfatin-1, another neuropeptide, affecting neuroendocrine activity and stress responses. This interaction enhances levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone, suggesting a role in reproductive function (Liang2022Regulation). Phoenixin-20 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons by regulating the CREB/PGC-1α pathway and increasing the expression of mitochondrial regulatory factors (Liang2022Regulation).

In pancreatic islets, phoenixin stimulates insulin secretion via a cAMP/Epac-dependent mechanism and promotes cell proliferation through ERK1/2 and AKT pathways (Billert2019Phoenixin14). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of phoenixin in cellular signaling and physiological regulation.
