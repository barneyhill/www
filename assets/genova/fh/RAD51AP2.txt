# RAD51AP2

## Overview
RAD51AP2 is a gene that encodes the RAD51 associated protein 2, which plays a critical role in the process of homologous recombination during meiosis. This protein is specifically involved in the recombination of XY chromosomes, particularly in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), where it stabilizes recombination intermediates and facilitates the maturation of the obligatory crossover. RAD51 associated protein 2 interacts with RAD51, a central protein in homologous recombination, but not with DMC1, another recombinase. The gene's function is essential for maintaining fertility, as disruptions can lead to reproductive issues such as non-obstructive azoospermia. Additionally, RAD51AP2 has been implicated in genetic predispositions to complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes-attributed end-stage kidney disease (T2D-ESKD), highlighting its broader significance beyond meiosis (Guan2018An; Lampitto2024Recent).

## Function
RAD51AP2 is a meiosis-specific gene that plays a crucial role in the recombination process during meiosis, particularly in the pairing and synapsis of XY chromosomes in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR). In healthy cells, RAD51AP2 stabilizes recombination intermediates in the PAR, ensuring the maturation of the obligatory crossover in this chromosomal region. This function is critical for maintaining fertility, as disruptions in RAD51AP2 can lead to issues such as non-obstructive azoospermia (Lampitto2024Recent).

RAD51AP2 interacts with RAD51, a key protein in homologous recombination, through its C-terminus. This interaction is essential for the stabilization of recombination intermediates, although RAD51AP2 does not interact with DMC1, another recombinase involved in meiotic recombination. The absence of RAD51AP2 expression does not affect the processing of double-strand breaks or synapsis of non-sex chromosomes, but it causes premature separation of XY chromosomes at late pachynema, before recombination is complete. This is due to the early disappearance of intermediate recombination markers MSH4 and TEX11 from the PAR (Lampitto2024Recent). RAD51AP2's role in these processes highlights its importance in ensuring proper chromosomal segregation and genomic stability during meiosis.

## Clinical Significance
The RAD51AP2 gene has been implicated in type 2 diabetes-attributed end-stage kidney disease (T2D-ESKD) in African Americans. A missense variant, rs834514, located in the RAD51AP2 gene, has shown a putative association with T2D-ESKD. This variant may influence the expression of RAD51AP2 and other genes such as GEN1 and VSNL1 in various tissues, including the pancreas and adipose tissue. The study suggests that low-frequency and rare variants in coding regions of RAD51AP2 provide important insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases like diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (Guan2018An). However, the findings require further replication due to limited power in the initial study (Guan2018An).

The research highlights the potential role of RAD51AP2 in genetic predisposition to T2D-ESKD, with variants within RAD51AP2 and PRX being highly correlated. Despite these associations, no variant reached exome-wide significance, emphasizing the need for additional research to confirm these findings and understand the clinical implications of RAD51AP2 mutations in the context of T2D-ESKD (Guan2018An). The study underscores the importance of exploring low-frequency coding variants to address the missing heritability in ESKD risk among African Americans (Guan2018An).

## Interactions
RAD51AP2 is a meiosis-specific protein that interacts with RAD51, a key player in homologous recombination. This interaction is crucial for the recombination process of XY chromosomes in mice, particularly in stabilizing recombination intermediates and maturing the obligatory crossover in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) (Lampitto2024Recent). RAD51AP2 co-immunoprecipitates with RAD51, indicating a physical interaction, but does not interact with DMC1, another recombinase involved in meiotic recombination (Lampitto2024Recent). The interaction between RAD51AP2 and RAD51 occurs through the C-terminus of RAD51AP2, suggesting that this region is essential for its function in recombination (Lampitto2024Recent).

Mutations in the interaction domains of RAD51AP2 and/or RAD51 could negatively impact XY recombination, highlighting the importance of this interaction for proper meiotic progression (Lampitto2024Recent). The role of RAD51AP2 in recombination is further supported by its identification as a meiosis-specific RAD51-interacting protein in yeast two-hybrid assays, although its precise regulatory role in homologous recombination remains to be fully elucidated (Krejci2012Homologous).
