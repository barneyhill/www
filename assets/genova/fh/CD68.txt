# CD68

## Overview
CD68 is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The CD68 protein is primarily located in lysosomal granules and is highly glycosylated, which contributes to its immunocytochemical reactivity. It plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of cell motility, growth, differentiation, and the clearance of cellular debris and pathogens through phagocytosis. CD68 is not only a marker for macrophages but is also expressed in other cell types, including neutrophils and basophils, and in non-hematopoietic cells such as kidney tubules. Its expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, where it can serve as a marker for disease progression and therapeutic resistance (Xu2011Global; Pulford1990Distribution; Mello2017Maturation‐associated).

## Function
CD68 is a glycoprotein predominantly expressed in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, where it serves as a marker due to its high levels of expression. It is primarily located in lysosomal granules within myeloid and lymphoid cells, suggesting a role in cellular cytotoxicity and the immune response (Pulford1990Distribution). CD68 is highly glycosylated, with about 70% of its structure consisting of carbohydrates, which may contribute to its immunocytochemical reactivity patterns (Pulford1990Distribution).

In healthy human cells, CD68 is involved in the regulation of cell motility, growth, differentiation, and immune response functions, which are crucial for the development and function of mature monocytes and macrophages (Mello2017Maturation‐associated). It is also associated with the clearance of cellular debris and pathogens through phagocytosis, playing a significant role in inflammation regulation (Pulford1990Distribution).

CD68 is not only present in macrophages but also in other cell types, including neutrophils and basophils, and is found in non-hematopoietic cells such as kidney tubules (Pulford1990Distribution). Its presence in serum indicates that it may be secreted by cells like macrophages, suggesting a broader functional significance beyond being a macrophage marker (Pulford1990Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in CD68 expression are associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, CD68 is often overexpressed in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which can promote tumor progression and are linked to poor prognosis in several cancer types, including glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhang2022Role). High CD68 expression is also associated with resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, indicating its role in immunotherapy resistance (Kato2020Expression).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), CD68 is upregulated in chronic active lesions, suggesting its involvement in early demyelination and lesion expansion (Hendrickx2017Gene). This upregulation is linked to the inflammatory response and myelin processing in MS lesions.

In Gaucher disease, CD68 expression is elevated in macrophages, indicating macrophage activation and its role in the disease's pathology (Xu2011Global). These findings highlight CD68's significance in various pathological conditions, where its altered expression can serve as a marker for disease progression and therapeutic resistance.

## Interactions
CD68 is known to participate in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of immune responses and cancer. In muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), CD68 interacts with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This interaction promotes the M2 polarization of macrophages, which is associated with poor prognosis in MIBC patients. The binding between CD68 and PD-1 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and molecular docking studies, suggesting a potential interaction between the LAMP-like domain of CD68 and the IgV domain of PD-1 (Jiang2021PD1Positive).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CD68 interacts with endosialin, a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This interaction facilitates the recruitment and M2 polarization of macrophages, contributing to HCC progression. The interaction was validated through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and it was shown that endosialin binds to CD68 through its ECD1 domain (Yang2020Interaction).

Although CD68 was investigated for interactions with the S100A8/A9 heterocomplex in inflammatory responses, no significant interactions were detected in certain experimental setups, suggesting that CD68 does not play a major role in S100-mediated activation of macrophages (Möller2023The).
