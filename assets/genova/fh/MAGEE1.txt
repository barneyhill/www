# MAGEE1

## Overview
MAGEE1 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member E1, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. MAGEE1 is particularly notable for its role in cancer biology, where it has been implicated in several malignancies such as ovarian clear cell carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, and glioma. The protein encoded by MAGEE1 is involved in modulating cell viability and proliferation, with its expression levels serving as potential prognostic markers in certain cancer types. The gene's mutations and expression patterns have been linked to both adverse and protective outcomes, depending on the cancer context, highlighting its complex role in oncogenesis (Caballero2010Frequent; Yang2020Genomic; Jia2019Prognostic; Arora2020Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAGEE1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) and breast cancer. In OCCC, MAGEE1 mutations are associated with shorter survival times, suggesting a poor prognostic factor. The gene's overexpression significantly decreases the viability of OCCC cells, indicating its role in cancer progression. Functional assays have shown that both MAGE domains of MAGEE1 are linked to cell proliferation, with the second domain having a greater impact (Yang2020Genomic). 

In breast cancer, high mRNA expression levels of MAGEE1 are associated with improved relapse-free survival in certain subtypes, such as luminal B breast cancer, suggesting a potential protective role (Jia2019Prognostic). 

MAGEE1 is also involved in melanoma, where it is frequently mutated. These mutations, such as P324S and P568L, have been identified in melanoma cell lines, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Caballero2010Frequent). 

In glioma, MAGEE1 is downregulated compared to normal brain tissue, and its reduced expression is linked to immune infiltration and poor prognosis (Arora2020Downregulation).
