# SYNE1

## Overview
SYNE1 is a gene that encodes the protein spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope protein 1, commonly known as Nesprin-1. This protein is a large transmembrane component of the nuclear envelope and is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining cellular architecture. Nesprin-1 is integral to the formation of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which connects the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating nuclear positioning and anchorage within cells (Smith2011Increased; Zhang2009SUN12). The protein is characterized by its spectrin repeats and a conserved KASH domain, which interacts with SUN proteins to maintain nuclear integrity, particularly in muscle and neuronal cells (EspigatGeorger2016Nuclear; Starr2010Interactions). Mutations in SYNE1 are associated with various neurodegenerative and muscular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Peng2018Identifying; Qian2022Case).

## Structure
The SYNE1 gene encodes the protein Nesprin-1, which is a large trans-membrane protein involved in the structure and function of the nuclear envelope. Nesprin-1 contains a variable number of spectrin repeats, contributing to its elongated structure, and a conserved KASH domain at the C-terminal end. This KASH domain interacts with Sun proteins at the nuclear envelope, forming LINC complexes that link the nucleus to the cytoskeleton (Smith2011Increased; Zhang2009SUN12). The N-terminal region of the full-length Syne1, known as Syne1 giant, includes two actin-binding calponin homology domains, which connect directly with the actin cytoskeleton (Smith2011Increased).

SYNE1 produces multiple protein isoforms through alternative splicing or different translation start sites. Some isoforms lack either the C-terminus or N-terminus, and their expression varies depending on the tissue type and developmental stage (Loebrich2016Genomic; Smith2011Increased). The largest transcript spans exons 1-145, while shorter isoforms derived from exons 80-145 are expressed in heart and muscle tissues (Loebrich2016Genomic). These structural features and isoform variations allow SYNE1 to play diverse roles in cellular functions, including nuclear anchorage and positioning (Zhang2007Syne1andSyne2play).

## Function
The SYNE1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the structural organization and function of cells, particularly in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and positioning. SYNE1 is a member of the spectrin family of structural proteins and is involved in linking the nucleoskeleton to the cytoskeleton through the LINC complex, which is crucial for nuclear-cytoskeletal connections (Peng2018Identifying). This protein is active in the nuclear envelope and plays a significant role in anchoring nuclei within cells, ensuring proper nuclear positioning and anchorage, especially in skeletal muscle fibers (EspigatGeorger2016Nuclear; Starr2010Interactions).

In skeletal muscle, SYNE1 is essential for the anchorage of synaptic nuclei at the neuromuscular junction, which is vital for muscle function and motor neuron innervation (Zhang2007Syne1andSyne2play; Starr2010Interactions). The protein interacts with actin filaments and other nuclear envelope components, such as SUN proteins, to maintain myonuclear integrity during mechanical stress (Starr2010Interactions). SYNE1 is also involved in the recruitment of centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope during myoblast differentiation, facilitating the movement of nuclei along microtubules (EspigatGeorger2016Nuclear). These functions are crucial for maintaining cellular organization and ensuring proper muscle and neuronal cell activities.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYNE1 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative and muscular diseases. SYNE1 ataxia, a form of recessive spinocerebellar ataxia, is characterized by symptoms such as motor neuron disorder, cognitive impairment, and cerebellar ataxia. This condition can present with both cerebellar and extra-cerebellar symptoms, including depression and various physical abnormalities (Peng2018Identifying). SYNE1 mutations are also linked to other Mendelian diseases like Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 4 (EDMD4) and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), as well as complex conditions such as congenital muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, autism, and schizophrenia (Baumann2016Homozygous; Qian2022Case).

The gene's mutations can affect the structure and function of Nesprin-1, leading to defects in nuclear morphology and muscle-specific pathogenesis. The location of mutations within the gene can influence the onset and severity of these conditions, with C-terminal mutations often resulting in early-onset diseases (Qian2022Case). SYNE1-related autosomal recessive ataxia often presents with ataxia, dysarthria, and executive function difficulties, with onset usually in middle age and a slow progression that does not affect life expectancy (Swan2018SYNE1related). The genetic and clinical heterogeneity of conditions associated with SYNE1 mutations is notable, with cases reported across diverse ethnic backgrounds (Wiethoff2016Heterogeneity).

## Interactions
SYNE1, also known as Nesprin-1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is a component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, where it interacts with SUN domain proteins, such as SUN1 and SUN2, to facilitate nuclear positioning and anchorage in muscle cells (Méjat2010LINC; Zhang2007Syne1andSyne2play). These interactions are essential for maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope and are implicated in conditions like Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (Starr2010Interactions).

SYNE1 also interacts with kinesin II subunit KIF3B, a motor protein involved in cytokinesis. This interaction is crucial for the attachment of membrane vesicles to the mitotic spindle and midbody, facilitating vesicular transport during cell division (Fan2004A). Additionally, SYNE1 binds to syntaxin, a t-SNARE protein, through its association with KIF3B, which is important for proper vesicle localization during cytokinesis (Fan2004A).

In muscle cells, SYNE1 interacts with MuSK (Muscle Specific Kinase) at the neuromuscular junction, playing a role in synaptic nuclei positioning (Méjat2010LINC). These interactions highlight SYNE1's involvement in both structural and signaling roles within the cell.
