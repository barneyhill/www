# BBOX1

## Overview
BBOX1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1, which is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase family. This enzyme is crucial for the biosynthesis of L-carnitine, a compound essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, thereby playing a significant role in energy metabolism (Lee2018BBOX1; Zhou2019Bioinformaticsbased). The BBOX1 protein is characterized by a double-stranded beta-helix (DSBH) core fold, which is typical of its enzyme family and supports its catalytic function (Leung2010Structural; McDonough2010Structural). It is primarily expressed in the kidney and liver, with additional activity in the brain, where it contributes to maintaining isotonicity and nerve excitability (Lee2018BBOX1). BBOX1's interactions and regulatory roles have been implicated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer, where it influences mitochondrial function and glycolysis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Shi2021KLF5induced; Liao2020Identification).

## Structure
The BBOX1 protein, also known as gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1, is involved in the biosynthesis of L-carnitine. It is characterized by a double-stranded beta-helix (DSBH) core fold, typical of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenases, which supports its catalytic function (Leung2010Structural; McDonough2010Structural). The DSBH fold includes major and minor beta-sheets, with a 94-residue insert between strands that contributes to the active site and dimerization interface (Leung2010Structural).

The primary structure of BBOX1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the BBOX1 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a three-dimensional conformation necessary for its enzymatic activity (Leung2010Structural). The protein forms a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to substrate binding (McDonough2010Structural).

BBOX1 contains a zinc-binding site in its N-terminal domain, featuring a 3Cys-1His motif, which is conserved among homologs (Leung2010Structural). The active site of BBOX1 is enclosed by loops and strands, with a tunnel leading to it, and is coordinated by specific residues such as His-202, Asp-204, and His-347 (Leung2010Structural). The protein's structure allows for an induced fit mechanism during substrate binding, highlighting its conformational flexibility (Leung2010Structural).

## Function
Gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1 (BBOX1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of L-carnitine, a molecule essential for fatty acid metabolism. BBOX1 catalyzes the conversion of gamma-butyrobetaine to L-carnitine, facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation, a key energy production process (Lee2018BBOX1; Zhou2019Bioinformaticsbased). This enzymatic activity is primarily found in the kidney and liver, with some activity in the brain, where it contributes to maintaining isotonicity and nerve excitability (Lee2018BBOX1).

BBOX1 requires Fe2+ as a cofactor and ascorbic acid for its activity, and its function involves five enzymatic reactions with lysine and methionine as precursors (Lee2018BBOX1). In the kidney, BBOX1 mRNA is predominantly expressed in tubular epithelial cells, indicating its significant role in renal physiology (Zhou2019Bioinformaticsbased). The enzyme's activity in healthy human cells is primarily related to energy metabolism and neuroprotection, with acetyl-L-carnitine, a derivative of L-carnitine, exhibiting neuroprotective properties and involvement in reducing serum ammonia levels (Lee2018BBOX1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BBOX1 gene have been implicated in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). BBOX1 is identified as a potential therapeutic target in TNBC due to its role in sustaining mitochondrial activity and mTORC1-dependent glycolysis, which are crucial for TNBC cell growth and survival. Depletion of BBOX1 leads to decreased tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its importance in maintaining TNBC tumor growth (Liao2020Identification). BBOX1 interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3), protecting it from degradation and maintaining calcium flux essential for mitochondrial function and glycolysis. This interaction is crucial for sustaining metabolic pathways like the TCA cycle and glycolysis, which are often dysregulated in cancer (Liao2020Identification).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the long non-coding RNA BBOX1-AS1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. BBOX1-AS1 acts as a competitive 'sponge' for miR-27a-5p, promoting the expression of maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) and activating the FAK signaling pathway, contributing to cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Shi2021KLF5induced). These findings suggest that both BBOX1 and BBOX1-AS1 play significant roles in cancer progression and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
BBOX1, also known as gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). BBOX1 specifically binds to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3), a protein crucial for calcium signaling. This interaction is dependent on BBOX1's enzymatic activity and has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in various TNBC cell lines. The binding domain on IP3R3 responsible for this interaction spans the amino acid sequence 232-436. BBOX1 regulates the stability of IP3R3 by protecting it from ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL2. Depletion of BBOX1 results in decreased IP3R3 protein levels, which can be rescued by proteasomal and neddylation inhibitors, indicating that BBOX1 stabilizes IP3R3 by preventing its degradation (Liao2020Identification).

BBOX1's interaction with IP3R3 is also linked to the regulation of mitochondrial function and glycolysis, which are critical for TNBC cell growth and survival. The interaction is essential for maintaining cellular bioenergetics and cell proliferation, as BBOX1-mediated calcium signaling is necessary for mTORC1 activation, a key regulator of glycolysis in cancer cells (Liao2020Identification).
