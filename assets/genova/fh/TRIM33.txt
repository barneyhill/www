# TRIM33

## Overview
TRIM33 is a gene that encodes the tripartite motif containing 33 protein, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by a distinct structural motif comprising a RING-finger domain, zinc-finger domains, and a coiled-coil region. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including chromatin interactions, ubiquitination, and transcriptional regulation. TRIM33 is involved in key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β, where it modulates cellular homeostasis and developmental processes. It also participates in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, contributing to tumor suppression and genomic integrity. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular function and stability (Sekirnik2022Identification; Xue2015Tumour; Ali2019Cellular).

## Structure
TRIM33, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes an N-terminal tripartite motif. This motif typically comprises a RING-finger domain, zinc-finger domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are essential for its function in chromatin interactions and ubiquitination processes (Sekirnik2022Identification). At the C-terminal, TRIM33 contains plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD) modules. The PHD domains are small, independently folded protein domains that coordinate zinc ions and are involved in reading histone marks, while BRDs bind to acetylated lysine (KAc) residues on histones (Sekirnik2022Identification).

TRIM33 exists in two isoforms, TRIM33α and TRIM33β, which differ by a 17 amino acid insertion/deletion. This structural variation affects the bromodomain, with the N1039 residue in TRIM33β coordinating KAc within the binding pocket, unlike in TRIM33α where it is located outside the pocket (Sekirnik2022Identification). Despite these differences, both isoforms exhibit similar affinities for certain histone marks, such as H3K9Me3 and H3K18Ac (Sekirnik2022Identification). The structural insights into TRIM33's domains and their interactions with histone peptides provide a foundation for understanding its biological functions and potential as a therapeutic target (Sekirnik2022Identification).

## Function
TRIM33, also known as TIF1γ, is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. One of its key roles is in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it promotes the degradation of nuclear β-catenin, thereby preventing excessive signaling that could lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation (Xue2015Tumour). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

TRIM33 is also involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, where it interacts with phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and competes with SMAD4, modulating the transcriptional response to TGF-β signaling. This interaction influences developmental processes and ectoderm specification (Ali2019Cellular). Additionally, TRIM33 is recruited to sites of DNA damage, playing a role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Ali2019Cellular).

The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus but can also be found in the cytosol, where it acts as a transcriptional co-suppressor and influences gene expression (Ali2019Cellular). Through these activities, TRIM33 contributes to tumor suppression, regulation of developmental signaling pathways, and maintenance of genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRIM33 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including autism and various cancers. In autism, the TRIM33 gene is associated with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs11102807. The homozygous AA genotype of this SNP is more prevalent in children with autism and is linked to more severe symptoms, as indicated by higher scores on diagnostic tools like CARS and ADI-R. Lower expression levels of TRIM33 at both transcriptional and translational levels are also associated with autism, suggesting that reduced TRIM33 expression may contribute to the disorder's etiology (Norouzi2021Alteration).

In cancer, TRIM33 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting nuclear β-catenin for degradation, a process crucial for regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Reduced expression of TRIM33 has been observed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is associated with the constitutive activation of Wnt signaling, promoting tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. This suggests that TRIM33 downregulation or mutations could lead to unchecked Wnt signaling, contributing to cancer progression (Xue2015Tumour; Giannopoulou2022Emerging). Additionally, TRIM33's interaction with noncoding RNAs may play a role in autoimmune diseases like paraneoplastic dermatomyositis, potentially affecting gene expression and contributing to disease mechanisms (Talotta2024Sequence).

## Interactions
TRIM33, also known as tripartite motif containing 33, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor E2f4, targeting it for degradation and regulating its interaction with the DNA helicase Recql. This interaction is crucial for controlling DNA replication fork progression, especially under replicative stress conditions (Rousseau2023Trim33). TRIM33 also interacts with the chromatin remodeler ALC1, facilitating its timely removal from DNA damage sites, which is essential for proper DNA repair processes. This interaction is dependent on PARP activity and is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Kulkarni2013Tripartite).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, TRIM33 targets the viral integrase (IN) for proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting the virus at the DNA integration step. This interaction involves the RING domain of TRIM33 and is specific to HIV-1 IN, as it does not affect other integrases like Moloney MLV IN (Ali2019Cellular). TRIM33 also acts as a co-regulator of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in breast cancer cells, influencing ER signaling and stability by directing ER binding to chromatin and modulating gene expression (Romo2024TRIM33). These interactions highlight TRIM33's multifaceted role in transcription regulation, DNA damage response, and viral infection control.
