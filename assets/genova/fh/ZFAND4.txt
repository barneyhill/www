# ZFAND4

## Overview
ZFAND4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger AN1-type containing 4 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a zinc finger AN1-type domain. This domain is integral to the protein's ability to mediate protein-protein interactions, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The ZFAND4 protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress response. It is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it regulates protein degradation pathways and gene expression, respectively. These functions are crucial for maintaining cellular equilibrium and facilitating adaptive responses to environmental changes, highlighting the protein's significance in cellular and organismal health.

## Structure


## Function
ZFAND4 encodes a protein that contains a zinc finger AN1-type domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in several cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In healthy human cells, ZFAND4 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress. It is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm is associated with the regulation of protein degradation pathways, which are essential for removing damaged or misfolded proteins and thus preventing cellular stress. In the nucleus, ZFAND4 contributes to transcriptional regulation, influencing the expression of genes necessary for cell survival and adaptation to environmental changes. Through these molecular activities, ZFAND4 supports the proper functioning of cellular processes, ensuring that cells can efficiently manage stress and maintain equilibrium. This dual localization and function underscore the protein's importance in cellular biology and its potential impact on organismal health by facilitating adaptive responses to various physiological conditions.
