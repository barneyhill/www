component of a ubiquitination complex. The encoded protein is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. In addition to oxygen-related gene expression, this protein plays a role in many other cellular processes including cilia formation, cytokine signaling, regulation of senescence, and formation of the extracellular matrix. Variants of this gene are associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, pheochromocytoma, erythrocytosis, renal cell carcinoma, and cerebellar hemangioblastoma.
