# CDH15

## Overview
CDH15, also known as M-cadherin, is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 15, a member of the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion proteins. Cadherin 15 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and the cerebellum, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating cellular signaling. As a type I classical cadherin, cadherin 15 is characterized by a five-domain extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region that interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as p120 and β-catenin, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The protein is involved in myotube formation in muscle tissue and is implicated in cognitive functions through its interactions in a molecular network that may impact learning and memory (El-Amraoui2009Cadherins). Variations in the CDH15 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as coronary artery disease and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both cardiovascular and neural contexts (Xiang2019A; Pagnamenta2010Rare).

## Structure
CDH15, also known as M-cadherin, is a type I classical cadherin characterized by a five-domain-long extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. The extracellular region contains five cadherin repeats, which are essential for calcium-dependent cell adhesion. These repeats form a beta-sandwich fold, typical of cadherin ectodomains, and are stabilized by calcium ions binding at three sites between each domain, creating a rigid, rod-like structure (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

The primary structure of CDH15 includes a conserved HAV tripeptide motif and a tryptophan residue at the second position in the most distal domain, EC1, which is crucial for adhesion (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The cytoplasmic region interacts with proteins such as p120 and β-catenin, linking the cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, affecting the protein's stability and function. While specific splice variants of CDH15 are not detailed in the provided context, such variants could lead to isoforms with distinct properties. The quaternary structure involves dimerization, forming either cis or trans dimers, which are essential for its adhesive functions (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

## Function
CDH15, also known as M-cadherin, is a type I classical cadherin primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and the cerebellum. It plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion, which is crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating cellular signaling. The protein is characterized by a five-domain extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region that interacts with proteins such as p120, β-catenin, and α-catenin to link to actin filaments, thereby contributing to the structural integrity of tissues (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

In skeletal muscle, CDH15 is involved in myotube formation, although M-cadherin-deficient mice do not exhibit defects in muscle development, suggesting potential compensation by other cadherins like N-cadherin (El-Amraoui2009Cadherins). The protein's role in cognitive functions is suggested through its involvement in a molecular network with KIRREL3 and other proteins, which may impact learning and memory (El-Amraoui2009Cadherins). CDH15's function in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its adhesive properties, which are essential for muscle development and possibly neural connectivity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDH15 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Variations in CDH15 are linked to repeat revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a procedure used to treat coronary artery disease. The gene is involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and its variations may affect vascular remodeling, contributing to coronary restenosis (Xiang2019A). Specifically, the rs72819363 SNP in CDH15 has shown significant associations with repeat revascularization events, suggesting its role in coronary artery-related conditions (Xiang2019A).

CDH15 has also been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. De novo deletions overlapping CDH15 have been detected in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autistic features, and alterations in CDH15 are associated with learning disabilities and impaired cell-cell adhesion (Pagnamenta2010Rare). In the context of KBG syndrome, CDH15 may play a role in regulating proper central nervous system embryogenesis, although specific diseases directly associated with CDH15 mutations in this syndrome are not detailed (Wojciechowska2021Case). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in both cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Interactions
CDH15, also known as cadherin 15, is a member of the cadherin superfamily, which are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion proteins. While specific physical interactions of CDH15 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively in the available literature, some insights can be drawn from related studies. CDH15 is noted to be part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, where it has a close relationship with other cadherin family members such as CDH1 and CDH13, suggesting potential interactions among these proteins (Ku2022Comprehensive). 

In the context of vascular remodeling, CDH15 is associated with the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions pathway, which is crucial for coronary restenosis. This implies that CDH15 may interact with ECM components, although specific proteins involved in these interactions are not detailed (Xiang2019A). 

CDH15 is also expressed in the brain and muscles, where it encodes calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion glycoproteins. Variations in CDH15 can affect its ability to mediate cell-cell adhesion, indicating its role in maintaining structural integrity through interactions with other cellular components (Xiang2019A). However, the specific partners in these interactions remain unspecified in the provided context.
