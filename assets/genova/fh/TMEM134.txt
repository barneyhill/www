# TMEM134

## Overview
TMEM134 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 134, a small protein characterized by its two-pass transmembrane domain and conserved domain DUF872. This protein is highly conserved across various species, including mammals, and exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can significantly impact its function. The transmembrane protein 134 is involved in several cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and interactions with viral proteins, such as the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the Epstein-Barr virus. These interactions suggest a role in signaling pathways that influence immune response and cell survival. TMEM134's involvement in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and Parkinson's disease highlights its clinical significance, particularly in the context of RNA splicing and protein interactions that contribute to disease pathogenesis (Wu2023Singlecell; Jansen2017Discovery; Talaty2012Identification).

## Structure
TMEM134 is a small transmembrane protein characterized by a predicted structure that includes a 122 amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a two-pass transmembrane domain, and a 20 amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Talaty2012Identification). It contains a conserved domain known as DUF872, which is preserved across various species, including mammals, zebrafish, drosophila, and C. elegans (Talaty2012Identification). The protein is highly conserved among mammalian species, showing over 90% identity in humans, chimpanzees, mice, rats, dogs, and bovines (Talaty2012Identification).

TMEM134 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. The full-length version is referred to as TMEM134α, while the version with exon 6 skipped is called TMEM134β. Exon 6 encodes one of the two transmembrane domains, and its skipping alters the protein's topology, potentially affecting its function (Wu2023Singlecell). TMEM134α is associated with decreased cell cycle activity, whereas TMEM134β promotes cell proliferation and leukemogenesis, indicating the critical role of exon 6 in the protein's function (Wu2023Singlecell). The predicted molecular weight of the CYFP-TMEM134 fusion protein is approximately 25 kDa (Talaty2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM134 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in RNA splicing and protein interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), exon 6 skipping in the TMEM134 gene is associated with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis. This splicing event results in two isoforms: TMEM134α and TMEM134β, with the latter promoting leukemogenesis and rapid cell proliferation, contributing to leukemia heterogeneity and aggressiveness (Wu2023Singlecell).

In Parkinson's disease, TMEM134 has been identified as a candidate gene that exacerbates α-synuclein-induced retinal degeneration in Drosophila models. Knockdown of TMEM134 enhances α-synuclein toxicity, suggesting its involvement in neurodegenerative processes related to Parkinson's disease (Jansen2017Discovery).

TMEM134 is also involved in cancer biology. It has been identified as a novel binding partner of the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the Epstein-Barr virus, which is associated with several cancers. TMEM134 affects LMP1-induced NF-κB activity, a pathway involved in cell survival and proliferation, indicating its potential role in oncogenic processes mediated by LMP1 (Talaty2012Identification).

## Interactions
TMEM134, or transmembrane protein 134, has been identified as a novel binding partner for the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This interaction was discovered using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and confirmed through various biochemical techniques, including pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation (Talaty2012Identification). TMEM134 and LMP1 co-localize in specific subcellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, early endosomes, and lipid rafts, with significant overlap observed in the endoplasmic reticulum (Talaty2012Identification).

The interaction between TMEM134 and LMP1 suggests a role for TMEM134 in LMP1 signaling pathways, particularly in the activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor involved in immune response and cell survival. Knockdown of TMEM134 has been shown to decrease NF-κB activity, indicating its involvement in LMP1-induced signaling (Talaty2012Identification). TMEM134 is also implicated in the regulation of LMP1 signaling through its interaction with cytoskeletal proteins, which may affect LMP1's association with lipid rafts and its signaling capabilities (Holthusen2015Regulation). These findings highlight TMEM134's potential role in EBV-related cellular processes and its broader implications in viral oncogenesis.
