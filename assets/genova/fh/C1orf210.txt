# C1orf210

## Overview
C1orf210 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 210. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain largely undefined (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite the limited understanding of its precise role, C1orf210 has been implicated in various biological processes and disease contexts, including its involvement in protein trafficking within oligodendrocytes and its potential impact on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Zhu2021Singlecell). Additionally, C1orf210 has been associated with cancer, particularly in terms of its expression patterns across different cancer types and its involvement in copy number variations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Liu2023Multiomics). The gene's presence in gene networks related to ovarian cancer and its potential for off-target mutations in genetic studies further underscore its clinical significance and the need for continued research (Ryczek2020Evaluation; Li2023Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
C1orf210 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), C1orf210 is involved in protein trafficking, particularly in the release of endosomes. Alterations in its expression or function may disrupt normal protein trafficking processes in oligodendrocytes, potentially contributing to ADHD symptoms (Zhu2021Singlecell).

In cancer research, C1orf210 is noted for its upregulation in a pan-cancer group, suggesting a potential role in cancer prognosis. However, specific clinical implications in terms of survival rates or treatment outcomes are not detailed (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), C1orf210 is associated with copy number variations (CNVs), particularly CNV loss, which may influence gene expression and contribute to distinct prognostic outcomes in different risk subgroups (Liu2023Multiomics).

Additionally, C1orf210 has been identified in a gene network related to ovarian cancer occurrence, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Li2023Transcriptomic). The gene has also been noted for potential off-target mutations in genetic modification studies, indicating the need for careful evaluation in such contexts (Ryczek2020Evaluation).
