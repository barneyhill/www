# TIMM23B

## Overview
The TIMM23B gene encodes the protein translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23 homolog B, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. This protein is part of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM) complex, which facilitates the translocation of preproteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. TIMM23B plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity by ensuring the proper import and sorting of proteins necessary for mitochondrial operations. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its role in spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane and facilitating the movement of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. Understanding the function and regulation of TIMM23B is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
