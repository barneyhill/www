# ADH4

## Overview
The ADH4 gene encodes the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (class II), pi polypeptide, which is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. This enzyme plays a critical role in the metabolism of alcohols, particularly in the liver, where it catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a key step in alcohol metabolism (LI1998Function; Pochareddy2010Identification). ADH4 is categorized as an oxidoreductase, a class of enzymes that facilitate oxidation-reduction reactions. The expression of ADH4 is notably high in the liver and is regulated by various transcription factors, with its activity being influenced by genetic variations that can affect susceptibility to alcoholism and other conditions (Pochareddy2010Identification; LI1998Function). Additionally, ADH4 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and alcohol dependence, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological processes (Luo2005ADH4; Li2024ADH4—a).

## Function
The ADH4 gene encodes a class II alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which is primarily involved in the metabolism of alcohols in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, including ethanol, to acetaldehyde, a crucial step in alcohol metabolism (LI1998Function; Pochareddy2010Identification). ADH4 is highly expressed in the liver, both in fetal and adult stages, and to a lesser extent in the gastrointestinal tract, stomach, and spleen (Pochareddy2010Identification). It contributes to approximately 30% of alcohol metabolism in the liver, with the remaining 70% accounted for by class I isozymes (Pochareddy2010Identification).

The enzyme has a Km for ethanol of 34 mM, indicating its role in ethanol metabolism, particularly under conditions of intoxication (LI1998Function). ADH4 is also capable of oxidizing and reducing long-chain aliphatic alcohols and aromatic aldehydes (Pochareddy2010Identification). The regulation of ADH4 expression involves multiple transcription factor binding sites in its promoter region, including members of the C/EBP and AP-1 families, which enhance its promoter activity and contribute to its high expression levels in the liver (LI1998Function). Variations in regulatory sequences, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can affect the levels of ADH4 enzyme and have been associated with the risk of alcoholism (Pochareddy2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADH4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ADH4 expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This downregulation is associated with a poorer prognosis, including lower overall survival, recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival in HCC patients. ADH4's expression levels are linked to tumor status, histologic grade, and immune cell infiltration, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker and its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Li2024ADH4—a; Zhang2022Alcohol).

ADH4 is also associated with alcohol and drug dependence, particularly in European Americans. Variations in the ADH4 gene, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to a genetic predisposition to these dependencies. The gene's role in alcohol metabolism, through its encoding of the π subunit of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, influences the risk of alcohol dependence by affecting the breakdown of alcohol (Luo2005ADH4).

Additionally, ADH4 has been studied in relation to cluster headaches, although findings are inconclusive. Some studies suggest an association between certain ADH4 polymorphisms and cluster headaches, but these results have not been consistently replicated (Fourier2016Screening; Papasavva2019Analysis).

## Interactions
ADH4, or alcohol dehydrogenase 4, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids that influence its expression and function. One significant interaction involves the microRNA hsa-miR-148a-3p, which promotes ADH4 expression by binding directly to its coding sequence. This interaction enhances mRNA stability through an AGO1-dependent mechanism, a process that is non-canonical as miRNAs typically repress gene expression (Luo2021A). The binding of miR-148a to ADH4 is facilitated by the protein AGO1, which is essential for the up-regulation of ADH4 expression. Experiments have shown that silencing AGO1 disrupts the ability of miR-148a to increase ADH4 expression, underscoring the importance of this protein in the regulatory pathway (Luo2021A).

In contrast, the expression of ADH4 can be downregulated by environmental pollutants such as TCDD (2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its partner ARNT. This interaction occurs via a genomic pathway where the AhR/ARNT complex binds to xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs) in DNA, leading to decreased ADH4 expression (Attignon2016Novel).
