# ADRA1A

## Overview
The ADRA1A gene encodes the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, a critical component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the sympathetic nervous system, where it mediates various physiological responses, including smooth muscle contraction, vasoconstriction, and myocardial inotropism, thereby playing a significant role in cardiovascular regulation and blood pressure maintenance (Patrao2007Cloning; Gu2006Association). The alpha-1A adrenergic receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional properties (Patrao2007Cloning). Functionally, the receptor is involved in calcium ion release upon catecholamine binding, influencing processes such as glycogenolysis and thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue (Johnston2016A; Rahbani2022ADRA1A–Gαq). The receptor's interactions with proteins like CRELD1α and Snapin further modulate its signaling pathways, impacting its physiological and pharmacological roles (Suzuki2007Snapin; Nishimune2010Identification). Variations in the ADRA1A gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as hypertension and hysterocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Peng2018Clinical; Gu2006Association).

## Structure
The ADRA1A gene encodes the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is characterized by a structure that includes seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs (Patrao2007Cloning). The primary structure of the ADRA1A protein consists of 466 amino acids (Patrao2007Cloning). The gene structure includes at least two exons, with one exon coding for the N-terminal region through the sixth transmembrane domain, and the other exon encoding the third extracellular loop, the seventh transmembrane domain, and most of the C-terminal region (Patrao2007Cloning).

The ADRA1A receptor undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several splice variants. Some of these variants code for functional receptor isoforms, while others are truncated and non-functional (Patrao2007Cloning). The wild-type ADRA1A_v1 transcript is the predominant variant in human tissues (Patrao2007Cloning). The receptor's structure includes conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the receptor's stability and function (Patrao2007Cloning). The presence of potential palmitoylation sites suggests post-translational modifications that may influence receptor localization and function (Patrao2007Cloning).

## Function
The ADRA1A gene encodes the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, which plays a crucial role in the sympathetic nervous system. This receptor is involved in mediating smooth muscle contraction, vasoconstriction, and myocardial inotropism, which are essential for regulating cardiovascular function and blood pressure (Patrao2007Cloning; Gu2006Association). The receptor is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it binds catecholamines like norepinephrine, leading to the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. This calcium release is critical for various physiological processes, including glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, as well as secretions from sweat glands (Johnston2016A).

In adipose tissue, ADRA1A is involved in thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT). It regulates the expression of genes involved in the futile creatine cycle, which enhances ATP turnover and thermogenesis, contributing to energy expenditure and metabolic processes (Rahbani2022ADRA1A–Gαq). The receptor's signaling pathways are crucial for adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold exposure, highlighting its role in maintaining energy balance and metabolic health (Rahbani2022ADRA1A–Gαq).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADRA1A gene, which encodes the α1A adrenergic receptor, have been associated with several clinical conditions. Variants in this gene have been linked to essential hypertension, particularly in specific populations such as the northern Han Chinese. The 2547G allele, in particular, has been associated with an increased risk of stage 2 hypertension, suggesting that it may influence blood pressure regulation through its effects on vascular tone (Gu2006Association). 

Polymorphisms in ADRA1A, such as rs1048101 (Arg347Cys), have been studied for their impact on cardiovascular measures. This polymorphism has been associated with variations in peripheral vascular resistance and heart rate reactivity, with different effects observed between males and females. The Cys allele has been linked to increased blood pressure in some populations, while the Arg allele is associated with hypertension in others (Matušková2022Adrenergic).

In addition to cardiovascular implications, ADRA1A expression levels have been studied in the context of hysterocarcinoma. Higher serum levels of ADRA1A are correlated with advanced stages of the disease and poorer prognosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and survival outcomes (Peng2018Clinical).

## Interactions
The ADRA1A gene encodes the α1A-adrenoceptor, which participates in various protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with CRELD1α, a protein that modulates the α1A-adrenoceptor's expression and phenotype. CRELD1α interacts with the α1A-adrenoceptor through its C-terminal region, specifically the sequence comprising amino acids 244-420, which includes the second FURIN domain, the Ca-EGF-like domain, two transmembrane domains, and the C-terminal tail. This interaction is crucial for the expression of the α1L-adrenoceptor phenotype, which is characterized by a low affinity for prazosin (Nishimune2010Identification).

Snapin is another protein that interacts with the α1A-adrenoceptor. This interaction enhances calcium influx through TRPC6 channels upon receptor activation. Snapin binds to the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the α1A-adrenoceptor, and this interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The presence of Snapin at the plasma membrane increases upon α1A-adrenoceptor activation, suggesting a functional coupling that augments calcium signaling (Suzuki2007Snapin).

The α1A-adrenoceptor also forms a heteromer with the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), which significantly alters its pharmacology. This heteromerization enhances β-arrestin recruitment, a process that is not as pronounced with the α1A-adrenoceptor alone. The interaction is demonstrated using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, indicating a stable complex formation that influences receptor signaling (Mustafa2012Identification).
