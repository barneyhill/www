# NUP98

## Overview
NUP98 is a gene that encodes the nucleoporin 98 and 96 precursor protein, which is a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This complex is essential for the regulation of macromolecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The NUP98 protein, characterized by its FG (phenylalanine-glycine) repeat domains, is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport and transcriptional regulation. It is synthesized as a 186-kDa precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing to produce two distinct proteins, NUP98 and NUP96, each playing unique roles within the NPC (Fontoura1999A; Chatel2012Domain). NUP98 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including mRNA export and transcriptional activation, and is known to interact with several nucleoporin subcomplexes and mRNA export factors (Pritchard1999RAE1; Griffis2003Nup98). Clinically, alterations in the NUP98 gene, such as mutations and translocations, are associated with hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Gough2011NUP98).

## Structure
NUP98 is a nucleoporin protein that plays a critical role in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). It is initially synthesized as a 186-kDa precursor protein, which undergoes proteolytic processing to generate two distinct proteins: NUP98 and NUP96 (Fontoura1999A). The NUP98 protein contains FG (phenylalanine-glycine) repeat domains, which are essential for its function in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Chatel2012Domain).

The C-terminal domain of NUP98 is responsible for autoproteolytic cleavage, a process crucial for its proper targeting to the NPC. This domain adopts a unique β sandwich-like fold, forming a loose, prism-shaped structure around a hydrophobic core, with α helices capping each end (Hodel2002The). The cleavage occurs between Phe863 and Ser864, facilitated by a conserved nucleophile, Ser864, and His862, which are critical for the proteolytic activity (Sun2008Structural; Hodel2002The).

NUP98 is expressed in two forms due to alternative mRNA splicing, resulting in a 98-kDa protein and a 190-kDa polyprotein, both of which undergo post-translational cleavage (Sun2008Structural). The protein can also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its function and interactions within the NPC.

## Function
NUP98 is a nucleoporin protein that plays a significant role in the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which regulates the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In healthy human cells, NUP98 is involved in Crm1-mediated nuclear protein export, acting as a cofactor that facilitates the export of NES-cargo through the NPC. It forms a complex with Crm1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner, promoting the translocation of NES-containing proteins into the cytoplasm (Oka2010The).

NUP98 also functions as a transcriptional regulator. It interacts with histone-modifying enzymes and binds to promoter regions of intranuclear genes, primarily acting as an activator for genes involved in development, cell signaling, and cell cycle processes (Franks2013The). NUP98's dynamic behavior allows it to affect cellular functions at off-pore sites, including transcription regulation (Franks2013The).

In the nucleoplasm, NUP98 interacts with genes that are highly expressed and enriched in developmental and cell-cycle functions, such as Cyclin B and Bub1, indicating its role in regulating genes crucial for development and cell-cycle progression (Kalverda2010Nucleoporins). NUP98's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper gene expression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and translocations involving the NUP98 gene are associated with various hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-bc), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Gough2011NUP98). NUP98 fusions are most prevalent in myeloid malignancies and are linked to poor prognosis in AML, often due to the overexpression of HOXA9 (Gough2011NUP98). These fusions result from chromosomal translocations involving NUP98 and over 30 partner genes, leading to changes in chromatin structure and gene expression that contribute to leukemogenesis (Michmerhuizen2020Mechanistic).

In pediatric AML, NUP98 fusions, such as NUP98-NSD1 and NUP98-KDM5A, are associated with distinct clinical outcomes. NUP98-NSD1 is linked to a lower complete remission rate and poor prognosis, often co-occurring with mutations like FLT3-ITD (Bertrums2023Comprehensive; Shiba2013NUP98‐NSD1). NUP98-KDM5A fusions are associated with unique immunophenotypes and chromosome 13 abnormalities, which can influence prognosis (Bertrums2023Comprehensive).

Therapeutic strategies targeting NUP98 fusions are being explored, including inhibitors of transcriptional and epigenetic machinery, as well as targeting cooperating mutations and signaling pathways (Michmerhuizen2020Mechanistic). These efforts aim to improve outcomes for patients with NUP98-rearranged malignancies.

## Interactions
NUP98 is a nucleoporin that participates in various interactions critical for its function in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). It localizes to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the NPC and interacts with distinct nucleoporin subcomplexes. NUP98 binds to the cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup88, part of the Nup214, Nup88, Nup62 subcomplex, and also interacts with the nuclear-oriented Nup160, 133, 107, 96 complex through direct binding to Nup96. These interactions require the autoproteolytic cleavage of the Nup98 C terminus (Griffis2003Nup98).

NUP98 also interacts with the mRNA export factor Rae1 through a GLEBS-like motif, which is essential for mRNA export processes. This interaction involves the binding of Rae1 to the NUP98 GLEBS motif, forming a complex that is crucial for mRNA export from the nucleus (Ren2010Structural; Pritchard1999RAE1).

In the context of leukemogenesis, NUP98 forms fusion proteins, such as NUP98-HOXA9, which interact with transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. These interactions are important for the transcriptional activation and oncogenic potential of the fusion proteins, contributing to the development of leukemia (Kasper1999CREB).
