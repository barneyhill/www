# RLN1

## Overview
The RLN1 gene encodes the hormone relaxin-1, a peptide hormone belonging to the relaxin family, which is structurally similar to insulin. Relaxin-1 is primarily recognized for its role in reproductive physiology, particularly in facilitating childbirth by promoting the relaxation of pelvic ligaments and the cervix. Beyond its reproductive functions, relaxin-1 is involved in collagen metabolism and tissue remodeling, exerting anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting collagen synthesis and promoting its breakdown. The hormone achieves its physiological effects through interaction with the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), a G-protein-coupled receptor, activating various intracellular signaling pathways such as cAMP, PI3K, and nitric oxide pathways. These pathways contribute to relaxin-1's vasodilatory and organ-protective effects, highlighting its significance in maintaining tissue integrity across multiple organ systems (Halls2015International; BATHGATE2006Physiology; Valkovic2019Understanding).

## Structure
The RLN1 gene encodes the relaxin-1 peptide, which is structurally similar to insulin. The primary structure of relaxin-1 consists of an A-chain and a B-chain linked by disulfide bonds, forming a heterodimeric peptide. The A-chain contains two α-helices, while the B-chain has one α-helix, which is crucial for receptor binding (BATHGATE2006Physiology). The B-chain includes a relaxin receptor binding motif, Arg-X-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile/Val, essential for interaction with the relaxin receptor (BATHGATE2006Physiology).

The tertiary structure of relaxin-1 is stabilized by these disulfide bonds, resulting in a compact, globular shape similar to insulin (BATHGATE2006Physiology). The mature peptide is formed by removing the signal peptide and C peptide, resulting in a structure with two disulfide bonds between the A- and B-chains and an additional intra-A-chain bond (Halls2015International). The crystal structure of human relaxin reveals a fold similar to insulin, with specific residues in the B-chain interacting with the RXFP3 receptor (Halls2015International).

The RLN1 gene structure includes two exons interrupted by an intron in the middle of the C-peptide sequence (Bathgate2013Relaxin). Splice variants of the RLN1 gene contain an extra exon within the known intron region, resulting in a frame shift and a truncated protein missing the A-chain sequence, likely rendering it non-functional (BATHGATE2006Physiology).

## Function
The RLN1 gene encodes the hormone relaxin-1, which plays a significant role in various physiological processes in humans. Relaxin-1 is primarily involved in reproductive functions, where it facilitates the remodeling of the reproductive tract during pregnancy by promoting the relaxation of pelvic ligaments and the cervix, aiding in childbirth (Halls2015International; Hsu2002Activation). Beyond reproduction, relaxin-1 is crucial in collagen metabolism and tissue remodeling. It inhibits collagen biosynthesis and promotes collagen breakdown, which is essential in preventing fibrosis in tissues such as the heart, lungs, and skin (Bathgate2003Relaxin:).

Relaxin-1 exerts its effects by binding to the G-protein-coupled receptor RXFP1, activating several intracellular signaling pathways, including cAMP, PI3K, and nitric oxide (NO) pathways. These pathways contribute to its vasodilatory, anti-fibrotic, and organ-protective effects (Valkovic2019Understanding). In the cardiovascular system, relaxin-1 enhances arterial compliance and protects against endothelial dysfunction, thereby improving tissue perfusion and reducing oxidative stress (Halls2015International). Relaxin-1's diverse roles highlight its importance in maintaining tissue integrity and function across various organ systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RLN1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of reproductive health, RLN1 deficiency in mice leads to underdeveloped mammary glands and prolonged parturition due to the inability of the interpubic ligament to relax, which is associated with increased collagen content in relaxin-dependent reproductive organs (Agoulnik2005Mouse). In males, RLN1 deficiency results in increased collagen content in the testis and prostate, leading to increased cell apoptosis and decreased fertility (Agoulnik2005Mouse).

RLN1 is also involved in lung function, where its deficiency in mice leads to progressive, age-related increases in lung weight, collagen content, and distorted alveolar structure, contributing to altered lung function. Treatment with human relaxin 2 has been shown to reverse lung collagen deposition, indicating RLN1's role in inhibiting fibrosis (Ganguly2007Candidate).

In cancer, RLN1 expression is associated with prostate cancer progression. Increased relaxin expression is linked to more aggressive prostate cancer and may contribute to cancer recurrence. Relaxin promotes cancer cell invasion, proliferation, and adhesion, while its suppression leads to increased apoptosis and reduced invasiveness of prostate cancer cells (Feng2007Relaxin). Genetic alterations in RLN1 have been observed in various cancers, although specific mutations are not commonly reported (Thanasupawat2019Emerging).

## Interactions
Relaxin 1 (RLN1) interacts with several proteins and signaling pathways, primarily through its receptor, the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). RXFP1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates the effects of relaxin by activating various signaling pathways, including cAMP production and the activation of ERK1/2, tyrosine kinases, and nitric oxide signaling (Thanasupawat2019Emerging). The interaction between RLN1 and RXFP1 involves the receptor's large extracellular domain, which includes the LDLa module and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs (Thanasupawat2019Emerging).

RLN1 also influences collagen metabolism by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). It alters MMP expression in various cell types, including human endometrial and rabbit fibrocartilagenous cells, and affects MMP and TIMP expression in equine ovarian stromal cells (Bathgate2003Relaxin:). RLN1 interacts with growth factors and cytokines, inhibiting collagen stimulation by transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-1beta, while synergistically decreasing collagen synthesis with interferon-gamma (IFN-g) (Bathgate2003Relaxin:).

These interactions highlight RLN1's role in extracellular matrix remodeling and its potential implications in fibrotic conditions and cancer therapy (Bathgate2003Relaxin:; Thanasupawat2019Emerging).
