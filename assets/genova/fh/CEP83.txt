# CEP83

## Overview
CEP83 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 83, a crucial component involved in the formation and function of cilia, which are essential microtubule-based organelles for cellular signaling and homeostasis. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and is specifically localized at the distal appendages of the mother centriole. It plays a pivotal role in anchoring membrane vesicles necessary for the initiation of primary cilia assembly and is essential for recruiting other distal appendage proteins, such as CEP89, CEP164, and LRRC45, which are critical for ciliogenesis (Lo2019Phosphorylation; Veldman2021Beyond). Phosphorylation of centrosomal protein 83 by tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a key regulatory step in cilia initiation, facilitating the removal of CP110 and promoting the docking of ciliary vesicles (Lo2019Phosphorylation). Mutations in CEP83 are associated with ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis, underscoring its importance in maintaining healthy ciliary function (Lo2019Phosphorylation; Veldman2021Beyond).

## Function
CEP83, also known as centrosomal protein 83, is a critical component in the process of ciliogenesis, which is the formation of cilia, a microtubule-based organelle important for cellular signaling and homeostasis. It is localized at the distal appendages of the mother centriole, where it plays a pivotal role in anchoring membrane vesicles necessary for the initiation of primary cilia assembly (Lo2019Phosphorylation; Veldman2021Beyond). CEP83 is essential for the recruitment of other distal appendage proteins (DAPs) such as CEP89, CEP164, and LRRC45, which are crucial for the proper assembly of the distal appendages and subsequent ciliogenesis (Lo2019Phosphorylation; Veldman2021Beyond).

Phosphorylation of CEP83 by the kinase TTBK2 is necessary for cilia initiation, as it regulates the removal of CP110, a protein that must be removed for cilia to form, and promotes the docking of ciliary vesicles (Lo2019Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation is a critical step in the initiation of ciliogenesis, facilitating the assembly of the transition zone by recruiting proteins such as TCTN2 and NPHP1 (Lo2019Phosphorylation). Mutations in CEP83 are associated with ciliopathies, such as infantile nephronophthisis, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy ciliary function (Lo2019Phosphorylation; Veldman2021Beyond).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP83 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, primarily affecting the kidneys and other organs. Nephronophthisis, a progressive kidney disorder, is one of the main conditions associated with CEP83 mutations. This disease often leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in early childhood, characterized by symptoms such as microcystic tubular dilatations, glomerular cysts, and interstitial fibrosis (Srivastava2015Nephronophthisis; Mansour2021The). 

Beyond renal manifestations, CEP83 mutations can also result in neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability and hydrocephalus, as well as other systemic issues like periportal liver fibrosis and retinal dystrophy (Mansour2021The; Veldman2021Beyond). Some patients with CEP83 mutations exhibit retinal dystrophy without kidney dysfunction, expanding the clinical spectrum of CEP83-related disorders (Veldman2021Beyond).

The gene's role in ciliogenesis is crucial, and disruptions in its function can impair ciliary assembly, leading to a range of clinical manifestations associated with ciliopathies (Mansour2021The). Alterations in CEP83 expression or its interactions with other proteins, such as CEP164 and IFT20, can further exacerbate these conditions (Mansour2021The).

## Interactions
CEP83 is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis by participating in various protein interactions. It is a component of the distal appendages of the mother centriole and is essential for the recruitment of other distal appendage proteins, such as CEP89, SCLT1, FBF1, and CEP164, to the basal body and/or the transition zone (Tsang2013CP110). CEP83 interacts with CEP90, which is part of a complex with FOPNL and OFD1, to facilitate the assembly of centriolar distal appendages. This interaction is crucial for basal body anchoring and the proper formation of primary cilia (Le2022The; Le2021The).

CEP83 is also a substrate of tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2), which phosphorylates it during ciliogenesis. This phosphorylation is important for the transition from cilia initiation to elongation, highlighting the regulatory role of CEP83 in cilium assembly (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation). The interactions of CEP83 with these proteins and its phosphorylation by TTBK2 underscore its integral role in the complex network of proteins that regulate ciliogenesis and centrosome function.
