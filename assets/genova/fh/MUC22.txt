# MUC22

## Overview
MUC22 is a gene that encodes the protein mucin 22, a membrane-associated mucin involved in maintaining the integrity and function of mucosal surfaces. Mucin 22 is characterized as a single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain, which includes tandem repeats that undergo extensive O-linked glycosylation. This glycosylation is crucial for its hydrophilic and antiadhesive properties, contributing to the formation of a protective barrier on epithelial surfaces. The protein's structure, which includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail with potential phosphorylation sites, suggests a role in intracellular signaling pathways, possibly affecting cell adhesion and immune response modulation. MUC22 is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the ocular surface, and is implicated in immune defense mechanisms and the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis (Nason2021Display; Fini2020Membraneassociated).

## Structure
The human MUC22 protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. It begins with an N-terminal signal peptide consisting of 26 amino acids, which facilitates its insertion into the membrane (Fini2020Membraneassociated). The extracellular domain (ED) of MUC22 contains 124 non-identical tandem repeats of 10 amino acids each, which are predicted to undergo extensive O-linked glycosylation, a common post-translational modification in mucins that contributes to their hydrophilic and antiadhesive properties (Fini2020Membraneassociated).

Following the ED, MUC22 features an alpha-helical transmembrane domain composed of 21 amino acids, anchoring the protein to the cell membrane (Fini2020Membraneassociated). The cytoplasmic tail (CT) of MUC22 is 92 amino acids long and is rich in glycine and histidine residues. This region is predicted to have phosphorylation sites for tyrosine and serine, with potential phosphorylation by EGFR and protein kinase A family members, respectively (Fini2020Membraneassociated).

MUC22 lacks the SEA domain commonly found in other mucins but shares a conserved Epiglycanin_C domain with MUC21, suggesting an evolutionary relationship (Pelaseyed2020Membrane; Fini2020Membraneassociated). The protein's structure is similar to single-pass transmembrane immune receptors, with a large extracellular subunit and a smaller transmembrane and cytoplasmic subunit (Fini2020Membraneassociated).

## Function
MUC22 is a membrane-associated mucin that plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and function of mucosal surfaces. It is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the ocular surface, where it contributes to the mucosal glycocalyx, a protective barrier that shields epithelial cells from pathogens and mechanical stress (MartinezCarrasco2021Membraneassociated; Fini2020Membraneassociated). MUC22 is involved in the secretion processes of the lacrimal gland, which is crucial for tear film stability and ocular surface health (Fini2020Membraneassociated).

The protein structure of MUC22 includes an N-terminal signal peptide, tandem repeats, and a transmembrane domain, with extensive O-linked glycosylation that may influence its function (Fini2020Membraneassociated). The cytoplasmic tail of MUC22 contains phosphorylation sites that are predicted to interact with the EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase family, suggesting a role in intracellular signaling pathways that could affect cell adhesion and immune response modulation (Fini2020Membraneassociated).

MUC22's glycosylation patterns and interactions with bacterial adhesins indicate its involvement in immune defense mechanisms, potentially influencing the recognition and clearance of pathogens (Nason2021Display). These functions highlight MUC22's importance in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and protecting mucosal surfaces.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MUC22 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of lung cancer and respiratory diseases. In lung cancer, MUC22 expression is differentially regulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). MUC22 is downregulated in LUSC and upregulated in LUAD, with these changes associated with epigenetic modifications such as promoter hypermethylation in LUSC and hypomethylation in LUAD. These expression patterns are linked to cancer progression and patient prognosis, with low MUC22 expression in LUSC and high expression in LUAD associated with poor overall survival in early-stage cancer patients (Lin2021Differential).

MUC22 variants have also been associated with mild COVID-19 symptoms, particularly in super elderly individuals. Certain MUC22 gene variants are linked to higher expression of miR-6891, which targets the ORF3a gene of SARS-CoV-2, potentially reducing symptom severity. These variants are more frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, suggesting a protective role against severe outcomes (Castelli2022MUC22).

Additionally, MUC22 polymorphisms have been associated with diffuse panbronchiolitis and asthma, indicating its role in respiratory diseases beyond cancer (Castelli2022MUC22).
