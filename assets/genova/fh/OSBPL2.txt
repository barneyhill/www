# OSBPL2

## Overview
The OSBPL2 gene encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-like 2 (ORP2), a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family, which is involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular lipid transport. This protein is characterized by its oxysterol-binding domain (ORD) and is classified as a "short" oxysterol-binding protein-related protein (ORP) due to the absence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which distinguishes it from other family members (Zhou2014A; Jaworski2001A). ORP2 plays a critical role in regulating lipid droplet dynamics, cholesterol homeostasis, and cellular signaling pathways, including interactions with the Akt and Wnt signaling pathways (Wang2020OSBPL2; Kentala2018OSBPrelated). Mutations in OSBPL2 are linked to autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its importance in auditory function and cellular lipid regulation (Yao2019OSBPL2disrupted; Thoenes2015OSBPL2).

## Structure
The OSBPL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the oxysterol-binding protein family, characterized by the presence of an oxysterol-binding domain (ORD) but notably lacking a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is present in most other family members (Jaworski2001A). The OSBPL2 protein is classified as a "short" oxysterol-binding protein-related protein (ORP) due to the absence of the PH domain (Zhou2014A). 

The primary structure of OSBPL2 includes a peptide length of 480 amino acids and a molecular mass of 55.2 kDa (Jaworski2001A). The protein contains an FFAT motif, which targets the endoplasmic reticulum, and the ORD, which is crucial for binding and transferring sterols, oxysterols, and phosphoinositides (Shi2022Mutations). 

Alternative splicing of OSBPL2 results in a variant transcript that omits exon 3, leading to the absence of 12 amino acids N-terminal to the OSBP domain, although this does not affect the oxysterol-binding domain itself (Jaworski2001A). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ciliogenesis and phosphoinositide homeostasis (Shi2022Mutations).

## Function
The OSBPL2 gene encodes the oxysterol-binding protein-like 2 (ORP2), which is a crucial component in lipid metabolism and intracellular lipid transport. In healthy human cells, OSBPL2 is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet (LD) dynamics and lipolysis, essential processes for energy metabolism. It facilitates the binding of COPB1 to adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), mediating the transport of ATGL from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the surface of LDs, which is necessary for the breakdown of triacylglycerols (TAGs) stored in LDs (Wang2020OSBPL2).

OSBPL2 also plays a role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by interacting with ATIC to regulate AMPK activity, which is crucial for controlling cholesterol biosynthesis. This interaction prevents excessive cholesterol accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby protecting against mitochondrial damage (Wang2019Deletion).

The protein is active in the ER and Golgi apparatus, influencing membrane dynamics and signaling pathways. It is also involved in establishing ER-LD membrane contacts, which are critical for lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, thus maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and energy balance (Wang2020OSBPL2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OSBPL2 gene are associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA67). These mutations can lead to progressive sensorineural hearing loss, often beginning in the early second decade of life and initially affecting high frequencies before progressing to severe or profound levels (Xing2015Identification; Thoenes2015OSBPL2). The hearing loss is linked to defects in the stereocilia of inner and outer hair cells in the cochlea, where OSBPL2 is expressed (Thoenes2015OSBPL2).

Research has shown that OSBPL2 mutations can disrupt cellular lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis, which are crucial for normal auditory function. In a study using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in pigs, OSBPL2 disruption led to progressive hearing loss and hypercholesterolemia, suggesting a link between auditory dysfunction and lipid metabolism disorders (Yao2019OSBPL2disrupted).

OSBPL2 is also involved in the regulation of ciliary function and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways. Deficiency in OSBPL2 can lead to ciliary defects and impaired Shh signaling, contributing to abnormal cochlear development and hearing loss (Shi2022Mutations). These findings highlight the gene's role in maintaining auditory cell structure and function, with mutations leading to significant clinical implications.

## Interactions
OSBPL2, also known as ORP2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism and cellular processes. It interacts with COPB1, a subunit of the COPI coat complex, which is essential for the transport of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) from the endoplasmic reticulum to lipid droplets. This interaction is vital for lipid droplet lipolysis, as OSBPL2 facilitates the proper localization and function of ATGL on lipid droplets (Wang2020OSBPL2).

OSBPL2 also interacts with the Akt signaling pathway. It forms a complex with Cdc37 and Hsp90, which are key controllers of Akt activity. This interaction promotes Akt activation, influencing cellular energy metabolism, glucose uptake, and glycogen synthesis (Kentala2018OSBPrelated).

In addition, OSBPL2 binds to β-catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining β-catenin levels, preventing its degradation, and promoting its translocation into the nucleus. This process is important for the transcription of genes involved in adipogenic differentiation (Wang2021Oxysterolbinding). These interactions highlight OSBPL2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and lipid metabolism.
