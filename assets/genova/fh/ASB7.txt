# ASB7

## Overview
ASB7 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 7 protein, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by targeting specific proteins for degradation. The ASB7 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including eight ankyrin repeats and a SOCS box, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function in cellular processes. It is involved in regulating spindle dynamics and maintaining genome integrity during cell division, as well as responding to endoplasmic reticulum stress. ASB7's activity is crucial for proper chromosome alignment and segregation, and its dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and age-related fertility issues (Uematsu2016ASB7; Anasa2018Identification; Liu2020ASB7).

## Structure
The ASB7 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat and SOCS box domains. It contains eight ankyrin (ANK) repeats, which form the secondary structure of the protein. These repeats fold into a canonical helix-loop-helix structure with a hairpin loop projecting at a 90° angle, creating an L-shaped cross-section. The tertiary structure of ASB7 is elongated, with the ANK repeats stacking together to form a substrate binding groove through the concave inner helix and hairpin loops of ANK3-6. This groove is approximately 30 Å long and 9 Å wide, lined with hydrophobic residues at the bottom and mixed-charge residues on the sides (Zhou2024Molecular).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the SOCS box with Elongin B and Elongin C, forming a global structure at the C-terminus of ASB7. The SOCS box folds into three conserved helices that contact Elongin C to form a four-helix bundle associated with the C-terminus of Elongin B (Zhou2024Molecular). ASB7's interaction with its substrates is mediated by specific residues, such as Arg185, Thr151, Ser147, and Phe182, which are critical for binding to degrons (Zhou2024Molecular). The protein is involved in targeting substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, with post-translational modifications like ubiquitination influencing its stability and function (Anasa2018Identification).

## Function
ASB7 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating spindle dynamics and maintaining genome integrity in healthy human cells. The ASB7 protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting the protein DDA3 for proteasomal degradation. This process is crucial for proper cell division, as it ensures the dynamic regulation of the mitotic spindle, which is necessary for the correct distribution of replicated chromosomes into daughter cells (Uematsu2016ASB7). 

ASB7's interaction with DDA3 is essential for stabilizing microtubules and preventing abnormal poleward microtubule flux during the M phase of cell division. This regulation is vital for maintaining proper tension and orientation of spindle microtubules, ensuring normal chromosome alignment and segregation (Uematsu2016ASB7). Knockdown of ASB7 results in decreased microtubule polymerization and an increased proportion of cells with unaligned chromosomes, highlighting its role in maintaining genome integrity (Uematsu2016ASB7).

ASB7 is also involved in the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, where it is upregulated and interacts with ER stress transcription factors such as ATF4, suggesting a role in maintaining protein homeostasis (Anasa2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ASB7 gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, ASB7 plays a role in maintaining proper spindle dynamics and genome integrity. Knockdown of ASB7 leads to increased unaligned chromosomes and affects microtubule polymerization, suggesting its importance in chromosome segregation during cell division. This indicates that ASB7 may be a target in cancer research due to its role in modulating spindle dynamics and maintaining genome stability (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ASB7 is associated with a better prognosis. Lower expression levels of ASB7, along with other ASB genes, are observed in high-risk KIRC patients, suggesting a potential protective role. The study highlights that higher expression levels of ASB7 correlate with improved patient outcomes, making it a potential predictive marker for KIRC prognosis (Xie2023A).

ASB7's role in oocyte maturation is also significant, as its expression decreases with maternal age, contributing to meiotic defects in aged oocytes. Overexpression of ASB7 in aged oocytes can partially rescue these defects, indicating its potential in addressing age-related fertility issues (Liu2020ASB7).

## Interactions
ASB7 interacts with several proteins as part of its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It functions as a substrate receptor within the CRL5 ubiquitin ligase complex, which includes Elongin B, Elongin C, Cul5, and Rbx2 subunits (Zhou2024Molecular). ASB7 contains eight ankyrin (ANK) repeats and C-terminal BC and Cul5 boxes that facilitate binding with Elongin B/C and Cul5, respectively (Zhou2024Molecular). The interaction with Cul5 is crucial for ASB7's function in regulating the turnover of its substrates, such as DDA3 (Uematsu2016ASB7).

ASB7 directly binds to degrons from various substrate proteins, including CLIP2, GIGYF1, CCDC17, CEP152, and LZTS1, forming a stable quaternary complex with these degrons (Zhou2024Molecular). The ANK3-8 repeats of ASB7 are essential for degron binding, while ANK1-2 are not (Zhou2024Molecular). The interaction with the LZTS1-degron involves specific residues such as Arg185, Thr151, Ser147, and Phe182, which are crucial for binding affinity (Zhou2024Molecular). ASB7 also targets DDA3 for proteasomal degradation, a process that is modulated by microtubules (Uematsu2016ASB7).
