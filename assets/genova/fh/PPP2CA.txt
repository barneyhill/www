# PPP2CA

## Overview
The PPP2CA gene encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular processes. As a key component of the PP2A holoenzyme, the protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha plays a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle progression, signal transduction pathways, and the DNA damage response. The PP2A holoenzyme is a heterotrimeric complex that includes a scaffolding subunit and a regulatory subunit, which together determine substrate specificity and cellular localization (Janssens2008PP2A). The catalytic activity of the protein is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as methylation and phosphorylation, which influence its assembly and function (Janssens2008PP2A). Mutations in the PPP2CA gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer susceptibility, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Reynhout2019De; Huang2017Genetic).

## Structure
The PPP2CA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase. The primary structure of the PPP2CA protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the catalytic subunit of PP2A. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of the PPP family of phosphatases, with an α/β fold (Xing2006Structure).

The tertiary structure of the PPP2CA protein involves the 3D folding necessary for its function, including the presence of two manganese atoms at the active site, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Xing2006Structure). The quaternary structure of PP2A involves its assembly into a heterotrimeric complex with a scaffolding subunit and a regulatory B-type subunit, which determines substrate specificity and localization (Janssens2008PP2A).

The PP2A catalytic subunit interacts with the scaffolding subunit through HEAT repeats, forming a horseshoe-shaped structure that is essential for its function (Xing2006Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as methylation and phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the activity and assembly of the PP2A holoenzyme (Janssens2008PP2A).

## Function
The PPP2CA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular processes. PP2A plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation by maintaining the M-phase-promoting factor (MPF) in its inactive form, thus negatively regulating entry into mitosis. It achieves this by inhibiting Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) and Wee1 kinase, and counteracting Plx1 kinase, which are involved in the phosphorylation and activation of Cdc2, a component of MPF (JANSSENS2001Protein).

PP2A is also involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, where it stabilizes the β-catenin-E-cadherin complex at the plasma membrane and is part of a cytoplasmic complex that regulates β-catenin degradation. This regulation is crucial for controlling the accumulation of β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes (JANSSENS2001Protein).

In addition to its role in cell cycle and signaling pathways, PP2A is implicated in the DNA-damage response, where it interacts with proteins like cyclin G to contribute to cell cycle arrest and potentially enhance apoptosis (JANSSENS2001Protein). PP2A's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation, which affect its holoenzyme composition and catalytic activity (JANSSENS2001Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP2CA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include syndromic intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD), often accompanied by severe language delay, hypotonia, epilepsy, and brain abnormalities such as corpus callosum hypoplasia and dilated ventricles. Behavioral problems, including autism spectrum disorders, are also common among affected individuals (Reynhout2019De; Verbinnen2021Protein). 

The clinical presentation of PPP2CA-related disorders is heterogeneous, with some cases exhibiting mild dysmorphic facial features and seizures, while others show more severe intellectual and developmental impairments. Specific mutations, such as p.Cys196Arg, have been linked to partial loss of function, affecting the enzyme's catalytic activity and binding to subunits, contributing to the clinical phenotype of developmental disorders, autism, and epilepsy (Verbinnen2022Clinical).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, alterations in PPP2CA expression have been implicated in cancer susceptibility. For instance, certain genetic variants in PPP2CA are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, potentially due to decreased expression of PPP2CA mRNA in tumor tissues (Huang2017Genetic).

## Interactions
PPP2CA, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is involved in a complex network of protein interactions that regulate various cellular processes. It forms part of the PP2A holoenzyme, which includes a scaffolding A subunit and a regulatory B subunit, creating a trimeric complex essential for its function (Goudreault2009A). PPP2CA interacts with several regulatory subunits, such as B55, B56, and B00, which confer substrate specificity and control phosphatase activity (Reynhout2019De).

PPP2CA also associates with proteins like alpha4 and the CCT chaperonin complex, which are involved in stabilizing the catalytic subunit in a latent form (Goudreault2009A; Reynhout2019De). Under glucotoxic conditions, PPP2CA interacts with proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling, such as Rac1, RhoA, and Rab5c, which are crucial for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells (Zhang2016Quantitative).

Mutations in PPP2CA can disrupt its interactions with regulatory subunits, leading to altered phosphatase activity and potential implications for neurodevelopmental disorders (Reynhout2019De). These interactions highlight the critical role of PPP2CA in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various signaling pathways.
