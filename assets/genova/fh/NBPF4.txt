# NBPF4

## Overview
Neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 4 (NBPF4) is a gene that encodes the NBPF member 4 protein, which is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family. This family is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cellular metabolism. The NBPF member 4 protein is implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through its interactions with key proteins such as enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, and its modulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (Chen2021NBPF4). Additionally, NBPF4 has been associated with sensorineural hereditary hearing loss and male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance in diverse pathological conditions (Haraksingh2014Exome; Stouffs2012Array).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
NBPF4 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NBPF4 expression is significantly lower in cancerous cell lines compared to controls. Overexpression of NBPF4 in CRC cell lines, such as HCT116, results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. Conversely, silencing NBPF4 in SW620 cells enhances these cancerous behaviors. NBPF4 also influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, increasing E-cadherin and decreasing N-cadherin and vimentin levels, which indicates suppression of EMT and tumor progression (Chen2021NBPF4).

In sensorineural hereditary hearing loss (SNHL), NBPF4 has been identified as significantly associated with the condition through a genome-wide CNV association study. The gene is located within a region overlapping two deafness-associated genomic regions, DFNB82 and DFNB32 (Haraksingh2014Exome).

NBPF4 is also mentioned in the context of male infertility, where a deletion encompassing the gene was detected in a patient with complete meiotic arrest. However, due to the redundancy within the NBPF gene family, a deletion of one copy is considered less likely to significantly impact fertility (Stouffs2012Array).

## Interactions
NBPF4 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. It has been shown to interact with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation. This interaction is crucial for regulating the stability of EZH2 mRNA in a ZFP36-dependent manner, impacting the transcription of ETFA, a gene involved in cellular metabolism (Chen2021NBPF4).

NBPF4 also influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by modulating the levels of EMT markers. Overexpression of NBPF4 increases E-cadherin levels while decreasing N-cadherin and vimentin levels, indicating its role in inhibiting EMT and thus reducing tumor metastasis (Chen2021NBPF4).

Additionally, NBPF4 and EZH2 are both targets of miR-17-3p, which can bind and regulate their expression. This interaction suggests a complex regulatory network where miR-17-3p influences tumorigenesis through ETFA methylation (Chen2021NBPF4). These interactions highlight NBPF4's role in modulating key pathways involved in CRC progression and metastasis.
