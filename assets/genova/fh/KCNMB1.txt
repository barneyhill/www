# KCNMB1

## Overview
The KCNMB1 gene encodes the potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M regulatory beta subunit 1, a critical component of the large-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of vascular tone and smooth muscle contraction. The protein encoded by KCNMB1, known as the β1 subunit, modulates the functional properties of BK channels by enhancing their sensitivity to calcium and influencing their activation and deactivation kinetics (FernándezFernández2004Gainoffunction; Toro2006KCNMB1). This regulatory subunit is involved in the trafficking and surface expression of BK channels, impacting their physiological roles in arterial and bronchial smooth muscle function (Toro2006KCNMB1). Genetic variations in KCNMB1 have been linked to conditions such as hypertension and asthma, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular and respiratory health (Seibold2008An; Sentí2005Protective).

## Function
The KCNMB1 gene encodes the β1 subunit of the large-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels, which are crucial for regulating various physiological processes in healthy human cells. These channels are composed of a pore-forming α subunit and modulatory β subunits, with β1 playing a significant role in modulating the channel's functional properties, such as voltage and calcium sensitivities, as well as activation and deactivation kinetics (Toro2006KCNMB1).

In smooth muscle cells, the β1 subunit enhances the BK channel's sensitivity to calcium, facilitating a negative-feedback mechanism that prevents excessive calcium influx and smooth muscle contraction. This process is essential for controlling vascular tone and blood pressure (FernándezFernández2004Gainoffunction). The β1 subunit also regulates the surface expression of the BK channels through endocytic trafficking signals, influencing their removal from the plasma membrane and thus modulating their surface expression levels (Toro2006KCNMB1).

The KCNMB1 gene's role extends to the regulation of arterial and bronchial smooth muscle contraction, with genetic variations affecting pulmonary function and conditions like asthma (Seibold2008An). The β1 subunit's activity is modulated by sex hormones, which can upregulate BK channel activity, providing protective effects against conditions such as asthma and hypertension (Seibold2008An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNMB1 gene, which encodes the β1-subunit of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel, have significant clinical implications. The E65K gain-of-function mutation in KCNMB1 is associated with a lower prevalence of diastolic hypertension. This mutation enhances the BK channel's response to calcium, leading to increased channel activity and a protective effect against severe diastolic hypertension (FernándezFernández2004Gainoffunction; Sentí2005Protective). The protective effect is particularly notable in aging women, where it is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke (Sentí2005Protective).

Conversely, the absence of the BK-β1 subunit, as observed in Kcnmb1 knockout mice, results in hypertension due to aldosteronism and impaired potassium secretion. This condition is exacerbated by a high potassium diet, highlighting the role of KCNMB1 in maintaining potassium balance and blood pressure regulation (Grimm2009Hypertension). Additionally, polymorphisms in KCNMB1 can influence the efficacy of antihypertensive medications, affecting treatment outcomes in patients with hypertension (Beitelshees2007KCNMB1). These findings underscore the gene's importance in cardiovascular health and its potential as a target for personalized medical interventions.

## Interactions
KCNMB1, a regulatory subunit of the large conductance voltage- and calcium-gated potassium (BK) channel, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function. It is known to enhance the calcium sensitivity of BK channels, which is crucial for regulating myocyte contractility (North2019Proteomics). The protein is predominantly located intracellularly, suggesting potential interactions with other intracellular proteins. High-confidence interactions have been identified with proteins such as the trifunctional enzyme beta subunit (Hadhb), murinoglobulin-1, MKIAA0866, and transgelin-2. Notably, KCNMB1 shows significant co-localization with Hadhb, a protein involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, indicating possible novel roles beyond BK channel regulation (North2019Proteomics).

KCNMB1 also plays a role in the trafficking and surface expression of BK channels. It regulates the surface expression of the hSlo channel, a component of BK channels, by promoting its internalization into endosomal compartments. This internalization is facilitated by endocytic trafficking signals within KCNMB1, which are crucial for modulating the channel's surface expression and function (Toro2006KCNMB1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of KCNMB1 in cellular processes and its potential impact on physiological functions.
