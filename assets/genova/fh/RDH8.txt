# RDH8

## Overview
The RDH8 gene encodes the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 8, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. This enzyme is integral to the visual cycle, particularly within the photoreceptor cells of the retina, where it facilitates the conversion of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol. This conversion is a critical step in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, an essential component of the visual pigment rhodopsin (Zampatti2023A; Hädicke2021Membrane). Retinol dehydrogenase 8 is hypothesized to associate with membranes through palmitoylated cysteines, which are conserved across mammals, underscoring its role in the visual cycle (Hädicke2021Membrane). The enzyme's function is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic bis-retinoids, such as A2E, thereby protecting against retinal degeneration (Zampatti2023A). Mutations in the RDH8 gene have been linked to retinal diseases, including autosomal recessive Stargardt macular dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Zampatti2023A).

## Function
The RDH8 gene encodes the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 8, which plays a crucial role in the visual cycle within photoreceptor cells of the retina. This enzyme is involved in the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol, a key step in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, an essential component of rhodopsin (Zampatti2023A; Hädicke2021Membrane). RDH8 is located in the outer segments of photoreceptors, where it facilitates the clearance of all-trans-retinal, preventing the accumulation of toxic bis-retinoids such as A2E, which can lead to retinal degeneration (Zampatti2023A).

The enzyme's activity is particularly important in cones, where it supports the oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal, necessary for visual pigment regeneration and dark adaptation (Zampatti2023A). RDH8 is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family and is hypothesized to bind to membranes through palmitoylated cysteines in its C-terminus, which are conserved among mammals (Hädicke2021Membrane). This membrane association is essential for its function in the visual cycle, facilitating the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol, a critical step in rhodopsin regeneration (Hädicke2021Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RDH8 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt macular dystrophy, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive vision loss due to retinal degeneration. A specific splicing variant, c.262+1G>A, has been identified as pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. This mutation leads to abnormal splicing, resulting in the partial retention of intron 2, which causes an insertion of nine amino acids and a premature stop codon. This disrupts the normal function of RDH8, contributing to the accumulation of toxic bis-retinoids in the retina, similar to the effects seen with ABCA4 mutations (Zampatti2023A).

The RDH8 gene is primarily expressed in the retina, where it plays a crucial role in the visual cycle by reducing all-trans-retinal in photoreceptors. Dysfunction in RDH8 can lead to the accumulation of lipofuscin fluorophores, such as A2E, in the retinal pigment epithelium, which is associated with retinal degeneration and photoreceptor cell death (Zampatti2023A). This is the first reported human phenotype linked to RDH8 mutations, highlighting the gene's potential role in retinal diseases (Zampatti2023A).

## Interactions
The RDH8 protein, encoded by the RDH8 gene, plays a significant role in the visual cycle by interacting with other proteins to facilitate retinoid metabolism. One of its key interactions is with the ATP-binding cassette transporter 4 (ABCA4). This interaction is crucial for the translocation of all-trans-retinal from the inside to the outside of photoreceptor outer segment discs, aiding in the clearance of all-trans-retinal, a byproduct of the visual cycle (Zampatti2023A). In the absence of RDH8, as observed in Rdh8-/- mice, there is an accumulation of all-trans-retinal, leading to the formation of bis-retinoids, which can contribute to photoreceptor degeneration (Zampatti2023A).

The membrane binding properties of RDH8 are also significant for its function. The C-terminal segment of RDH8 contains an amphipathic α-helix that facilitates its association with lipid membranes. This interaction is enhanced by palmitoylation, which stabilizes the membrane association by anchoring the C-terminal segment into the membrane (Hädicke2021Membrane). These structural features are crucial for RDH8's interaction with photoreceptor membranes, although specific protein-protein interactions beyond ABCA4 are not detailed in the provided context.
