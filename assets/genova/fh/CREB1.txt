# CREB1

## Overview
CREB1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the leucine zipper family of DNA-binding proteins. The protein product, cAMP responsive element binding protein 1, plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression in response to a variety of cellular signals, including hormonal and neuronal stimuli. As a transcription factor, it is involved in numerous cellular processes such as glucose homeostasis, cell survival, and synaptic plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory (Mayr2001Transcriptional; Avgan2017A). CREB1 is activated through phosphorylation, which facilitates its interaction with coactivators like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, thereby modulating the transcription of target genes (Zhang2005Genomewide). The gene's activity is finely tuned by various signaling pathways, allowing it to function as both an activator and repressor depending on the cellular context (Euskirchen2004CREB).

## Function
CREB1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to various cellular signals, including hormonal and neuronal stimuli. It is activated by phosphorylation, particularly at serine residue 133, which is crucial for its function in gene expression (Mayr2001Transcriptional; Zhang2005Genomewide). This phosphorylation event facilitates the recruitment of coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300, which are essential for the activation of target genes (Zhang2005Genomewide).

CREB1 is involved in numerous cellular processes, including glucose homeostasis, cell survival, and synaptic plasticity, which is vital for learning and memory (Mayr2001Transcriptional; Avgan2017A). It binds to cAMP response elements (CREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, functioning as both an activator and repressor depending on the context and interacting factors (Euskirchen2004CREB). CREB1's activity is modulated by different signals, allowing for specific responses to various stimuli, which is crucial for its role in cognitive functions and memory formation (Mayr2001Transcriptional; Avgan2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CREB1 gene have been linked to several psychiatric disorders and other conditions. The CREB1 gene is associated with major psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). Studies have shown that CREB1 mRNA expression is significantly lower in patients with these disorders compared to healthy controls, particularly in SCZ (Xiao2017The). Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CREB1 gene, such as rs2709370 and rs6785, have been associated with increased risk for BPD, SCZ, and MDD, although these associations did not reach genome-wide significance (Xiao2017The).

In schizophrenia, CREB1 expression is upregulated in Brodmann Area 10, suggesting its involvement in cognitive impairments associated with the disease (Ohayon2020Gene). A rare haplotype in CREB1 has also been linked to schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population, indicating a genetic predisposition to the disorder (Ma2014Molecular).

A specific missense mutation in CREB1, c.347A>G, leads to a novel multiple malformation syndrome resembling the Creb knockout mouse, affecting the protein's ability to interact with coactivators and disrupting signal transduction (Kitazawa2012A). This mutation results in severe developmental abnormalities, including neonatal respiratory distress and agenesis of the corpus callosum (Kitazawa2012A).

## Interactions
CREB1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. CREB1 interacts with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which are essential for its transcriptional activity. The interaction with CBP is phosphorylation-dependent, requiring the phosphorylation of CREB1 at Serine 133, which facilitates the binding of its kinase-inducible domain (KID) to the KIX domain of CBP. This interaction is characterized by the formation of an amphipathic helix in CREB1 that docks into the hydrophobic groove of the KIX domain (Cardinaux2000Recruitment; Radhakrishnan1997Solution).

CREB1 also forms complexes with other transcription factors, such as Lyl1, which can alter the expression of CREB1 target genes. Lyl1 interacts with CREB1 and p300, forming a tripartite complex that influences histone acetylation and gene expression (SanMarina2008Lyl1). In breast cancer cells, CREB1 is necessary for the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), facilitating its recruitment to chromatin and enhancing its transcriptional activation of target genes (Berto2018ERα). These interactions highlight CREB1's role in diverse cellular processes through its ability to form dynamic complexes with various proteins.
