# KIR2DL3

## Overview
KIR2DL3 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, two Ig domains and long cytoplasmic tail 3, a transmembrane receptor protein primarily expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. This receptor is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in the immune system by interacting with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, particularly HLA-C group 1 alleles. Through these interactions, KIR2DL3 transmits inhibitory signals that regulate NK cell activity, preventing the destruction of healthy cells and maintaining immune homeostasis (Sim2015KIR2DL3; Moesta2012Diverse). The receptor's structural features, including its two immunoglobulin-like domains, facilitate its binding to MHC class I molecules, influencing NK cell education and responsiveness (Moradi2021Structural; Maenaka1999Crystal). KIR2DL3 is clinically significant due to its involvement in various autoimmune and infectious diseases, where its interactions with HLA ligands can either confer protection or increase susceptibility (Omraninava2020Systematic; Mahmoudi2017Analysis).

## Structure
The KIR2DL3 protein is characterized by its two tandem immunoglobulin-like domains, D1 and D2, which are part of its extracellular region. These domains exhibit a distinct subtype of the Ig-like fold, resembling fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like folds found in the hematopoietic receptor family (Maenaka1999Crystal). The structure of KIR2DL3 reveals an acute interdomain elbow angle, approximately 70°, which is a distinguishing feature of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) (Maenaka1999Crystal). 

The primary structure of KIR2DL3 includes key residues involved in MHC class I binding, such as those on the CC′ loop of D1 and the FG loop of D2, which are crucial for ligand interaction (Maenaka1999Crystal). The protein's tertiary structure is maintained by hydrophobic interactions at the D1-D2 interface, with a similar solvent-accessible area buried at the interface as seen in related receptors (Maenaka1999Crystal).

KIR2DL3 shares structural similarities with monomeric IgSF cell adhesion molecules like ICAM2 and VCAM1, indicating an evolutionary relationship to these molecules (Maenaka1999Crystal). The protein's structural plasticity allows for altered docking geometries atop HLA-C, which is significant for its function in immune regulation (Moradi2021Structural).

## Function
KIR2DL3 is a receptor protein expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, playing a crucial role in the immune response by interacting with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, specifically HLA-C group 1 alleles. This interaction is essential for the regulation of NK cell activity, as it transmits inhibitory signals that prevent the destruction of healthy cells, thereby maintaining immune system balance (Sim2015KIR2DL3; Moesta2012Diverse).

The receptor is involved in the licensing of NK cells, a process that enhances their functional responsiveness. NK cells expressing KIR2DL3 exhibit enhanced functional responses compared to receptor-negative NK cells, although the degree of licensing is not significantly affected by the presence of two HLA-I ligand alleles (Sim2015KIR2DL3). KIR2DL3-positive NK cells are also more sensitive to changes in the peptide repertoire presented by MHC class I molecules, which may contribute to their protective effects against certain viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (Cassidy2014Peptide).

KIR2DL3's role in NK cell education involves interactions with HLA-C group 1 variants, which influence the functionality and responsiveness of NK cells. However, its contribution to antibody-dependent NK cell activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is modest compared to other KIRs (Lisovsky2019Differential).

## Clinical Significance
KIR2DL3 is associated with various diseases due to its role in modulating immune responses. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), KIR2DL3 is part of protective genotypes that reduce disease risk, suggesting its inhibitory function on NK cells may help prevent autoimmunity (Mahmoudi2017Analysis). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), KIR2DL3 is linked to a decreased risk, likely due to its ability to inhibit cytokine production, such as IFN-γ, which reduces T cell autoreactivity (Aghaei2019Association; Gianchecchi2021Natural). 

Conversely, KIR2DL3 is associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The imbalance between activating and inhibitory KIRs, including KIR2DL3, may affect NK cell activation, increasing PTB risk (Omraninava2020Systematic). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), KIR2DL3 shows heterogeneity in its association with ulcerative colitis, indicating a complex role in disease susceptibility (Fathollahi2018The).

KIR2DL3's interactions with HLA ligands are crucial in these conditions, as specific KIR-HLA combinations can be protective or predisposing. The gene's polymorphic nature and its role in immune regulation highlight its clinical significance across various autoimmune and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
KIR2DL3 is a killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor that primarily interacts with HLA-C molecules on target cells, transmitting inhibitory signals to regulate natural killer (NK) cell activity. This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. KIR2DL3 specifically binds to HLA-Cw3-related MHC class I molecules, with key residues such as those on the CC′ loop of D1 and the FG loop of D2 playing significant roles in this binding (Maenaka1999Crystal). The receptor's binding site spans both immunoglobulin-like domains, with hydrophobic interactions involving residues like Phe45 and Phe181 contributing to the binding affinity (Maenaka1999Crystal).

Allelic variations in KIR2DL3, such as KIR2DL3*005, exhibit increased binding affinity to HLA-C ligands, similar to KIR2DL2. This variant binds HLA-C group 1 allotypes with high avidity and group 2 allotypes with intermediate avidity, influenced by specific amino acid residues that alter the interdomain hinge angle (Frazier2013Allelic). The structural plasticity of KIR2DL3 allows it to recognize multiple HLA-I allotypes, with differences in docking geometries affecting the recognition of specific HLA-C allotypes like HLA-C*03:04 and HLA-C*07:02 (Moradi2021Structural).
