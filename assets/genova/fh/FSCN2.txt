# FSCN2

## Overview
FSCN2 is a gene that encodes the protein fascin actin-bundling protein 2, retinal, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton. This protein is primarily involved in the organization of actin filaments into tightly packed parallel bundles, a function essential for maintaining the structural integrity of hair cell stereocilia and the retina (Liu2024Inhibition). As an actin-binding protein, FSCN2 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and signal transduction. It also has a regulatory function, influencing pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis, particularly in cochlear cells and the retina (Trifunovic´2008A; Liu2024Inhibition). Mutations in FSCN2 have been studied for their potential involvement in inherited retinal diseases, although their pathogenicity remains uncertain (Jin2008Allelic; Hanany2019Allele). Additionally, altered expression of FSCN2 has been linked to poor prognosis in certain cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Lin2023Comprehensive).

## Function
The FSCN2 gene encodes an actin cross-linking protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of hair cell stereocilia and the retina. In healthy human cells, FSCN2 is involved in organizing actin filaments into tightly packed parallel bundles, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of stereocilia in hair cells and the structural integrity of the retina (Liu2024Inhibition). This protein binds to various forms of actin, including α-, β-, and γ-actin, and is active in the cytoskeleton, contributing to cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and signal transduction (Liu2024Inhibition).

FSCN2 also plays a regulatory role by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of PPAR-γ, a transcription factor, thereby controlling the expression of PARVB. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cochlear cell survival and preventing hearing loss, as it modulates the ILK-AKT signaling pathway, which is associated with cell survival and apoptosis (Liu2024Inhibition). In the retina, FSCN2 is expressed across all retinal cell layers, suggesting a broader role in retinal function beyond its previously understood involvement in photoreceptor cells (Trifunovic´2008A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FSCN2 gene have been investigated for their potential role in inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular degeneration. The c.72delG mutation, also known as 208delG, was initially reported to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) and autosomal dominant macular degeneration (ADMD). However, subsequent studies have found this mutation in both affected individuals and healthy controls, suggesting it is non-pathogenic and does not cosegregate with retinal degeneration (Zhang2007The; Jin2008Allelic; Hanany2019Allele).

Other variants in FSCN2, such as c.1105G>A, have been identified as affecting splicing rather than being missense mutations, which may contribute to disease mechanisms (RodriguezMuñoz2022Functional). Despite these findings, the evidence supporting FSCN2 as a primary cause of retinal degeneration remains inconclusive, and further research is needed to clarify its role (Jin2008Allelic).

In addition to retinal diseases, altered expression of FSCN2 has been associated with poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), where high FSCN2 expression correlates with shorter progression-free intervals and overall survival (Lin2023Comprehensive).

## Interactions
FSCN2, or fascin actin-bundling protein 2, is known to participate in several important protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the transcription factor PPAR-γ. FSCN2 binds to PPAR-γ, inhibiting its nuclear translocation. This interaction prevents PPAR-γ from binding to the Parvb promoter, thereby regulating the expression of the PARVB gene in cochlear cells. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining proper cell survival pathways, as it affects downstream molecules such as p-ILK, p-AKT, and Bcl-2, which are involved in cell survival (Liu2024Inhibition).

FSCN2 also plays a structural role by interacting with β-actin to maintain the length of stereocilia, which is essential for auditory function. This interaction is particularly important in the context of hearing, as it helps preserve the structure of hair cell stereocilia in the cochlea (Wang2023Loss). These interactions highlight FSCN2's dual role as both a structural and regulatory protein, influencing cell shape and signaling pathways critical for hearing and cell survival.
