# RBBP6

## Overview
RBBP6 (Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 6) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA processing, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. The protein, known as RB binding protein 6, ubiquitin ligase, is characterized by its ubiquitin-like DWNN domain, a CCHC zinc knuckle, and an atypical RING finger domain, which contribute to its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Pugh2006DWNN). RBBP6 interacts with key tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb, implicating it in the regulation of cell proliferation and programmed cell death (Pugh2006DWNN). Additionally, RBBP6 is involved in the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, influencing mRNA stability and expression through its interactions with the polyadenylation machinery (Di2014RBBP6; Boreikaite2022RBBP6). The protein's diverse functions and interactions underscore its significance in both normal cellular physiology and pathological conditions, including its role in cancer progression and viral replication (Chen2013Overexpression; Batra2018Protein).

## Structure
The RBBP6 protein is a large, approximately 250 kDa splicing-associated protein with multiple domains that contribute to its diverse functions. It contains a novel ubiquitin-like domain known as the DWNN domain, which is located at the N-terminus and consists of residues 1-81. This domain is structurally similar to human ubiquitin and features a β-grasp topology with an α-helix packing against a five-stranded β-sheet, along with an additional short section of anti-parallel β-sheet not seen in other ubiquitin-like proteins (Pugh2006DWNN). The DWNN domain is expressed independently in vertebrates and is involved in mRNA processing and ubiquitin-like pathways (Pugh2006DWNN).

RBBP6 also includes a CCHC zinc knuckle and a RING finger domain, the latter of which is atypical and shares characteristics with U-box domains, indicating a role in ubiquitin-conjugating functions (Pugh2006DWNN). The protein interacts with tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, suggesting roles in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation (Pugh2006DWNN). RBBP6 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including isoform 3, which consists solely of the DWNN domain (Mbita2019Expression). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which influence its function and stability.

## Function
RBBP6 (RB binding protein 6) plays a crucial role in the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, a vital step in mRNA maturation that influences mRNA stability, export, and translation. It is involved in the polyadenylation machinery, interacting with core factors such as CstF and CPSF through its ubiquitin-like DWNN domain (Di2014RBBP6). RBBP6 is not a stable component of the CPSF complex but is recruited in an RNA-dependent manner to activate the CPSF endonuclease, essential for pre-mRNA cleavage (Boreikaite2022RBBP6).

RBBP6 influences alternative polyadenylation (APA), affecting the length of 3' UTRs and the expression of mRNAs with AU-rich elements. Its knockdown results in the use of distal poly(A) sites, leading to 3' UTR lengthening and decreased transcript levels, particularly of AU-rich mRNAs (Di2014RBBP6). The protein's interaction with tumor suppressors Rb and p53 suggests a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Pugh2006DWNN). RBBP6 is active in the nucleus, where it associates with hnRNPs and localizes within nuclear speckles, indicating its involvement in RNA metabolism and processing (Pugh2006DWNN).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RBBP6 gene have been linked to various cancers, including colon, colorectal, and glioblastoma. In colon cancer, RBBP6 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, increased disease recurrence, and decreased survival. It is particularly significant when combined with mutant TP53, serving as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival. This overexpression is linked to higher rates of metastasis and local recurrence, suggesting its role in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis (Chen2013Overexpression).

In colorectal cancer, RBBP6 acts as a RING finger-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. This activation leads to the degradation of IκBα, an NF-κB inhibitor, facilitating cancer progression. RBBP6's upregulation in colorectal cancer is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis (Xiao2019RBBP6).

In glioblastoma, RBBP6 is crucial for the survival and maintenance of glioblastoma stem cells, mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of CPSF3. This process is essential for maintaining high MYC expression, which is critical for glioblastoma stem cell proliferation and tumor growth (Lin2024RBBP6).

## Interactions
RBBP6 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is involved in the human polyadenylation machinery, where it interacts with the cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) through a ubiquitin-like domain called DWNN. This interaction is crucial for 3' processing of pre-mRNA, with RBBP6 stimulating 3' cleavage in vitro (Di2014RBBP6). RBBP6 also interacts transiently with CPSF in an RNA-dependent manner, activating the endonuclease CPSF73, which is essential for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (Boreikaite2021RBBP6).

RBBP6 isoform 3 competes with other isoforms for binding to the core machinery, inhibiting 3' processing and affecting alternative polyadenylation (APA) and transcript accumulation (Di2014RBBP6). The DWNN domain is critical for these interactions, as it binds to CstF and influences 3' processing efficiency (Di2014RBBP6).

RBBP6 also interacts with the Ebola virus protein VP30, acting as a negative regulator of Ebola virus replication. It competes with the viral nucleoprotein for binding to VP30, inhibiting viral RNA synthesis (Batra2018Protein). These interactions highlight RBBP6's multifaceted role in cellular and viral processes.
