# ST8SIA4

## Overview
ST8SIA4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 4, a member of the sialyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a carbohydrate polymer that modifies glycoproteins and glycolipids, playing a crucial role in neural development and cell-cell interactions. The ST8SIA4 protein is categorized as a type II transmembrane protein, characterized by its localization in the Golgi apparatus where it facilitates post-translational modifications. It is particularly significant in the polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which is essential for neural plasticity and development (Huang2017The; Ma2014Modification). The gene's expression and regulation are implicated in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer progression and immune response modulation (Fu2021miR1445p; Moe2021A).

## Structure
The ST8SIA4 protein is a member of the sialyltransferase family, characterized by its role in transferring sialic acid residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids. It is a type II transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a catalytic domain localized within the Golgi apparatus (Huang2017The). The protein's structure includes several key features, such as antiparallel β-sheets near the N-terminal region and two pairs of disulfide bonds (C142:C292 and C156:C356), which contribute to its compact 3D structure and enhance its stability and activity (Huang2017The).

The catalytic domain of ST8SIA4 is divided into seven distinct domains (A-G), with domains A-B and D being crucial for catalyzing the polysialylation of NCAM. The C, E-F, and G domains form the core region necessary for efficient autopoysialylation (Huang2017The). The protein also contains the PSTD motif and the polybasic region (PBR), which are critical for its function in polysialylation (Huang2017The). The presence of α-helices and β-sheets, along with disulfide bonds, is crucial for the protein's function in polysialylation (Huang2017The).

## Function
ST8SIA4 encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a carbohydrate polymer that modifies glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid residues to form polysialic acid chains, primarily on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This modification is essential for cell-cell interactions, neural development, and plasticity (Ma2014Modification).

The activity of ST8SIA4 is mainly localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in post-translational modification processes. In healthy human cells, ST8SIA4 is expressed in the brain, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes, indicating its involvement in various physiological processes (Moe2021A). Although the specific function of ST8SIA4 in healthy cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested to be involved in the modification of polysialic acid, which could be relevant to its function in normal cellular activities (Moe2021A).

ST8SIA4 is also implicated in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and survival. This pathway's activation by ST8SIA4 suggests a role in modulating cellular responses to external stimuli (Zhang2015α2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST8SIA4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, ST8SIA4 is significantly upregulated in aggressive cell lines and tumor tissues, contributing to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Knockdown experiments in breast cancer models have shown that reducing ST8SIA4 expression decreases tumor growth and metastatic potential, suggesting its role in promoting malignancy (Ma2016Functional). The gene is also associated with creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in BRCA1-mutant breast cancers, which enhances metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy (Shu2023BRCA1).

In cholangiocarcinoma, ST8SIA4 expression is elevated and linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. This expression is regulated by miR-144-5p and miR-451a, which act as tumor suppressors by downregulating ST8SIA4. Alterations in these miRNAs lead to enhanced cancer progression, highlighting the gene's role in this aggressive cancer type (Fu2021miR1445p).

Beyond cancer, ST8SIA4 has been identified as a key diagnostic biomarker in atherosclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, where its expression is associated with immune microenvironment alterations and inflammatory responses (Ma2024Exploring).

## Interactions
ST8SIA4, a member of the sialyltransferase family, is involved in various interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. It is known to participate in the polysialylation of neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs), a process crucial for cell-cell interactions and neural development (Huang2017The). The enzyme's activity is modulated by specific structural motifs, such as the PSTD and PBR, which are essential for its interaction with NCAMs. These motifs contain basic residues that are exposed on the protein surface, facilitating protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions necessary for NCAM polysialylation (Huang2017The).

ST8SIA4 is also regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-144-5p, miR-451a, miR-26a, and miR-26b, which target its mRNA, leading to decreased expression and affecting cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These interactions highlight the role of ST8SIA4 in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (Fu2021miR1445p; Ma2016Functional). Additionally, the long non-coding RNA MALAT1 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-26a/26b, indirectly regulating ST8SIA4 expression and influencing breast cancer cell aggressiveness (Wang2021lncRNA). These interactions underscore the multifaceted regulatory mechanisms involving ST8SIA4 in both normal physiological and pathological contexts.
