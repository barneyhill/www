# PPARA

## Overview
PPARA (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) is a gene that encodes a nuclear receptor protein involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammation. The protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, functions as a transcription factor and is predominantly expressed in tissues with high fatty acid oxidation rates, such as the liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPARA forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, energy homeostasis, and inflammation control. The receptor is activated by endogenous ligands, including fatty acids and their metabolites, as well as synthetic compounds like fibrates. PPARA's role extends beyond metabolism, as it also modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines and interfering with signaling pathways such as NF-kB and AP-1. This multifaceted functionality makes PPARA a significant target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic and inflammatory diseases (Bougarne2018Molecular; Yessoufou2010Multifaceted).

## Structure
PPARA (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) is a nuclear receptor protein that plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism. The protein structure includes a ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a DNA-binding domain, which contains zinc finger motifs essential for its function as a transcription factor (Uchiki2004Molecular). The LBD of PPARA has been crystallized in complex with various ligands, revealing interactions that are critical for its activation and specificity (Oyama2021Crystal).

The secondary structure of PPARA includes several helices, with helix 12 being particularly important for nuclear receptor activation. Ligand binding induces conformational changes in helices 3, 4, 8-9 loop, and 10/11, which are involved in allosteric communication within the PPARA-RXRα heterodimer (Venäläinen2009Molecular). The quaternary structure involves heterodimerization with RXRα, which is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Venäläinen2009Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation are common in PPARA, affecting its activity and stability. The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can alter its functional domains and regulatory capabilities (Uchiki2004Molecular). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the receptor's role in lipid metabolism and its interaction with various ligands.

## Function
PPARA (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism and inflammation in healthy human cells. It is predominantly expressed in tissues with high rates of fatty acid oxidation, such as the liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle (Desvergne1999Peroxisome; Bougarne2018Molecular). PPARA is activated by endogenous ligands, including fatty acids and their metabolites, as well as synthetic compounds like fibrates (Bougarne2018Molecular; Kersten2017The).

Upon activation, PPARA forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific DNA elements to regulate the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, energy homeostasis, and inflammation control (Bougarne2018Molecular; Yessoufou2010Multifaceted). It enhances the transcription of proteins involved in mitochondrial transport and β-oxidation, promoting fatty acid catabolism (Cabrero2002Peroxisome). PPARA also regulates microsomal ω-oxidation through CYP4A enzymes, contributing to the degradation of proinflammatory eicosanoids (Cabrero2002Peroxisome).

In addition to its metabolic functions, PPARA modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines and interfering with signaling pathways such as NF-kB and AP-1 (Bougarne2018Molecular). This anti-inflammatory action is significant in controlling inflammation and may have implications for conditions like atherosclerosis (Bougarne2018Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the PPARA gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. The L162V polymorphism, resulting from a C-to-G transversion, is associated with increased levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, contributing to hyperlipidemia and elevated cardiovascular risk, especially in non-diabetics and apoE4 carriers (Ruscica2019Impact). This polymorphism also affects lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk, with its impact varying based on dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (Ruscica2019Impact).

The V227A polymorphism is linked to changes in serum lipid concentrations and is prevalent in Oriental populations. It is associated with reduced cholesterol and triglyceride levels and may influence the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Ruscica2019Impact; Han2017PPARs:). PPARA gene variations can also affect the response to fenofibrate treatment in type 2 diabetes patients, highlighting their role in personalized medicine (Ruscica2019Impact).

Alterations in PPARA expression levels are implicated in inflammatory diseases, with decreased expression observed in conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This reduction can be counteracted by inhibiting miRNA-21, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Bougarne2018Molecular).

## Interactions
PPARA (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) interacts with various proteins and forms complexes that are crucial for its function in regulating gene expression. One significant interaction is with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), forming a heterodimer that is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Ligand binding to PPARα or RXRα induces conformational changes that stabilize the heterodimer and enhance its transcriptional activity (Venäläinen2009Molecular; Bougarne2018Molecular).

PPARA also interacts with a complex of coactivator proteins known as the PRIC complex, which includes CBP, SRC-1, and novel proteins like PRIC285. This complex enhances transcription from gene promoters containing peroxisome proliferator response elements (Surapureddi2002Identification). PRIC285, in particular, acts as a coactivator for PPARα, potentiating its transcriptional activity in a ligand-dependent manner (Surapureddi2002Identification).

PPARA's interactions extend to other nuclear receptors, such as ERRα, which can coactivate ligand-activated PPARα. This interaction is modulated by coactivators like PGC1α and is influenced by cellular conditions such as serum deprivation (Desmet2024Crosstalk). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which PPARA participates, influencing lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.
