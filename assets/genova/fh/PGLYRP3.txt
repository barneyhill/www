# PGLYRP3

## Overview
PGLYRP3 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidoglycan recognition protein 3, which is a member of the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family. This protein plays a significant role in the innate immune system by recognizing and binding to peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls, thereby contributing to the host's defense mechanisms against bacterial infections. PGLYRP3 is categorized as a pattern recognition receptor and is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, eyes, salivary glands, and intestinal epithelial cells, where it helps maintain microbial homeostasis and modulate inflammatory responses (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 0 of 4; Zenhom2012Peptidoglycan page 0 of 3). The protein's structure includes a carboxy-terminal PGRP domain and a type 2 amidase domain, which are crucial for its bactericidal activity and ligand-binding specificity (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 3 of 4). PGLYRP3's function and expression are regulated by interactions with nuclear receptors and are influenced by dietary and microbial factors, highlighting its role in immune regulation and potential implications in inflammatory diseases (Zenhom2011PPARγdependent).

## Structure
The human PGLYRP3 protein is part of the peptidoglycan recognition protein family, which plays a role in the immune response by binding to bacterial cell wall components. PGLYRP3 contains a carboxy-terminal PGRP domain that is involved in binding peptidoglycan, specifically recognizing muramyl-tetrapeptide and muramyl-pentapeptide with higher affinity than muramyl-tripeptide. This binding induces a conformational change in the protein, locking the ligand in the binding groove (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 3 of 4).

Structurally, PGLYRP3 has a carboxy-terminal type 2 amidase domain, approximately 165 amino acids long, homologous to bacteriophage and bacterial type 2 amidases. The protein typically features two conserved cysteines forming a disulfide bond essential for activity. In vertebrates, additional conserved cysteines form a second disulfide bond, and in PGLYRP3, a third disulfide bond is present (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 0 of 4). PGLYRP3 is a glycosylated protein, forming disulfide-linked dimers, and requires divalent cations and N-glycosylation for its bactericidal activity (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 3 of 4). The protein's structure includes two PGRP domains, each with a ligand-binding site, and these domains are not identical, leading to different binding specificities (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 3 of 4).

## Function
Peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (PGLYRP3) plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by recognizing bacterial peptidoglycan, a component of bacterial cell walls. It is expressed in various human tissues, including the skin, eyes, salivary glands, and intestinal epithelial cells, where it contributes to barrier immunity and the maintenance of microbial homeostasis (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 0 of 4; Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 2 of 4).

PGLYRP3 has an anti-inflammatory role in intestinal epithelial cells, such as Caco-2 cells, by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of PGLYRP3 reduces the levels of cytokines like IL-8, IL-12p35, and TNF-α, while its knockdown increases these cytokines, indicating its role in balancing inflammatory responses (Zenhom2012Peptidoglycan). This anti-inflammatory effect is achieved through the suppression of the NF-κB pathway, a key regulator of inflammation (Zenhom2011PPARγdependent).

PGLYRP3 expression is regulated by the PPARγ-RXRα complex, which is influenced by dietary and microbial fatty acids. This regulation suggests that PGLYRP3 may play a role in modulating immune responses in response to dietary components (Zenhom2011PPARγdependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PGLYRP3 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its subtypes, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Studies have shown that PGLYRP3 plays a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis and protecting against colitis. Deficiencies in PGLYRP3 can lead to increased sensitivity to colitis, characterized by symptoms such as decreased survival, increased intestinal bleeding, and altered gut microbiome (Jing2014Peptidoglycan). 

In experimental models, PGLYRP3 knockout mice exhibit more severe symptoms of DSS-induced colitis, including heightened inflammatory responses and increased gut permeability, compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that PGLYRP3 is involved in modulating the inflammatory response and maintaining gut barrier function (Ghadimi2021Study). The absence of PGLYRP3 has been linked to increased levels of inflammatory markers such as COX-2 and IL-6, indicating a heightened inflammatory state (Ghadimi2021Study). 

Alterations in PGLYRP3 expression or function can also lead to changes in gut microbiota, which further predispose individuals to inflammatory conditions like colitis (Jing2014Peptidoglycan). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in modulating sensitivity to colitis in humans.

## Interactions
PGLYRP3, a member of the peptidoglycan recognition protein family, is involved in various interactions that influence immune responses. It interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARγ, forming complexes with PPARγ-RXRα, which bind to specific sites on the PGlyRP3 promoter, such as the -1359 site, to regulate gene expression. This interaction is confirmed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) in Caco2 and Hela cells (Zenhom2011PPARγdependent). PGLYRP3 expression is modulated by PPARγ agonists and certain free fatty acids, which enhance its expression and subsequently inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-8, IL-12p35, and TNF-α through the suppression of the NF-κB pathway (Zenhom2011PPARγdependent).

PGLYRP3 also has a ligand-binding groove that interacts with peptidoglycan, specifically muramyl-tetrapeptide and muramyl-pentapeptide, inducing conformational changes that lock the ligand in place. This binding preference is determined by specific amino acids in the groove, allowing PGLYRP3 to form heterodimers with PGLYRP-4, further diversifying its binding capabilities (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 3 of 4). These interactions highlight PGLYRP3's role in modulating immune responses and its potential involvement in forming multiprotein complexes.
