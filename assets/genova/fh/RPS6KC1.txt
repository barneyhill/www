# RPS6KC1

## Overview
RPS6KC1 is a gene that encodes the protein ribosomal protein S6 kinase C1, also known as RPK118 or RSKL1. This protein is categorized as a pseudokinase, which plays a significant role in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways. It is primarily associated with early endosomes and is characterized by the presence of a PX domain, which is crucial for its function as an adapter protein in recruiting other proteins to the endosomal compartment. This recruitment is vital for processes such as receptor internalization and intracellular trafficking, indicating the protein's role in organizing and modulating protein interactions at the endosomal level (Jacobsen2017The). Additionally, RPS6KC1 is involved in interactions with circular RNA derived from its gene, influencing cell cycle regulation and senescence, particularly in the context of cancer (Shu2024N6methyladenosinemodified). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular functions and disease pathogenesis (Charng2016Exome; Liang2012Wholeexome).

## Structure


## Function
Ribosomal protein S6 kinase C1 (RPS6KC1), also known as RPK118 or RSKL1, is a pseudokinase involved in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways. It is associated with early endosomes and contains a PX domain, which facilitates its binding to various proteins, recruiting them to the endosomal compartment. This recruitment is essential for receptor internalization and intracellular trafficking processes, suggesting that RPS6KC1 acts as an adapter protein that organizes and modulates protein interactions at the endosomal level (Jacobsen2017The).

The pseudokinase domain of RPS6KC1 is believed to facilitate interactions between endosomes and actin, potentially acting as a mechanical switch to aid in the movement of receptor complexes within the cell. This function highlights its role in the dynamic processes of cellular trafficking, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external signals (Jacobsen2017The).

While the specific mechanisms of RPS6KC1's function are not fully defined, its involvement in these processes underscores its significance in cell biology, particularly in the context of intracellular signaling and protein trafficking. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm further supports its role in regulating these essential cellular functions (Jacobsen2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RPS6KC1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurological disorders and cancers. In neurological conditions, compound heterozygous variants in RPS6KC1 have been associated with structural brain malformations, such as cortical dysgenesis and corpus callosum abnormalities. These findings suggest that RPS6KC1 may play a role in neurogenesis and embryonic development, making it a candidate gene for neurological diseases, especially in consanguineous populations (Charng2016Exome).

In cancer, RPS6KC1 has been identified as having oncogene-like activity in endometrial cancer, where its knockdown inhibited cell viability, indicating its role in promoting cell survival (Liang2012Wholeexome). In glioblastoma, somatic mutations in RPS6KC1 have been detected, although their clinical significance remains unclear (Bleeker2014Mutational). Additionally, RPS6KC1 is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is frequently dysregulated in cancers. A specific RPS6KC1-Akt3 fusion has been noted in mammary cancer, contributing to pathway hyperactivation (Li2022Targeting).

In prostate cancer, the circular RNA circRPS6KC1, derived from RPS6KC1, is upregulated and influences cell senescence through the FOXM1/PCNA axis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shu2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

## Interactions
RPS6KC1, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase C1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that play a role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the circular RNA circRPS6KC1, which is derived from the RPS6KC1 gene. This circRNA is involved in prostate cancer progression and is regulated by the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, facilitated by the RNA methylase METTL3 and the m6A reader protein YTHDF1. These interactions stabilize circRPS6KC1, enhancing its function as a miR-761 sponge, which in turn regulates the expression of the transcription factor FOXM1 (Shu2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

The interaction between circRPS6KC1 and miR-761 is crucial, as circRPS6KC1 acts as a sponge for miR-761, thereby influencing FOXM1 expression. FOXM1 is a transcriptional regulator of PCNA, which affects p21 degradation in a p53-independent manner, highlighting the role of RPS6KC1 in cell cycle regulation and senescence in prostate cancer cells (Shu2024N6methyladenosinemodified). These interactions underscore the importance of RPS6KC1 in the regulation of cell proliferation and senescence through its derived circRNA and associated protein interactions.
