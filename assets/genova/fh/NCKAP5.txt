# NCKAP5

## Overview
NCKAP5, or NCK-associated protein 5, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. The protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, playing a crucial role in the regulation of actin dynamics. NCKAP5 is expressed in multiple tissues and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism, due to its involvement in neuronal signaling pathways (Forstner2020Wholeexome). Additionally, NCKAP5 has been associated with oncological conditions, including metastatic melanoma and prostate cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and metastasis (KLUTH2015Prevalence; Leonard2021Comprehensive). Despite its recognized importance, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which NCKAP5 contributes to these diverse diseases are still under investigation.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NCKAP5 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. In the context of bipolar disorder (BD), whole-exome sequencing studies have identified rare, non-synonymous variants in NCKAP5, such as p.D19E and p.M1477I, which are predicted to be damaging and may contribute to the disease's genetic etiology (Forstner2020Wholeexome). The gene has also been associated with a broader spectrum of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, suggesting a shared genetic basis among these conditions (Forstner2020Wholeexome).

In cancer research, NCKAP5 has been identified as one of the genes with frequent mutations in metastatic melanoma, indicating a potential role in the progression of this disease (Leonard2021Comprehensive). Additionally, NCKAP5 has been noted for its recurrent deletions in prostate cancer, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (KLUTH2015Prevalence). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both psychiatric and oncological contexts, although the precise mechanisms by which NCKAP5 mutations contribute to these diseases remain to be fully elucidated.
