# EEF1A2

## Overview
The EEF1A2 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (eEF1A2), a crucial protein involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. As a member of the elongation factor family, eEF1A2 facilitates the delivery of aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosome, a key step in translating genetic information into functional proteins (Newbery2007Translation). This protein is predominantly expressed in neurons, skeletal muscle, and heart tissues, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular function and protein synthesis (Mills2021On). Beyond its primary role in translation, eEF1A2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cellular stress responses, and oncogenesis, through its interactions with multiple signaling molecules and post-translational modifications (Carriles2020Structural; Mills2021On). Mutations in the EEF1A2 gene have been linked to several neurological and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Marshall2023Early; Cao2017Homozygous).

## Structure
The EEF1A2 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (eEF1A2), a protein involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. The eEF1A2 protein is composed of 463 amino acids and folds into three well-characterized structural domains. Domain I (residues 4-234) is responsible for GDP/GTP binding, while domains II (241-328) and III (337-462/463) are β-barrels (Carriles2020Structural; Mills2021On). The protein can form a dimer, with a head-to-tail arrangement, and further assemble into a tetramer (Mills2021On; Carriles2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a significant role in the function of eEF1A2. Notable PTMs include the attachment of phosphatidylethanolamine to Glu301 and Glu374, which is crucial for membrane interactions (Mills2021On; Carriles2020Structural). Phosphorylation sites such as Ser300 and Ser53 are also important, affecting tRNA binding and protein synthesis (Mills2021On; Carriles2020Structural). These modifications contribute to the protein's diverse roles beyond translation, including interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and involvement in cellular processes like autophagy and oncogenesis (Mendoza2020eEF1A2; Carriles2020Structural).

## Function
The EEF1A2 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (eEF1A2), a protein that plays a critical role in the elongation phase of protein synthesis. eEF1A2 is responsible for delivering aminoacylated tRNAs to the A site of the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner, a crucial step in the translation process (Newbery2007Translation; Chambers1998The). This protein is predominantly expressed in neurons, skeletal muscle, and heart tissues, where it is essential for maintaining protein synthesis and cellular function (Kahns1998The; Mills2021On).

In healthy cells, eEF1A2 is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and is crucial for the survival of myotubes and neurons, exerting prosurvival activities (Mills2021On). It also plays a role in cellular stress responses, such as apoptosis, where its expression can delay cell death (Mills2021On). The protein's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, which enable it to interact with other molecular partners and participate in various cellular processes beyond translation (Mills2021On).

eEF1A2's activity is essential for normal cellular growth, differentiation, and the maintenance of the cytoskeleton, contributing to the stability and longevity of cells in tissues that require high levels of protein synthesis (Chambers1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EEF1A2 gene are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. Homozygous missense mutations, such as p.P333L, have been linked to severe conditions including dilated cardiomyopathy, global developmental delay, epilepsy, and early death. Affected individuals often appear normal at birth but experience rapid deterioration postnatally (Cao2017Homozygous). De novo heterozygous missense mutations in EEF1A2, such as E122K, are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, characterized by early onset seizures, intellectual disability, and movement disorders (Marshall2023Early; Inui2016Two). These mutations can result in either loss-of-function or gain-of-function effects, with some mutations exhibiting a toxic gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect (Marshall2023Early).

In animal models, EEF1A2 deficiency leads to neurological defects, muscle weakness, and cardiac failure, mirroring the human phenotypes (Cao2017Homozygous). Zebrafish models with EEF1A2 knockdown show developmental abnormalities and heart failure, further supporting the gene's critical role in normal development and function (Cao2017Homozygous). The gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variants suggests its essential role in maintaining normal cellular processes (Carvill2020Damaging).

## Interactions
EEF1A2 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular signaling and oncogenic processes. It forms complexes with SH2 and SH3 domains of several signaling molecules, including Grb2, RasGAP, PLC-gamma1, Shc, Shp2, Crk, Csk, Fgr, Fyn, and Src, indicating its involvement in phosphotyrosine-mediated signaling pathways (Panasyuk2008A2). EEF1A2 also interacts with HSP90AB1, which regulates TGF-β/SMAD signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma cells (Jia2021EEF1A2).

The protein binds to the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, inhibiting its pro-apoptotic activity, which is crucial for cancer cell survival. This interaction is disrupted by the drug plitidepsin, leading to increased PKR activity and apoptosis (Losada2018Binding). EEF1A2 also interacts with sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1), enhancing their activities and contributing to tumor cell growth and resistance to oxidative stress (Losada2018Binding).

Additionally, EEF1A2 interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase β (PI4KB), increasing its lipid kinase activity, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi complex (Carriles2020Structural). These interactions highlight EEF1A2's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
