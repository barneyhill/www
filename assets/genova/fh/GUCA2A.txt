# GUCA2A

## Overview
The GUCA2A gene encodes the protein guanylate cyclase activator 2A, commonly known as guanylin, which is a peptide hormone primarily involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance in the gastrointestinal tract. Guanylin functions as an endogenous ligand for the guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptor, a transmembrane receptor expressed in the intestinal epithelium. Upon binding to the GC-C receptor, guanylin facilitates the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which subsequently activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to mediate chloride and bicarbonate ion transport. This process is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological functions, including satiety regulation and intestinal barrier integrity (Brenna2016Cellular; Porto2015Computational). Additionally, GUCA2A has been studied for its role in colorectal cancer, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Jalali2023GUCA2A).

## Structure


## Function
The GUCA2A gene encodes guanylin, a peptide that plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by regulating ion and fluid transport. Guanylin acts as an endogenous ligand for the guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptor, which is expressed throughout the intestinal epithelium from the duodenum to the colon. Upon binding to the GC-C receptor, guanylin increases intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, which in turn activate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This activation promotes chloride and bicarbonate secretion while inhibiting the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE3), resulting in net water secretion into the intestinal lumen (Brenna2016Cellular).

Guanylin is primarily expressed in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, including goblet cells, colonocytes, and Paneth cells, but not in enterochromaffin cells. It is secreted into the gastrointestinal lumen and can also be found in systemic circulation. The concentration of guanylin increases in a cranio-caudal direction in the gastrointestinal tract, which may be related to its pH optima and resistance to digestive enzymes (Brenna2016Cellular).

In addition to its role in fluid and electrolyte balance, guanylin is involved in regulating satiety, abdominal pain, and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. It also plays a role in epithelial defense and possibly in the regulation of intestinal functions through its interaction with the GC-C receptor (Brenna2016Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GUCA2A gene, which encodes guanylin, have significant clinical implications in colorectal cancer (CRC). GUCA2A expression is notably downregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poorer overall survival in patients. Lower expression levels of GUCA2A correlate with shorter overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker for CRC (Zhang2019Integrated; Jalali2023GUCA2A). 

The loss of GUCA2A expression is observed in various CRC pathways, including conventional, serrated, and microsatellite instability (MSI) pathways. This loss contributes to the silencing of the GUCY2C receptor, a tumor suppressor, which is associated with tumor transformation and hyperproliferation (Bashir2019Silencing). GUCA2A dysregulation is also linked to immune response modulation in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its role in immune-related processes in colorectal adenocarcinoma (Jalali2023GUCA2A).

Mutations in GUCA2A, including missense mutations, have been identified in colorectal adenocarcinoma, with some classified as deleterious or probably damaging. These mutations, along with differential methylation patterns, may alter GUCA2A expression and contribute to CRC pathogenesis (Jalali2023GUCA2A).

## Interactions
GUCA2A, also known as guanylin, is a peptide hormone that primarily interacts with the guanylate cyclase-C (GUCY2C) receptor on intestinal epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of fluid and electrolyte secretion in the gut, as it stimulates the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to mediate chloride and bicarbonate ion transport (Porto2015Computational; Schwabe2012Guanylin).

In the hepatobiliary system, guanylin is involved in the regulation of electrolyte secretion through a paracrine signaling pathway. It interacts with GUCY2C, leading to the activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase GII (PRKG2) pathway, which enhances chloride and water secretion. Guanylin also influences bicarbonate secretion via the anion exchanger SLC4A2, which involves the exchange of chloride and bicarbonate ions (Schwabe2012Guanylin).

In the context of colorectal cancer, GUCA2A is noted for its role in the tumor immune microenvironment, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this setting are not detailed (Jalali2023GUCA2A). The gene's expression is associated with various immune cells and modulators, suggesting its involvement in broader signaling networks (Jalali2023GUCA2A).
