# KCNF1

## Overview
KCNF1 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily F member 1, which is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in regulating the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane, thereby influencing cellular excitability and signal transduction. The protein encoded by KCNF1 is involved in modulating the electrical activity of cells, particularly in the nervous system, where it contributes to the maintenance of the resting membrane potential and the shaping of action potentials. As a transmembrane protein, it is essential for various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and neuronal communication. Alterations in the function or expression of KCNF1 have been implicated in several neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal cellular function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
