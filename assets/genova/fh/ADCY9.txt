# ADCY9

## Overview
ADCY9 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 9, a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a crucial second messenger in various cellular signaling pathways. Adenylate cyclase 9 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes 12 transmembrane helices and cytosolic domains that form the catalytic core, classifying it as a transmembrane enzyme (Pálvölgyi2018Autoinhibition; Qi2019The). The enzyme plays a significant role in physiological processes such as β2-adrenoceptor signaling, immune response regulation, and cognitive functions (Devasani2022Expression; Niesor2015Adenylyl; Teixeira2017Adenylyl). Variations in the ADCY9 gene have been associated with different health conditions, including cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or a prognostic factor depending on the context (Li2021Assessment; Yi2018Elevated; Tang2023ADCY9).

## Structure
Adenylyl cyclase 9 (ADCY9) is a membrane-bound enzyme characterized by a complex structure that includes 12 transmembrane helices and cytosolic N and C termini. The transmembrane domain is organized into two pseudosymmetric halves, TM1-TM6 and TM7-TM12, which can be superposed with a root mean square deviation of 3.4 Å over 176 residues, suggesting a gene duplication event in its evolutionary history (Qi2019The). The enzyme's catalytic activity is facilitated by two cytoplasmic domains, C1a and C2a, which form the catalytic core through non-covalent interactions (Pálvölgyi2018Autoinhibition).

The C2b domain of ADCY9 plays a critical role in auto-inhibition, with specific residues (1268-1276) being crucial for this function. This domain is highly conserved among vertebrates and is involved in regulating the enzyme's activation by GsCRs (Pálvölgyi2018Autoinhibition). The structure of ADCY9 also includes a helical domain that extends into the cytosol, forming a classic coiled-coil structure important for its function (Qi2019The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence ADCY9's regulatory properties, although specific sites are not detailed in the context provided (Baldwin2019Insights). The enzyme is known to form homo- and heterodimers with other adenylyl cyclase isoforms, which may affect its regulatory functions (Baldwin2019Insights).

## Function
The ADCY9 gene encodes adenylyl cyclase type 9, an enzyme that plays a critical role in converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger involved in numerous cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ADCY9 is integral to the β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) signaling pathway, which is essential for physiological functions such as lipolysis, smooth muscle contraction, and cardiac activity (Niesor2015Adenylyl). This enzyme is associated with caveolae, cholesterol-rich membrane substructures, and its activity is modulated by cholesterol levels, influencing β2-AR signaling (Niesor2015Adenylyl).

ADCY9 is also involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through T regulatory (Treg) cells, which utilize cAMP to suppress T effector cells and modulate immune responses (Teixeira2017Adenylyl). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as Foxp3 and microRNA miR-142-3p, which affect cAMP levels in Treg cells (Teixeira2017Adenylyl).

In the central nervous system, ADCY9 is abundantly expressed and is implicated in cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, as evidenced by its increased expression in the hippocampus following spatial learning (Devasani2022Expression). This suggests a role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance (Devasani2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADCY9 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer, specific polymorphisms in ADCY9, such as rs2230742, are associated with an increased risk, particularly for rectal cancer, where individuals with the AA genotype have a significantly higher risk compared to those with the GG+AG genotype (Li2021Assessment). Conversely, the rs11076810 SNP is linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in individuals over 59 years old (Li2021Assessment).

In lung adenocarcinoma, ADCY9 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its overexpression is associated with reduced cell proliferation and better overall survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tang2023ADCY9). High ADCY9 expression correlates with improved immune cell recruitment, which may contribute to its tumor-suppressing effects (Tang2023ADCY9).

In colon cancer, elevated ADCY9 expression is linked to advanced disease stages and shorter disease-free survival, indicating its role as a poor prognostic factor (Yi2018Elevated). These findings suggest that ADCY9 expression levels and genetic variants significantly impact cancer risk and progression.
