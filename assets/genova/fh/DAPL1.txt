# DAPL1

## Overview
DAPL1, or death-associated protein like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, particularly within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye. The DAPL1 protein functions as a suppressor of cell proliferation, playing a crucial role in maintaining the RPE as a monolayer, which is vital for retinal function and homeostasis (Ma2017DAPL1). It is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in cell cycle control and its interactions with cell cycle-related proteins such as CDKN1A (P21) (Ma2017DAPL1). DAPL1 is also implicated in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in RPE cells, thereby contributing to the prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (Ma2023DAPL1). Beyond its ocular functions, DAPL1 acts as a tumor suppressor in melanoma by stabilizing the P21 protein, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Liu2024Death).

## Structure


## Function
The DAPL1 gene, also known as death-associated protein like-1, functions as a critical regulator of cell proliferation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye. It acts as a suppressor of cell proliferation, maintaining the RPE as a monolayer, which is essential for retinal function and homeostasis (Ma2017DAPL1). DAPL1 is highly expressed in quiescent RPE cells and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation by increasing levels of CDKN1A, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor involved in cell cycle regulation (Ma2017DAPL1).

DAPL1 also plays a role in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of RPE cells, a process that can lead to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Overexpression of DAPL1 increases the expression of epithelial markers and decreases mesenchymal markers, thereby reducing cell migration and maintaining the structural integrity of the RPE (Ma2023DAPL1). The protein is active in the nucleus and its function is mediated through pathways involving the regulation of cell cycle-related proteins such as P21, p-RB, and P107 (Ma2017Regulation; Ma2023DAPL1).

## Clinical Significance
The DAPL1 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Alterations in DAPL1 expression are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. DAPL1 acts as a suppressor of cell proliferation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and its dysregulation may contribute to abnormal RPE-related proliferative diseases and retinal dysfunctions, including AMD (Ma2017DAPL1).

In melanoma, DAPL1 functions as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing the P21 protein, which inhibits cell proliferation. Low expression levels of DAPL1 in melanoma tissues are linked to poorer prognosis in patients with uveal melanoma, suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic factor. Overexpression of DAPL1 in melanoma cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, while knockdown increases it, indicating its role in tumor suppression (Liu2024Death).

DAPL1 is also involved in regulating CD8 T cell responses during chronic infections and cancer. Its deletion enhances NFATc2 activation in exhausted CD8 T cells, suggesting that targeting DAPL1 could improve antitumor responses by enhancing T cell functionality (Zhu2022Dapl1).

## Interactions
DAPL1 (death associated protein like 1) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In melanoma cells, DAPL1 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing the P21 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, through the inhibition of its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This stabilization is crucial for inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation, suggesting a potential interaction between DAPL1 and components of the ubiquitination machinery or the proteasome pathway (Liu2024Death).

In retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, DAPL1 is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation through its interaction with the cell cycle regulator CDKN1A (also known as P21). DAPL1 overexpression increases CDKN1A expression, which in turn reduces cell proliferation, indicating a regulatory pathway involving CDKN1A and associated cell cycle proteins (Ma2017DAPL1).

DAPL1 also interacts with the E2F4/USP2 complex, as it has been shown to bind directly with E2F4 in RPE cells. This interaction may play a role in regulating P21 ubiquitination, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Liu2024Death). These interactions highlight DAPL1's role in modulating cell cycle progression and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by abnormal cell proliferation.
