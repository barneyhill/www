# MTR

## Overview
The MTR gene encodes the enzyme 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, also known as methionine synthase, which is a crucial component of the methionine cycle. This enzyme is responsible for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, a process that requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor and vitamin B12 as a cofactor (Aggrey2017Gene; Felix2023Methionine). Methionine synthase is categorized as a methyltransferase and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular methylation balance, impacting DNA synthesis and various methylation reactions essential for normal cellular function and growth (Bleich2014Genetic). The MTR gene's activity is particularly significant in tissues with high rates of cell division and methylation activity. Variants in the MTR gene have been associated with several health conditions, including congenital heart disease and folate deficiency, highlighting its clinical importance (Zhao2013Genetic; Li2015Homocysteine).

## Structure
The MTR gene encodes the human methionine synthase protein, which is crucial for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. The protein consists of 1265 amino acids and is organized into four conserved domains. These include the N-terminal domain (amino acids 21-340) responsible for homocysteine binding and methyl transferase activity, a folate binding domain (amino acids 371-627), a B12 binding domain (amino acids 671-897), and a vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase activation domain (Desai2019Predicting). 

The protein's 3D structure has been modeled using computational tools, revealing significant alterations in hydrogen bonding interactions in certain mutants compared to the native protein (Desai2019Predicting). These structural changes are particularly noted in the B12 binding domain, where specific non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) such as G682D, V744L, and V776E are located, potentially affecting the protein's stability and function (Desai2019Predicting). 

Methionine synthase can undergo post-translational modifications, including methylation and phosphorylation, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its functional properties and interactions within the methionine cycle.

## Function
The MTR gene encodes the enzyme 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, commonly known as methionine synthase. This enzyme plays a critical role in the methionine cycle by catalyzing the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor and vitamin B12 as a cofactor (Aggrey2017Gene; Felix2023Methionine). Methionine is essential for protein synthesis and serves as a precursor for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions, including DNA methylation (Bleich2014Genetic).

The activity of methionine synthase is crucial for maintaining cellular methylation balance and proper DNA synthesis, impacting various biological processes and organismal outcomes. In the cytoplasm, this enzyme ensures adequate levels of methionine and SAM, supporting cellular functions such as gene expression regulation and oxidative stress response (Aggrey2017Gene). The MTR gene's function is particularly important in tissues with high rates of cell division and methylation activity, where it helps sustain the necessary methylation reactions for normal cellular function and growth (Felix2023Methionine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MTR gene, which encodes the enzyme 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, have been linked to several health conditions. Variants in the MTR gene, such as 2186T>G and +905G>A, are associated with an increased risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) in Han Chinese populations. These variants lead to reduced MTR expression, resulting in elevated plasma homocysteine levels, a known risk factor for CHD (Zhao2013Genetic). The 2186G allele specifically shows reduced promoter activity and transcription factor binding, while the +905A allele has a stronger binding affinity to microRNAs that downregulate MTR expression (Zhao2013Genetic).

The MTR A2756G polymorphism has been associated with folate deficiency, which can exacerbate the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Individuals with the 2756AG + GG genotypes have a higher risk of folate deficiency compared to those with the AA genotype (Li2015Homocysteine). This polymorphism is also linked to an increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome (Bosco2003Methionine). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MTR gene variants in various health conditions.
