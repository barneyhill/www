# PMP2

## Overview
The PMP2 gene encodes peripheral myelin protein 2 (P2), a member of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family, which plays a pivotal role in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This small, cytoplasmic protein is primarily expressed in Schwann cells and is integral to the formation and maintenance of myelin sheaths, which are essential for efficient nerve conduction. P2 is involved in lipid transport and membrane stacking, contributing to the structural integrity and function of myelin sheaths (Uusitalo2021Human; Palaima2019Peripheral). The protein's structure, characterized by a β-barrel and two α-helices, facilitates its interaction with lipid membranes, allowing it to bind and transport lipids such as fatty acids and cholesterol (Ruskamo2017Molecular; Uusitalo2021Human). Mutations in the PMP2 gene have been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, underscoring its clinical significance in peripheral neuropathies (Baga2023A).

## Function
The PMP2 gene encodes the peripheral myelin protein 2 (P2), a small protein that plays a crucial role in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by contributing to the formation and maintenance of myelin sheaths. P2 is a member of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family and is involved in lipid transport and membrane stacking, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of myelin sheaths (Uusitalo2021Human; Palaima2019Peripheral).

In healthy human cells, P2 facilitates the stacking of lipid bilayers and potentially transports lipids such as fatty acids and cholesterol within myelin membranes. This activity is vital for the stability and proper functioning of the myelin sheath, which is necessary for efficient nerve conduction (Uusitalo2021Human; Hong2016A). The protein's structure includes a β-barrel with a cap formed by two α-helices, and it has two membrane-binding sites that allow it to interact with lipid membranes (Uusitalo2021Human).

P2 is primarily active in Schwann cells, which are responsible for myelination in peripheral nerves. It plays a role in lipid homeostasis and remyelination, supporting the structural and functional integrity of the myelin sheath (Ruskamo2017Molecular; Palaima2019Peripheral).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMP2 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies characterized by muscle weakness and sensory loss. Specifically, PMP2 mutations have been linked to a demyelinating form of CMT, known as CMT1. These mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including distal muscle weakness, sensory impairments, foot deformities, and reduced reflexes. The disease often progresses slowly and predominantly affects the lower limbs (Baga2023A).

Several specific mutations in the PMP2 gene have been identified, such as the p.Ile50del mutation, which results in the loss of isoleucine at codon 50, and the p.I43N mutation, which affects Schwann cell integrity and leads to demyelination (Hong2016A; Baga2023A). These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and can cause significant alterations in the protein's function, potentially affecting lipid homeostasis and the remyelination process of the peripheral nervous system (Palaima2019Peripheral; Hong2016A).

The identification of PMP2 mutations has expanded the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of CMT, highlighting the importance of including PMP2 in genetic testing panels for accurate diagnosis and management of the disease (Geroldi2020Early).

## Interactions
Peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2) is involved in interactions with lipid membranes, where it plays a role in membrane stacking and the formation of multilayered myelin-like assemblies. PMP2 binds to lipid membranes using two opposite faces of the protein, facilitating the stacking of lipid bilayers, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of myelin (Uusitalo2021Human). 

PMP2 has been shown to interact with cholesterol, as suggested by the presence of a CRAC cholesterol binding motif at its C terminus, indicating a potential role in cholesterol binding and transport within the myelin sheath (Ruskamo2017Molecular; Majava2010Structural). Molecular docking simulations have identified cholesterol as a potential ligand for PMP2, with the cholesterol molecule fitting well into the PMP2 binding pocket and forming hydrogen bonds with conserved residues (Majava2010Structural).

PMP2's interactions with other proteins, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), have been explored, but studies indicate that PMP2 and MBP do not substitute each other's functions in the peripheral nervous system (Zenker2014A). PMP2's role in lipid homeostasis and its interactions with lipid membranes are crucial for its function in the myelin sheath (Zenker2014A).
