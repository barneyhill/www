# PRKAB2

## Overview
The PRKAB2 gene encodes the protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit beta 2, a crucial component of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit within the heterotrimeric AMPK complex, which also includes catalytic alpha and regulatory gamma subunits. AMPK serves as a key energy sensor in eukaryotic cells, regulating metabolic pathways to maintain energy homeostasis. The beta 2 subunit, specifically, is involved in the structural integrity and regulation of the AMPK complex, featuring domains that facilitate interactions with glycogen and other metabolic regulators (Ross2016AMP‐activated; Steinberg2019AMP-activated). The PRKAB2 gene is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in cellular differentiation and energy metabolism, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and congenital heart defects (Dong2019The; Ziegler2020AMPKβ1).

## Structure
The PRKAB2 gene encodes the AMPK-β2 subunit, a protein consisting of 271 amino acids with a molecular weight of 34 kDa. The primary structure includes a conserved MGNXXS sequence at the N-terminus, which is a consensus for N-myristoylation, a modification crucial for the subunit's function and localization (Ross2016AMP‐activated). The AMPK-β2 subunit contains several important domains, including the kinase interacting sequence (KIS), association with Snf1 complex (ASC), and a glycogen-binding domain (GBD) that spans residues 68 to 163 (Sanz2008AMPActivated). The GBD is part of the carbohydrate-binding module (b-CBM) from the CBM48 family, which binds polyglucans like glycogen (Ross2016AMP‐activated).

The tertiary structure of the AMPK-β2 subunit involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, similar to the AMPK-β1 subunit when complexed with β-cyclodextrin (Sanz2008AMPActivated). In terms of quaternary structure, the AMPK-β2 subunit acts as a scaffold within the heterotrimeric AMPK complex, assembling with the α and γ subunits (Sanz2008AMPActivated).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at multiple sites, such as Ser108 and Ser182, which are necessary for AMPK activity and nuclear exclusion of the β1 subunit (Sanz2008AMPActivated). The β2 isoform is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and has a higher affinity for glycogen compared to the β1 isoform (Ross2016AMP‐activated).

## Function
The PRKAB2 gene encodes the beta 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical energy sensor in cells. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex composed of α, β, and γ subunits, with the β subunit playing a key role in the structural integrity and regulation of the complex. The beta 2 subunit, specifically, is involved in the regulation of AMPK activity through its carbohydrate binding module, which is essential for the binding of small-molecule activators and the regulation of AMPK by metabolic signals (Steinberg2019AMP-activated).

In healthy human cells, AMPK, including the beta 2 subunit, is activated in response to increased levels of AMP and ADP, which occur when ATP levels fall. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of various proteins involved in metabolic pathways, thereby promoting catabolic processes that generate ATP and inhibiting anabolic processes that consume ATP. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Steinberg2019AMP-activated).

The PRKAB2 gene is particularly important in the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into mesendoderm and cardiac lineages. The absence of AMPKβ2 impairs the differentiation potential of hiPSCs towards mesoderm and endoderm lineages, highlighting its role in early stages of cell differentiation and cardiac development (Ziegler2020AMPKβ1).

## Clinical Significance
The PRKAB2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular energy homeostasis. In pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), low expression of PRKAB2 is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including shorter overall and event-free survival, increased mortality, and tumor relapse. This suggests that PRKAB2 expression levels could serve as a prognostic biomarker for these tumors (Xavier2024Low). Treatment with Rottlerin, which increases PRKAB2 levels, has shown potential therapeutic benefits by inhibiting tumorigenic aspects in adrenocortical cancer cell lines (Xavier2024Low).

In congenital heart defects, particularly tetralogy of Fallot, copy number variations in the PRKAB2 gene have been identified, suggesting a potential role in the development of this condition. However, no such variations were found in patients with ventricular septal defects, indicating a specific association with tetralogy of Fallot (Dong2019The).

PRKAB2 has also been studied in the context of type 2 diabetes, although no significant association was found between common variants in PRKAB2 and the disease. Despite this, its location near a type 2 diabetes linkage peak suggests it remains a candidate gene for influencing diabetes risk (Sun2006Haplotype). Additionally, polymorphisms in PRKAB2 have been linked to antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients with schizophrenia, highlighting its potential role in metabolic side effects of psychiatric treatments (Souza2012Association).

## Interactions
PRKAB2, a regulatory subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, plays a significant role in cellular energy regulation by forming a heterotrimeric complex with the catalytic alpha (PRKAA) and gamma (PRKAG) subunits. This complex is crucial for AMPK's function as a cellular energy sensor, influencing metabolic pathways such as glucose uptake and lipid metabolism (Ross2016AMP‐activated).

PRKAB2 is involved in the stabilization of the AMPK complex by mediating interactions between the catalytic and regulatory subunits, which is essential for the complex's activation and function (Xavier2024Low). The beta subunits, including PRKAB2, contain a carbohydrate-binding module that interacts with glycogen, which is important for AMPK's role in energy metabolism (Ross2016AMP‐activated).

In the context of cancer, PRKAB2 is frequently amplified, suggesting its involvement in tumor cell survival under stress conditions. This amplification may be linked to its interactions with other AMPK subunits, which are necessary for maintaining the stability and activity of the AMPK complex in cancer cells (Ross2016AMP‐activated). Additionally, PRKAB2's myristoylation is suggested to facilitate its relocalization to lysosomes during glucose starvation, enhancing AMPK activation (Ross2016AMP‐activated).
