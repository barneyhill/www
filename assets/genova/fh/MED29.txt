# MED29

## Overview
MED29 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 29, a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex serves as a critical bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II machinery, facilitating the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA. MED29, specifically, is part of the Tail module of the Mediator complex, contributing to its structural integrity and function (Zhao2021Structure). The protein is characterized by its involvement in forming helical bundles that stabilize the complex, essential for transcriptional regulation (Zhao2021Structure). MED29 is highly conserved across species and is expressed in various human tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes such as growth and differentiation (Kuuselo2011MED29). Additionally, alterations in MED29 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Wu2021MED29; Yang2022A).

## Structure
The MED29 protein is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex, specifically part of the Tail module. It is organized into the upper Tail along with MED27, MED28, and MED30, forming a double bracket-like structure. These subunits are similar in size, each being 180-200 amino acids long, and are characterized by N-terminal coiled coils that interact with other subunits within the Mediator complex (Zhao2021Structure). The N-terminal coiled coils of MED27 and MED29 contact the C-terminal portion of MED16 and wrap around the MED14 C-terminus towards the Mediator core. The α-helices following the N-terminal coiled coil in MED27 and MED29 interdigitate with the MED28-30 coiled coils to form a 6-helix bundle. The C-terminal helices in MED28-30 move toward the Head jaws, forming a 4-helix bundle with C-terminal helices from MED11 and MED22. These helical bundles are stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions, contributing to the structural integrity of the upper Tail (Zhao2021Structure). The interactions of MED29 within the Mediator complex are crucial for its role in transcription regulation, although specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variants are not provided in the available context.

## Function
MED29 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. It functions as a bridge between gene-specific activators and the general transcription machinery, facilitating RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (Kuuselo2011MED29). MED29 is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is essential for both activated and basal transcription processes (Youn2016Regulation). This subunit is highly conserved across species and is widely expressed in humans during embryonic development and in adult tissues, indicating its essential role in transcriptional regulation (Kuuselo2011MED29).

In terms of molecular activity, MED29 is involved in maintaining the overall structure of the Mediator complex, which is crucial for its function in transcription (Youn2016Regulation). Although specific functions of MED29 in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context, its role in transcriptional regulation suggests it is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. The Mediator complex, including MED29, acts as a global regulator of transcription, facilitating communication between gene-specific activators and the general transcriptional machinery (Kuuselo2011MED29).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MED29 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer (OvCa), MED29 is located in the 19q13.2 region, which is often amplified in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. This amplification is associated with poor prognosis and increased MED29 mRNA levels. Overexpression of MED29 in OvCa is linked to shorter survival and is implicated in activating genes involved in cell proliferation. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing MED29 expression inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2021MED29).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MED29 is upregulated by the tRNA-derived fragment AS-tDR-007333, promoting cell proliferation and malignancy. This upregulation occurs through the HSPB1/MED29 and ELK4/MED29 axes, with AS-tDR-007333 enhancing MED29 expression via histone modifications and transcriptional regulation. The interaction between AS-tDR-007333 and MED29 suggests a role for MED29 as an oncogene in NSCLC, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target (Yang2022A).

In renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), high transcription levels of MED29 are associated with longer overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2024Systematic).

## Interactions
MED29, a component of the Mediator complex, is involved in various interactions that influence transcriptional regulation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MED29 expression is regulated by the tRNA-derived fragment AS-tDR-007333 through the HSPB1/MED29 and ELK4/MED29 pathways. AS-tDR-007333 up-regulates MED29 by enhancing the expression of the transcription factor ELK4, which binds directly to the promoter regions of the MED29 gene, thereby increasing its transcription. AS-tDR-007333 also up-regulates HSPB1, which interacts with MED29 to promote its expression (Yang2022A).

In pancreatic cancer, MED29 is part of the Mediator complex, which mediates regulatory signals from gene-specific activators to the general transcription machinery. MED29 has been shown to be amplified and overexpressed in some pancreatic cancers, and its silencing leads to reduced cell growth and survival. The dual role of MED29 as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor may depend on the cellular environment and interactions with other proteins (Kuuselo2011MED29).

Proteomic analyses have shown that MED29 is part of distinct Mediator complexes, which can vary in composition and activity. These complexes may include the kinase module and are associated with transcriptional repression, indicating that MED29 may participate in transcriptional regulation through its interactions within the Mediator complex (Paoletti2006Quantitative).
