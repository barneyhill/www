# DIP2A

## Overview
DIP2A is a gene that encodes the protein disco-interacting protein 2 homolog A, which is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly within the nervous and respiratory systems. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motif, which allows it to function as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of zinc finger domain-containing proteins during brain development (Sah2019Transcriptome). It is highly expressed in the brain, where it plays a pivotal role in axon patterning, synapse formation, and axon guidance, particularly in developing regions such as retinal ganglion cells and Purkinje cell layers (Sah2019Transcriptome). Additionally, DIP2A is involved in lung development, influencing gene expression related to cell proliferation and vasculogenesis (Sah2019Transcriptome). The protein interacts with various molecular complexes, including those involved in DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, which are essential for neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (Sah2019Transcriptome). Through these interactions, DIP2A contributes to maintaining cellular signaling and structural integrity, underscoring its importance in neuronal development and function.

## Function
The DIP2A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous and respiratory systems. It is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in axon patterning in the central nervous system, contributing to synapse formation and axon guidance. This is supported by its high expression in developing central nervous system regions such as retinal ganglion cells and Purkinje cell layers (Sah2019Transcriptome). DIP2A functions as a transcription factor due to its zinc finger motif, regulating zinc finger domain-containing proteins during brain development (Sah2019Transcriptome).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, DIP2A is involved in lung development, influencing the expression of genes related to epithelial and mesenchyme cell proliferation, vasculogenesis, and alveologenesis (Sah2019Transcriptome). At the molecular level, DIP2A forms a complex with DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1), DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and histone deacetylases (HDAC) at DNA replication sites, regulating neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (Sah2019Transcriptome). This protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to cell signaling and structural integrity. DIP2A's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in neuronal development and synaptic function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DIP2A gene have been linked to several neurological and developmental disorders. Variations in DIP2A are associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Copy number variations in DIP2A have been identified in individuals with ASD, and DIP2A knockout mice exhibit autism-like behaviors, such as repetitive behaviors and social novelty defects (noblett2018role; Ma2019Autism; Qiu2023Nexus). 

DIP2A is also implicated in developmental dyslexia, with mutations in the gene found in affected populations (noblett2018role). In addition, increased methylation of DIP2A has been linked to a significant risk for Alzheimer's disease (noblett2018role). 

The gene's role in synaptic function is highlighted by its interaction with cortactin, a protein involved in spine remodeling. This interaction is crucial for maintaining acetylated cortactin levels, which are important for synaptic transmission and spine morphology. Disruption of this interaction in DIP2A knockout mice leads to synaptic dysfunction and ASD-like behaviors (Ma2019Autism). 

These findings suggest that DIP2A plays a critical role in maintaining normal neuronal function, and its disruption can contribute to various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
DIP2A, a human gene encoding the disco-interacting protein 2 homolog A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with cortactin, a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation. DIP2A binds to the SH3 domain of cortactin through its N terminus, specifically the DIP2A 1-320 region, which contains proline-rich sequences with PXXP motifs. This interaction is crucial for the acetylation of cortactin, affecting synaptic transmission and spine morphogenesis (Ma2019Autism). In DIP2A knockout mice, reduced cortactin acetylation leads to synaptic dysfunction and autism-like behaviors, which can be rescued by acetylation mimetic cortactin (Ma2019Autism).

DIP2A also interacts with the DMAP1-HDAC2 complex, playing a role in the transcriptional regulation of MGMT in glioblastoma cells. This interaction is mediated through the DMAP1-binding domain of DIP2A and is crucial for suppressing MGMT transcription, influencing temozolomide resistance (Nie2018Fstl1DIP2AMGMT). Fstl1, a glycoprotein, can disrupt this interaction by competitively binding to DIP2A, affecting its nuclear translocation and thereby modulating MGMT expression (Nie2018Fstl1DIP2AMGMT). These interactions highlight DIP2A's role in both synaptic function and cancer resistance mechanisms.
