# LSR

## Overview
The LSR gene encodes the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism and cellular barrier functions. This receptor is integral to the hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is involved in maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis. Beyond its metabolic functions, LSR is a critical component of tricellular tight junctions in epithelial cells, where it regulates paracellular water transport and maintains barrier integrity. The protein's interactions extend to pathogenic processes, serving as a receptor for bacterial toxins and modulating oncogenic pathways, such as those involving YAP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinically, alterations in the LSR gene are linked to various diseases, including endometrial cancer and pediatric cholestatic liver disease, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Maddirevula2019Identification; AyalaTorres2021Angulin1; Dong2022LipolysisStimulated).

## Structure
The LSR (lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor) protein is a multimeric complex with several isoforms, including α, α', and β. The LSR α isoform is the complete protein sequence, featuring a clathrin binding site, a di-leucine lysosomal targeting signal at the N-terminal, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, a cysteine-rich region, and a group of alternatively negatively and positively charged amino acids at the C-terminal, which serve as the lipoprotein binding site (El2019Agerelated). The α' isoform is similar to α but lacks the di-leucine lysosomal signal, yet it still functions as a transmembrane protein. The β isoform lacks both the transmembrane domain and the di-leucine routing motif responsible for internalization and endocytosis, but it can still bind lipoproteins in the presence of fatty acids (El2019Agerelated).

The LSR protein plays a crucial role in mediating hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich ApoB, E-containing lipoproteins during the post-prandial phase and is necessary for maintaining normal peripheral circulation levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (El2019Agerelated). The structural details of LSR, including its transmembrane domains and potential post-translational modifications, contribute to its function in lipid metabolism.

## Function
The lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) plays a significant role in maintaining the barrier function of epithelial cells by being a crucial component of tricellular tight junctions (tTJs). LSR is involved in regulating paracellular water transport, particularly in tight epithelial cells, where it acts as a negative regulator of water permeability at tTJs. This regulation is more pronounced in epithelial cells with high transepithelial electrical resistance, such as MDCK C7 cells, compared to intermediate-tight cells like HT-29/B6 (AyalaTorres2021Angulin1).

LSR is also essential for the proper localization of tricellulin, another protein critical for tTJ function, and its loss can disrupt barrier integrity. The protein's role extends to influencing the expression and localization of other tight junction proteins, such as claudins and occludin, which are vital for maintaining the epithelial barrier (AyalaTorres2021Angulin1).

In addition to its role in epithelial cells, LSR is involved in lipid metabolism, where it binds and internalizes triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the liver, impacting lipid homeostasis and energy balance. This activity is crucial for maintaining metabolic health (AyalaTorres2021Angulin1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LSR gene have been implicated in several diseases. In endometrial cancer (EC), high expression of LSR is associated with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis. The LSR gene influences these processes through the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly the MEK/ERK pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of LSR in EC cells results in reduced cell invasion and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. An anti-LSR monoclonal antibody has shown significant antitumor effects in a xenograft mouse model, indicating its promise as a novel therapeutic agent for EC (Nagase2022Antilipolysisstimulated).

In pediatric cholestatic liver disease, a novel homozygous missense variant in the LSR gene has been identified as pathogenic. This variant is linked to a syndrome characterized by transient neonatal cholestasis, intellectual disability, and short stature. LSR is crucial for liver development, and its deficiency can lead to liver dysfunction and developmental abnormalities (Maddirevula2019Identification).

High folic acid intake can alter the methylation and expression of the LSR gene, disrupting cholesterol homeostasis in the liver. This dysregulation is associated with increased liver cholesterol and decreased plasma cholesterol levels, potentially leading to liver injury and altered lipid metabolism (Leclerc2021High).

## Interactions
The lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) is involved in several interactions with bacterial toxins and cellular proteins. LSR serves as a receptor for the Clostridium difficile binary toxin (CDT) and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, facilitating their entry into host cells. The binding component of CDT, known as CDTb, interacts with LSR, inducing its clustering into lipid rafts, which are specialized membrane microdomains. This clustering is crucial for the toxin's entry into cells and is dependent on the presence of CDTb (Papatheodorou2013Clostridium). Similarly, the iota toxin component Ib binds to LSR, forming an oligomer and inducing clustering in lipid raft membranes, which is essential for the toxin's cytotoxicity (Nagahama2018Interaction).

LSR also interacts with the oncogenic protein YAP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It binds to YAP1 via the PPPY motif, increasing YAP1 phosphorylation and impairing its transcriptional function. This interaction suggests a role for LSR in inhibiting HCC progression by modulating YAP1 activity (Dong2022LipolysisStimulated). These interactions highlight LSR's involvement in both pathogenic processes and cellular signaling pathways.
