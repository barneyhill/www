# ROBO3

## Overview
ROBO3 is a gene that encodes the roundabout guidance receptor 3, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in axon guidance and neuronal migration within the central nervous system. This receptor is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its multiple immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains (Pak2020NELL2Robo3). Unlike other members of the Robo family, ROBO3 is unique in its function of facilitating axonal midline crossing by modulating responses to Slit proteins, which typically mediate repulsion (Sabatier2004The; Jen2004Mutations). The protein exists in two splice isoforms, Robo3.1 and Robo3.2, which have distinct roles in axon guidance, particularly in the context of midline crossing and subsequent prevention of recrossing (Chen2008Alternative). ROBO3's interaction with ligands such as NELL2 and its involvement in complex signaling pathways underscore its critical function in neural development and its association with clinical conditions like Horizontal Gaze Palsy with Progressive Scoliosis (HGPPS) (Ungaro2018The; Pak2020NELL2Robo3).

## Structure
ROBO3, a member of the Robo family of receptors, is a type I transmembrane protein involved in axon guidance. Its molecular structure includes multiple immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III (FN) domains, which are characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Pak2020NELL2Robo3). The extracellular domain (ECD) of ROBO3 is primarily monomeric and assumes an open conformation, which is distinct from other Robo proteins like Robo1 that form dimers or higher-order oligomers (Pak2020NELL2Robo3). This open conformation facilitates the binding of NELL2, a ligand that interacts with the FN1 domain of ROBO3, crucial for axon repulsion (Pak2020NELL2Robo3).

ROBO3 exists in two splice isoforms, Robo3.1 and Robo3.2, which have identical ECDs but differ in their C-terminal regions. Robo3.1 is specifically responsive to NELL2 signaling before midline crossing in spinal commissural axons, indicating the importance of its unique C-terminus (Pak2020NELL2Robo3). The FN1 domain plays a significant role in the high-affinity binding with NELL2, and mutations or domain swaps with Robo1's FN1 domain reduce this interaction, highlighting the evolutionary specialization of ROBO3 for NELL2 binding (Pak2020NELL2Robo3).

## Function
The ROBO3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in axon guidance and neuronal migration, particularly in the central nervous system. In healthy human cells, ROBO3 is essential for the proper crossing of axons at the midline of the spinal cord, a process crucial for contralateral sensorimotor projection and overall neural circuit formation (Jen2004Mutations). Unlike other members of the roundabout family, which typically mediate repulsive signals to prevent midline crossing, ROBO3 facilitates this crossing by modulating the response to Slit proteins, which are known to repel axons (Sabatier2004The; Jen2004Mutations).

ROBO3 undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms, Robo3.1 and Robo3.2, which have distinct functions. Robo3.1 is expressed on commissural axons before and during midline crossing, where it suppresses Slit-mediated repulsion, allowing axons to cross the midline. After crossing, Robo3.2 is expressed and promotes Slit repulsion to prevent recrossing, ensuring accurate axon guidance (Chen2008Alternative). This switch from attraction to repulsion is crucial for the precise navigation of axons to their targets, highlighting the importance of alternative splicing in diversifying the function of guidance receptors like ROBO3 (Chen2008Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ROBO3 gene are associated with Horizontal Gaze Palsy with Progressive Scoliosis (HGPPS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by the absence or severe restriction of horizontal eye movements and progressive scoliosis, which typically develops during childhood and adolescence (PineroPinto2020Mutation; Ungaro2018The). The ROBO3 gene is crucial for the proper crossing of axonal pathways in the hindbrain, and mutations disrupt this process, leading to uncrossed corticospinal and dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathways (Jen2004Mutations). 

Various types of mutations in the ROBO3 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, have been identified in patients with HGPPS. These mutations result in a loss of function of the ROBO3 protein, affecting the midline crossing of neurons in the medulla during brain development (PineroPinto2020Mutation; Jen2004Mutations). Despite the severe scoliosis often associated with HGPPS, the exact mechanism linking ROBO3 mutations to scoliosis remains unclear, with some cases of scoliosis reported without detectable mutations in the ROBO3 gene (Ungaro2018The). Neuroimaging studies in affected individuals have shown structural abnormalities in the brainstem, such as a flattened pons and hypoplasia in the pontine tegmentum (PineroPinto2020Mutation).

## Interactions
ROBO3 interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in axon guidance. Unlike other Robo family members, ROBO3 does not bind Slit proteins directly. Instead, it modulates axon guidance by inhibiting Slit-mediated repulsion and enhancing Netrin-1-mediated attraction. This is achieved through phosphorylation by Netrin-1 via Src-family kinases, specifically at tyrosine 1019, although this phosphorylation does not occur through direct binding of Netrin-1 to ROBO3 (Zelina2014Signaling; Jaworski2015Operational).

ROBO3 forms a complex with the DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) protein, which acts as a receptor for Netrin-1, facilitating the phosphorylation of ROBO3. This interaction is crucial for the migration of precerebellar and spinal commissural neurons (Zelina2014Signaling).

ROBO3 also interacts with NELL2, a secreted glycoprotein that repels commissural axons. NELL2 binds specifically and with high affinity to ROBO3, mediated by the EGF-like domains of NELL2 and the FN1 domain of ROBO3. This interaction is essential for axon repulsion and guidance, particularly in the developing spinal cord (Pak2020NELL2Robo3; Jaworski2015Operational). The trimeric state of NELL2 allows it to bind three ROBO3 molecules simultaneously, suggesting a 3:3 stoichiometry in their interaction (Pak2020NELL2Robo3).
