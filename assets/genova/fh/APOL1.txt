# APOL1

## Overview
The APOL1 gene encodes the apolipoprotein L1, a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis, particularly within the kidney. Apolipoprotein L1 is a member of the apolipoprotein family and is involved in forming ion channels, which are essential for maintaining cellular ion balance (Kumar2019APOL1). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, brain, and pancreas, and is a component of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) complex in the bloodstream (Kumar2019APOL1). Notably, specific variants of the APOL1 gene, known as G1 and G2, have been linked to an increased risk of kidney diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), particularly in individuals of African descent (Anyaegbu2014Clinical; Genovese2010Association). These variants are believed to alter the protein's function, contributing to disease pathogenesis through mechanisms that may involve disrupted cellular processes and increased podocyte injury (Nichols2015Innate; Ge2021APOL1).

## Structure
The APOL1 protein is characterized by several distinct structural domains. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) features a non-classical four-helix bundle motif, which is unique to the APOL family and distinct from classical four-helix bundles found in other proteins (Ultsch2021Structures). This domain is composed of amphipathic α-helices and includes a BH3-like region, although it does not bind to Bcl-2 family proteins (Ultsch2021Structures). The NTD is involved in interactions with other proteins and may play a role in forming ion channels (Ultsch2021Structures).

The C-terminal region of APOL1 contains a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which forms an α-helical hairpin structure. This domain is involved in interactions with the serum response-associated (SRA) protein and is associated with kidney disease risk variants G1 and G2, which exhibit structural differences compared to the wild-type G0 variant (Sharma2016Structural). The G1 variant involves substitutions S342G and I384M, while the G2 variant involves a deletion of residues N388 and Y389, leading to conformational changes that affect protein stability and function (Sharma2016Structural; Mayanja2022Molecular).

APOL1 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization. Multiple splice variant isoforms of APOL1 exist, potentially differing in their structural and functional properties (Mayanja2022Molecular).

## Function
The APOL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, particularly in kidney cells. In healthy human cells, APOL1 is involved in preserving the molecular phenotype of podocytes, specialized cells crucial for kidney function. This is achieved through the regulation of the APOL1-miR193a axis, where the non-risk variant of APOL1 (APOL1NR) downregulates miR193a, a microRNA that can induce oxidative stress and cell death in podocytes. By downregulating miR193a, APOL1NR helps maintain podocyte structure and function, preventing cell death and de-differentiation (Kumar2019APOL1).

APOL1 is also implicated in autophagy, a process essential for cellular integrity. It can induce autophagy, maintaining adequate autophagy flux under normal conditions, which is crucial for the survival and function of podocytes (Kumar2019APOL1). The protein is involved in ion transport, acting as an ion channel that can form chloride-selective channels in lipid bilayers and generate pores in phospholipid vesicles (Kumar2019APOL1).

APOL1 is expressed in various cell types, including kidney, brain, pancreas, and macrophages, and is a component of the circulating HDL complex (Kumar2019APOL1). Its role in maintaining the stability of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes is crucial for supporting the glomerular basement membrane (Kumar2019APOL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the APOL1 gene, specifically the G1 and G2 variants, are strongly associated with an increased risk of kidney diseases, particularly in individuals of African descent. These variants are linked to conditions such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and hypertension-attributed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Anyaegbu2014Clinical; Genovese2010Association). The presence of two APOL1 risk alleles significantly elevates the risk of non-diabetic nephropathy, leading to faster disease progression and earlier initiation of renal replacement therapy (Anyaegbu2014Clinical).

APOL1 variants are also implicated in lupus nephritis (LN) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated ESRD, with a notable ethnic disparity in disease prevalence between African Americans and European Americans (Freedman2014End‐Stage). The G1 and G2 alleles are associated with a 17-fold increased risk for FSGS and a 29-fold increased risk for HIVAN (Anyaegbu2014Clinical).

The APOL1 risk variants may act as toxic gain-of-function mutations, contributing to various clinical phenotypes and histopathologies. These variants are thought to interfere with normal cellular processes, such as lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function, leading to podocyte injury and renal disease (Nichols2015Innate; Ge2021APOL1).

## Interactions
APOL1 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes and influencing cellular processes. It interacts with APOL3, affecting the formation of the APOL3-NCS-1 complex. APOL1, when in excess, reduces the interaction between APOL3 and NCS-1, while the APOL1D variant increases NCS-1 binding, suggesting a tripartite APOL1D-APOL3-NCS-1 complex. However, neither APOL1 nor APOL1D can bind to the preformed APOL3-NCS-1 complex. The G1 and G2 variants of APOL1 behave similarly to APOL1, reducing the interaction between APOL3 and NCS-1 (Uzureau2020APOL1).

APOL1 also interacts with SNARE proteins, particularly VAMP8. The interaction between APOL1 and VAMP8 is confirmed through biochemical methods, but the G1 and G2 variants attenuate this interaction, suggesting that these variants stabilize a closed state of APOL1, reducing its ability to interact with VAMP8. This reduced interaction may lead to disordered vesicular trafficking in podocytes, contributing to kidney injury (Madhavan2017APOL1).

APOL1 is found in large serum complexes, referred to as complex A and complex B, which contain APOL1, APOA1, and HPR, with novel components like complement C3 and fibronectin identified in these complexes (Weckerle2016Characterization).
