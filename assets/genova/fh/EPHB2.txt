# EPHB2

## Overview
EPHB2 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor B2, a member of the Eph receptor family, which are receptor tyrosine kinases. These receptors are integral to numerous cellular processes, including cell signaling, growth, migration, and adhesion. EPH receptor B2 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular organization and tissue architecture, particularly in the nervous and immune systems. It is involved in synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, and immune cell trafficking, highlighting its importance in both neuronal connectivity and immune responses (Darling2019Emerging; Palmer2003Multiple). The gene is located on chromosome 1p36.12 in humans and is implicated in various cancers, such as prostate and colorectal cancer, where it often functions as a tumor suppressor (Huusko2004Nonsensemediated; Lugli2005EphB2).

## Structure
The EPHB2 protein is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase encoded on chromosome 1p36.12 in humans. It consists of 1,055 amino acids and exhibits a prototypical receptor tyrosine kinase topology (Liu2022The). The primary structure of EPHB2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, while the secondary structure features elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets.

The tertiary structure of EPHB2 is characterized by a multidomain extracellular region, a membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular region. The extracellular region comprises two fibronectin type-III repeats, a cysteine-rich domain with an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif, and an ephrin-binding region. The ephrin-binding region is spherical and accommodates a hydrophobic loop from the ephrin ligand (Liu2022The). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of EPHB2 is noted for its jelly-roll folding topology (Goldgur2009Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, EPHB2 undergoes dimerization upon ligand binding, facilitated by the sterile-α-motif (SAM) domain, which also aids in receptor homo-dimerization and oligomerization (Liu2022The). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, with two conserved autophosphorylation sites (tyrosines 605 and 611) in the juxtamembrane region, crucial for its kinase activity (Liu2022The). EPHB2 also has several splice variant isoforms that can affect its function and localization.

## Function
EPHB2, a member of the Eph receptor family, is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes. It plays a significant role in cell signaling, influencing cell growth, migration, adhesion, and polarity. EPHB2 is crucial for maintaining cellular organization and tissue architecture, particularly in the intestinal epithelium, where it helps control the positioning of cells and prevents inappropriate intermingling of distinct cell types (Huusko2004Nonsensemediated; Palmer2003Multiple).

In the immune system, EPHB2 modulates dendritic cell responsiveness and is involved in T cell activation and differentiation. It enhances T cell receptor signaling and is implicated in immune cell trafficking, which is essential for immune surveillance (Darling2019Emerging). EPHB2 also plays a role in hematopoiesis, influencing the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Darling2019Emerging).

In the nervous system, EPHB2 is involved in synaptic plasticity and axon guidance. It promotes the clustering of NMDA receptors, essential for synapse formation, and is involved in dendritic spine formation, which is crucial for neuronal connectivity and function (Palmer2003Multiple). EPHB2's interactions with ephrin ligands mediate changes in cellular shape and motility, contributing to its diverse roles in development and tissue homeostasis (Darling2019Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EPHB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably prostate and colorectal cancer. In prostate cancer, EPHB2 mutations, including nonsense and missense mutations, are associated with increased cancer cell proliferation and aggressiveness. The DU 145 prostate cancer cell line, originating from a brain metastasis, carries a truncating mutation in EPHB2, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Liu2022The; Huusko2004Nonsensemediated). The expression of wild-type EphB2 in these cells suppresses growth, indicating its function as a tumor suppressor (Huusko2004Nonsensemediated).

In colorectal cancer, EPHB2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to advanced disease and poor survival. Mutational inactivation of EPHB2 is rare in colorectal cancer, but its expression is crucial for maintaining cellular architecture in the intestinal crypt (Liu2022The; Lugli2005EphB2). Germline variants of EPHB2, such as G787R, have been identified in familial colorectal cancer, suggesting a role in tumor progression rather than initiation (Zogopoulos2008Germline).

EPHB2 is also involved in other cancers, such as gastric and breast cancer, where its expression levels influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Liu2022The).

## Interactions
EPHB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its signaling functions. One significant interaction involves the formation of a complex with Src family kinases, which requires the phosphorylation of tyrosine 611 in the juxtamembrane region of EPHB2. This phosphorylation is essential for binding to the SH2 domains of Src, Yes, and Fyn, with a preference for Src, highlighting the role of EPHB2 in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (Zisch1998Complex).

EPHB2 also interacts with the Abl and Arg kinases, members of the Abl family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. These interactions are important for tissue morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization, particularly in the developing nervous system. The SH2 domains of Abl and Arg bind to phosphorylated motifs in EPHB2, and there are additional phosphorylation-independent interactions involving non-conserved sequences in the C-terminal tails of Abl and Arg (Yu2001Multiple).

In the context of ephrinB1 stimulation, EPHB2 forms a complex with STAM1 and HRS, proteins known to down-regulate receptor tyrosine kinases, suggesting a role in EPHB2 down-regulation. The WAVE2 complex and its components are also identified as interacting with EPHB2 upon stimulation, indicating potential changes in protein interactions (Darie2011Identifying).
