# PSMD7

## Overview
PSMD7 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 7, a crucial component of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein is part of the 19S regulatory particle, which plays a significant role in the ATP-independent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. As a non-ATPase regulatory subunit, PSMD7 is involved in the recognition, deubiquitylation, and subsequent degradation of poly-ubiquitylated substrates, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. The proteasome's function is vital for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. PSMD7's activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, which can lead to cellular dysfunction and disease (Xu2021PSMD7; Luo2024Deubiquitinase).

## Function
The PSMD7 gene encodes a component of the 26S proteasome, specifically the non-ATPase regulatory subunit 7, which is part of the 19S regulatory particle. This subunit is crucial for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells. The 26S proteasome is responsible for the regulated degradation of proteins, which is vital for various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and signal transduction. PSMD7 facilitates the recognition, deubiquitylation, and degradation of poly-ubiquitylated substrates, preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins that can lead to cellular dysfunction (Xu2021PSMD7).

In healthy human cells, PSMD7 functions in cell proliferation and apoptosis and aids in the nuclear export of various crucial proteins to the cytoplasm for protein stabilization. It acts as an ATP-independent constituent of the proteasome, interacting with PSMD14 to form a functional complex (Luo2024Deubiquitinase). PSMD7 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular functions by ensuring proper protein degradation and recycling, which is essential for maintaining cellular and organismal health (Xu2021PSMD7).

## Clinical Significance
PSMD7 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PSMD7 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones. This overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, such as reduced overall survival and disease-free survival, and is linked to lymph node invasion and tumor laterality. Knockdown of PSMD7 in LUAD cells results in reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2021PSMD7).

In breast cancer, high PSMD7 expression correlates with poor distant metastasis-free survival, indicating its oncogenic role in cancer progression. The gene is part of a broader network of PSMD family genes that are upregulated in breast cancer tissues, contributing to tumor growth and poor prognosis (Xuan2021Prognostic).

PSMD7 is also considered an oncogene in prostate cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and breast cancer, where its knockout induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer progression and cell cycle regulation (Li2023PSMD8).

In acute myeloid leukemia, high PSMD7 expression is associated with poor survival, further underscoring its clinical significance across different cancer types (Li2021Integrated).

## Interactions
PSMD7 is a component of the 26S proteasome, a complex involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. It interacts with other proteasome subunits, such as PSMD14, to regulate the degradation process. This interaction is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle and apoptosis (Xu2021PSMD7).

In pancreatic cancer cells, PSMD7 interacts with the transcription factor SOX2. This interaction occurs primarily through the HMG domain of SOX2, where PSMD7 acts as a deubiquitinase to stabilize SOX2 by preventing its proteasomal degradation. This stabilization enhances the Notch1 signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Luo2024Deubiquitinase).

In lung adenocarcinoma, PSMD7 is involved in the regulation of the p53 pathway. Its knockdown leads to increased levels of p53 and its downstream targets, such as p21 and Puma, indicating that PSMD7 may interact with components of the p53 pathway to influence cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Xu2021PSMD7).
