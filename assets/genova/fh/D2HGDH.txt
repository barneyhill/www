# D2HGDH

## Overview
The D2HGDH gene encodes the enzyme D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial flavoprotein that plays a critical role in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) to alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG), a process essential for maintaining metabolic balance and proper functioning of a-KG-dependent dioxygenases involved in epigenetic regulation (Lin2015D2HGDH). D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase is a member of the VAO/PCMH flavoprotein family and functions as a dimer, with its activity linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain through interaction with the electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF) (Yang2021Structure; Toplak2019Biochemical). Mutations in the D2HGDH gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, characterized by the accumulation of D-2-HG, and have been implicated in certain cancers, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Pop2019D‐2‐hydroxyglutaric; Lin2015D2HGDH).

## Structure
The human D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D-2-HGDH) protein is a member of the VAO/PCMH flavoprotein family and consists of 521 amino acids (Yang2021Structure). Its structure includes a conserved FAD-binding domain and a variable substrate-binding domain, along with a small C-terminal domain (Yang2021Structure). The FAD-binding domain adopts a classical PCMH-type fold, comprising two subdomains: subdomain a (residues 51-153) with a three-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices, and subdomain b (residues 154-276) with a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices (Yang2021Structure). The substrate-binding domain (residues 277-479) features a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Yang2021Structure). The small C-terminal domain (residues 480-521) includes an α-helix and a 3_10 helix, which shield the FAD-binding site from the solvent (Yang2021Structure).

The active site of D-2-HGDH is located at the interface of the FAD-binding and substrate-binding domains, and it is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Yang2021Structure). The protein binds a Zn2+ ion at the active site, which is essential for substrate binding and activity (Yang2021Structure). The FAD cofactor is non-covalently bound, differing from other family members where it is covalently attached (Yang2021Structure). The protein functions as a dimer in solution (Toplak2019Biochemical).

## Function
The D2HGDH gene encodes the enzyme D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by converting D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) into alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG) in mitochondria. This conversion is essential for maintaining the balance of a-KG and D-2-HG, which is important for the proper functioning of a-KG-dependent dioxygenases involved in epigenetic regulation, including histone and DNA methylation (Lin2015D2HGDH). 

D2HGDH activity prevents the accumulation of D-2-HG, a byproduct of cellular metabolism that can be toxic if it accumulates. The enzyme also influences mitochondrial metabolism by modulating the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), thereby contributing to the cellular pool of a-KG (Lin2015D2HGDH). This regulation is significant for epigenetic remodeling, which affects gene expression and cellular differentiation (Lin2015D2HGDH).

The enzyme's activity is linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain through its interaction with the electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF), which serves as its natural electron acceptor, crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy production (Toplak2019Biochemical). Mutations in the D2HGDH gene can lead to a loss of enzymatic activity, resulting in the accumulation of D-2-HG and associated metabolic disorders (Pop2019D‐2‐hydroxyglutaric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the D2HGDH gene are associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA), a neurometabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in body fluids. This condition presents with symptoms such as developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. D-2-HGA has both mild and severe phenotypes, with the severe form often involving early-infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy (Struys2005Mutations; Kranendijk2012Progress). 

D-2-HGA is classified into two types: Type I, associated with D2HGDH mutations, and Type II, which involves different genetic factors. Type I is linked to impaired enzyme function due to mutations, leading to the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (Kranendijk2010Evidence). 

In addition to D-2-HGA, missense heterozygous mutations in D2HGDH have been identified in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). These mutations result in the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, affecting histone demethylases and DNA dioxygenases, and contributing to cancer progression (Yang2021Structure; Lin2015D2HGDH).

## Interactions
D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) is known to interact with the human electron transfer flavoprotein (hETF), which acts as a central electron acceptor for several dehydrogenases in the mitochondrial matrix. This interaction is significant as it links the oxidation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The electron transfer from D2HGDH to hETF was confirmed by observing changes in the UV-visible absorption spectrum of hETF, indicating the formation of an anionic flavin semiquinone species, although this radical flavin species was not stable and further reduced to the hydroquinone form (Toplak2019Biochemical).

D2HGDH also interacts with IDH2, a mitochondrial enzyme, influencing its expression and activity. This interaction suggests that D2HGDH may regulate intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate levels by modulating IDH2 function, acting as a rheostat for IDH2 and affecting alpha-ketoglutarate levels and potentially influencing epigenetic modifiers (Lin2015D2HGDH). These interactions highlight the role of D2HGDH in cellular metabolism and its potential impact on metabolic and epigenetic processes.
