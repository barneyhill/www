# COX10

## Overview
The COX10 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor heme A:farnesyltransferase COX10, a crucial enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is a multi-pass transmembrane enzyme belonging to the UbiA prenyltransferase family, and it plays a vital role in the biosynthesis of heme A, an essential component of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV (Pei2021Human; TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). COX10 facilitates the conversion of heme B to heme O, which is subsequently transformed into heme A, a process critical for the proper assembly and function of COX (Soto2012Biogenesis). The protein is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and forms a multimeric complex necessary for its function (Khalimonchuk2012Oligomerization). Mutations in the COX10 gene can lead to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and associated clinical conditions such as Leigh syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Voges2024Phenotypic; Valnot2000A).

## Structure
The COX10 protein is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with 9 transmembrane segments, consistent with its classification in the UbiA prenyltransferase family (Pei2021Human). It is involved in the biosynthesis of heme A, a crucial component for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) function, by converting heme B to heme O, which is then converted to heme A (Soto2012Biogenesis; TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). The protein forms a multimeric complex, likely a homo-oligomer, which is essential for its function (Khalimonchuk2012Oligomerization). 

The COX10 protein has a significant primary sequence similarity to the ORF1 product of Paracoccus denitrificans, with 24% identical residues and a large percentage of conservative substitutions (Nobrega1990COX10). The protein's structure includes transmembrane segments that are part of the cap domains, which connect transmembrane helices near the active site (Pei2021Human). The oligomerization of COX10 is linked to the synthesis of the CcO subunit Cox1 and is mediated by the assembly factor Coa2, although oligomerization and catalytic activation are separate processes (Khalimonchuk2012Oligomerization). Specific mutations, such as D336V, can result in a catalytically inactive enzyme that still oligomerizes (Khalimonchuk2012Oligomerization).

## Function
The COX10 gene encodes a protein known as heme A:farnesyltransferase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of heme A, a prosthetic group essential for the catalytic activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Diaz2005Mice; Valnot2000A). This enzyme facilitates the conversion of protoheme to heme O, which is then converted to heme A, the prosthetic group of the COXI subunit in COX (Valnot2000A). The COX10 protein is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and contains multiple transmembrane domains, which are important for its function in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Diaz2005Mice; Valnot2000A).

COX10's activity is essential for the proper assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase, which catalyzes the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, a process coupled with proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Diaz2005Mice). This function is vital for cellular respiration and energy production in healthy human cells, impacting overall organismal energy homeostasis (Diaz2005Mice; Chen2010Hypoxiaregulated). Mutations in COX10 can lead to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, affecting mitochondrial function and energy production (Valnot2000A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the COX10 gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions. COX10 mutations can lead to mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome, a rare genetic condition characterized by progressive neuromuscular defects. These mutations result in mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically affecting oxidative phosphorylation, which is crucial for energy production (Voges2024Phenotypic). In patients with Leigh-like disease, mutations in the COX10 gene have been linked to reduced cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity, leading to severe neurological symptoms and rapid disease progression (Coenen2004Cytochrome).

In addition to neurological disorders, COX10 mutations are implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition that can cause sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes. A specific polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the COX10 gene has been associated with an increased risk of SCD in Chinese populations, potentially due to its effect on COX10 expression levels (Yang2021A).

Mouse models with COX10 gene disruptions in skeletal muscle exhibit phenotypes similar to human mitochondrial myopathies, including muscle weakness and increased fatigability, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining normal mitochondrial function (Diaz2005Mice). These findings underscore the clinical significance of COX10 in various mitochondrial-related diseases.

## Interactions
COX10 is involved in the biosynthesis of heme A, a critical component of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). It interacts with various proteins during the assembly and function of CcO. In yeast, COX10 forms a high-mass complex distinct from the COX15 complex, indicating its role in heme a formation and interaction with proteins involved in CcO biogenesis, such as Mss51, Coa1, and Shy1 (Bestwick2010The). The N196K mutation in COX10 enhances the abundance of this complex, suggesting a specific interaction with Cox1 levels (Bestwick2010The).

In humans, COX10 interacts with COA8, potentially forming a subunit of the heme farnesyltransferase complex. This interaction is characterized by high contact probability scores and involves COA8 forming two long α-helices that interact with COX10's transmembrane segments (Pei2021Human). The interaction is part of the cap domains, which are connections between transmembrane helices near the active site. A missense mutation in COA8, F118S, lies in the predicted interface of the COA8-COX10 complex, highlighting the significance of this interaction in mitochondrial disorders (Pei2021Human).

COX10 also forms complexes with COX11, COX15, and COA3 in early apo-metallochaperone modules, crucial for coordinating COX1 synthesis and CcO assembly (Nývltová2022Coordination).
