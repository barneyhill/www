# HAO1

## Overview
The HAO1 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxyacid oxidase 1, commonly referred to as glycolate oxidase, which is a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent oxidase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolic pathway that converts glycolate to glyoxylate, a critical step in glyoxylate metabolism, predominantly occurring in the peroxisomes of liver cells (McGregor2020Characterising; McGregor2019Deep). Hydroxyacid oxidase 1 is characterized by its β8/α8-barrel fold and forms a homodimer, which is typical of the α-hydroxy acid oxidase family (Murray2008Active; Mackinnon2022Novel). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining normal oxalate levels in the body, and its dysregulation is associated with conditions such as primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and kidney stone disease (McGregor2020Characterising; Rungroj2014A). Due to its role in oxalate production, HAO1 is a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing oxalate levels, with research exploring various inhibitors and genetic approaches to modulate its activity (Lee2021Discovery; Kletzmayr2020Investigational).

## Structure
The HAO1 protein, also known as glycolate oxidase, is a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent enzyme that primarily catalyzes the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. The enzyme's structure includes a FMN binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Murray2008Active). The active site of HAO1 contains several conserved residues, including Tyr26, Trp110, Tyr132, Arg167, Lys236, His260, and Arg263, which are important for substrate binding and catalysis (Murray2008Active). The enzyme exhibits a β8/α8-barrel fold typical of the α-hydroxy acid oxidase family (Murray2008Active).

HAO1 typically forms a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure (Mackinnon2022Novel). The protein also features a flexible gating loop, which plays a role in shielding the active site during catalysis (Mackinnon2022Novel). This loop is poorly conserved within the hydroxy acid oxidase family, contributing to the enzyme's substrate specificity (Mackinnon2022Novel).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may affect the activity and stability of HAO1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variant isoforms of HAO1 may exist, potentially altering its function or localization, but specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The HAO1 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxyacid oxidase 1, also known as glycolate oxidase, which is primarily active in the peroxisomes of hepatocytes in the liver. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glycolate by catalyzing its oxidation to glyoxylate, a key step in glyoxylate metabolism (McGregor2020Characterising; McGregor2019Deep). Glyoxylate is subsequently converted to glycine by the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) in the liver, which is essential for maintaining normal oxalate levels in the body (Lee2021Discovery).

In healthy cells, the proper functioning of HAO1 is vital for preventing the overproduction of oxalate, which can lead to conditions such as primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) (McGregor2020Characterising). The enzyme's activity is not limited to glycolate; it also metabolizes 2-hydroxy fatty acids, indicating its involvement in broader metabolic processes (McGregor2020Characterising). The suppression of HAO1 is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to decrease oxalate production, as reducing glycolate oxidase activity can lead to increased glycolate levels, which are more soluble and can be excreted by the kidneys (McGregor2020Characterising; McGregor2019Deep).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HAO1 gene, which encodes glycolate oxidase, have significant clinical implications. HAO1 is involved in the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate and subsequently to oxalate, a key metabolite in kidney stone formation. Variants in the HAO1 gene have been associated with kidney stone disease (KSD), with studies identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that show significant differences in allele frequencies between patients and controls. Certain haplotypes of HAO1 are linked to increased or decreased risks of KSD, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease (Rungroj2014A).

In primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a condition characterized by excessive oxalate production, the inability to convert glyoxylate to glycine leads to oxalate accumulation, contributing to kidney stone formation. Targeting HAO1 to reduce glyoxylate and oxalate levels has been explored as a therapeutic strategy, with approaches like siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 showing promise in reducing oxalate levels in animal models (Kletzmayr2020Investigational).

Altered expression of HAO1 is also implicated in bone health. Increased expression of HAO1, as observed in studies involving soft drink consumption, is associated with oxidative stress, which can disrupt bone remodeling and contribute to conditions like osteoporosis (Shaalan2022Impact).

## Interactions
Hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) is involved in the metabolism of glycolate and other hydroxy acids. The protein's interactions are primarily related to its role in the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways. HAO1 has been studied for its interactions with various inhibitors, which are of interest for therapeutic applications in conditions like primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). 

Research has identified several inhibitors that interact with HAO1, affecting its activity. For instance, compounds identified through DNA-encoded chemical library screening have shown competitive binding to HAO1, with some compounds demonstrating significant inhibitory effects (Lee2021Discovery). The binding interactions of these inhibitors with HAO1 have been characterized using techniques such as surface plasmon resonance and X-ray crystallography, revealing interactions with specific amino acid residues like Arg167, Arg263, His260, and Tyr132 (Lee2021Discovery).

Additionally, luminescence-based complementation assays have been used to assess the target engagement and cell permeability of HAO1 inhibitors. These studies have shown that certain compounds can stabilize the HAO1 protein in cells, indicating a strong interaction between the inhibitors and the enzyme (Mackinnon2024Luminescencebased). These interactions are crucial for developing effective HAO1 inhibitors for therapeutic use.
