# CYP2S1

## Overview
CYP2S1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily S member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids and retinoic acid, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammation and cellular signaling (Bui2010Human; Madanayake2013A). CYP2S1 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, where it contributes to the metabolism of both endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, suggesting its role in detoxification and metabolic homeostasis (Rylander2001Identification; Saarikoski2005Localization). The enzyme's involvement in lipid metabolism and its expression in specific tissues underscore its functional significance in maintaining physiological balance. Additionally, CYP2S1 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly those with the BRAF V600E mutation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020CYP2S1).

## Structure
The human CYP2S1 gene encodes a protein that is 504 amino acids long with a calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kDa (Deb2009Characterization). The primary structure of CYP2S1 includes a N-terminal hydrophobic stretch, a proline-rich region, and a conserved cysteine in the C-terminal region, which serves as the fifth ligand for the heme iron, a characteristic feature of the cytochrome P450 family (Deb2009Characterization). The secondary and tertiary structures are suggested to be conserved across species, as indicated by hydrophobicity analysis, although specific details on these structures are not provided (Deb2009Characterization). The protein has not been purified from mammalian tissue, and there is limited information on its quaternary structure, specific domains, prominent folds, common post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms (Shrivas2013Mass; Deb2009Characterization). The molecular mass of the purified CYP2S1 expressed in Escherichia coli is approximately 50 ± 5 kDa, as confirmed by mass spectrometry (Mrízová2016Heterologous). Despite the lack of detailed structural information, CYP2S1 is known to be involved in the metabolism of certain compounds, indicating its functional significance (Mrízová2016Heterologous).

## Function
CYP2S1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids and retinoic acid, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. It metabolizes eicosanoids derived from cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways, including prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), converting them into products like 12-HHT and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) (Bui2010Human). This activity suggests a role in modulating bioactive lipid levels, impacting inflammation and vascular function (Bui2010Human).

CYP2S1 is also involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A crucial for cellular signaling and transcription regulation. Depletion of CYP2S1 in bronchial epithelial cells leads to changes in retinoic acid metabolism, indicating its contribution to this pathway (Madanayake2013A). The enzyme's activity in metabolizing polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, further supports its role in lipid metabolism (Fekry2019A).

CYP2S1 is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, including the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, where it contributes to the metabolism of both endogenous compounds and xenobiotics (Rylander2001Identification; Saarikoski2005Localization). Its expression in these tissues suggests a role in detoxification and metabolic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
CYP2S1 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly thyroid cancers driven by the BRAF V600E mutation. In these cancers, CYP2S1 is highly expressed and acts as a synthetic lethal partner with BRAF V600E, meaning that its inhibition can lead to cell death specifically in cancer cells harboring this mutation. This makes CYP2S1 a potential therapeutic target for treating BRAF V600E-mutated thyroid cancers (Li2020CYP2S1). The gene's expression is upregulated through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is activated by BRAF V600E, and involves a feedback loop with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) that amplifies the oncogenic signal (Li2020CYP2S1).

CYP2S1 is also involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, which are linked to inflammation and cancer progression. Its role in metabolizing these compounds suggests a potential impact on inflammatory processes and cancer, although specific diseases directly associated with CYP2S1 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Bui2010Human). Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2S1 have been associated with various malignant tumors, including colorectal cancer and non-small-cell carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer susceptibility and progression (Kang2018Genetic).
