# LILRB5

## Overview
LILRB5 is a gene that encodes the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B5, a transmembrane receptor involved in immune regulation. This receptor is primarily expressed on immune cells such as T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. LILRB5 interacts with HLA-class I molecules, particularly binding to HLA-B27 dimers, which suggests its involvement in immune cell activation and the pathogenesis of diseases associated with HLA-B27 expression (Zhang2015The). Additionally, LILRB5 is implicated in the proliferation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, enhancing immune responses against mycobacterial infections (Hogan2016Expression). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with statin therapy response and its altered expression in hepatocellular carcinoma, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tornio2023The; Fan2021Expression).

## Function
LILRB5 is an inhibitory receptor involved in immune regulation, primarily expressed on T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. It plays a role in modulating immune responses by interacting with HLA-class I molecules, specifically binding to HLA-class I heavy chains, including HLA-B27 dimers (Zhang2015The). This interaction suggests a regulatory function in immune cell activation and response, potentially influencing the pathogenesis of diseases associated with HLA-B27 expression (Zhang2015The).

LILRB5 is also implicated in enhancing the proliferation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which are crucial for anti-mycobacterial responses. This effect is observed when LILRB5 is crosslinked, indicating its role in T cell proliferation and immune response modulation during mycobacterial infections (Hogan2016Expression). The receptor's expression is up-regulated following exposure to mycobacteria, suggesting its involvement in the immune response to such infections (Hogan2016Expression).

The receptor is classified as a Class II receptor and is found in various immune cells, including monocytes, T-cells, NK cells, and mast cells, with known ligands such as the HLA-B27 free heavy chain and ANGPTL (Storm2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LILRB5 gene have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in the context of statin therapy and immune response. The LILRB5 Gly247Asp genotype influences the response to atorvastatin, a commonly used statin. Individuals with the Gly247Gly genotype experience a better cholesterol-lowering effect and reduced statin intolerance compared to those with the Asp247Asp genotype. The Asp247Asp genotype is linked to increased creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating muscle damage, and poorer adherence to statin therapy due to muscle symptoms (Tornio2023The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LILRB5 expression is altered on immune cells. It is significantly increased on CD14+CD16+ monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages in HCC patients, suggesting a role in the immunosuppressive environment of tumors. This altered expression may impact immune responses and tumor progression, highlighting LILRB5 as a potential target for immunotherapy (Fan2021Expression).

The LILRB5 gene is also implicated in the regulation of serum CK levels, which are relevant in the context of statin-induced myopathy. Variations in LILRB5 may influence CK clearance, affecting muscle-related symptoms in statin users (Dubé2014CKM; Hirayasu2015Functional).

## Interactions
LILRB5 interacts with HLA-class I molecules, specifically binding to HLA-B27 β2microglobulin-free heavy chain dimers. This interaction is distinct from other LILR family members, as LILRB5 does not bind to β2microglobulin and peptide-associated HLA-A3, HLA-B7, and HLA-B27 heterodimers. The binding of B27 dimers to LILRB5 can be inhibited by the HLA-class I heavy chain antibody HC10, indicating a specific interaction between LILRB5 and these class I heavy chains (Zhang2015The).

LILRB5 is also involved in interactions with mycobacterial components. It has been shown that BCG, a strain of Mycobacterium bovis, can interact with LILRB5 to induce signaling through a CD3ζ construct, suggesting a direct engagement of LILRB5 with mycobacterial elements. However, this interaction was not observed with the H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating specificity in its interactions with different mycobacterial strains (Hogan2016Expression).

These interactions suggest that LILRB5 plays a role in modulating immune responses through its binding to specific ligands, including HLA-class I molecules and mycobacterial components, potentially influencing immune cell activation and function.
