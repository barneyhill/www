# CLEC16A

## Overview
CLEC16A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 16A, which is a member of the C-type lectin (CLEC) protein family. Unlike typical members of this family, the protein lacks a full-length carbohydrate recognition domain and instead functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes such as autophagy and mitophagy, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and mitochondrial quality control (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An; Smits2022CLEC16A). CLEC16A is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, and its expression is crucial for immune function, particularly in the regulation of HLA class II expression and antigen presentation (Smits2022CLEC16A; van2015Multiple). The gene has been implicated in various autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in both immune regulation and cellular health (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An).

## Structure
The CLEC16A gene encodes a protein that is part of the C-type lectin (CLEC) protein family, although it lacks a full-length carbohydrate recognition domain typical of this family. Instead, it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in autophagy and mitophagy (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An; Smits2022CLEC16A). The protein contains an atypical C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An).

CLEC16A has an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) at its C terminus, which is crucial for mitochondrial quality control and mitophagy. This region is enriched in disorder-promoting amino acids like proline and serine, contributing to its flexible conformation (Gingerich2021The). The IDPR is essential for the protein's stability and function, preventing self-ubiquitination and degradation (Gingerich2021The).

CLEC16A is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a full-length 24-exon transcript and a shorter 21-exon variant with a truncated C terminus (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An; Smits2022CLEC16A). The loss of the C-terminal IDPR in some splice variants is associated with disease (Gingerich2021The).

## Function
CLEC16A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in immune function and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, CLEC16A plays a significant role in endosomal trafficking, interacting with proteins such as TRIM27 and components of the retromer complex, including VPS35. This interaction is crucial for regulating endosomal sorting and recycling, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Smits2022CLEC16A).

CLEC16A is also involved in the regulation of mitophagy, a process that ensures the removal of damaged mitochondria, thereby maintaining mitochondrial health. It forms a complex with Nrdp1 and USP8 to promote mitophagic processes, protecting cells from mitochondria-induced cell death (Smits2022CLEC16A). The gene's role in these processes is highlighted by its involvement in ubiquitination pathways that regulate protein degradation and actin polymerization, which are critical for proper endosomal function (Smits2022CLEC16A).

In the immune system, CLEC16A is involved in the regulation of HLA class II expression and antigen presentation, particularly in antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and B cells. It influences the biogenesis of late endosomes, where HLA class II molecules accumulate, and is essential for their proper trafficking and surface expression (van2015Multiple; Rijvers2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLEC16A gene are associated with a range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. CLEC16A is implicated in 18 autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease, among others (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An). The gene's role in regulating autophagy and mitophagy is crucial for cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to the accumulation of defective mitochondria, contributing to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An).

CLEC16A variants have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, persistent ER stress, and inflammation, which are factors in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CLEC16A, such as rs6498169 and rs12708716, have been associated with multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions (Fan2022Autoimmune; Berge2013From). The gene's interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NRDP1 is disrupted in Parkinson's disease, leading to mitochondrial death and dysfunction in mitophagy and autophagy (Pandey2023CLEC16A—An). These findings highlight CLEC16A's significant role in both immune regulation and neurodegeneration.

## Interactions
CLEC16A is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for cellular processes such as mitophagy and endosomal trafficking. It forms a ubiquitin-dependent tripartite complex with Nrdp1 (RNF41) and USP8, which is essential for regulating mitophagy in pancreatic β-cells. This complex is important for maintaining mitochondrial quality control and is sensitive to cellular stress, such as glucolipotoxicity, which can disrupt its formation (Pearson2017Clec16a). CLEC16A directly ubiquitinates Nrdp1 with non-degradative conjugates, which is crucial for the stability and function of the complex (Pearson2017Clec16a).

CLEC16A also interacts with the retromer complex and TRIM27, playing a significant role in endosomal trafficking and neurodevelopment. The interaction with TRIM27 is specific, as demonstrated by the loss of interaction in a truncated variant of CLEC16A (CLEC16A-Δ19) (Smits2022CLEC16A). These interactions influence the accumulation of F-actin on VPS35-positive vesicles, affecting endosomal recycling (Smits2022CLEC16A). The loss of CLEC16A impairs these processes, leading to neurodevelopmental issues, as observed in zebrafish models (Smits2022CLEC16A). The C-terminal intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) of CLEC16A is crucial for its stability and the assembly of the mitophagy complex (Gingerich2021The).
