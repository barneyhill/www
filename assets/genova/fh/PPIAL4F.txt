# PPIAL4F

## Overview
PPIAL4F is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4F, which belongs to the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. These enzymes play a crucial role in protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. The PPIAL4F protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, trafficking, and assembly, and may have implications in cellular stress responses and signaling pathways. Although the specific biological functions of PPIAL4F are not fully elucidated, its role in protein homeostasis suggests potential involvement in disease mechanisms where protein misfolding is a factor (Qiu2020aarFDC).
