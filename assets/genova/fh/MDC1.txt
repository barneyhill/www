# MDC1

## Overview
MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) is a gene that encodes a pivotal scaffold protein involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation. The MDC1 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and C-terminal tandem BRCT (BRCA1 C Terminus) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins involved in DNA repair and mitotic progression. As a scaffold protein, MDC1 plays a crucial role in recruiting and retaining DNA repair proteins at sites of DNA double-strand breaks, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Coster2010The; Liu2012Structural). Additionally, MDC1 is involved in regulating mitotic progression through interactions with the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) and other mitotic checkpoint complexes (Townsend2009Mediator). The gene's significance extends to clinical contexts, where its mutations and altered expression are linked to various cancers, underscoring its role in tumorigenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Li2017DNA; Ruff2020Roles).

## Structure
The MDC1 protein is characterized by several key structural domains that facilitate its role in the DNA damage response. It contains an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is crucial for phosphorylation-dependent dimerization. This domain forms a face-to-face dimer with pseudo-dyad symmetry and recognizes phosphothreonine residues, particularly pT4, which is phosphorylated by ATM kinase in response to DNA damage (Liu2012Structural). The FHA domain is composed of an 11-stranded β-sandwich structure, with specific loops forming a cleft for binding phosphopeptides (Wu2012Structural).

The C-terminal region of MDC1 contains tandem BRCT (BRCA1 C Terminus) domains, which are involved in binding the C-terminal phosphopeptide of γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage (Liu2012Structural). The FHA domain's dimerization is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with specific residues like L127 playing a critical role (Liu2012Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are essential for MDC1's function, particularly in its role as a scaffold for recruiting DNA repair proteins to damage sites (Liu2012Structural). The protein's structure allows it to coordinate the assembly of DNA repair complexes effectively.

## Function
MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) is a crucial protein in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the DNA damage response (DDR) and regulating mitotic progression. In the DDR, MDC1 acts as a scaffold protein that facilitates the recruitment and retention of repair proteins at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It interacts with γ-H2AX through its tBRCT domain, protecting γ-H2AX from dephosphorylation and amplifying the DNA damage signal (Coster2010The). MDC1 also interacts with the MRN complex, particularly NBS1, to ensure the proper localization of repair proteins to DSBs, which is essential for effective DNA repair (Lukas2004Mdc1; Spycher2008Constitutive).

Beyond its role in DDR, MDC1 is involved in regulating mitotic progression. It interacts with the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) and is necessary for the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. MDC1's interaction with APC/C components, such as Cdc20, is crucial for normal mitotic progression and preventing mitotic errors (Townsend2009Mediator). Phosphorylation of MDC1 by Plk1 during mitosis is essential for proper chromosome alignment and spindle formation, further highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Li2017DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MDC1 gene are linked to various cancers due to its critical role in maintaining genomic stability. Reduced levels of MDC1 lead to increased chromosomal instability, which is associated with a higher risk of tumorigenesis. This is evidenced by increased rates of aneuploidy and tumor formation in MDC1 +/- mice and HeLa cells with reduced MDC1 expression (Li2017DNA). In cervical cancer, MDC1 depletion enhances sensitivity to cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent, by increasing apoptosis and reducing cell viability, suggesting that MDC1 may confer resistance to such treatments (Singh2020MDC1).

MDC1 also plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR), and its loss is linked to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents like doxorubicin and cisplatin in various cancers, including breast and cervical carcinomas (Ruff2020Roles). The gene's interaction with nuclear hormone receptors, such as Estrogen Receptor α and Androgen Receptor, suggests its involvement in breast and prostate cancer progression. Loss of MDC1 in these contexts may contribute to tumor development by affecting the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (Ruff2020Roles). Genetic variants of MDC1, such as the rs4713354A.C SNP, are associated with increased lung cancer risk, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer susceptibility (Wang2014A).

## Interactions
MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) is a crucial protein in the DNA damage response, interacting with several key proteins to facilitate DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. MDC1 directly binds to phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) through its BRCT domains, a critical interaction for the recruitment of other DNA damage response factors such as 53BP1, NBS1, and phosphorylated ATM to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (Stucki2005MDC1). This interaction is essential for the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) and efficient DNA repair (Stucki2005MDC1).

MDC1 also interacts with the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) through its tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (tBRCT) domain, particularly binding to the BubR1 subunit, which is important for spindle assembly checkpoint regulation (Eliezer2014Interplay). The interaction between MDC1 and ATM is phospho-dependent, requiring ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981, and is crucial for the recruitment and retention of ATM at DNA damage sites (Coster2010The).

Additionally, MDC1 interacts with the MRN complex via its FHA domain, which is involved in checkpoint activation independent of its interaction with γH2AX (Stucki2005MDC1). MDC1's interactions extend to other proteins such as RNF8, TopoIIα, and components of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), highlighting its broader role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response (Coster2010The).
