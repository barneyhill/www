# SERPINB7

## Overview
SERPINB7 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 7, which belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in inhibiting serine proteases, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting tissues from protease-mediated damage. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of protease activity, inflammation, and immune response (Gatto2013Serpins). SERPINB7 is particularly significant in skin biology, where it contributes to epidermal barrier integrity and keratinocyte differentiation, influencing calcium ion channels crucial for skin development and repair (Zheng2022SerpinB7). Mutations in the SERPINB7 gene are linked to Nagashima-type palmoplantar keratoderma and have implications in conditions such as psoriasis, highlighting its clinical significance (Harjama2021Hereditary; Zheng2022SerpinB7).

## Function
SERPINB7, a member of the serpin family, functions primarily as a serine protease inhibitor and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to various cellular processes, including the regulation of protease activity, inflammation, and immune response (Gatto2013Serpins). In healthy human cells, SERPINB7 is involved in protecting cells from protease-mediated damage, thereby supporting tissue integrity and cellular function.

The protein is particularly important in skin homeostasis, where it acts as an endogenous protease inhibitor. Its deficiency is linked to abnormalities in epidermal barrier integrity and skin architecture, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the skin (Zheng2022SerpinB7). SERPINB7 is also associated with keratinocyte differentiation, a process crucial for skin development and repair. It influences calcium ion channels, which are essential for keratinocyte function and differentiation (Zheng2022SerpinB7).

In addition to its role in skin biology, SERPINB7 has been implicated in suppressing the invasion and migration of cancer cells, suggesting a broader role in cellular protection and regulation (Chou2011Suppression). These functions underscore the importance of SERPINB7 in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINB7 gene are associated with Nagashima-type palmoplantar keratoderma (NPPK), a condition characterized by nonprogressive, diffuse hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. This condition is prevalent in Asian populations, with specific founder mutations identified, such as the c.796C>T (p.Arg266*) mutation, which is common in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean populations (Harjama2021Hereditary; Li2021Identification). The loss-of-function mutations in SERPINB7 may lead to overactivation of proteases, causing protein deterioration in keratinocytes and promoting water permeation in the stratum corneum (Harjama2021Hereditary).

Alterations in SERPINB7 expression are also linked to psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. SERPINB7 deficiency affects keratinocyte differentiation and calcium signaling, leading to impaired skin barrier function and increased inflammatory responses. This deficiency exacerbates psoriasis symptoms by promoting excessive keratinocyte proliferation and reducing differentiation, contributing to the disease's pathology (Zheng2022SerpinB7). The gene's role in maintaining skin integrity and regulating inflammation suggests it as a potential therapeutic target for psoriasis (Zheng2022SerpinB7).
