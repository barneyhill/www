# TRAK2

## Overview
TRAK2, or trafficking kinesin protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial transport and cholesterol metabolism. The TRAK2 protein is categorized as a kinesin-associated protein, playing a crucial role in the intracellular transport of mitochondria, particularly within neuronal cells. This transport is essential for maintaining cellular energy distribution and function, as it facilitates the movement of mitochondria along microtubules by interacting with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein. In addition to its role in mitochondrial dynamics, TRAK2 is implicated in cholesterol metabolism, where it negatively regulates cholesterol efflux and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis, particularly in hepatic cells. These functions highlight TRAK2's significance in both cellular energy management and lipid homeostasis, with implications for various physiological and pathological processes (LópezDoménech2012The; Lake2017TRAK2; Quintanilla2020Truncated).

## Function
TRAK2 (trafficking kinesin protein 2) is a key regulator of cholesterol metabolism and mitochondrial transport in human cells. In the context of cholesterol metabolism, TRAK2 negatively regulates cholesterol efflux and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis. It is highly expressed in hepatic cells, where its knockdown leads to increased cholesterol efflux and HDL production, suggesting a role in reverse cholesterol transport and atheroprotection (Lake2017TRAK2). TRAK2 influences the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which is crucial for cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and HDL particles (Lake2017TRAK2).

In neuronal cells, TRAK2 is involved in mitochondrial transport, facilitating the movement of mitochondria along microtubules by interacting with kinesin motor proteins. This function is essential for maintaining proper mitochondrial distribution, which is crucial for cellular energy supply and neuronal function (LópezDoménech2012The; Quintanilla2020Truncated). TRAK2's role in mitochondrial dynamics is particularly important in neurons, where it ensures the localization of mitochondria at synaptic terminals, impacting cellular health and energy balance (Quintanilla2020Truncated).

## Clinical Significance
TRAK2 (trafficking kinesin protein 2) has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in mitochondrial transport and cellular dynamics. Alterations in TRAK2 expression are associated with the aggressiveness of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. In osteosarcoma, TRAK2 expression is decreased compared to normal tissues, and its reduced expression correlates with poorer prognosis. This suggests that TRAK2 could serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in osteosarcoma (Wang2020miR‐487b).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TRAK2 is involved in mitochondrial transport within neurons. Truncated tau, a pathological form of tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, reduces TRAK2 expression and impairs its function, leading to mitochondrial transport failure. This impairment contributes to bioenergetic deficits, such as mitochondrial depolarization and reduced ATP production, which are linked to synaptic and cognitive alterations observed in Alzheimer's disease (Quintanilla2020Truncated).

TRAK2 also plays a role in cholesterol metabolism. Its expression negatively correlates with plasma HDL-C concentration, and knockdown of TRAK2 in hepatic cells increases cholesterol efflux and HDL production, suggesting potential implications in cardiovascular health (Lake2017TRAK2).

## Interactions
TRAK2, a trafficking kinesin protein, is involved in mitochondrial transport and interacts with several key proteins. It predominantly associates with the dynein/dynactin motor complex, which is crucial for directing mitochondria into dendrites, highlighting its role in dendritic development (van2013TRAKMilton). TRAK2's interaction with dynein/dynactin is essential for minus-end-directed transport, facilitating the proper dendritic distribution of mitochondria (van2013TRAKMilton).

TRAK2 also interacts with kinesin-1, although this interaction is modulated by its conformational state. TRAK2 tends to form a stable head-to-tail interaction, which inhibits its binding to kinesin-1, thereby preventing axonal transport (van2013TRAKMilton). However, overexpression of kinesin-1 can force an interaction, suggesting that high concentrations of kinesin-1 might release the inhibitory state by unfolding TRAK2 (van2013TRAKMilton).

TRAK2 is part of a complex with Miro proteins, which are mitochondrial Rho GTPases. This interaction is part of the KIF5/Miro/Trak2 trafficking complex, and it is regulated by calcium levels, with high calcium concentrations reducing the interaction between TRAK2 and Miro (LópezDoménech2012The). These interactions underscore TRAK2's role in mitochondrial transport and its regulation by various protein interactions and conformational changes.
