# CNIH1

## Overview
CNIH1, or cornichon homolog 1, is a gene that encodes the cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 1, a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. This protein is a member of the cornichon family, characterized by its role as an auxiliary subunit of ionotropic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are essential for excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. CNIH1 is crucial for the trafficking and maturation of transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) and functions as a COPII cargo receptor, facilitating the ER exit of G-protein coupled receptors and enhancing the plasma-membrane localization of AMPARs. By promoting the tetramerization and intracellular trafficking of GluA subunits, CNIH1 contributes to the regulation of cation permeation and synaptic transmission, thereby supporting efficient neurotransmission and cognitive functions (Papoušková2024The).

## Structure
CNIH1, or cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 1, is a transmembrane protein characterized by a conserved domain structure typical of the cornichon family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The molecular structure of CNIH1 includes specific domains that facilitate its function in receptor trafficking and modulation. 

CNIH1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are essential for the protein's role in forming complexes that affect receptor function. The ability of CNIH1 to form such complexes suggests a quaternary structure where it interacts with other proteins to modulate receptor trafficking and function. 

The primary structure of CNIH1 includes sequences that are conserved within the cornichon family, indicating a shared evolutionary origin and functional similarities among family members. While specific details on the secondary and tertiary structures are not provided, the presence of conserved domains suggests a stable and functionally significant folding pattern. The protein's role in receptor modulation highlights its importance in synaptic transmission and plasticity.

## Function
The human gene CNIH1 encodes a cornichon protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of ionotropic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are crucial for excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. CNIH1 is involved in the trafficking and maturation of transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) and colocalizes with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, suggesting its role as a COPII cargo receptor (Papoušková2024The). This protein is implicated in the ER exit of G-protein coupled receptors and enhances the plasma-membrane localization of AMPARs by promoting the tetramerization and intracellular trafficking of GluA subunits (Papoušková2024The).

CNIH1, like other cornichon proteins, contributes to the regulation of cation permeation and synaptic transmission by forming multi-protein complexes with AMPARs, adding functional diversity to these receptors (Papoušková2024The). It plays a role in maintaining monovalent-cation homeostasis in eukaryotic cells by facilitating the incorporation of cargo proteins into COPII vesicles for efficient trafficking via the secretory pathway (Papoušková2024The). CNIH1's activity is primarily located in the ER and at the synaptic membrane, where it supports efficient neurotransmission and cognitive functions (Papoušková2024The).
