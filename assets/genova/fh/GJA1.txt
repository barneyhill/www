# GJA1

## Overview
The GJA1 gene encodes the protein Connexin 43 (Cx43), a transmembrane protein that is a pivotal component of gap junction intercellular channels (GJIChs). These channels facilitate direct communication between adjacent cells by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules, playing a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and synchronizing cellular activities. Cx43 is particularly significant in cardiac tissue, where it ensures the propagation of electrical signals necessary for coordinated heart contractions. Beyond its canonical role in electrical coupling, Cx43 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, cell cycle regulation, and response to injury. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its trafficking and degradation. Mutations in GJA1 are linked to several clinical conditions, most notably oculodentodigital dysplasia, underscoring its importance in human health (Epifantseva2018Intracellular; Paznekas2003Connexin; RodríguezSinovas2021Connexins).

## Structure
The human gene GJA1 encodes the protein Connexin 43 (Cx43), which is a critical component of gap junction intercellular channels (GJIChs). The primary structure of Cx43 consists of 382 amino acids. Its secondary structure includes transmembrane helices, with significant conformational changes observed in the N-terminal helices (NTHs) and transmembrane domains (TMDs) due to environmental factors such as pH and lipid composition (Lee2023Conformational; Woo2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of Cx43 involves the arrangement of these helices to form a channel, with specific interactions between transmembrane helices and lipids like POPE and CHS, which stabilize the channel's conformation (Lee2023Conformational). The quaternary structure is characterized by hexameric assemblies known as connexons, which dock between adjacent cell membranes to form GJIChs (Woo2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the gating and permeability of Cx43 channels (Woo2021Structural). The protein also undergoes conformational changes, including an α-to-π-helix transition in the first transmembrane helix, which is crucial for its function (Woo2021Structural). These structural features are essential for the protein's role in intercellular communication and its involvement in various physiological processes.

## Function
The GJA1 gene encodes connexin 43 (Cx43), a protein that plays a crucial role in forming gap junction channels, which facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. In the heart, Cx43 is essential for synchronizing the heartbeat by enabling low-resistance communication between cardiac cells, predominantly localizing to the intercalated discs of ventricular cardiomyocytes to aid in action potential propagation (Epifantseva2018Intracellular; RodríguezSinovas2021Connexins). Cx43 is also involved in mitochondrial functions, interacting with proteins like Tom20 and components of the mitochondrial respiratory complex, suggesting roles in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis regulation (RodríguezSinovas2021Connexins).

Beyond its canonical role in electrical signaling, Cx43 participates in various non-canonical functions, including cell cycle regulation, cancer progression, wound healing, and muscle differentiation (Epifantseva2018Intracellular). It is involved in paracrine signaling, notably transporting ATP, which activates purinergic receptors and plays roles in inflammation (Zhu2022Gap). Cx43's phosphorylation, particularly on its C-terminal tail, regulates its trafficking, gap junction formation, and degradation, impacting its function in cardiac health (Zhu2022Gap).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJA1 gene, which encodes the protein Connexin 43, are primarily associated with oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. ODDD is characterized by craniofacial, limb, and neurological abnormalities, including syndactyly, microphthalmia, microcornea, and facial dysmorphisms (Jamsheer2014Three; Paznekas2003Connexin). The mutations in GJA1 are predominantly missense substitutions affecting highly conserved amino acids, which can lead to misassembly of gap junction channels or altered channel conduction properties (Jamsheer2014Three; Paznekas2003Connexin).

The clinical manifestations of GJA1 mutations are diverse, affecting multiple organ systems. These include conductive hearing loss, cataracts, glaucoma, keratoderma, and cardiac defects such as atrioseptal defects and ventricular tachycardia (Paznekas2003Connexin). Neurological symptoms, such as spastic paraparesis and ataxia, are also common (Paznekas2003Connexin). In some cases, GJA1 mutations have been linked to massive brain calcifications, suggesting a potential impact on brain microvessels (Tumminelli2015Oculodentodigital).

The expression of GJA1 during embryonic development, particularly in craniofacial regions, correlates with the phenotypic features observed in ODDD, highlighting its role in morphogenesis (Richardson2004Expression). Despite its broad expression, GJA1 mutations typically result in a limited range of phenotypic abnormalities, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Paznekas2003Connexin).

## Interactions
The human gene GJA1, encoding the protein Connexin 43 (Cx43), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cardiac and other tissues. GJA1 interacts with Kcnq1, a potassium channel protein, and this interaction is significant for cardiac electrophysiology. The co-precipitation and co-localization of GJA1 with Kcnq1 suggest a close physical proximity at the intercalated disc in cardiac cells (Maurya2023Outlining). GJA1 also interacts with ZO-1, a protein localized to the intercalated disc, which co-precipitates with both Kcnq1 and GJA1, indicating a shared protein network (Maurya2023Outlining).

The GJA1-20k isoform, a variant of GJA1, plays a role in microtubule-based mitochondrial transport. It interacts with microtubules through a microtubule-binding domain, facilitating the transport of mitochondria along microtubules. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation and live-cell imaging data, highlighting GJA1-20k's role in maintaining mitochondrial network integrity during stress (Fu2017Cx43). Additionally, GJA1-20k interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing f-actin polymerization and inhibiting actin depolymerization, which is crucial for its role in trafficking and mitochondrial regulation (Shimura2022GJA120k).
