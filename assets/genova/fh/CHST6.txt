# CHST6

## Overview
The CHST6 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 6, also known as N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfotransferase (C-GlcNAc6ST), which is a member of the carbohydrate sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is integral to the sulfation of keratan sulfate, a process crucial for maintaining corneal transparency and proper vision. The CHST6 protein is characterized by a sulfotransferase domain that facilitates the transfer of sulfate groups, primarily within the Golgi apparatus, thereby influencing glycosaminoglycan modification and cellular communication (Safari2020CHST6; Zhang2019A). Mutations in the CHST6 gene are linked to macular corneal dystrophy, a condition marked by corneal opacity and vision impairment due to the accumulation of unsulfated keratan sulfate (Ocampo2019Reconstruction; Aldave2004Novel). The gene's expression is predominantly corneal, underscoring its specialized role in ocular health (Yu2018Distinct).

## Structure
The CHST6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the carbohydrate sulfotransferase family, specifically known as N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphotransferase (C-GlcNAc6ST). This enzyme consists of 395 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa (Safari2020CHST6; Zhang2019A). The primary structure of CHST6 includes a short cytosolic tail at the N-terminal, a single transmembrane span, and a C-terminal domain (Zhang2019A). The C-terminal domain contains the sulfate donor PAPS binding site, which is crucial for determining carbohydrate specificity in vivo (Zhang2019A).

The CHST6 protein features a key sulfotransferase domain that spans residues 42 to 356, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Zhang2019A). This domain is involved in the transfer of sulfate groups to keratan sulfate, a process vital for maintaining corneal transparency (Safari2020CHST6). The protein's structure is conserved among various membrane-bound sulfotransferases, indicating its structural and functional importance (Safari2020CHST6). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CHST6 gene encodes the enzyme corneal N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase (C-GlcNAc6ST), which plays a critical role in the sulfation of keratan sulfate (KS) in the cornea. This sulfation process is essential for maintaining corneal transparency and proper vision. The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies glycosaminoglycans, influencing cellular communication and structural integrity (Ocampo2019Reconstruction; Yu2018Distinct).

In healthy human cells, CHST6 is specifically expressed in the cornea, where it adds sulfate groups to specific glycan structures. This modification alters the physico-chemical properties of the glycans, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and transparency of the corneal tissue (Yu2018Distinct). The enzymatic activity of CHST6 is vital for the proper sulfation of keratan sulfate, which prevents the accumulation of unsulfated keratan sulfate that can lead to vision impairment (Ocampo2019Reconstruction).

Mutations in the CHST6 gene can lead to macular corneal dystrophy, a condition characterized by the accumulation of unsulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea, resulting in vision impairment (Ocampo2019Reconstruction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHST6 gene are primarily associated with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive corneal opacity and vision impairment. MCD is divided into two main types based on keratan sulfate reactivity: type I, which shows low or undetectable keratan sulfate levels, and type II, which has normal to sub-normal levels (Carstens2016Novel; Akama2000Macular). Mutations in CHST6 lead to the accumulation of unsulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea, resulting in the characteristic opacities and loss of transparency (Safari2020CHST6; Aldave2004Novel).

The gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfotransferase, which is crucial for the sulfation of keratan sulfate. Mutations in CHST6, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, disrupt this process, leading to the clinical manifestations of MCD (Niel2003Truncating; Zhang2019A). The genetic diversity of CHST6 mutations contributes to the variability in disease severity and presentation among affected individuals (Ha2003Mutation; Sultana2005Allelic). The identification of novel mutations, such as the E71Q mutation in a South African family, highlights the ongoing discovery of genetic variants contributing to MCD (Carstens2016Novel).
