# NOL9

## Overview
NOL9 is a gene that encodes the nucleolar protein 9, a critical component in ribosomal RNA processing within the nucleolus of human cells. The protein is characterized by its polynucleotide kinase (PNK) domain, which is essential for its RNA phosphotransferase activity, and is categorized as a kinase due to this enzymatic function. Nucleolar protein 9 plays a pivotal role in the maturation of the 60S large ribosomal subunit by participating in the cleavage and phosphorylation of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). This process is facilitated through its interaction with the endoribonuclease Las1L, forming a complex that is crucial for pre-rRNA processing. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cellular growth and proliferation, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Xie2024Nucleolar; Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

## Structure
The NOL9 protein is a critical component of the human Las1L-Nol9 complex, involved in pre-rRNA processing. It contains a conserved central polynucleotide kinase (PNK) domain, which is essential for RNA phosphotransferase activity, flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of NOL9 is crucial for its interaction with the Las1L endoribonuclease, as truncations that remove the CTD prevent binding to Las1L (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a). 

NOL9 also features a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) at its N-terminus, which is rich in arginine residues. This sequence is responsible for targeting the protein to the nucleolus and is crucial for its spatial regulation role within the nucleolus (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a). The N-terminal NoLS facilitates the transport of Las1L into the nucleolus, as Las1L lacks its own NoLS, allowing Las1L to 'piggyback' on NOL9 (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

The NOL9 protein forms a higher-order complex with Las1L, containing multiple copies of each protein, which is essential for its function in pre-rRNA processing (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

## Function
NOL9, or nucleolar protein 9, plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis within human cells. It is a component of the ITS2 pre-rRNA endonuclease-kinase complex, which is essential for the processing of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) in the nucleolus. NOL9 functions alongside the Las1L endoribonuclease to cleave and phosphorylate the ITS2 region of pre-rRNA, marking it for degradation. This process is vital for the maturation of the 60S large ribosomal subunit, a critical component of the ribosome (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

NOL9 contains a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) at its N-terminus, which is rich in arginine residues. This sequence is crucial for targeting the Las1L-Nol9 complex to the nucleolus, specifically to the granular component where late pre-rRNA processing occurs (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a). The N-terminal NoLS is essential for the nucleolar localization of NOL9, while the C-terminal NoLS is dispensable (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

NOL9's kinase activity is necessary for its function, as it phosphorylates the 5'-hydroxyl RNA after ITS2 cleavage, signaling its degradation. This activity is crucial for the proper processing and maturation of rRNA, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Gordon2019Nol9; Heindl2010Nol9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NOL9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those related to ribosome biogenesis and function. In zebrafish, a loss-of-function mutation in the nol9 gene leads to defects in 28S rRNA processing, resulting in multiple organ failures, including hypoplastic pancreas, liver, and intestine, as well as hematopoietic deficiencies. These phenotypic features are reminiscent of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a ribosomopathy characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hematological abnormalities (BielczykMaczyńska2015The).

In humans, NOL9 is significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), correlating with larger tumor sizes, advanced grades, and poor survival rates. Its expression is regulated by DNA methylation and the transcription factor ZNF384, which enhances NOL9 expression. NOL9 promotes HCC cell proliferation by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, facilitating the G1/S cell cycle transition, and reducing apoptosis. High NOL9 expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced efficacy of sorafenib treatment, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC (Xie2024Nucleolar).

## Interactions
NOL9 is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA processing through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with the endoribonuclease Las1L, which is essential for the processing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). This complex is involved in the cleavage and phosphorylation of ITS2, marking it for degradation, a necessary step for the maturation of the 60S large ribosomal subunit (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

NOL9 contains a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) that facilitates the transport of the Las1L-NOL9 complex into the nucleolus. Las1L lacks its own NoLS and relies on NOL9 for nucleolar transport, effectively 'piggybacking' on NOL9 to enter the nucleolus (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a). The interaction between NOL9 and Las1L is mediated by the C-terminal domain of NOL9, which is crucial for binding with Las1L (Gordon2019Nol9; Gordon2019Nol9a).

NOL9's kinase activity is essential for its function in rRNA processing, as it phosphorylates the 5′-hydroxyl RNA after ITS2 cleavage, a step necessary for the degradation of ITS2 (Heindl2010Nol9). This activity suggests potential interactions with other components of the rRNA processing machinery, including ribonucleoprotein particles and possibly other enzymes involved in RNA maturation (Heindl2010Nol9).
