# IGLL5

## Overview
The IGLL5 gene encodes the immunoglobulin lambda like polypeptide 5, a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system. This protein is categorized as a component of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is involved in the development and function of B cells. IGLL5 is particularly significant in the context of hematological malignancies, where its mutations have been linked to various cancers, including multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These mutations can influence disease progression and patient prognosis, making IGLL5 a potential biomarker for risk stratification and targeted therapies (White2018A; Li2022Wholeexome; Zhao2022Analysis). Additionally, IGLL5 expression levels have been associated with tumor progression and immune response modulation in other cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Xia2021IGLL5; Bu2022Microenvironmentrelated).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IGLL5 gene have been implicated in various hematological malignancies. In multiple myeloma, IGLL5 mutations are frequent and associated with disease progression, serving as a potential biomarker for high-risk cases. These mutations are often mutually exclusive of RAS mutations and are linked to a higher risk of disease progression, suggesting their role in stratifying patients for targeted therapies (White2018A). 

In ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (OAML), IGLL5 mutations are present in a significant portion of tumors and may be associated with early recurrence. Although the pathogenic mechanism is not fully understood, these mutations could contribute to genomic instability and increased proliferation rates in affected patients (Zhao2022Analysis).

IGLL5 is also frequently mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where it may act as an oncogenic driver. In primary gastrointestinal DLBCL, IGLL5 mutations are associated with better overall survival, indicating a potential protective role in this context (Li2022Wholeexome). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, high IGLL5 expression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and immune response modulation (Xia2021IGLL5; Bu2022Microenvironmentrelated).
