# OR51M1

## Overview
OR51M1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily M member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction across cell membranes. The protein encoded by OR51M1 is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by initiating the signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Knape2008Genomics). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR51M1 has been implicated in broader cellular signaling processes, including those related to myocardial infarction, suggesting potential roles in various physiological and pathological contexts (Fang2020Risk). Despite its involvement in diverse genetic studies, the specific clinical implications of OR51M1 remain to be fully understood.

## Structure
OR51M1 is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, which are involved in signal transduction across cell membranes. The primary structure of OR51M1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor (Knape2008Genomics). The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs. These helices contribute to the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane and interact with odorant molecules.

The tertiary structure of OR51M1 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, allowing the receptor to maintain its functional conformation. This folding is crucial for the receptor's ability to bind to specific ligands and initiate a cellular response. While the quaternary structure is generally not applicable to OR51M1, as these receptors typically function as monomers, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs and may play a role in the receptor's function and regulation (Knape2008Genomics). These modifications can affect the receptor's stability, localization, and interaction with other cellular components.

## Function
OR51M1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR51M1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in olfactory signal recognition and transduction (Knape2008Genomics).

In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), OR51M1 has been identified as one of the genes involved in the 'G-protein coupled receptor signaling' pathway, indicating its potential role in cellular signaling processes beyond olfaction. This involvement suggests that OR51M1 may have broader implications in cellular communication and signaling pathways, which are critical in various physiological and pathological processes (Fang2020Risk).

The gene has also been studied in the context of genetic diversity and evolution. It is part of a group of olfactory receptor genes that exhibit higher heterozygosity, particularly in certain populations, suggesting a role in balancing selection and possibly enhancing olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites (Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Clinical Significance
The OR51M1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been studied in various contexts, though its direct clinical significance remains largely unexplored. In a study focusing on Brazilian families prone to cutaneous melanoma, OR51M1 was identified as one of the genes harboring rare loss-of-function variants. However, these variants were not directly associated with melanoma susceptibility, as the gene is not linked to genetic diseases according to the OMIM database (Fidalgo2022Familybased).

In another study, OR51M1 was noted among the top mutated genes in a local Chinese cohort of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients, suggesting a potential role in the genetic landscape of PTC. However, the study did not establish a direct link between OR51M1 mutations and the disease (Liu2023Insight).

Additionally, OR51M1 was mentioned in the context of breast cancer, where mutations in this gene were identified in patients non-responsive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The study primarily focused on other genes, leaving the specific impact of OR51M1 mutations on chemotherapy response unclear (Yin2024Genomic).

Overall, while OR51M1 has been identified in various genetic studies, its specific clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated.
