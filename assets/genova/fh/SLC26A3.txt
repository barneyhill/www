# SLC26A3

## Overview
The SLC26A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 3, also known as DRA (down-regulated in adenoma), which is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in ion transport. This protein functions primarily as a chloride/bicarbonate (Cl-/HCO3-) exchanger and is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the ileum and colon. It plays a critical role in maintaining electrolyte and fluid balance by facilitating the exchange of chloride ions and bicarbonate across the apical membrane of epithelial cells, which is essential for fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, pH regulation, and buffering in the gastrointestinal tract (Seidler2019Slc26; Mäkelä2002SLC26A3). The protein's structure includes a sulfate transporter and anti-sigma antagonist (STAS) domain, which is crucial for regulatory interactions, including those with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (Mäkelä2002SLC26A3; Wedenoja2011Update). Mutations in the SLC26A3 gene can lead to congenital chloride diarrhea, highlighting its importance in maintaining electrolyte balance (Reimold2015Congenital). Additionally, alterations in SLC26A3 expression have been linked to other gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Yu2020Slc26a3).

## Structure
The SLC26A3 protein, encoded by the SLC26A3 gene, is a transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 764 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 82-85 kDa (Mäkelä2002SLC26A3; Wedenoja2011Update). It is predicted to have 12 to 14 hydrophobic transmembrane segments, forming a 7+7 transmembrane segment inverted repeat architecture (Chang2019Structural; Rapp2019Role). The protein includes a cytoplasmic N-terminal and C-terminal domain, with the C-terminal region containing a sulfate transporter and anti-sigma antagonist (STAS) domain, which is crucial for regulatory interactions (Mäkelä2002SLC26A3; Wedenoja2011Update).

The STAS domain, spanning amino acids 525 to 720, serves as a binding site for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is essential for the protein's function (Wedenoja2011Update). The C-terminal also features a PDZ interaction motif, which facilitates binding with PDZ domain adaptor proteins, influencing protein-protein interactions and transport activity (Seidler2019Slc26; Wedenoja2011Update).

N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification that affects the stability and function of SLC26A3, although it is not necessary for trafficking to the cell surface (Rapp2019Role). The protein's structure and function are influenced by specific mutations, which can lead to congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) by disrupting anion exchange activity (Reimold2015Congenital).

## Function
The SLC26A3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a chloride/bicarbonate (Cl-/HCO3-) exchanger, primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the ileum and colon. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte and fluid balance by facilitating the exchange of chloride ions and bicarbonate across the apical membrane of epithelial cells. This exchange is essential for maintaining fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, pH regulation, and buffering in the gastrointestinal tract (Seidler2019Slc26; Mäkelä2002SLC26A3).

SLC26A3 is involved in the electroneutral exchange of Cl- and HCO3-, which is critical for the absorption of salt and water in the intestine. This process is particularly important in the colon, where SLC26A3 contributes to luminal alkalization and fluid absorption (Seidler2019Slc26). The protein's activity is regulated by interactions with PDZ domain adaptor proteins, which modulate its expression and transport activity (Lee2012Regulation).

Mutations in SLC26A3 can lead to congenital chloride diarrhea, characterized by Cl--rich acidic diarrhea and systemic alkalosis, highlighting its critical role in maintaining electrolyte balance (Seidler2019Slc26; Mäkelä2002SLC26A3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC26A3 gene are primarily associated with congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. CCD is characterized by lifelong watery diarrhea with high chloride content, leading to dehydration, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and failure to thrive. If untreated, the condition can be fatal in early life due to severe electrolyte imbalances and dehydration (Höglund2006SLC26A3; Wedenoja2011Update). The disease results from impaired Cl-/HCO3- exchange in the ileal and colonic epithelium, causing excessive chloride loss in stools (Höglund2006SLC26A3).

Alterations in SLC26A3 expression are also linked to other gastrointestinal conditions. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis, has been associated with polymorphisms in the SLC26A3 gene. Dysfunctional SLC26A3 may contribute to IBD through impaired fluid and electrolyte absorption and compromised intestinal barrier function (Yu2020Slc26a3). Additionally, decreased expression of SLC26A3 has been observed in infectious diarrhea caused by pathogens like Citrobacter rodentium and Clostridium difficile, where it contributes to increased luminal chloride concentrations and fluid loss (Yu2020Slc26a3).

In the male reproductive tract, SLC26A3 deficiency can lead to infertility due to altered water, pH, and electrolyte homeostasis, affecting sperm maturation (Höglund2006SLC26A3).

## Interactions
SLC26A3, also known as DRA, interacts with several proteins that regulate its function as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. One significant interaction is with NHERF4, a PDZ domain scaffold protein. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of SLC26A3 and is crucial for its regulation. NHERF4 decreases the surface expression of SLC26A3 by inducing rapid internalization, thereby reducing its anion exchange activity. This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation state of NHERF4, particularly at serine 329, which affects binding selectivity (Lee2012Regulation).

SLC26A3 also interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The STAS domain of SLC26A3 binds to the R domain of CFTR, facilitating a reciprocal regulatory interaction. This binding is enhanced by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain, which increases CFTR's open probability and activity. The interaction involves additional domains beyond the PDZ ligand, highlighting the complexity of this regulatory mechanism (Ko2004Gating; Wedenoja2017A).

Mutations in SLC26A3, such as p.Asp688His, can affect its interaction with CFTR, leading to impaired CFTR activation while retaining normal Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity (Wedenoja2017A).
