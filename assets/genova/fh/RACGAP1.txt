# RACGAP1

## Overview
RACGAP1 is a gene that encodes the Rac GTPase activating protein 1, a critical regulator of the Rho family of GTPases, which includes Rac1 and Cdc42. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), playing a pivotal role in the inactivation of these GTPases, thereby influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell adhesion, and migration. RACGAP1 is a component of the centralspindlin complex, essential for the assembly of the contractile ring during cell division (Bastos2012CYK4). The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, which is crucial for its role in cell migration and invasion (Jacquemet2013RCPdriven). RACGAP1's involvement in various cellular processes and its overexpression in several cancers underscore its significance as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Yang2018Overexpression; Yin2019Rac).

## Structure
RACGAP1, also known as Rac GTPase activating protein 1, is a protein involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. The protein contains a RhoGAP domain, which is approximately 170 amino acids long and is crucial for its GTPase-activating function (Peck2002Human). This domain facilitates the hydrolysis of GTP, inactivating the GTPases and affecting cellular processes such as actin polymerization and cell adhesion (Peck2002Human).

RACGAP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. Specifically, it is phosphorylated by protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt at threonine 249 (T249), which is crucial for its recruitment to IQGAP1 at the tips of invasive pseudopods. This phosphorylation does not directly influence its GAP activity but is essential for suppressing Rac activity and promoting RhoA activity, facilitating cell migration and invasion (Jacquemet2013RCPdriven).

RACGAP1 forms complexes with other proteins, such as IQGAP1, which acts as a scaffold, facilitating its role in cell migration (Jacquemet2013RCPdriven). The interaction with IQGAP1 is critical for the localized suppression of Rac and activation of RhoA during cell migration in fibronectin-rich matrices (Jacquemet2013RCPdriven).

## Function
RACGAP1, also known as CYK4, is a critical regulator of the Rho family of GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42, in human cells. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 to influence cytoskeletal dynamics and ensure proper cell division. During cytokinesis, RACGAP1 is part of the centralspindlin complex and localizes to the central spindle and midbody, where it plays a crucial role in the assembly of the contractile ring and successful cell division (Bastos2012CYK4).

RACGAP1's GAP activity is essential for maintaining the balance between Rac and Rho activities, which is vital for cytokinesis and cell adhesion processes. In adherent cells, RACGAP1 inhibits Rac1-dependent pathways, such as those involving PAK1 and ARHGEF7, to prevent cytokinesis failure and regulate cell spreading and adhesion (Bastos2012CYK4). Additionally, RACGAP1 is involved in cell migration, where it modulates the activities of Rac and RhoA GTPases. It interacts with IQGAP1, and its phosphorylation by PKB/Akt at T249 is necessary for its recruitment to the cell front, promoting RhoA activation and suppressing Rac activity, which is crucial for invasive migration (Jacquemet2013RCPdriven).

## Clinical Significance
RACGAP1 (Rac GTPase activating protein 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of RACGAP1 is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma (Yang2018Overexpression; Bian2021Rac; Yin2019Rac; Liu2024RACGAP1). In HCC, RACGAP1 promotes cancer cell proliferation by reducing Hippo signaling and activating the YAP pathway, which are crucial for cytokinesis (Yang2018Overexpression). Its overexpression is linked to early recurrence of HCC after surgery, suggesting its role as a predictive biomarker for recurrence (Wang2024Clinical).

In esophageal carcinoma, high RACGAP1 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, and is associated with lymphatic invasion and advanced tumor stages (Yin2019Rac). In gallbladder cancer, RACGAP1 interacts with DNA ligase 3 to reduce apoptosis, contributing to tumor progression (Bian2021Rac). In lung adenocarcinoma, RACGAP1 is identified as a hub gene associated with poor prognosis and limited response to immunotherapy (Liu2024RACGAP1). These findings highlight RACGAP1's potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
RACGAP1 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and cell cycle regulation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RACGAP1 interacts with the translocated promoter region (TPR) protein, forming complexes during mitosis. This interaction is crucial for cytokinesis, as TPR acts as a scaffold for RACGAP1 redistribution and phosphorylation, facilitating its function at the spindle midzone during anaphase (Yang2018Overexpression). RACGAP1 also interacts with aurora kinase B (AURKB), which phosphorylates RACGAP1, further supporting its role in cytokinesis (Yang2018Overexpression).

In gallbladder cancer (GBC), RACGAP1 binds with DNA ligase 3 (LIG3), a key player in the alternative non-homologous end joining (Alt-NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. This interaction enhances LIG3 stability and reduces apoptosis in GBC cells, indicating RACGAP1's role in promoting cancer cell survival (Bian2021Rac).

In prostate cancer, RACGAP1 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and its variant AR-V7. This interaction occurs at the N-terminal domain of AR, influencing AR/AR-V7 stability by inhibiting their ubiquitination and degradation, thus contributing to endocrine therapy resistance (Wang2024Reciprocal).
