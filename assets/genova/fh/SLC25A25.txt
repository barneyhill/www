# SLC25A25

## Overview
SLC25A25 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 25, a mitochondrial transporter involved in cellular energy metabolism. This protein is part of the solute carrier family 25, characterized by its role in facilitating the exchange of ATP-Mg and phosphate ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The SLC25A25 protein is distinguished by its tripartite structure, which includes transmembrane alpha-helices and EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs, allowing it to undergo calcium-dependent conformational changes essential for its function as a Ca2+-regulated Mg-ATP transporter (Palmieri2013The; Hofherr2018The). It plays a significant role in maintaining the adenine nucleotide pool within mitochondria, crucial for various metabolic processes. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the TRPP2 channel, highlight its involvement in linking ciliary signaling to cellular metabolism, with implications for processes like left-right organ patterning in vertebrates (Hofherr2018The). Mutations in the SLC25A25 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as kidney stone formation and mitochondrial dysfunction, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and development (Jabalameli2021Exome; Babenko2018Altered).

## Structure
The SLC25A25 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 25, characterized by a tripartite structure with three homologous domains, each containing two transmembrane alpha-helices (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). These helices form a funnel-shaped structure that facilitates the transport of molecules across the mitochondrial membrane (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). The protein also features a bipartite structure with N-terminal domains containing three EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs and C-terminal domains with common mitochondrial carrier family sequence features (Palmieri2013The).

SLC25A25 undergoes Ca2+-dependent conformational changes, which are crucial for its function as a Ca2+-regulated Mg-ATP transporter (Hofherr2018The). The protein's structure includes a calmodulin-like N-terminal domain involved in calcium regulation, a loop domain with an amphipathic helix, and a C-terminal mitochondrial carrier domain with six transmembrane and three matrix helices involved in substrate transport (Jabalameli2021Exome).

The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and stability (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). Splice variants of SLC25A25 result in different isoforms, such as APC3a and APC3b, which may have distinct functions and expression patterns (Jabalameli2021Exome).

## Function
SLC25A25 is a mitochondrial transporter that plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the exchange of ATP-Mg and phosphate ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This exchange is essential for maintaining the adenine nucleotide pool within the mitochondria, which is vital for various metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis, urea synthesis, and mitochondrial DNA replication (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

The protein is regulated by calcium ions, undergoing a Ca2+-dependent conformational change that enhances its transport activity. This regulation allows SLC25A25 to respond to cellular energy demands by modulating ATP output from mitochondria, which is critical for processes such as sperm motility and potentially influencing left-right patterning in vertebrates (Hofherr2018The).

SLC25A25 is also involved in the cross-talk between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, influencing metabolic shifts and playing a protective role during cellular stress conditions, such as ischemia/reperfusion. It helps buffer Ca2+ and facilitates the closure of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, thus protecting cells from necrotic death (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The protein is predominantly expressed in tissues like the lung and brain, and its overexpression is associated with cancer cell survival (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A25 gene have been linked to kidney stone formation. Specifically, the p.Gln349His variant has been identified in two families with a history of kidney stones. This mutation affects the stability and transport activity of the mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier, significantly reducing its function and leading to ATP depletion in renal cells. This depletion impacts solute reabsorption, contributing to lithogenic urine production and potentially causing hyperphosphaturia, a condition common among stone formers (Jabalameli2021Exome).

The SLC25A25 gene is also implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to severe clinical conditions such as hypotonia, halted psychomotor development, and convulsions. These conditions are associated with mutations in conserved residues of the gene, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Babenko2018Altered).

Alterations in SLC25A25 expression or function can disrupt its interaction with TRPP2, a ciliary Ca2+-permeable ion channel. This disruption affects cellular metabolism and processes like left-right patterning in vertebrates, which are crucial for proper development. The interaction between SLC25A25 and TRPP2 is essential for linking ciliary signaling to mitochondrial metabolism, and its dysfunction may contribute to conditions such as polycystic kidney disease (Hofherr2018The).

## Interactions
SLC25A25, a mitochondrial transporter, is involved in several interactions that link ciliary signaling to cellular metabolism. It interacts with the TRPP2 channel, a ciliary Ca2+-permeable ion channel, to mediate Ca2+ signaling crucial for processes such as left-right organ patterning in vertebrates. This interaction is facilitated by their spatial proximity in cellular microdomains, particularly at the ciliary base where mitochondria cluster, allowing for functional coupling. TRPP2 contributes to Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, while SLC25A25 is expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane, enabling the regulation of cellular metabolism through Ca2+ transients (Hofherr2018The).

SLC25A25 is also involved in energy supply and purinergic signaling in the kidney, with its activity regulated by cytosolic calcium. It acts downstream of the polycystin-2 ion channel, which is another name for TRPP2, in cilia-triggered responses to flow (Jabalameli2021Exome). The protein's interactions include calcium binding, which is crucial for its role as a Ca2+-regulated mitochondrial ATP carrier, linking ciliary signaling and cellular metabolism (Hofherr2018The). These interactions highlight the importance of SLC25A25 in cellular energy homeostasis and signal transduction.
