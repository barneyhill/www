# ZCCHC13

## Overview
ZCCHC13 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 13 protein, which is characterized by its zinc finger motifs. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and proliferation, particularly through its role in the AKT/MAPK/c-MYC signaling pathway. ZCCHC13 has been identified as a key player in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, with significant implications in both reproductive biology and oncology. In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), ZCCHC13 is considered a hub gene, influencing pathways critical for germ cell development. Additionally, its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggests an oncogenic role, as it promotes tumor growth and progression through the activation of specific signaling pathways. The gene's expression and methylation status are clinically significant, offering potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in diseases such as male infertility and liver cancer (Li2018Novel; Li2019ZCCHC13mediated).

## Clinical Significance
The ZCCHC13 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition affecting male fertility, ZCCHC13 is identified as a novel biomarker. The gene is hypermethylated and down-regulated in NOA patients, leading to decreased expression in testicular tissues. This down-regulation is associated with impaired spermatogenesis, potentially due to disruptions in the AKT/MAPK/c-MYC signaling pathways, which are crucial for germ cell proliferation (Li2018Novel).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZCCHC13 is frequently upregulated, attributed to hypomethylation of its promoter region. This overexpression promotes liver cancer cell growth by enhancing cell cycle progression and activating the AKT/ERK signaling pathway. The presence of high levels of ZCCHC13 antibodies in the sera of HCC patients suggests its potential as an immunogenic tumor antigen, indicating its role as an oncogene in liver cancer (Li2019ZCCHC13mediated).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZCCHC13 in both male infertility and liver cancer, suggesting that alterations in its expression and methylation status can contribute to disease pathogenesis and may serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ZCCHC13, a zinc finger CCHC-type protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in the activation of the AKT/MAPK/c-MYC signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and proliferation in male germ cells. This interaction suggests that ZCCHC13 may influence the expression of c-MYC through the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK pathways, thereby promoting germ cell proliferation (Li2018Novel).

In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), ZCCHC13 is identified as a hub gene within a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, indicating its central role in the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition. The PPI network analysis highlights the involvement of ZCCHC13 in significant pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway, which is associated with cell growth, survival, and differentiation (Li2018Novel).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZCCHC13 overexpression is linked to the activation of the ATK/ERK/c-MYC/CDK pathway, promoting cell cycle progression and cancer cell growth. This suggests that ZCCHC13 functions as an oncogene in HCC, with its interactions contributing to tumorigenesis (Li2019ZCCHC13mediated).
