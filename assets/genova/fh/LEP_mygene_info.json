"summary": "This gene encodes a protein that is secreted by white adipocytes into the circulation and plays a major role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Circulating leptin binds to the leptin receptor in the brain, which activates downstream signaling pathways that inhibit feeding and promote energy expenditure. This protein also has several endocrine functions, and is involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, reproduction, bone formation and wound healing. Mutations in this gene and its regulatory regions cause severe obesity and morbid obesity with hypogonadism in human patients. A mutation in this gene has also been linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus development.
