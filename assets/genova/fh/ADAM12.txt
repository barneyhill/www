# ADAM12

## Overview
ADAM12 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, which is characterized by its zinc-dependent metalloprotease activity. The ADAM12 protein exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing: a membrane-bound form (ADAM12-L) and a secreted form (ADAM12-S) (NyrenErickson2013A). These isoforms play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, fusion, and signaling, particularly in tissues undergoing growth or repair such as muscle and bone (Kveiborg2008Cellular). The protein's involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and interaction with integrins and growth factor receptors underscores its significance in cellular communication and structural integrity (Kveiborg2008Cellular). ADAM12's dysregulation is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, liver diseases, and asthma, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Shalaby2016ADAM33; Huang2021Upregulation).

## Structure
ADAM12 is a member of the ADAM family of enzymes, characterized by a multi-domain structure. It exists in two forms due to alternative splicing: a membrane-bound form (ADAM12-L) and a secreted form (ADAM12-S) (NyrenErickson2013A). The protein structure includes several domains: a signal peptide, a pro-domain, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an EGF-like domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (NyrenErickson2013A). The pro-domain assists in protein folding and inhibits enzymatic activity until cleavage occurs. The metalloproteinase domain is responsible for proteolytic activity, while the disintegrin domain is involved in cell adhesion. The cysteine-rich domain aids in substrate recognition and cell adhesion, although the function of the EGF-like domain remains unknown (NyrenErickson2013A).

ADAM12's structure has been partially elucidated through electron microscopy, revealing a compact clover-shaped architecture with four globular domains (NyrenErickson2013A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common among ADAM family proteins (Seegar2019Domain). These modifications contribute to the protein's structural stability and functional regulation.

## Function
ADAM12 is a member of the ADAM family of enzymes, which are zinc-dependent metalloproteases involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ADAM12 plays significant roles in cell adhesion, fusion, and signaling. It exists in two forms due to alternative splicing: a membrane-bound form (ADAM12-L) and a secreted form (ADAM12-S) (NyrenErickson2013A; Kveiborg2008Cellular).

ADAM12 is prominently expressed in tissues characterized by cell fusion, growth, or repair, such as muscle, bone, and adipose tissue. It is involved in myogenesis, particularly in the fusion of myoblasts, and interacts with integrins like α9β1, α7β1, and α5β1, influencing muscle development and myotube formation (NyrenErickson2013A; Lafuste2005ADAM12; Kveiborg2008Cellular).

The protein also plays a role in extracellular matrix restructuring and cell signaling. It is involved in the shedding of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, leading to EGFR activation and subsequent downstream signaling, which stimulates cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Kveiborg2008Cellular). ADAM12's interaction with integrins and syndecans supports cell attachment and influences the actin cytoskeleton, potentially affecting cell survival and structure (Kveiborg2008Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
The ADAM12 gene is implicated in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, ADAM12 overexpression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, particularly in breast, colon, bladder, and lung cancers. It serves as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, with its secreted form, ADAM12-S, being notably elevated in breast cancer and associated with resistance to endocrine therapies like tamoxifen (NyrenErickson2013A; Huang2021Upregulation). In colon adenocarcinoma, high ADAM12 expression correlates with poor survival and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in the tumor microenvironment (Huang2021Upregulation).

ADAM12 is also involved in liver diseases, with increased expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases, where it contributes to matrix remodeling and tumor invasion (Pabic2003ADAM12). In asthma, ADAM12 polymorphisms are associated with increased risk and severity, potentially due to its role in airway remodeling (Shalaby2016ADAM33). Additionally, ADAM12 is linked to osteoarthritis, cardiac hypertrophy, and neurological diseases, where its expression affects disease progression and tissue remodeling (Jacobsen2009Targeting). These findings highlight ADAM12's potential as a therapeutic target across various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ADAM12, a member of the ADAM family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cell signaling and adhesion. It interacts with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in Cos7 cells, which do not naturally express ADAM12, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is significant for cell adhesion and survival, occurring within IPP complexes that include PINCH and parvin proteins (Leyme2012Identification). ADAM12 also interacts with the type II transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor (TβRII), enhancing TGF-β signaling by stabilizing TβRII and preventing its degradation (Atfi2007The).

ADAM12 is identified as a novel sheddase for basigin (BSG), facilitating its shedding at the cell surface. This interaction is significant in cancer progression, as basigin is involved in matrix metalloproteinase-mediated extracellular matrix degradation (Albrechtsen2019Identification). Additionally, ADAM12 interacts with FLRG, a protein that modulates osteoclast differentiation, suggesting a role in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis by interacting with ADAM proteins (Bartholin2005FLRG). These interactions highlight ADAM12's role in various cellular processes, including adhesion, signaling, and proteolysis.
