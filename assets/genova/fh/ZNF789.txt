# ZNF789

## Overview
ZNF789 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 789, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 789 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. The protein plays a role in modulating gene expression and is implicated in several biological pathways, although its precise functions and mechanisms of action are still under investigation. Understanding the interactions and regulatory roles of zinc finger protein 789 is crucial for elucidating its contributions to cellular homeostasis and potential involvement in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
