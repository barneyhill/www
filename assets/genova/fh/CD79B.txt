# CD79B

## Overview
The CD79B gene encodes the CD79b protein, a transmembrane component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, which is crucial for B-cell development and function. The CD79b protein forms a heterodimer with CD79a, facilitating BCR signal transduction by interacting with membrane-bound immunoglobulins and various intracellular signaling molecules. This interaction is essential for the initiation and propagation of signaling pathways that regulate B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). The CD79b protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is phosphorylated to activate downstream signaling cascades, including PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). Mutations in CD79B are associated with several B-cell malignancies, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yonese2018CD79B; Visco2020Oncogenic).

## Structure
CD79B is a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, forming a heterodimer with CD79A. This heterodimer is essential for BCR signal transduction and consists of three domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). The extracellular domains of CD79B and CD79A are linked by disulfide bonds, specifically between Cys119 of CD79A and Cys136 of CD79B, and are further stabilized by π-π stacking of aromatic rings and hydrogen bonding (Bhattacharyya2023Combination). The transmembrane helices form a compact bundle dominated by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds (Bhattacharyya2023Combination).

The intracellular domain of CD79B contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) with two critical tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated by Src-family kinases, playing a direct role in BCR signal mediation (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). Ubiquitination of CD79B is crucial for BCR endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, involving ligases like c-Cbl and Cbl-b (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). CD79B is expressed specifically in the B cell lineage, making it a target for immunotherapy in B cell malignancies (Bhattacharyya2023Combination). The protein's expression is limited to B cells, which contributes to its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022Characterization).

## Function
The CD79B gene encodes the CD79b protein, which is a critical component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex. In healthy human cells, particularly B cells, CD79b forms a heterodimer with CD79a, essential for BCR functionality, signal initiation, and transduction (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). This heterodimer is involved in regulating various B cell functions, including antigen uptake, presentation, cell survival, proliferation, activation, differentiation, metabolism, and anergy (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

CD79b plays a pivotal role in BCR signaling by interacting with various regulators to modulate signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). It is involved in the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are crucial for signal transduction and the recruitment of kinases like SYK (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). CD79b also interacts with co-receptors such as CD19 and BAFFR to maintain pro-survival signals in B cells (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

The CD79a/CD79b complex is essential for the assembly and stability of the BCR, facilitating its transport and surface expression by adjusting glycosylation patterns (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). This complex is active in the plasma membrane of B cells, where it transmits signals that lead to B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, impacting the immune response (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD79B gene are implicated in various B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL). In DLBCL, particularly the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype, CD79B mutations, such as the Y196 missense mutation, enhance B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling by preventing internalization and inhibiting negative regulators, leading to increased BCR expression and constitutive NF-κB activation (Visco2020Oncogenic). These mutations often co-occur with MYD88 mutations, contributing to the pathogenesis of the MCD genetic subtype of DLBCL, which is associated with poor outcomes (Visco2020Oncogenic; Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

In PVRL, CD79B mutations, particularly at Y196, are associated with more aggressive disease progression and earlier development of central nervous system lesions, indicating a potential prognostic role (Yonese2018CD79B). These mutations lead to persistently active BCR signaling, which is linked to NF-κB signaling activation (Yonese2018CD79B).

CD79B mutations are also prevalent in other subtypes of DLBCL, such as primary testicular DLBCL, where they are associated with chronic active BCR signaling and poor clinical outcomes (Chen2019&lt; Prevalence; p&gt). These mutations contribute to the survival and proliferation of tumor cells by enhancing BCR signaling pathways, making them potential targets for therapeutic interventions (Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

## Interactions
The CD79B protein, a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, engages in several critical interactions that influence BCR signaling and function. CD79B forms a heterodimer with CD79A, which is essential for BCR assembly and signal transduction. This heterodimer interacts with the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg), forming a stable complex crucial for BCR function (Bhattacharyya2023Combination; Tkachenko2023B-Cell). 

CD79B interacts with proteins such as Lyn and SYK, which are involved in BCR signaling. These interactions facilitate the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), crucial for downstream signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT and NF-κB (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). CD79B also associates with CD19, maintaining pro-survival signals in B cells in a PI3K-dependent manner (Reth2023Discovering; Tkachenko2023B-Cell).

CD79B's interaction with TLR9 leads to MYD88 recruitment and NF-κB signaling upregulation, while its interaction with TRAF3 reduces non-canonical NF-κB and MAPK/ERK pathway activation (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). Additionally, CD79B mutations are linked with CARD11 mutations, which are necessary for NF-κB activation through the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome complex (Tkachenko2023B-Cell). These interactions underscore CD79B's role as a signaling hub in BCR-mediated pathways.
