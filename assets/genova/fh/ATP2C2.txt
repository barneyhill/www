# ATP2C2

## Overview
The ATP2C2 gene encodes the ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+ transporting 2 (SPCA2), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the secretory pathway Ca2+, Mn2+-ATPases family. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and manganese (Mn2+) homeostasis by facilitating their transport into the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as protein sorting and glycosylation. SPCA2 is characterized by its unique structural features, including 10 transmembrane domains and specific motifs that influence its localization and function. It is predominantly expressed in secretory and absorptive epithelial tissues, suggesting a specialized role in these areas. The gene has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those affecting language and cognitive functions, highlighting its significance in both cellular ion regulation and human health (Vanoevelen2005The; Martinelli2021A; Brini2009Calcium).

## Structure
The ATP2C2 gene encodes the SPCA2 protein, a member of the secretory pathway Ca2+, Mn2+-ATPases family. SPCA2 is a 946-residue polypeptide with 64% sequence identity to SPCA1, featuring 10 predicted transmembrane domains and conserved cytosolic phosphorylation and ATPase domains (Xiang2005A; Dode2007Ca2+Mn2+). The protein has a unique N-terminal EF-hand-like motif that is divergent from SPCA1, and its C terminus includes a dileucine motif and a potential type III PDZ binding motif, which may influence localization and trafficking (Xiang2005A).

SPCA2 is characterized by a structure similar to other Ca pumps, fitting the conventional 10 transmembrane helices structure with large cytoplasmic domains (Pestov2012Structural). The protein has a major negatively charged cluster at the N-terminal and an acidic loop in the nucleotide binding domain, with a specific residue (Y505) predicted to be a site of tyrosine phosphorylation (Pestov2012Structural). SPCA2 is predominantly localized in the plasma membranes and is involved in Mn2+ and Ca2+ transport into the secretory pathway (Pestov2012Structural; Xiang2005A). There are no reported splice variants for ATP2C2 (Dode2006Dissection).

## Function
The ATP2C2 gene encodes the human secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase 2 (hSPCA2), a Golgi-localized pump with high affinity for calcium (Ca2+) and manganese (Mn2+) ions. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and contributes to cellular Mn2+ detoxification. It is involved in transporting these ions into the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for various cellular processes such as glycosylation, protein sorting, and degradation (Vanoevelen2005The; Brini2009Calcium).

hSPCA2 is expressed in a limited range of tissues, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, prostate, thyroid, salivary, and mammary glands, as well as in neuronal cells. Its expression pattern suggests a specialized role in these tissues, particularly in secretory and absorptive epithelia (Vanoevelen2005The; Fenech2016Atp2c2). In the Golgi, hSPCA2 ensures the compartment is refilled with Ca2+, which is necessary for the optimal activity of enzymes involved in proteolytic processing (Brini2009Calcium).

The protein's ability to transport Mn2+ at an appreciable rate is a characteristic not shared by other Ca2+ transport ATPases, highlighting its unique role in cellular ion homeostasis and detoxification processes (Vanoevelen2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP2C2 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those affecting language and cognitive functions. Specific language impairment (SLI) has been associated with variations in ATP2C2, where significant associations have been found with phonological short-term memory tasks, such as nonword repetition, which are sensitive to SLI (Newbury2009CMIP). A rare missense variant in ATP2C2 has been linked to language impairment and related cognitive measures, with carriers of this variant showing lower scores in language and reading-related phenotypes (Martinelli2021A). This variant was more frequent in individuals with language impairment compared to those with dyslexia or ADHD, suggesting a specific link to language disorders (Martinelli2021A).

The ATP2C2 gene has also been associated with dyslexia, particularly through its influence on the late component of the mismatch response (MMR), an indicator of auditory discrimination capabilities. SNPs in ATP2C2 have shown significant associations with dyslexia-related phenotypes, suggesting a potential genetic overlap between dyslexia and language impairments (Müller2017ATP2C2andDYX1C1are). These findings highlight the gene's role in modulating cognitive and language-related traits, potentially through its impact on calcium and manganese ion transport in neuronal processes.

## Interactions
ATP2C2, also known as SPCA2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for calcium signaling and homeostasis. SPCA2 interacts with the ion channels Kv10.1 and Orai1, forming a complex that facilitates store-independent calcium entry (SICE), which is essential for breast cancer cell survival and proliferation. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of breast cancer, where SPCA2, Kv10.1, and Orai1 are co-expressed in aggressive tumor tissues (Peretti2019Original).

SPCA2 also interacts with CCDC47, a protein involved in calcium homeostasis, through its transmembrane domain. This interaction is distinct from those with STIM1 and Orai1, which are key regulators of Store-Operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE). The SPCA2-CCDC47 interaction is crucial for the regulation of the STIM1-Orai1 complex and SOCE (Samardzija2023Defining).

In pancreatic acinar cells, SPCA2C, a variant of SPCA2, interacts with Orai1 to affect SICE and is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction highlights SPCA2C's role in calcium regulation and suggests potential functions in vesicular transport (Samardzija2023Defining).
