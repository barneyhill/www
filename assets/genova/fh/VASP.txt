# VASP

## Overview
The VASP gene encodes the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins, which are pivotal in regulating actin filament dynamics. This protein is categorized as an actin-associated protein and plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as motility, adhesion, and shape maintenance. VASP is characterized by its structural domains, including an EVH1 domain for protein-protein interactions, a proline-rich region, and an EVH2 domain for actin binding and tetramerization. It is involved in the modulation of actin polymerization, which is essential for processes like cell migration and polarization. VASP's activity is regulated through phosphorylation by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, influencing its role in actin dynamics and cellular functions. The protein is also significant in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and modulating platelet function, impacting vascular health and hemostasis (Reinhard1995The; Hansen2010VASP; Benz2023Cardiovascular).

## Structure
The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a 380-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 39.8 kDa, although it migrates with an apparent mass of 46 kDa during SDS-PAGE (Holt1998Molecules). VASP is organized into three structural domains: an EVH1 domain for protein-protein interactions, a central proline-rich region, and an EVH2 domain for actin binding and tetramerization (Reinhard1995The). The central proline-rich region contains motifs that facilitate binding to profilin, a G-actin-binding protein, and includes four GPPPPP motifs (Reinhard1995The; Holt1998Molecules). 

VASP exists as a homo-tetramer in its native state, with a total molecular mass of approximately 149 kDa (Holt1998Molecules). The C-terminal region of VASP is crucial for its targeting to focal adhesions and includes a repetitive mixed-charge cluster sequence important for binding to vinculin (BRINDLE1996The). VASP is phosphorylated at three sites: serine-157, serine-239, and threonine-278, with phosphorylation at serine-157 causing a conformational change (Holt1998Molecules). These phosphorylation events are mediated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and are important for VASP's function in actin filament assembly and cell motility (Reinhard1995The).

## Function
Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a key regulator of actin filament dynamics, playing a significant role in cell motility, adhesion, and shape. VASP is part of the Ena/VASP family, which is involved in promoting the assembly of actin networks, particularly at sites of high actin turnover such as the leading edge of lamellipodia and filopodia in motile cells (Hansen2010VASP; Benz2023Cardiovascular). VASP acts as a processive actin polymerase, facilitating the addition of actin monomers to the growing barbed ends of filaments, which is crucial for cellular processes like migration and polarization (Hansen2010VASP).

In endothelial cells, VASP is essential for maintaining the integrity of the endothelial barrier by stabilizing interendothelial junctions and regulating vascular permeability (Comerford2002Role; Benz2023Cardiovascular). VASP's phosphorylation by protein kinases such as PKA and PKG modulates its activity and localization, impacting actin dynamics and cell movement (Benz2009Differential; Comerford2002Role). VASP also plays a role in platelet function, where it modulates actin polymerization and inhibits platelet aggregation, thereby influencing hemostasis (Aszodi1999The). Through these activities, VASP contributes to various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, vascular repair, and cardiovascular health (Benz2023Cardiovascular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the VASP gene have been implicated in several cardiovascular and cancer-related conditions. In the cardiovascular system, VASP is crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cardiac myocytes. Disruption of VASP localization in intercalated disks can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by cardiac dilatation, hypertrophy, and conduction abnormalities (Eigenthaler2003Disruption). Mice deficient in both Mena and VASP exhibit cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting the importance of these proteins in cardiac health (Benz2013MenaVASP).

In cancer, VASP is overexpressed in various types, including breast cancer, where it is associated with tumor differentiation and metastasis. High levels of VASP expression correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, particularly in aggressive subtypes like HER2-Enriched and Basal-like (Hu2019CREB1Lin28miR638VASP). The regulation of VASP by transcription factors and miRNAs, such as CREB1 and miR-638, plays a role in its upregulation in cancer cells, contributing to enhanced cell migration and invasion (Hu2019CREB1Lin28miR638VASP). These findings suggest that VASP is a significant factor in both cardiovascular and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in actin filament dynamics and cell motility. VASP interacts with profilins from different species, including human, calf thymus, and recombinant birch pollen, suggesting a role in signal transduction and cellular motility (Reinhard1995The). It also forms complexes with palladin, a protein containing proline-rich motifs, which bind to Ena/VASP family members. This interaction is significant for the formation of multiprotein complexes in cellular structures, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and blot overlay experiments (Boukhelifa2004Palladin).

VASP interacts with αII-spectrin in endothelial cells, a binding mediated by the SH3 domain of spectrin and the proline-rich region of VASP. This interaction is crucial for endothelial cell-cell adhesion and vascular permeability (Benz2008Cytoskeleton). VASP also forms complexes with Mena and other proteins in cardiomyocytes, contributing to the structural integrity of Z-discs and intercalated discs (Benz2013MenaVASP).

In the context of filopodia formation, VASP interacts with IRSp53, enhancing its actin bundling ability. This interaction is mediated through the proline-rich region of VASP and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 (Vaggi2011The). These interactions highlight VASP's role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cellular adhesion processes.
