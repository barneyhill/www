# SNTG2

## Overview
SNTG2, or syntrophin gamma 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the syntrophin family, which is characterized by its role as a scaffolding protein involved in cellular signaling and structural organization. The protein encoded by SNTG2, syntrophin gamma 2, is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle and neuronal cells by linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (Piluso2000γ1-; Bhat2012Syntrophin). Syntrophin gamma 2 is distinguished by its domain organization, including a PDZ domain, two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and its involvement in synaptic function (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Yamakawa2007Neuroligins). The protein is implicated in neuromuscular signaling and has been associated with clinical conditions such as osteoporotic vertebral fractures, highlighting its potential significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Jales2020Overexpression).

## Structure
Syntrophin gamma 2 (SNTG2) is a protein encoded by the SNTG2 gene, characterized by a unique domain organization that includes a PDZ domain, two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The PH domains are involved in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization, with the first PH domain split into two halves by the PDZ domain, forming a PH N -PDZ-PH C tandem structure (Bhat2012Syntrophin). This structure is crucial for binding to membrane lipids and interacting with calmodulin, contributing to oligomerization (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

The γ2 isoform of syntrophin has a 14 amino acid extension at the C-terminal tail, which may form a P-loop important for dystrophin binding (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The protein is 539 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa (Bhat2012Syntrophin). SNTG2 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect the PDZ domain and contribute to its functional diversity (Piluso2000γ1-). The protein is involved in interactions with neuroligins, with the PDZ domain playing a key role in these interactions (Yamakawa2007Neuroligins).

## Function
SNTG2, or syntrophin gamma 2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and structural organization within healthy human cells. It is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which is essential for linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of muscle and neuronal cells (Piluso2000γ1-; Bhat2012Syntrophin). SNTG2 is highly expressed in neuronal cells and is involved in synaptic function, potentially acting as a scaffolding protein that organizes signaling pathways (Yamakawa2007Neuroligins).

The protein contains pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and a PDZ domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and membrane localization. These domains allow SNTG2 to recruit various signaling molecules to the cell membrane, contributing to the regulation of intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics (Bhat2012Syntrophin). In muscle cells, SNTG2 is localized in the subsynaptic space beneath the neuromuscular junction, indicating its role in neuromuscular signaling (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The protein's interaction with dystrophin and other components of the DAPC underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function (Piluso2000γ1-).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SNTG2 gene have been associated with osteoporotic vertebral fractures (VFs) in elderly women. The study by Jales Neto et al. found that SNTG2 was significantly overexpressed in women with VFs compared to those without, suggesting a strong correlation between SNTG2 expression and the risk of developing these fractures (Jales2020Overexpression). This overexpression is independent of bone mineral density, indicating that SNTG2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of VFs through mechanisms other than bone density reduction (Jales2020Overexpression).

The research identified SNTG2 as one of the most upregulated genes in the VF group, with a significant positive association with the presence of fractures (Jales2020Overexpression). The study suggests that SNTG2 may influence pathways related to cell adhesion and receptor binding, which could be critical in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoporotic fractures (Jales2020Overexpression). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of SNTG2 expression alterations in identifying individuals at risk for VFs and suggest that further research is needed to validate these results in larger populations (Jales2020Overexpression).

## Interactions
SNTG2 (syntrophin gamma 2) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex. It interacts with neuroligins, specifically neuroligins 3 and 4X, through its PDZ domain. These interactions are crucial for synaptic maturation and are affected by autism-related mutations, which can weaken the binding of neuroligins to SNTG2 (Yamakawa2007Neuroligins). SNTG2 also interacts with dystrophin and dystrobrevin proteins, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and GST pull-down studies, indicating its role in linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (Piluso2000γ1-).

In addition to its interactions with neuroligins and dystrophin, SNTG2 has been identified as a binding partner for diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKζ) in certain cell types, although this interaction is not consistently observed across all experimental conditions (Zambo2023Comparative). SNTG2's involvement in these interactions highlights its role as a scaffolding protein, contributing to cellular signaling and structural stability within neuronal cells.
