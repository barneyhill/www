# NICN1

## Overview
NICN1 is a gene that encodes the protein nicolin 1, a subunit of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex, which is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation. This modification is crucial for the regulation of microtubule stability and function, impacting cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and ciliary function. Nicolin 1, as part of this complex, plays a significant role in maintaining cellular architecture and genetic stability by ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein's involvement in intracellular transport and ciliary function further underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. Mutations and alterations in the NICN1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including thyroid cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance (Tous2023Identification; Pellagatti2018Impact).

## Function
NICN1, or nicolin 1, is a critical component of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex, which plays a significant role in the post-translational modification of tubulin through a process known as polyglutamylation. This modification is essential for regulating microtubule stability and function, which are vital for various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and ciliary function. Polyglutamylation affects the interaction of microtubules with motor proteins and other microtubule-associated proteins, thereby influencing the dynamics and organization of the microtubule network within the cell.

In healthy human cells, NICN1's activity is crucial for maintaining proper cellular architecture and function. By modulating the stability of microtubules, NICN1 ensures the correct segregation of chromosomes during cell division, which is fundamental for genetic stability. Additionally, the role of NICN1 in intracellular transport is vital for the distribution of organelles and vesicles, impacting processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis. The function of NICN1 in ciliary function is also significant, as cilia are involved in signaling pathways and the movement of fluids across epithelial surfaces. Overall, NICN1's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NICN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of thyroid cancer, a variant of the NICN1 gene has been identified as likely deleterious, contributing to the development of thyroid cancer by affecting microtubule functions, which are crucial for cellular processes (Tous2023Identification). The gene's involvement in cancer is further supported by its association with glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) activity, which is linked to clinical phenotypes such as hypertension and smoking (Lubos2013Association).

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), NICN1 exhibits aberrant splicing events that correlate with clinical variables, including platelet counts. These splicing events are significant predictors of patient survival, suggesting a role in disease progression (Pellagatti2018Impact). Additionally, NICN1 is associated with anorexia nervosa-related phenotypes, particularly in the context of tobacco and illicit drug use, where its upregulation correlates with increased drug use frequency in individuals with low BMI (Johnson2021The).

The presence of inverted SINEs in the 3' UTR of NICN1 can lead to a significant reduction in gene expression, potentially impacting protein production and contributing to disease states (Tajaddod2016Transcriptomewide). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NICN1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
NICN1, also known as nicolin 1, is a subunit of the tubulin polyglutamylase (TPG) complex, which is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin. Within the TPG complex, NICN1 interacts with multiple known components, suggesting its role in the complex's function (Zhang2024Computing). The TPG complex includes subunits such as TTLL1, TPGS1, TPGS2, LRRC49, and NICN1, with NICN1 interacting with TBC1D19, a predicted central component of the complex (Zhang2024Computing). 

NICN1 mRNA is also involved in interactions with nuclear proteins. It is specifically bound to the protein p54 nrb, which is associated with nuclear retention and RNA editing (Chen2008Alu). This interaction suggests a mechanism for regulating the expression of NICN1 mRNA through editing and nuclear retention, as RNAs containing IRAlus, like NICN1 mRNA, are retained in the nucleus and are more extensively edited than those in the cytoplasm (Chen2008Alu). The presence of IRAlus in the 3' UTR of NICN1 mRNA contributes to its nuclear retention, mediated by interactions with paraspeckle proteins such as p54 nrb (Hu2015Protein).
