# UBE2U

## Overview
UBE2U is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 U, a member of the E2 enzyme family involved in the ubiquitination process. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is responsible for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Magnati2024A; Meghan2022Review). UBE2U is classified as a class 3 E2 enzyme, characterized by a C-terminal extension that may influence its interaction specificity with RING E3 ligases (Meghan2022Review). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Meghan2022Review). Despite its broad interaction network, UBE2U exhibits low expression levels in certain tissues, such as the human brain, suggesting a specialized role in specific cellular contexts (Magnati2024A).

## Structure
UBE2U, a human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, features a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is a hallmark of E2 enzymes. This domain typically exhibits an α/β-fold structure, comprising an N-terminal helix, a four-stranded β-meander, a short 3_10-helix, and two C-terminal helices. The active-site cysteine, crucial for its enzymatic function, is located in a shallow groove surrounded by conserved residues that facilitate thioester and isopeptide bond formation (Gundogdu2019Structural).

UBE2U is classified as a class 3 E2 enzyme, characterized by having between 10 and 50 amino acids at the C-terminus. This C-terminal extension may influence its specificity and binding interactions with RING E3 ligases, although the exact role of these terminal residues in specificity remains unclear (Meghan2022Review).

The structural variations in UBE2U, particularly in the C-terminal α3-α4 region, as well as in the α1 helix and loops L4 and L7, are thought to affect its interaction specificity with E3 ligases (Gundogdu2019Structural). UBE2U has been identified to have 52 interactors, indicating its potential for diverse interactions with RING E3 ligases (Meghan2022Review).

## Function
UBE2U encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 U, which is involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical post-translational modification that regulates protein concentration, function, and cellular location. This enzyme is part of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), which tags proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Magnati2024A; Meghan2022Review). UBE2U is classified as a Class 3 E2 enzyme, characterized by C-terminal extensions, which may influence substrate specificity and ubiquitin chain elongation (Meghan2022Review).

UBE2U is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing roles in cell cycle regulation and stress responses. The enzyme facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E1 enzymes to substrates, a process mediated by RING E3 ligases (Meghan2022Review). Despite its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes, UBE2U exhibits extremely low expression levels throughout human brain development, suggesting a limited or highly specialized role in this context (Magnati2024A). The specific function of UBE2U in healthy human cells remains less detailed, with its precise roles and interactions still under investigation.

## Interactions
UBE2U is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that interacts with various E3 ligases within the human ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is notably connected to 52 E3 ligases, making it one of the most highly connected E2 enzymes in the network (van2009A). Among its interactions, UBE2U has a significant interaction with the E3 ligase MDM2, a key regulator of the transcriptional regulator p53. This interaction was confirmed through GST-pulldown assays, demonstrating that UBE2U binds more efficiently to MDM2 than UBE2D2, another E2 enzyme (van2009A). 

UBE2U acts as a hub protein in the E2-E3 interaction network, contributing to the robustness and resistance of the ubiquitin-conjugation network against perturbations. Its removal from the network results in 32 E3s becoming unconnected, highlighting its critical role in maintaining network connectivity (van2009A). Despite its high connectivity, UBE2U's ubiquitin-conjugating activity is not well characterized, possibly due to its restricted expression pattern in the urogenital tract (van2009A). UBE2U is also capable of loading ubiquitin, although it does so weakly compared to other E2 enzymes (Sheng2012A).
