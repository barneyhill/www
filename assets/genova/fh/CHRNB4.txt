# CHRNB4

## Overview
The CHRNB4 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 4 subunit, a component of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are categorized as ligand-gated ion channels. These receptors are crucial for neurotransmission and are composed of various alpha and beta subunits, forming heteropentamers. The beta 4 subunit, specifically, contributes to the structural integrity and ligand-binding properties of the receptor. It is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, playing a significant role in autonomic functions and cognitive processes. The CHRNB4 gene has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions, including nicotine dependence and epilepsy, due to its influence on receptor function and brain circuitry (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic; Duga2001Characterization).

## Function
The CHRNB4 gene encodes the beta 4 subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels involved in neurotransmission. These receptors are heteropentamers composed of alpha and beta subunits and are expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The beta 4 subunit, in particular, plays a structural role in the receptor and contributes to ligand binding profiles (Duga2001Characterization). 

In the peripheral nervous system, the beta 4 subunit is part of nAChRs that are involved in autonomic nervous system functions, including bladder contractility. Mice lacking the beta 4 subunit exhibit deficits in bladder contraction, indicating its role in autonomic regulation (LevLehman2001Characterization). In the central nervous system, the beta 4 subunit is expressed in regions such as the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway, which is associated with the brain's response to aversive stimuli (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic).

The beta 4 subunit is also implicated in various neurological processes, including cognition and memory, and is associated with conditions like epilepsy and nicotine dependence (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic; Kedmi2007Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHRNB4 gene, which encodes the β4 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, have been linked to several clinical conditions. Variants in CHRNB4 are associated with nicotine addiction, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs11636753 showing strong associations with nicotine addiction across multiple cohorts (Icick2020Genetic). The gene's variants, mostly intronic, influence gene expression and methylation patterns, affecting the risk of nicotine addiction by modifying receptor function and brain circuitry involved in addiction (Icick2020Genetic).

Rare missense variants in CHRNB4, such as T375I and T91I, have been associated with a reduced risk of nicotine dependence. These variants are linked to an increased cellular response to nicotine, which may lead to a decreased risk of dependence by allowing carriers to smoke fewer cigarettes and experience fewer withdrawal symptoms (Haller2011Rare). The presence of these variants suggests a protective effect against nicotine dependence, particularly in African American and European American populations (Haller2011Rare).

Alterations in CHRNB4 expression have also been implicated in cognitive functions, such as attention variability in ADHD patients, and are associated with severe neurodevelopmental delay (Icick2020Genetic). The gene's role in nicotine addiction and its potential impact on other neuropsychiatric disorders highlight its clinical significance.
