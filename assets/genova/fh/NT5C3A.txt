# NT5C3A

## Overview
The NT5C3A gene encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IIIA, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleotides, such as uridine monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP), into their respective nucleosides. The activity of 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IIIA, is crucial for maintaining nucleotide balance within cells, particularly during erythrocyte maturation, where it prevents the toxic accumulation of nucleotides. Beyond its metabolic functions, the enzyme is involved in modulating inflammatory responses by acting as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, specifically through the inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Mutations in the NT5C3A gene can lead to pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase deficiency, resulting in hemolytic anemia and affecting inflammatory processes (AlHaj2018The; Bogusławska2022A).

## Structure
The NT5C3A gene encodes a cytosolic enzyme known as pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, which plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism. The enzyme's structure includes several conserved motifs that are essential for its catalytic function. Motif I, characterized by the sequence DXDX[T/V][L/V/I], is highly conserved within the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family and includes a critical aspartate residue that is transiently phosphorylated during catalysis (AlHaj2018The). The enzyme's catalytic site is formed by three conserved regions, known as cN-III Motifs I, II, and III, which are crucial for substrate accommodation, phosphate binding, and activation of water molecules necessary for substrate hydrolysis (dos2014Pyrimidine5′nucleotidase).

Mutations in the NT5C3A gene can significantly impact the enzyme's structure and function. For instance, the p.F149del mutation results in the deletion of a phenylalanine residue, which shortens a beta strand and likely destabilizes the enzyme's structure, preventing substrate binding and leading to a near-complete loss of enzyme activity (Bogusławska2022A). Another mutation, N179S, located near the catalytic site within the α/β Rossman-like domain, reduces catalytic activity (AlHaj2018The). These structural features and mutations highlight the importance of the enzyme's precise molecular architecture for its function in nucleotide metabolism.

## Function
The NT5C3A gene encodes the enzyme pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, which plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleotides such as uridine monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP) to their corresponding nucleosides. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining nucleotide balance within cells and is particularly significant during the maturation of erythrocytes, where it prevents the accumulation of nucleotides that could be toxic to cells (Bogusławska2022A).

In addition to its role in erythrocytes, NT5C3A is involved in regulating inflammatory responses. It acts as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling by inhibiting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, which is a key mediator of proinflammatory cytokine expression. This regulation is achieved through the modulation of sirtuin activity, specifically SIRT1 and SIRT6, leading to histone deacetylation and suppression of NF-κB target gene expression, including IL8 (AlHaj2018The).

NT5C3A is inducible by type I interferons in various cell types, suggesting a broader role beyond erythrocytes. It functions as part of an anti-inflammatory pathway, acting as a negative feedback regulator to control excessive inflammatory cytokine signaling (AlHaj2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NT5C3A gene are associated with pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase deficiency, a rare erythrocyte enzymopathy that leads to hemolytic anemia. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as jaundice, hemoglobinuria, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, and reticulocytosis. The deficiency results from the accumulation of pyrimidine nucleotides, which disrupts erythrocyte metabolism and leads to decreased intracellular pH and reduced enzyme activities (Bogusławska2022A). A specific mutation, p.F149del, causes a single amino acid deletion, significantly reducing enzyme activity and leading to the clinical manifestations of the disease (Bogusławska2022A).

NT5C3A mutations also affect inflammatory processes. The gene acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Pathological mutations, such as D87V, N179S, and G230R, disrupt this regulatory function, potentially contributing to disease pathology by altering cytokine signaling pathways (AlHaj2018The). These mutations are linked to hemolytic anemia, as they impair the enzyme's catalytic activity and thermostability (AlHaj2018The).

NT5C3A deficiency is also implicated in anemia resulting from lead poisoning or β-thalassemia co-inheritance, highlighting its broader clinical significance (AlHaj2018The).

## Interactions
The NT5C3A protein, also known as 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IIIA, is involved in several interactions that influence cytokine signaling and nucleotide metabolism. It acts as a negative regulator in interferon (IFN) and cytokine signaling by interacting with various molecular pathways. NT5C3A is inducible by type I interferons and plays a role in suppressing cytokine production through the inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. This suppression involves the interaction of NT5C3A with sirtuins, specifically SIRT1 and SIRT6, which are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. These interactions lead to the deacetylation of histone H3 and the NF-κB subunit RelA (p65), thereby repressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-8 (AlHaj2018The).

NT5C3A also interacts with downstream mediators of the TNF receptor 1, such as MAP3K7 (TAK1), TAB1, and IKKβ, which are involved in NF-κB activation. Coexpression of NT5C3A with these mediators attenuates NF-κB activation, highlighting its role as a negative regulator of NF-κB target gene expression (AlHaj2018The). Additionally, NT5C3A's interaction with IRF1 is crucial for its expression in response to IFN and TNF-α, further influencing cytokine signaling pathways (AlHaj2018The).
