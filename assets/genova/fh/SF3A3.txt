# SF3A3

## Overview
SF3A3 is a gene that encodes the protein splicing factor 3a subunit 3, which is a critical component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. The protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is part of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, playing a vital role in the assembly of the mature 17S U2 snRNP. SF3A3 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process that enhances protein diversity by allowing a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms (Martelly2019Identification; Liu2022E2F6KDM5C). The protein's interactions and expression levels are significant in various cellular processes and have been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chen2022CircSCAP; Liu2022E2F6KDM5C).

## Function
SF3A3 is a component of the splicing factor 3a complex, which plays a crucial role in the assembly of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This process is essential for accurate mRNA processing, which is critical for proper gene expression and cellular function (Martelly2019Identification). SF3A3 is part of the U2 snRNP, a core component of the spliceosome, and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing by facilitating the assembly of the mature 17S U2 snRNP (Martelly2019Identification; Liu2022E2F6KDM5C).

SF3A3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing, a process that allows a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms, thereby increasing the diversity of proteins that a cell can produce (Chen2022CircSCAP). The integrity of the SF3A complex, which includes SF3A3, is vital for normal physiological processes, as it ensures the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome, which is essential for the removal of introns and the ligation of exons in pre-mRNAs (Martelly2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
SF3A3 is implicated in the progression of several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In bladder cancer (BC), SF3A3 is overexpressed compared to normal tissues, and this upregulation is associated with poor prognosis. The increased expression of SF3A3 in BC is linked to the hypomethylation of its DNA promoter, a process facilitated by the demethylase KDM5C. The interaction between KDM5C and the transcription factor E2F6 is crucial for this demethylation, leading to enhanced SF3A3 expression and promoting BC progression (Liu2022E2F6KDM5C).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SF3A3 acts as an oncogenic protein, promoting malignancy through cell proliferation and colony formation. The circular RNA circSCAP interacts with SF3A3, leading to its degradation via a ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. This interaction inhibits NSCLC malignancy by activating p53 signaling, which is known for its tumor-suppressing functions. Overexpression of circSCAP reduces SF3A3 levels, thereby suppressing tumor growth in NSCLC (Chen2022CircSCAP).

These findings suggest that SF3A3 plays a significant role in cancer progression, and its expression and interactions are potential targets for therapeutic strategies in these cancers.

## Interactions
SF3A3, a component of the spliceosome, is involved in various protein interactions essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It is part of the SF3a complex, which includes SF3A1 and SF3A2, and plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the spliceosome by associating with the U2 snRNP (Akerman2015Differential). SF3A3 interacts directly with SRSF1, a splicing activator, in an RNA-independent manner, as demonstrated by in vitro binding assays. This interaction highlights SF3A3's involvement in early spliceosome assembly and its persistent association throughout the splicing process (Akerman2015Differential).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SF3A3 interacts with circSCAP, a circular RNA that promotes its ubiquitination and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction leads to the activation of p53 signaling, a crucial tumor-suppressing mechanism (Chen2022CircSCAP). SF3A3 also forms a complex with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), regulating the alternative splicing of the MDM4 transcript, which is involved in p53 signaling (Chen2022CircSCAP). These interactions underscore SF3A3's role in both normal cellular processes and cancer progression.
