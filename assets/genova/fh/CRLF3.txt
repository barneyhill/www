# CRLF3

## Overview
Cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (CRLF3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the class I cytokine receptor family, characterized by its involvement in neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. The CRLF3 protein is a receptor that features a cytokine receptor homology domain (CHD) and is structurally similar to other hematopoietic cytokine receptors, containing motifs essential for cytokine binding and signal transduction. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, particularly within the nervous system. CRLF3 is activated by erythropoietin (Epo) and its splice variant EV-3, which are crucial for its function in neuroprotection and cell survival under stress conditions. The gene's expression is widespread across human tissues, and its dysregulation has been linked to several diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers (Knorr2023The; Knorr2024Antiapoptotic; Taznin2022Cytokine).

## Structure
The CRLF3 protein is characterized by a cytokine receptor homology domain (CHD) in its extracellular region, which includes the conserved WSXWS motif, typical of cytokine receptors in bilateria (Knorr2023The; Taznin2022Cytokine). The protein consists of 442 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 49.6 kDa (mifsud2018exploration). Sequence analysis reveals a fibronectin type-III domain between residues 181-274, which is involved in cell adhesion and morphology, and a SPRY domain, although its function remains unknown (mifsud2018exploration). The protein also contains coiled coils between residues 10-57 (mifsud2018exploration).

The secondary structure of CRLF3 includes helices in the first part of the protein and β-sheets in the second part, particularly in the fibronectin type domain (mifsud2018exploration). The protein's tertiary structure has not been fully elucidated, and there is no detailed information on its quaternary structure. CRLF3 is predicted to lack transmembrane helices and signal peptides (mifsud2018exploration). The protein is implicated in various cellular functions, including blood clotting and cell cycle regulation, but its ligand remains unidentified (mifsud2018exploration).

## Function
The CRLF3 gene encodes a cytokine receptor involved in neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in human cells. It is activated by erythropoietin (Epo) and its splice variant EV-3, leading to neuroprotection through the transphosphorylation of JAK, which subsequently activates STAT as a transcription factor. This activation promotes the transcription of anti-apoptotic proteins and may involve GATA transcription factors that inhibit pro-apoptotic gene transcription, shifting the balance towards cell survival under stress (Knorr2024Antiapoptotic).

CRLF3 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including the nervous system, where it plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is structurally similar to other hematopoietic cytokine receptors and contains a cytokine receptor motif, a transmembrane region, and a Janus kinase docking site (Knorr2023The). In neuron-like cells, CRLF3 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis, as EV-3 binding to CRLF3 initiates endocytosis, suggesting its role in ligand-induced protective mechanisms (Knorr2023The).

CRLF3's activation by EV-3 protects neurons from stress-induced apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cell homeostasis and tissue protection, particularly in the nervous system (Knorr2024Antiapoptotic).

## Clinical Significance
The CRLF3 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. Variants in CRLF3 have been associated with an increased risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, with significant expression increases observed in affected skin tissues (Castellucci2020A). In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, CRLF3 is identified as a critical regulator of neurogenesis. Mutations in CRLF3, such as a deleterious p.Leu389Pro mutation, have been linked to increased autism traits in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (Wegscheid2021Patientderived).

CRLF3 is also involved in hematopoietic processes, with its ablation in mice leading to reduced platelet numbers and altered red blood cell parameters (Taznin2022Cytokine). In cancer, CRLF3 is part of a rare UTP6-CRLF3 fusion observed in acute myeloid leukemia and is upregulated in early cancerous stages of skin cancers (Taznin2022Cytokine). Additionally, CRLF3 has been implicated in neuroprotection, particularly in response to the erythropoietin splice variant EV-3, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases (Knorr2023The).

## Interactions
CRLF3 is a largely uncharacterized orphan cytokine receptor that is part of the group 1 prototypic class I cytokine receptors. These receptors typically bind class 1 helical cytokines and function as homo- or hetero-dimers or associate with multimeric receptor complexes (Hahn2024Functional). CRLF3 contains a conserved cytokine receptor motif WSXWS, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular Janus kinase (JAK) docking site, suggesting potential interactions with JAK proteins as part of its signaling pathway (Hahn2024Functional). 

CRLF3 has been shown to activate STAT3, a transcription factor, and cause cell cycle arrest in a human embryonic kidney cell line, indicating potential interactions with components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Hahn2024Functional). In the context of neuroprotection, CRLF3 is activated by erythropoietin (Epo) and its splice variant EV-3, which suggests that CRLF3 may serve as a receptor for Epo-like cytokines, mediating neuroprotective effects (Knorr2023The; Knorr2024Antiapoptotic). However, specific physical interactions of CRLF3 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature (Hahn2024Functional; Knorr2024Antiapoptotic).
