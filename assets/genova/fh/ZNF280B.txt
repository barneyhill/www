# ZNF280B

## Overview
ZNF280B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 280B, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA and other proteins. The protein encoded by ZNF280B is involved in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and survival. Notably, zinc finger protein 280B has been associated with the modulation of key proteins involved in cancer progression, such as the tumor suppressor protein p53 and sGCa1, a protein linked to cell proliferation (Gao2013Zinc). The dysregulation of ZNF280B expression has been observed in several cancers, including gastric and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Gao2013Zinc; Zhai2018ZNF280B).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF280B has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, notably gastric and prostate cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer, ZNF280B expression is associated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and proliferation. Studies have shown that ZNF280B expression correlates with increased cell proliferation and colony formation in gastric cancer cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhai2018ZNF280B).

In prostate cancer, ZNF280B is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal prostate cells. It acts as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53 by promoting its nuclear export and degradation through the induction of Mdm2, a known p53 antagonist. This regulation leads to decreased p53 activity, facilitating cancer cell survival and proliferation. ZNF280B also enhances the expression of sGCa1, contributing to prostate cancer cell growth (Gao2013Zinc).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF280B in cancer, suggesting that targeting its expression or interactions could be a viable strategy for therapeutic intervention in these malignancies.

## Interactions
ZNF280B is involved in several interactions that influence its role in cancer cell regulation. In prostate cancer cells, ZNF280B up-regulates the expression of sGCa1, a protein associated with cell proliferation, by increasing its mRNA and protein levels. This interaction suggests that sGCa1 is a target of ZNF280B, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Gao2013Zinc).

ZNF280B also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It down-regulates p53 protein levels by promoting its nuclear export and subsequent degradation. This process is mediated through the up-regulation of Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation. ZNF280B acts as a transcriptional activator on the Mdm2 promoter, enhancing Mdm2 expression and thus facilitating p53 degradation (Gao2013Zinc).

These interactions highlight ZNF280B's role in modulating key proteins involved in cell growth and survival, particularly in the context of cancer. The regulation of sGCa1 and p53 by ZNF280B underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment (Gao2013Zinc).
