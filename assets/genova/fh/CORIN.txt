# CORIN

## Overview
CORIN is a gene located on chromosome 4p12-13 that encodes the corin protein, a type II transmembrane serine protease. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular physiology by converting pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) into their active forms, ANP and BNP, respectively. These peptides are crucial for regulating blood pressure and volume through vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis (Wang2008Corin; Liao2007Role). Corin is primarily expressed in cardiac tissues but is also found in the kidney and bloodstream, where it contributes to cardiovascular homeostasis (Ichiki2011Corin). The protein is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and requires proteolytic activation by PCSK6, with glycosylation playing a significant role in its activation and function (Chen2015PCSK6mediated; Liao2007Role). Variants in the CORIN gene have been linked to cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure, underscoring its clinical significance (Wang2008Corin; Li2016Role).

## Structure
The CORIN protein is a type II transmembrane serine protease encoded by the human CORIN gene located on chromosome 4p12-13. It consists of 1042 amino acids and is synthesized as a zymogen, requiring cleavage at Arg801 for activation (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored; Dong2012Corin). The primary structure includes a signal anchor that serves as a transmembrane domain, positioning the protease in the plasma membrane (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

The extracellular region of CORIN features two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains, eight LDL receptor-like repeats, a scavenger receptor-like domain, and a C-terminal trypsin-like protease domain (Ichiki2013BNP; Dong2012Corin). These domains are crucial for substrate interactions and catalytic activity. The protein's molecular mass is approximately 116 kDa, but it appears as 150-200 kDa on immunoblots due to N-glycosylation, with 19 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular region (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

CORIN's tertiary structure involves complex folding patterns typical of serine proteases, with the protease domain remaining attached to the rest of the molecule via a disulfide bond after activation (Dong2012Corin). The quaternary structure is not detailed in the provided context. No O-linked glycans or sialic acids have been detected in CORIN (Dong2012Corin).

## Function
The CORIN gene encodes a cardiac serine protease that plays a crucial role in the activation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a hormone involved in regulating blood pressure and volume. In healthy human cells, corin is primarily produced in atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, where it functions as a pro-ANP convertase, converting pro-ANP to its active form, ANP. This conversion is essential for promoting vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis, thereby contributing to cardiovascular homeostasis (Wang2008Corin; Liao2007Role).

Corin is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and requires proteolytic cleavage for activation. This activation process is facilitated by PCSK6, a protease that cleaves corin, enabling it to process pro-ANP efficiently (Chen2015PCSK6mediated). Glycosylation is also critical for corin activation, as N-glycans are necessary for its biosynthesis and activity (Liao2007Role).

Corin's activity is not limited to the heart; it is also expressed in the kidney and present in the bloodstream, where it processes pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) into its active form, BNP, which is important for cardiovascular health (Ichiki2011Corin). Variants in the CORIN gene that impair its activation have been linked to hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal blood pressure (Wang2008Corin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CORIN gene are associated with several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, and pre-eclampsia. Variants such as c.102_103insA, T555I, and Q568P have been linked to hypertension by impairing corin's ability to activate natriuretic peptides, which are crucial for blood pressure regulation (Wang2008Corin; Zhang2014A; Li2016Role). The c.102_103insA variant causes a frameshift that leads to poor Golgi trafficking and reduced cell surface expression, resulting in decreased natriuretic peptide processing activity (Zhang2014A). The T555I and Q568P variants, particularly prevalent in African Americans, are associated with hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy due to impaired zymogen activation (Wang2008Corin; Li2016Role).

Corin dysfunction is also implicated in pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by gestational hypertension. Corin expression in the uterus is essential for proper spiral artery remodeling, and defects in corin function may contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia (Li2016Role). Additionally, low plasma corin levels have been observed in heart failure and acute myocardial infarction patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions (Yu2018Circulating).

## Interactions
CORIN, a serine protease, is involved in the activation of natriuretic peptides, such as pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP). It interacts with these substrates to convert them into their active forms, which are crucial for cardiovascular homeostasis (Wang2008Corin). The activation of CORIN itself is mediated by the protease PCSK6, which activates corin on the cell surface but not intracellularly. This interaction is significant for the proper functioning of CORIN, as demonstrated by the impaired activation of certain CORIN variants, such as p.Arg530Ser, which are not enhanced by PCSK6 overexpression (Zhang2017Identification).

CORIN's activity is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level by microRNA 1-3p (miR-1-3p), which binds to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of CORIN mRNA. This interaction inhibits CORIN expression and subsequently reduces its activity in human cardiomyocytes. The inhibition of miR-1-3p leads to increased CORIN expression and enhanced atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) biogenesis, highlighting a regulatory mechanism that affects CORIN's function in cardiac cells (Celik2019Functional).
