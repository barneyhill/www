# JAKMIP1

## Overview
JAKMIP1, or Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by JAKMIP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and communication, particularly within neuronal cells. It interacts with Janus kinases (JAKs) and other proteins, such as CLASP2 and Kinesin light chain 1, to facilitate processes like synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory (Ellis2012TissueSpecific; Jia2024CLASPmediated). JAKMIP1's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in the homeostasis and functionality of the nervous system. Additionally, alterations in JAKMIP1 expression have been linked to neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and Smith-Magenis syndrome-like features, highlighting its clinical relevance (Ansel2017Variation; Loviglio2016Identification).

## Function
JAKMIP1, or Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. This protein interacts with Janus kinases (JAKs), which are critical components of various signaling cascades. JAKMIP1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and communication. Its involvement in microtubule dynamics is crucial for the proper functioning of neuronal cells, particularly in processes such as synaptic transmission and plasticity. These functions are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and the adaptability of synaptic connections, which are fundamental for learning and memory. By influencing these cellular processes, JAKMIP1 contributes to the overall homeostasis and functionality of the nervous system. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm underscores its importance in cellular organization and the facilitation of intracellular communication, which are vital for the proper execution of cellular functions and the maintenance of cellular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the JAKMIP1 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. JAKMIP1 is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), where it is noted for its role in GABAB receptor expression and microtubule networks. Studies have shown that JAKMIP1 expression is significantly dysregulated in individuals with ASD, suggesting it may represent a commonly dysregulated pathway in the disorder (Ansel2017Variation). The gene is also part of a local neuronal communication sub-network, indicating its involvement in neuronal communication pathways relevant to ASD (Chen2020De).

In addition to ASD, JAKMIP1 has been linked to Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS)-like features. A de novo variant in JAKMIP1 was identified in an individual with SMS features, suggesting that it may contribute to the phenotypic manifestations observed in such cases (Loviglio2016Identification). The gene is part of a proposed RAI1 functional network, which is associated with SMS and other intellectual disability and cognitive dysfunction disorders (Loviglio2016Identification). These findings highlight the potential role of JAKMIP1 in a broader disease network involving neurological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule interacting protein 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with CLASP2, a protein involved in microtubule organization, through its TBM-containing fragments and the TOG4 domain of CLASP2. This interaction has been validated by co-immunoprecipitation assays and ITC-based analyses, indicating a specific binding between JAKMIP1 and CLASP2_TOG4 (Jia2024CLASPmediated).

JAKMIP1 also interacts with Kinesin light chain 1 (Klc1) in neurons, linking the cytoskeleton to gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptors (GABA[B]Rs), which are involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. This interaction is modulated by alternative splicing of exon 15 in Klc1, which affects its binding with JAKMIP1 (Ellis2012TissueSpecific).

In the context of autism spectrum disorders, JAKMIP1 is associated with Janus kinases and GABR B receptors, affecting intracellular levels of these receptors and potentially influencing metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) signaling (Nishimura2007Genomewide). These interactions highlight JAKMIP1's role in neuronal signaling and microtubule dynamics.
