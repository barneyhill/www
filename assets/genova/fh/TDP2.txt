# TDP2

## Overview
TDP2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2, which plays a pivotal role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by topoisomerase II (TOP2) activity. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphodiesterase and is integral to the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a critical DNA repair mechanism. TDP2 specifically targets and hydrolyzes 5'-phosphotyrosyl bonds at TOP2-associated DSBs, facilitating the ligation of DNA ends and thereby maintaining genomic integrity (GómezHerreros2013TDP2–Dependent). The protein's structure includes a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a catalytic domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with polyubiquitin chains, enhancing its activity in DNA repair processes (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases; Schellenberg2020Ubiquitin). Mutations in the TDP2 gene are linked to clinical conditions such as spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 23 (SCAR23), highlighting its significance in human health and disease (ZagnoliVieira2023Inactivating).

## Structure
The TDP2 protein is a crucial enzyme involved in DNA repair, specifically targeting DNA-protein crosslinks. It is composed of 362 amino acids with a molecular mass of 41 kDa, and it features a two-domain structure: an N-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases). The catalytic domain belongs to the EEP-domain nucleases, characterized by four conserved catalytic motifs (TWN, LQE, GDXN, and SDH) essential for its phosphodiesterase activity (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases). 

The tertiary structure of TDP2 includes a mixed alpha-beta fold with a central 12-stranded anti-parallel beta-sandwich and several helical elements forming the active site (Schellenberg2016Reversal). The DNA-binding cleft is formed by the 'beta-2-helix-beta' grasp and 'helical cap,' which direct single-stranded DNA into the active site (Schellenberg2016Reversal). 

The UBA domain is a three-helix bundle that interacts with polyubiquitin chains, particularly K63-linked chains, enhancing TDP2's catalytic activity (Schellenberg2020Ubiquitin). This domain's flexibility allows TDP2 to adopt compact or extended conformations, influenced by interactions with ubiquitin and salt concentrations (Schellenberg2020Ubiquitin). The structural arrangement and interdomain flexibility are critical for TDP2's regulatory control and recruitment to DNA damage sites (Schellenberg2020Ubiquitin).

## Function
TDP2 (tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by topoisomerase II (TOP2) activity. It is involved in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a major DNA repair mechanism that ligates DSB termini. TDP2 specifically hydrolyzes 5'-phosphotyrosyl bonds at TOP2-associated DSBs, liberating the DNA ends for ligation, which is essential for maintaining genome integrity and preventing the accumulation of potentially clastogenic or lethal DSBs (GómezHerreros2013TDP2–Dependent).

In healthy human cells, TDP2 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA and other repair proteins to facilitate the resolution of DNA damage. It is particularly important in non-cycling cells, where it facilitates the error-free repair of TOP2-induced DSBs, which can occur independently of the cell cycle (GómezHerreros2017TDP2). TDP2 also plays a role in suppressing chromosomal translocations during gene transcription, thereby protecting genome stability and preventing oncogenic translocations (GómezHerreros2017TDP2).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular resistance to TOP2 poisons, such as etoposide, used in cancer therapy, highlighting its importance in protecting against genome instability and associated malignancies (GómezHerreros2013TDP2–Dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TDP2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in DNA repair. A notable condition linked to TDP2 mutations is spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 23 (SCAR23), characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and ataxia. This disorder is caused by mutations that typically result in reduced or absent TDP2 protein, impairing the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by topoisomerase II (TOP2) activity (ZagnoliVieira2023Inactivating; GómezHerreros2013TDP2–Dependent).

A specific homozygous missense mutation in TDP2 (c.454G > A; p.E152K) has been identified in siblings with congenital abnormalities reminiscent of Fanconi anemia. These patients exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and skeletal abnormalities. The mutation results in a lack of TDP2 enzymatic activity, despite the presence of residual protein, leading to impaired DNA repair and hypersensitivity to the TOP2 poison, etoposide (ZagnoliVieira2023Inactivating).

Alterations in TDP2 expression are also implicated in cancer. Elevated TDP2 levels have been observed in non-small cell lung cancer, where it is associated with resistance to chemotherapy drugs like etoposide. This overexpression is often linked to mutant p53, suggesting a role in tumor proliferation and resistance to treatment (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases; GómezHerreros2013TDP2–Dependent).

## Interactions
TDP2, also known as tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It was initially identified as a negative transcription regulator for ETS1 and AP1, interacting with ETS1 and ETS2, particularly in the context of mutant p53 in lung cancers (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases). TDP2 is involved in signal transduction pathways, such as the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, which promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases).

TDP2 interacts with poly-ubiquitinated proteins, specifically associating with K27- and K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, which are involved in DNA damage response signaling. The UBA domain of TDP2 is crucial for binding these chains, particularly K63-linked chains, enhancing TDP2's catalytic activity and its binding to DNA-protein crosslinks (Schellenberg2020Ubiquitin). TDP2 also interacts with SUMOylated proteins, independently of TOP2-SUMO2/3 complexes, and this interaction is important for recruiting TDP2 to DNA damage sites (Schellenberg2020Ubiquitin).

In terms of nucleic acid interactions, TDP2 has specific enzymatic activity for cleaving 5′-phosphotyrosyl bonds, which is crucial for removing trapped topoisomerases like Top2. It also acts as a VPg unlinkase for picornaviruses, removing the VPg protein from the 5′-end of viral RNA, essential for viral replication (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases).
