# POLR1E

## Overview
POLR1E is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase I subunit E, a crucial component of the RNA polymerase I complex. This protein is integral to the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus, a process vital for ribosome biogenesis and, consequently, protein synthesis. As a part of the RNA polymerase I complex, POLR1E contributes to the assembly and stability of this transcription machinery, ensuring efficient rRNA production, which is essential for cell growth and proliferation (LagunasRangel2022Ribosomal; Muste2023Deregulations). The activity of POLR1E is modulated by cellular growth conditions and environmental cues, underscoring its role in adapting rRNA synthesis to meet the demands of the cell (LeDoux2024Polymerase).

## Function
POLR1E encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase I, which is essential for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus. This transcription process is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis, which is necessary for protein synthesis and, consequently, for cell growth and proliferation. POLR1E plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase I complex, ensuring the proper functioning of this transcription machinery (LagunasRangel2022Ribosomal).

In healthy human cells, POLR1E is involved in maintaining the integrity of the transcription machinery by contributing to the stability of the RNA polymerase I complex. This stability is crucial for the efficient transcription of rRNA, which forms the structural and functional core of ribosomes. The activity of POLR1E, therefore, directly impacts cellular processes such as growth and proliferation by facilitating the production of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis (Muste2023Deregulations).

The nucleolus, where POLR1E is active, is a dynamic structure that responds to cellular growth conditions and environmental cues, further highlighting the importance of POLR1E in adapting rRNA synthesis to meet the cellular demands for protein production (LeDoux2024Polymerase).
