# RUSC2

## Overview
RUSC2, or RUN and SH3 domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The RUSC2 protein is characterized by the presence of a RUN domain, which is associated with microtubule dynamics, and an SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. These domains are integral to the protein's role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and autophagy, as well as its interactions with small GTPases like Rab35. RUSC2 is implicated in the spatial control of autophagy through the AP-4 vesicle pathway and plays a significant role in the transport of EGFR, ensuring proper cellular responses to growth signals. Mutations in the RUSC2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Tom2020EHD1; Fukuda2011Genomewide; Davies2017AP4).

## Structure
The RUSC2 protein is characterized by the presence of a RUN domain and an SH3 domain, which are integral to its function in intracellular signaling. The RUN domain is associated with microtubule dynamics, playing a crucial role in the structural organization and stability of microtubules. The SH3 domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the signaling pathways in which RUSC2 is involved. 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in the RUSC2 protein, potentially influencing its functional interactions and activity. These modifications can alter the protein's conformation and interaction capabilities, thereby impacting its role in cellular processes. 

RUSC2 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can lead to differences in its structural and functional properties. These isoforms may result in variations in the protein's domains, affecting its interaction with other cellular components and its overall function in signaling pathways. The presence of these isoforms highlights the complexity and adaptability of the RUSC2 protein in response to cellular needs and conditions.

## Function
RUSC2 (RUN and SH3 domain containing 2) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the trafficking and regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and autophagy. In healthy human cells, RUSC2 plays a significant role in the transport of EGFR from the Golgi compartment to the cell surface, ensuring an activation-ready pool of EGFR on the plasma membrane. This process is crucial for maintaining optimal receptor levels for ligand-mediated activation and cellular responses, which are essential for cell growth and proliferation (Tom2020EHD1).

RUSC2 is also implicated in the spatial control of autophagy through its involvement in the AP-4 vesicle pathway. It facilitates the peripheral delivery of ATG9A, a protein essential for autophagosome biogenesis, by associating with ATG9A-positive vesicles and autophagosomes. This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress conditions (Davies2017AP4).

RUSC2 interacts with small GTPases, such as Rab35, which are involved in various cellular processes, including endocytic recycling and actin remodeling. The RUN domain of RUSC2 preferentially binds to Rab35, suggesting a regulatory role in these processes (Fukuda2011Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RUSC2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including an autosomal recessive intellectual developmental disorder characterized by hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and secondary microcephaly. These conditions are linked to biallelic truncating variants in RUSC2, as initially described in affected individuals with homozygous inherited loss-of-function variants (Jauss2022Routine). The gene is also implicated in a severe neurological disorder similar to AP-4 deficiency, which involves early-onset progressive spastic paraplegia and intellectual disability (Davies2017AP4).

RUSC2 mutations have been identified in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), suggesting a potential role in cancer (Sarhadi2014Copy). In neuroblastoma, allele-specific expression of somatic mutations in RUSC2 has been observed, indicating its involvement in this cancer type (Li2020RNASeq).

RUSC2 is also involved in the trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and its dysregulation may contribute to cancer progression. The EHD1-RUSC2 pathway is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, highlighting its potential clinical relevance in targeted cancer therapies (Tom2020EHD1).

## Interactions
RUSC2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is identified as an accessory protein for the AP-4 complex, interacting specifically with the appendage domains, particularly the ε ear domain. This interaction is crucial for the peripheral delivery of ATG9A, a process important for autophagy regulation (Davies2017AP4). RUSC2 also colocalizes with EHD1 in vesicular and tubular structures, suggesting a role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, although no direct binding between full-length RUSC2 and EHD1 has been detected (Tom2020EHD1).

RUSC2 interacts with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab35, through its RUN domain. This interaction is specific and involves a minimal Rab35-binding site within RUSC2, referred to as RBD35. This site is crucial for trapping GTP-bound Rab35, indicating RUSC2's role in Rab-mediated membrane trafficking (Fukuda2011Genomewide). The interaction with Rab35 is strong and suggests a preferential binding, which is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells (Fukuda2011Genomewide). These interactions highlight RUSC2's involvement in cellular transport and signaling pathways.
