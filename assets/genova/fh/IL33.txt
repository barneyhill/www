# IL33

## Overview
Interleukin 33 (IL33) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 33, a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family. This cytokine is primarily involved in immune response regulation and functions as both a nuclear factor and an extracellular signaling molecule. IL-33 is constitutively expressed in the nuclei of endothelial and epithelial cells, where it plays a role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. Upon cellular damage or stress, IL-33 is released as an 'alarmin', alerting the immune system to potential threats. Extracellularly, IL-33 interacts with the ST2 receptor on immune cells, such as mast cells and Th2 lymphocytes, to promote the release of Th2-associated cytokines, thereby contributing to immune defense and repair mechanisms. The IL33 gene and its protein product are implicated in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Moussion2008The; Martin2016Interleukin; Cayrol2017Interleukin‐33).

## Structure
The IL-33 protein is a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family and adopts a β-trefoil fold, a common structural motif among IL-1 cytokines. This fold consists of 12 β-strands arranged in three pseudorepeats, forming a six-stranded β-barrel with β-hairpins atop the barrel (Lingel2009Structure; Liu2013Structural). The β-trefoil core is conserved across IL-1 cytokines, with IL-33 featuring a unique 10-residue insertion in the β4-β5 loop, which is flexible and unstructured in solution (Lingel2009Structure; Liu2013Structural).

IL-33 interacts with its primary receptor ST2 and the coreceptor IL-1RAcP, forming a heterotrimeric complex. The interaction involves a large surface area with distinct binding sites characterized by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. Specific acidic residues in IL-33, such as Glu148, Asp149, and Glu165, are crucial for high-affinity binding with ST2, forming salt-bridge interactions (Liu2013Structural). The IL-33/ST2 complex is stabilized by these interactions, and the addition of IL-1RAcP forms a stable heterotrimeric structure (Lingel2009Structure; Liu2013Structural).

IL-33 is synthesized with an N-terminal propeptide and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to become active. It can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Liu2013Structural).

## Function
Interleukin 33 (IL-33) is a cytokine from the IL-1 family that plays a crucial role in immune response regulation in healthy human cells. It is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of endothelial and epithelial cells, where it functions as a nuclear factor and a cytokine (Moussion2008The; Cayrol2017Interleukin‐33). IL-33 acts as an 'alarmin', a signal released upon cellular damage or mechanical injury, alerting the immune system to potential threats (Martin2016Interleukin; Cayrol2017Interleukin‐33).

In its nuclear role, IL-33 is involved in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. It binds to histones and chromatin, potentially influencing nuclear architecture and gene transcription (Cayrol2017Interleukin‐33; Martin2013Special). IL-33 can also interact with transcription factors like NF-κB, acting as a transcriptional repressor (Martin2013Special).

Extracellularly, IL-33 binds to the ST2 receptor on immune cells, such as mast cells and Th2 lymphocytes, promoting the release of Th2-associated cytokines and contributing to immune defense and repair mechanisms (Martin2016Interleukin; Cayrol2017Interleukin‐33). This dual function underscores IL-33's role in maintaining immune surveillance and response in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The IL33 gene is implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is associated with increased IL-33 expression in inflamed mucosa. The IL-33/IL1RL1 signaling axis is particularly active in UC, with genetic variants like rs3939286 linked to extensive colitis and steroid responsiveness in early-onset UC patients (Latiano2013Associations).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), IL-33 is identified as a candidate gene, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a decreased risk of AD in non-ε4 carriers of the APOE gene. These SNPs are linked to lower cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores, suggesting a protective role against AD pathology (Chapuis2009Transcriptomic).

IL-33 is also involved in respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In asthma, IL-33 acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, with specific SNPs associated with increased disease susceptibility (Shaban2021Interleukin33). In COPD, IL-33 expression correlates with disease severity and exacerbations, indicating its role in lung inflammation and tissue damage (RieraMartínez2023The).

Additionally, IL-33 is linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where its polymorphisms may influence disease susceptibility and treatment response (Iwaszko2021IL33).

## Interactions
IL33 (interleukin 33) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune response modulation. One of its primary interactions is with the ST2 receptor, a member of the IL-1 receptor family. This interaction is characterized by high affinity and involves a large interface between IL33 and ST2, with specific residues forming salt-bridge interactions. The binding of IL33 to ST2 is crucial for the recruitment of the accessory receptor IL-1RAcP, forming a heterotrimeric signaling complex that is essential for downstream signaling (Lingel2009Structure; Liu2013Structural).

IL33 also interacts with the transcription factor NF-kB, specifically its p65 and p50 subunits. This interaction occurs in both the cytosol and nucleus and is enhanced by stimulation with rhIL-1b. IL33 binds to the N-terminal Rel homology domain of p65, interfering with its ability to bind DNA and reducing NF-kB-mediated gene transcription. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal domain of IL33, particularly between amino acids 66 and 109, and is distinct from its nuclear localization sequence (Ali2011The). These interactions suggest that IL33 can modulate inflammatory responses by affecting NF-kB activity and gene expression.
