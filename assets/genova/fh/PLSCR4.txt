# PLSCR4

## Overview
PLSCR4 is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipid scramblase 4, a member of the phospholipid scramblase family. This protein is involved in the bidirectional translocation of phospholipids across the lipid bilayer, a process crucial for maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating cellular signaling. Phospholipid scramblase 4 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily expressed in human adipose tissue, where it plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Barth2022Phospholipid). The protein's activity is calcium-dependent and ATP-independent, highlighting its involvement in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell fusion, and blood coagulation (Barth2022Phospholipid). PLSCR4 also interacts with the CD4 receptor and the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), implicating it in immune response modulation and antiviral activities (Py2009The). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including sickle cell disease, PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome, and various cancers, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Abdulwahab2021Whole; xue2021linc00641; Barth2022Phospholipid).

## Structure
PLSCR4, a member of the phospholipid scramblase family, is involved in the bidirectional movement of phospholipids across the lipid bilayer. The primary structure of PLSCR4 encodes a 329 amino acid protein (Kodigepalli2014Roles). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PLSCR4 are not provided, it is known that PLSCR4 shares a conserved cysteine cluster with PLSCR1, which is involved in palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that aids in membrane anchoring (Py2009The). PLSCR4 also contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and mutations in this sequence can disrupt its nuclear localization (Kodigepalli2014Roles).

PLSCR4 interacts with the CD4 receptor at the plasma membrane, similar to PLSCR1, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways (Py2009The). The protein is also a receptor for the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), which can modulate its function by interacting with its cytoplasmic tail (Py2009The). The specific molecular structure of PLSCR4, including its secondary and tertiary structures, remains less understood compared to other family members.

## Function
Phospholipid scramblase 4 (PLSCR4) is a member of the phospholipid scramblase family, which plays a crucial role in the remodeling of phospholipid distribution across the plasma membrane, contributing to cellular signaling and membrane asymmetry (Barth2022Phospholipid). PLSCR4 is highly expressed in human adipose tissue, where it is involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. It regulates these processes through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, as indicated by its modulation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) levels and AKT activation (Barth2022Phospholipid).

In adipocyte progenitor cells, PLSCR4 knockdown leads to increased lipid accumulation and differentiation, while its overexpression reduces adipocyte differentiation, suggesting a regulatory role in adipogenesis (Barth2022Phospholipid). PLSCR4 is localized to the plasma membrane and cytosol, but not the nucleus, indicating its direct involvement in cellular signaling processes (Barth2022Phospholipid). The protein's activity is ATP-independent and relies on cellular calcium concentrations, which are essential for its function in various cell signaling activities, including cell fusion, apoptosis, and blood coagulation (Barth2022Phospholipid).

## Clinical Significance
PLSCR4 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In sickle cell disease (SCD), PLSCR4 is significantly up-regulated during vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for VOC development. This up-regulation is associated with hemolysis and vascular damage, contributing to the clinical complications of SCD (Abdulwahab2021Whole).

In the context of PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS), PLSCR4 is downregulated in PTEN-deficient adipose progenitor cells, leading to increased adipogenesis and lipoma formation. This downregulation results in elevated PIP3 levels and AKT activation, which are critical in adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation (Barth2022Phospholipid).

PLSCR4 also plays a role in cancer progression. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), PLSCR4 is upregulated and is part of a feedback loop involving LINC00641 and miRNA-424-5p, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (xue2021linc00641). Conversely, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PLSCR4 is upregulated as a result of LINC00641's interaction with miR-424-5p, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Li2019Long).

## Interactions
Phospholipid scramblase 4 (PLSCR4) is known to interact with the CD4 receptor at the plasma membrane of CD4-positive T lymphocytes. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 receptor, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays and two-hybrid system experiments. The interaction between PLSCR4 and CD4 is crucial for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication by the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) (Py2009The).

PLSCR4 also serves as a cellular receptor for SLPI, a serine protease inhibitor. SLPI directly binds to PLSCR4, as confirmed by yeast two-hybrid systems, ELISA tests, and pull-down assays. This interaction is specific to the mature form of SLPI, which lacks the N-terminal signal peptide. The binding of SLPI to PLSCR4 is significant for its antiviral properties, particularly in inhibiting HIV-1 replication and transfer between cells (Py2009Correction:; Py2009The).

In the context of adipocyte differentiation, PLSCR4 is involved in regulating PIP3-mediated AKT activation. Knockdown of PLSCR4 in adipocyte progenitor cells leads to increased AKT phosphorylation and PIP3 levels, suggesting a role in adipogenesis and lipid accumulation (Barth2022Phospholipid).
