# GUCY2D

## Overview
The GUCY2D gene encodes the enzyme guanylate cyclase 2D, retinal (GC-E), a membrane-bound protein that plays a crucial role in the phototransduction pathway of rod and cone photoreceptor cells in the retina. As a member of the guanylate cyclase family, GC-E is responsible for converting guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a key second messenger in visual signal transduction. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as a transmembrane domain and a cyclase catalytic domain, which are essential for its function and regulation by guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). Mutations in GUCY2D can lead to retinal diseases like Leber congenital amaurosis and cone-rod dystrophy, underscoring its clinical significance (Wimberg2018Photoreceptor; Gradstein2016Novel).

## Structure
The GUCY2D gene encodes the photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, also known as GC-E, which is a membrane-bound protein with a molecular mass of 110-120 kDa. The protein is composed of several distinct domains: a leader sequence (LS), an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TM), a juxtamembrane domain (JMD), a kinase homology domain (KHD), a dimerization domain (DD), and a cyclase catalytic domain (CCD) (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). The LS is an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and is cleaved post-translationally. The ECD is N-glycosylated and located on the extracellular side of the membrane (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

The TM is an α-helical structure that spans the membrane. The JMD is unique to photoreceptor GCs and contains regions associated with guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). The KHD, which is conserved among membrane-bound GCs, enhances catalytic activity through ATP binding and undergoes autophosphorylation of serine residues (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). The DD facilitates dimerization, which is crucial for the protein's function, and the CCD is responsible for the synthesis of cGMP from GTP (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). The protein's structure is essential for its role in photoreceptor signaling, and mutations in these domains can lead to retinal diseases (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

## Function
The GUCY2D gene encodes the photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, known as GC-E, which is essential for the phototransduction process in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a critical second messenger in visual signal transduction (Wimberg2018Photoreceptor; Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). In healthy cells, cGMP maintains the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, allowing the influx of ions, including calcium, which is crucial for photoreceptor excitation (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

The activity of GC-E is regulated by guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs), which respond to changes in intracellular calcium levels. In the dark, high cGMP levels keep CNG channels open, but upon illumination, cGMP is hydrolyzed, leading to channel closure and cell hyperpolarization. This decrease in calcium concentration activates GCAPs, which in turn stimulate GC-E to resynthesize cGMP, restoring the cell to its dark state (Azadi2010RD3; Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

The proper functioning of GC-E is vital for maintaining the balance of cGMP synthesis and ensuring normal visual function. Mutations in GUCY2D can disrupt this balance, leading to retinal diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis and cone-rod dystrophy (Wimberg2018Photoreceptor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GUCY2D gene are associated with several inherited retinal diseases, primarily Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD). LCA is a severe retinal dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness, often from birth. It is typically caused by autosomal recessive mutations in GUCY2D, which result in a significant reduction or complete loss of guanylate cyclase activity, crucial for cGMP synthesis in photoreceptor cells (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype; Gradstein2016Novel). These mutations prevent the restoration of basal cGMP levels, mimicking constant light exposure and leading to photoreceptor degeneration (den2008Leber).

Cone-rod dystrophy, on the other hand, is characterized by progressive degeneration of cone and rod photoreceptors, leading to visual acuity loss and color vision defects. Autosomal dominant CORD is often caused by heterozygous missense mutations in GUCY2D, particularly affecting the dimerization domain of the protein (Mukherjee2014A; Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype). These mutations alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of the GC-E-GCAP complex, affecting photoreceptor function and leading to cone photoreceptor death (Mukherjee2014A). GUCY2D mutations are also linked to other retinal conditions, such as autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy and early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

## Interactions
The GUCY2D gene encodes the photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, GC-E, which is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in the retina. GC-E interacts with guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAP1 and GCAP2), which regulate its activity in a calcium-dependent manner. These interactions occur at overlapping sites within the juxtamembrane, kinase homology, and dimerization domains of GC-E, but GCAP1 and GCAP2 bind in a mutually exclusive manner (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

RD3 is another protein that interacts with GC-E, playing a dual role in inhibiting its catalytic activity and facilitating its transport to the photoreceptor outer segments. RD3 inhibits both the basal and GCAP-stimulated activity of GC-E at low calcium concentrations, which is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis. It is also necessary for the transport of GC-E from the endoplasmic reticulum to the outer segments, involving a vesicular mechanism with RAB proteins like RAB5 and RAB11 (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).

Mutations in GC-E that disrupt its interaction with RD3 can lead to diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), highlighting the importance of these protein interactions in maintaining photoreceptor function (Sharon2018Genotypefunctionalphenotype).
