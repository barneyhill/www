# NPY4R2

## Overview
The NPY4R2 gene encodes the neuropeptide Y receptor Y4-2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of energy balance, appetite, and circadian rhythms. As a transmembrane receptor, neuropeptide Y receptor Y4-2 interacts with specific ligands, such as neuropeptide Y, to initiate intracellular signaling pathways that influence these biological functions. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in the study of metabolic disorders and potential therapeutic targets for obesity and related conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
