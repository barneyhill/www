# MIDN

## Overview
The MIDN gene encodes the protein midnolin, which is primarily localized in the nucleus and intracellular membranes. Midnolin functions as a transcription factor, despite lacking conventional DNA binding domains, and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression related to stress responses and metabolic activities (Obara2017Midnolin). It plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and development, particularly through its involvement in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis regulation via the ERK1/2 and ERK5 signaling pathways (Obara2017Midnolin). Additionally, midnolin is implicated in metabolic regulation, notably affecting glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells by interacting with glucokinase (Obara2017Midnolin). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in diseases such as liver cancer and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its importance in both cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Obara2017Midnolin; Kweon2022Midnolin).

## Function
The MIDN gene, also known as Midnolin, encodes a protein that is primarily located in the nucleus and intracellular membranes, where it functions as a transcription factor despite lacking common DNA binding domains (Obara2017Midnolin). MIDN is involved in the regulation of parkin gene expression, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in response to stress (Obara2017Midnolin). It promotes parkin expression via the CRE sequence, which is also targeted by ATF4, a member of the CREB/ATF family involved in cellular stress responses (Obara2017Midnolin).

In neuronal cells, MIDN is essential for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth, indicating its role in neuronal differentiation and development (Obara2017Midnolin). MIDN expression is enhanced by NGF through the ERK1/2 and ERK5 signaling pathways, suggesting its involvement in neurogenesis regulation (Obara2017Midnolin). The protein is also associated with glucokinase activity in pancreatic β-cells, where it reduces glucose-induced insulin secretion, indicating a role in metabolic processes (Obara2017Midnolin).

MIDN's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in cellular stress responses, neurodevelopment, and metabolic regulation, impacting organismal outcomes such as brain function and development (Obara2017Midnolin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MIDN (midnolin) gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably liver cancer and Parkinson's disease. In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression levels of midnolin are associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that knockdown of midnolin significantly inhibits tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell growth through metabolic pathways related to retinoic acid and lipid metabolism (Kweon2022Midnolin).

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), MIDN is identified as a regulator of parkin expression, a gene associated with PD pathogenesis. Loss of MIDN expression leads to reduced parkin levels, contributing to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, a hallmark of PD. Genetic studies have found that a significant percentage of PD patients exhibit copy number variations in the MIDN gene, indicating a potential genetic risk factor for the disease. MIDN's role in regulating parkin and its interaction with transcription factors like ATF4 further underscores its involvement in PD (Obara2017Midnolin; Obara2019Midnolin).

## Interactions
Midnolin (MIDN) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. MIDN acts as a transcription factor, despite lacking common DNA binding domains, and influences the expression of the parkin gene by interacting with the CRE sequence. This sequence is also bound by ATF4, a member of the CREB/ATF family, which is involved in neuronal stress responses. MIDN knockout or knockdown results in reduced expression of ATF4 and parkin, suggesting that MIDN may modulate the activity of other transcription factors (Obara2017Midnolin).

MIDN is also regulated by insulin through the ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways, with transcription factors such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) enhancing its expression. The AP-1 complex, consisting of c-FOS and c-JUN, binds to the MIDN promoter, promoting its expression. Conversely, transcription factor AP-2 negatively regulates MIDN expression (Sagehashi2022Insulin).

MIDN interacts with glucokinase, inhibiting its activity and affecting glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. This interaction highlights MIDN's role in metabolic regulation and its potential implications in diseases such as Parkinson's disease (Obara2017Midnolin).
