# ZNF511

## Overview
ZNF511 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 511, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 511 is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as a transcription factor that can modulate the expression of various genes. The specific biological pathways and processes influenced by ZNF511 are still under investigation, but its role in gene expression suggests it may be involved in critical cellular functions and developmental processes. Understanding the interactions and regulatory mechanisms of ZNF511 could provide insights into its potential implications in health and disease.
