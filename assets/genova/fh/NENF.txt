# NENF

## Overview
The NENF gene encodes the neudesin neurotrophic factor, a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system by promoting neuronal survival and differentiation. Neudesin is categorized as a member of the membrane-associated progesterone receptor (MAPR) family and is characterized by a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain, which is essential for its neurotrophic activity (Kimura2008Neurotrophic). This protein is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K, which are vital for neuron survival and function (Kimura2004Neudesin). Beyond its neurotrophic roles, neudesin is implicated in energy metabolism and erythrocyte and iron homeostasis, highlighting its multifaceted biological significance (Nakayama2024A; Ohta2015Deletion). The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to several clinical conditions, including colorectal cancer and metabolic disorders, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kamińska2023New; Byerly2013Identification).

## Structure
Neudesin, also known as neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NENF), is a secreted protein with a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of neudesin consists of 171 amino acids in mice and 172 amino acids in humans, with a high degree of similarity between the two species (Kimura2004Neudesin). The protein includes a signal sequence at its N-terminus, which facilitates its secretion (Kimura2004Neudesin).

Neudesin belongs to the membrane-associated progesterone receptor (MAPR) family and contains a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain. This domain is crucial for its function, as it allows the protein to bind heme, which is essential for its neurotrophic activity (Kimura2008Neurotrophic). The heme-binding domain in mouse neudesin spans amino acids 45 to 143, with specific tyrosine residues acting as ligands for the heme iron (Kimura2008Neurotrophic).

The secondary structure of neudesin is characterized by an α-helix/β-strand topology, specifically a β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β4-α3-α4-β5-β6 arrangement. The heme/steroid-binding domain is located within the α2-β4-α3 topology, with a hydrophobic pocket between the α2 and α3 helices (Ohta2015Neudesin). Tyrosine residues 82 and 88 are essential for heme-binding within this pocket (Ohta2015Neudesin). The tertiary and quaternary structures have not been detailed in the available context.

## Function
Neudesin, encoded by the NENF gene, is a secreted protein with neurotrophic activity, primarily expressed in neurons within the central nervous system. It plays a significant role in promoting neuronal survival and differentiation, particularly during neurodevelopment. Neudesin exerts its effects through the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways, which are crucial for neuron survival and function (Kimura2008Neurotrophic; Kimura2004Neudesin). 

The protein contains a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain, and its activity is enhanced when complexed with hemin, a form of heme. This complex promotes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, which are essential for its neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities (Kimura2008Neurotrophic). Neudesin is also involved in energy metabolism, where it acts as a negative regulator of sympathetic activity, influencing processes such as heat production and fatty acid oxidation in adipose tissues (Ohta2015Deletion). 

In addition to its roles in the nervous system, neudesin is implicated in erythrocyte and iron homeostasis, where it regulates erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in the spleen (Nakayama2024A).

## Clinical Significance
The NENF gene, also known as neudesin neurotrophic factor, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), NENF expression is notably abundant in CRC tissues, and its serum concentration is significantly higher in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic marker for CRC. Progesterone (P4) treatment increases NENF release in certain CRC cell lines, and co-treatment with NENF enhances cell invasion, indicating a role in cancer progression through interactions with progesterone receptors, particularly PGRMC1 (Kamińska2023New).

In metabolic conditions, NENF is involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. Its expression is modulated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway and is affected by changes in energy balance, such as diet-induced obesity (DIO) and fasting. In DIO conditions, NENF expression is suppressed, and its appetite-suppressing effects are diminished, suggesting resistance to NENF signaling in obesity (Byerly2013Identification). These findings highlight the potential of NENF as a target for therapeutic interventions in both cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
NENF, also known as neudesin neurotrophic factor, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It is part of the membrane-associated progesterone receptor family and may interact with progesterone receptors, affecting the stability and metabolism of progesterone. This interaction is suggested to influence neural precursor proliferation and hippocampal function (Novais2018Adult).

In colorectal cancer, NENF interacts with the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer progression, where NENF acts as a co-activator of PGRMC1. The co-localization of NENF and PGRMC1 in colorectal cancer cells suggests a non-classical progesterone signaling pathway that may enhance cell proliferation and invasiveness (Kamińska2023New).

NENF's activity is also mediated by signaling pathways such as the MAP and PI-3 kinase pathways, similar to other neurotrophic factors like NGF, BDNF, and IGF. These pathways are crucial for its neurotrophic activity, which supports neuron survival and differentiation (Kimura2004Neudesin). The involvement of a Gi/Go-protein-coupled receptor in NENF's activity has been suggested, indicating a potential mechanism for its neurotrophic effects (Kimura2004Neudesin).
