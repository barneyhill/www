# TRIM62

## Overview
TRIM62, also known as DEAR1, is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 62, which is a member of the TRIM/RBCC family. This family is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a SPRY domain. The protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation, DNA repair, and immune signaling (Li2019TRIM62mediated; Huang2013Characterization). TRIM62 is involved in various cellular processes, including antiviral activity, immune response regulation, and epithelial morphogenesis. It interacts with several proteins, such as CARD9 and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, influencing pathways related to inflammation and immune responses (Cao2015Ubiquitin; Liu2020TRIM62). Clinically, TRIM62 has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis and other diseases, where its expression levels and interactions can significantly impact disease progression and prognosis (Quintás‐Cardama2014Loss; Zhang2023M2).

## Structure
TRIM62, also known as DEAR1, is a member of the TRIM/RBCC family of proteins, characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a SPRY domain (Li2019TRIM62mediated; Huang2013Characterization). The RING finger domain is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to target substrates (Huang2013Characterization). This domain is essential for the protein's ubiquitination activity, as its deletion significantly reduces this function (Huang2013Characterization).

The SPRY domain is particularly important for TRIM62's antiviral activity, as its deletion completely abolishes the protein's ability to inhibit viral replication, such as that of the avian leukosis virus subgroup J (Li2019TRIM62mediated). TRIM62 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it forms aggregates, and its subcellular localization is crucial for its function (Huang2013Characterization). The protein can undergo self-ubiquitination, a process that requires an intact RING finger domain, highlighting its role in the proteasomal degradation pathway (Huang2013Characterization).

## Function
TRIM62, also known as DEAR1, is a member of the TRIM/RBCC family and functions as a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that regulates protein degradation, DNA repair, transcription, and other cellular processes (Huang2013Characterization). TRIM62 catalyzes self-ubiquitination, leading to its proteasomal degradation, which suggests a regulatory mechanism for its activity (Huang2013Characterization). It is localized in the cytoplasm of cells, such as HEK293T and HeLa cells, where it forms aggregates, potentially relating to its biochemical functions (Huang2013Characterization).

In healthy human cells, TRIM62 plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, impacting processes like protein turnover and immune signaling (Huang2013Characterization). It is involved in the TRIF branch of the TLR4 signaling pathway, affecting NF-kB, AP-1, and interferon production in response to lipopolysaccharide challenge, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Hatakeyama2017TRIM). TRIM62 is also implicated in regulating epithelial morphogenesis and maintaining epithelial integrity, which are crucial for normal cellular organization and function (Quintás‐Cardama2014Loss).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM62, a gene involved in various cellular processes, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In pancreatic cancer, miR-193b-3p derived from M2 macrophage exosomes targets TRIM62, leading to its downregulation. This downregulation enhances cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glutamine uptake, correlating with poor prognosis (Zhang2023M2). In cervical cancer, TRIM62 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its low expression is associated with aggressive clinical features and poor prognosis. It inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing c-Jun/Slug signaling, which is crucial for metastasis (Liu2016Tripartite).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TRIM62 loss is an early event in pathogenesis and is linked to poor survival outcomes. Its absence is associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and advanced histological stages, indicating a role in promoting invasiveness and metastasis (Quintás‐Cardama2014Loss). TRIM62 is also involved in inflammation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, where its expression is elevated, contributing to persistent inflammation and muscle wasting (Schmidt2014The). These findings highlight TRIM62's significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TRIM62, a member of the tripartite motif family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in immune response regulation. It interacts with CARD9, a scaffold protein crucial for immune signaling, particularly in the context of anti-fungal immunity and intestinal inflammation. TRIM62 binds to the C terminus of CARD9, facilitating K27-linked ubiquitination, which is essential for CARD9-mediated NF-kB signaling and cytokine production (Cao2015Ubiquitin). This interaction is disrupted in CARD9 variants lacking the C terminus, indicating the importance of this region for TRIM62 binding (Cao2015Ubiquitin).

TRIM62 also interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component in neuroinflammation. In cerebral ischemic injury, TRIM62 modulates the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kB-induced inflammatory response, affecting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Liu2020TRIM62). 

In the context of viral infections, TRIM62 acts as a negative regulator of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) replication in chicken cells. It interacts with host cell proteins such as RAB5B and ARPC2, which are involved in the actin cytoskeletal pathway, suggesting a role in regulating viral replication (Li2020TRIM62).
