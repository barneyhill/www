# TMEM70

## Overview
TMEM70 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 70, a crucial component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is primarily involved in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex, a key player in cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. TMEM70 is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a distinctive hairpin-like structure, facilitating its role in forming oligomeric scaffolds essential for ATP synthase assembly. The gene's significance is underscored by its evolutionary conservation and its involvement in the biogenesis of mitochondrial complexes I and V. Mutations in TMEM70 are associated with mitochondrial disorders, notably mitochondrial encephalocardio-myopathy, highlighting its clinical importance (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70; Honzik2010Mitochondrial; Bahri2020TMEM70).

## Structure
TMEM70 is a transmembrane protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, specifically within the cristae. It is characterized by two conserved transmembrane regions that form a hairpin-like structure, with both the N- and C-termini located in the mitochondrial matrix (Kratochvílová2014Mitochondrial; SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70). The protein has a cleavable N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and a C-terminal hydrophilic domain (Bahri2020TMEM70). The mature form of TMEM70 is approximately 21 kDa, processed from a 30 kDa precursor (Kratochvílová2014Mitochondrial).

TMEM70 forms oligomeric structures, including dimers and larger oligomers, which are crucial for its function in ATP synthase assembly (Kratochvílová2014Mitochondrial; Bahri2020TMEM70). It is suggested that TMEM70 forms large oligomers composed of eight dimers, providing a scaffold for the assembly of the c-ring in ATP synthase (Bahri2020TMEM70). The protein's structure supports its role in membrane intermediate assembly or stability, with a long C-terminal tail protruding into the mitochondrial matrix (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70). TMEM70's oligomeric state and interactions within the mitochondrial membrane are essential for its function in the biogenesis of ATP synthase (Kratochvílová2014Mitochondrial).

## Function
TMEM70 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex, particularly in the formation of the ATP synthase proton channel within mitochondrial cristae. It forms oligomeric scaffolds that facilitate the incorporation of subunit c (Su.c) into the c-ring of ATP synthase, which is essential for its proper assembly and function (Bahri2020TMEM70). TMEM70 interacts with Su.c in its unassembled form, protecting it from degradation and ensuring its successful integration into the ATP synthase complex (Bahri2020TMEM70).

In healthy cells, TMEM70 is involved in the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I and V, contributing to cellular energy production. Its absence leads to a reduction in fully assembled complex V and a decrease in ATP synthase levels, which can result in altered mitochondrial ultrastructure and impaired energy production (Bahri2020TMEM70; SánchezCaballero2019A). TMEM70's role in stabilizing membrane-bound subassemblies and recruiting subunits into forming complexes highlights its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (SánchezCaballero2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM70 gene are linked to a mitochondrial disorder known as mitochondrial encephalocardio-myopathy, which typically presents with early neonatal onset. This condition is characterized by severe muscular hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP), lactic acidosis, hyperammonaemia, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGC-uria) (Spiegel2010TMEM70; Honzik2010Mitochondrial). The most common mutation, c.317-2A→G, leads to aberrant splicing and loss of the TMEM70 transcript, resulting in ATP synthase deficiency (Houštěk2009TMEM70; Honzik2010Mitochondrial).

Patients with TMEM70 mutations often experience early neonatal death, although some survive with intensive care. Those who survive may suffer from persistent muscular hypotonia, psychomotor delay, and growth retardation (Honzik2010Mitochondrial). The condition is particularly prevalent in the Roma population, likely due to a founder allele effect (Houštěk2009TMEM70; Honzik2010Mitochondrial).

TMEM70 deficiency can also lead to severe and persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns, a life-threatening condition that has been associated with TMEM70 mutations (Catteruccia2014Persistent). The clinical spectrum of TMEM70-related disorders is broad, with some patients exhibiting milder symptoms and normal psychomotor development (Honzik2010Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
TMEM70 is involved in the assembly and stability of mitochondrial complexes I (CI) and V (CV) within the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. It interacts with several assembly factors crucial for CI assembly, including NDUFAF1, NDUFAF2, NDUFAF4, and NDUFAF5 (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70). TMEM70 is also associated with the assembly of the membrane arm (P-module) of CI and the formation of the F1-c assembly intermediate in CV (SánchezCaballero2019A). 

The absence of TMEM70 leads to the accumulation of certain assembly intermediates and a reduction in fully assembled CI and CV, indicating its role in stabilizing these intermediates (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70). TMEM70 does not directly interact with ATP synthase subunits, as immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect such interactions, suggesting that TMEM70's role in ATP synthase biogenesis might involve indirect interactions or stabilization of assembly intermediates (Kratochvílová2014Mitochondrial). 

TMEM70 is phylogenetically widespread and appears to have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, indicating its evolutionary significance in OXPHOS complexes (SánchezCaballero2020TMEM70).
