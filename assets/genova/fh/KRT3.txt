# KRT3

## Overview
KRT3 is a gene that encodes keratin 3, a type II cytokeratin protein, which is a member of the intermediate filament protein family. Keratin 3 is predominantly expressed in the corneal epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of the corneal epithelium. This protein forms heterodimers with type I keratins, such as keratin 12, to create intermediate filaments essential for the stability and transparency of the cornea (Allen2016Keratin; Kao2020Keratin). The expression of KRT3 is regulated by factors such as PAX6 and retinoic acid, highlighting its involvement in complex regulatory networks within the eye (Latta2021Similarities). Mutations in the KRT3 gene are linked to Meesmann corneal dystrophy, a condition characterized by corneal epithelial microcysts, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Weiss2009Molecular; Klintworth2009Corneal).

## Structure
Keratin 3 (KRT3) is a type II cytokeratin, part of the intermediate filament protein family, primarily expressed in corneal epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT3 consists of a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head (V1) and tail (V2) domains. This rod domain is divided into four subdomains: 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, with connecting non-helical linkers (L1, L12, and L2) (Smith2003The). Type II keratins, including KRT3, also have additional subdomains (H1 and H2) between the rod domain and the V1 and V2 domains (Smith2003The).

The secondary structure of KRT3 is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of dimeric structures. These dimers can be homodimeric or heterodimeric, forming antiparallel tetramers as basic building blocks for higher-order assembly (Ho2022Update). The tertiary structure involves the formation of filamentous networks, while the quaternary structure includes heterodimerization with type I keratins (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT3 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update). These structural features are crucial for the mechanical support and integrity of corneal epithelial cells.

## Function
KRT3 (keratin 3) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly within the corneal epithelium. It forms intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support and resilience to these cells, contributing significantly to maintaining corneal transparency and protecting against mechanical stress (Allen2016Keratin; Kao2020Keratin). In healthy human corneal tissue, KRT3 pairs with KRT12 to form a heterodimer, which is essential for the structural stability of the corneal epithelium (Allen2016Keratin). This pairing is characteristic of differentiated corneal epithelial cells and signifies corneal type epithelium differentiation (Kao2020Keratin).

KRT3 is expressed in the suprabasal and superficial layers of the corneal epithelium, but not in the basal limbus, indicating its role in the differentiation and maintenance of the corneal epithelium (Kao2020Keratin). The absence of a murine counterpart for KRT3 suggests its unique presence and function in humans, highlighting its evolutionary significance in providing mechanical stability to the corneal epithelium (Hesse2004Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT3 gene are primarily associated with Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD), a condition characterized by the presence of microcysts in the corneal epithelium. These cysts lead to symptoms such as mild ocular irritation and blurred vision, typically manifesting in middle age. MECD is caused by mutations in either the KRT3 or KRT12 genes, which encode keratins K3 and K12, respectively. These mutations disrupt the keratin structure, leading to cell fragility and the formation of intraepithelial cysts (Weiss2009Molecular; Hassan2012Severe; Klintworth2009Corneal).

Alterations in KRT3 expression have also been observed in the context of retinoic acid treatment and PAX6 expression. Studies have shown that KRT3 expression is downregulated when PAX6 is knocked out in corneal epithelial cells, indicating a regulatory relationship. This downregulation is also noted with retinoic acid treatment, although the exact role of retinoic acid in keratin regulation remains unclear (Latta2021Similarities).

Additionally, a novel mutation in KRT3 has been identified in a patient with Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), suggesting a potential link between KRT3 mutations and retinal vascular development, although this association requires further investigation (Zhang2020Clinical).

## Interactions
KRT3 (keratin 3) is known to form heterodimers with type I keratins, such as KRT12, to create intermediate filaments that provide structural stability to corneal epithelial cells. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the mechanical integrity and resilience of these cells (Allen2016Keratin). In the context of retinoic acid treatment and PAX6 knockdown in limbal epithelial cells, KRT3 expression is influenced by PAX6. CRISPR/CAS-mediated PAX6 knockout in corneal epithelial cells results in strong downregulation of KRT3, indicating a regulatory interaction between PAX6 and KRT3 expression (Latta2021Similarities).

The study by Latta et al. also highlights that KRT3 mRNA expression is downregulated after retinol treatment, suggesting that retinoic acid signaling pathways may affect KRT3 expression, although the specific role of retinoic acid receptors in this regulation remains unclear (Latta2021Similarities). Despite these findings, specific protein-protein interactions involving KRT3, such as its participation in multiprotein complexes or transient interactions, are not detailed in the available context. Therefore, while KRT3's role in forming structural filaments is well-documented, its broader interaction network requires further elucidation.
