# EML1

## Overview
The EML1 gene encodes the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 1, a member of the microtubule-associated proteins family, which plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics. The EML1 protein is characterized by its involvement in microtubule assembly and stabilization, as well as its participation in the formation of the mitotic spindle during cell division. Structurally, EML1 contains a hydrophobic EMAP-like protein (HELP) motif and several WD40 repeats, which fold into a tandem atypical β-propeller (TAPE) domain, crucial for tubulin binding and protein folding (Markus2021A). Functionally, EML1 is essential for the proper orientation of the cleavage plane of neuronal progenitors, influencing cortical development, and is also involved in the stability of primary cilia (Markus2021A). Mutations in the EML1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as subcortical heterotopia, highlighting its clinical significance (Collins2019The).

## Structure
The EML1 protein is a member of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein (EMAP) family, characterized by its involvement in microtubule dynamics. The primary structure of EML1 consists of 815 amino acids, with a highly conserved glycine at residue 231 within the HELP motif, which is part of the TAPE domain (Markus2021A). The secondary structure includes a coiled-coil region in the N-terminal domain, which facilitates homo-trimerization and microtubule binding (Bizzotto2017Eml1). 

The tertiary structure of EML1 is defined by its C-terminal domain, which contains multiple WD40 repeats forming tandem beta-propeller structures. These beta-propellers are indicative of a tertiary structure that supports protein-protein interactions, often involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (Fry2016EML; Bizzotto2017Eml1). The quaternary structure involves homo-trimerization, crucial for its function in binding to microtubules (Bizzotto2017Eml1).

EML1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its microtubule affinity by altering electrostatic interactions (Fry2016EML). The protein also contains low complexity regions and coiled-coil regions, contributing to its structural and functional diversity (Markus2021A).

## Function
The EML1 gene encodes the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 1, which is a member of the microtubule-associated proteins family. This protein plays a crucial role in microtubule assembly and stabilization, as well as in the formation of the mitotic spindle during interphase (Markus2021A). EML1 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular transport (Markus2021A). The EML1 protein contains a hydrophobic EMAP-like protein (HELP) motif and several WD40 repeats, which fold into a tandem atypical β-propeller (TAPE) domain. This structure is important for protein folding and tubulin binding, with the concave surface of the TAPE domain responsible for binding α/β-tubulin heterodimers (Markus2021A).

In healthy human cells, EML1 is crucial for the proper orientation of the cleavage plane of neuronal progenitors during cell division, influencing the distribution and function of progenitors in the early developing cortex (Markus2021A). It is also important for the stability and maintenance of primary cilia, as mutations in EML1 have been associated with ciliary defects (Markus2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EML1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably subcortical heterotopia. This condition is characterized by abnormal neuronal positioning beneath the normal cortex, leading to intellectual disability, epilepsy, and developmental delays (Collins2019The). Specifically, mutations in EML1 can result in ribbon-like subcortical heterotopia (RSH), which is marked by large, tortuous ribbons of heterotopic gray matter in both cerebral hemispheres. This condition is often accompanied by corpus callosum agenesis and diffuse polymicrogyria (Markus2021A).

The EML1 gene mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and have been linked to severe heterotopia in both mice and humans (Markus2021A). In mouse models, such as the HeCo mouse line, mutations in Eml1 lead to bilateral heterotopia below the cortex, associated with epilepsy susceptibility and learning and memory deficits (Collins2019The). The Eml1 knockout mouse model also shows severe cortical heterotopia and additional brain anomalies, such as corpus callosum abnormalities (Collins2019The).

A novel homozygous missense variant in EML1 (c.692G>A, p.Gly231Asp) has been identified in patients with RSH, leading to ciliary defects and confirming the genotype-phenotype associations of EML1 mutations with this condition (Markus2021A). These mutations can also result in hydrocephalus, macrocrania, and refractory epilepsy (Collins2019The).

## Interactions
EML1 is a microtubule-associated protein that interacts with microtubules and soluble tubulin, playing a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and spindle formation. The N-terminal region of EML1 contains a coiled-coil motif that facilitates trimerization, which is essential for its microtubule binding capabilities (Richards2015Microtubule; Fry2016EML). This region is also involved in electrostatic interactions with microtubules, as suggested by studies showing that subtilisin digestion disrupts the binding of the basic N-terminal fragment of EML1 to microtubules (Fry2016EML).

EML1 is part of a network of proteins involved in microtubule processes and spindle length regulation, interacting with proteins such as kinesins (e.g., Kif22) and dynein heavy chain 1 (Dync1h1) (Bizzotto2017Eml1). The protein's interactions are crucial for maintaining proper spindle assembly and function, particularly in the developing cerebral cortex (Bizzotto2017Eml1). EML1's role in microtubule regulation is further highlighted by its potential interactions with mitotic kinases, which may be localized to microtubules through EML1 acting as a scaffold (Fry2016EML). These interactions underscore EML1's importance in cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular transport.
