# PDGFA

## Overview
The PDGFA gene encodes the platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, a critical component of the PDGF family involved in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The protein encoded by PDGFA is a growth factor that primarily functions by forming homodimers or heterodimers with PDGFB, which then interact with receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFRα to activate various intracellular signaling pathways (Demoulin2014PDGF; Funa2013The). These pathways are essential for numerous physiological processes, including embryonic development, tissue organization, and neural development (Fredriksson2004The; Funa2013The). PDGFA's role extends to pathological conditions, where its altered expression is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as glioblastoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Kumar2023PDGF).

## Structure
The PDGFA gene encodes the platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which is a crucial component of the PDGF family involved in cell growth and development. The protein is typically synthesized as a prepropeptide and undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, which are essential for its function and secretion (Rorsman1988Structural). The mature PDGFA protein forms homodimers or heterodimers with PDGFB, linked by disulfide bonds, and contains a conserved PDGF/VEGF domain characterized by a cystine knot motif (Chen2013Plateletderived).

The PDGFA protein structure includes a cystine-knot fold, which is crucial for receptor recruitment and dimer formation. This fold consists of anti-parallel β-strands linked by disulfide bridges, providing structural stability (Chen2013Plateletderived). The PDGFA gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct C-terminal sequences. The inclusion of exon 6 results in a highly basic C-terminus, while its exclusion leads to a shorter variant (Hannink1989Structure). These variations may influence the dimerization and secretion of the protein, although the exact mechanisms remain under investigation (Hannink1989Structure).

## Function
PDGFA encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, PDGFA is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. It functions by binding to PDGF receptors, particularly PDGFRα, which are receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in various cell types, including mesenchymal cells and oligodendrocyte progenitors (Demoulin2014PDGF; Funa2013The). This interaction activates several intracellular signaling pathways, such as those mediated by PI 3-kinase, which is involved in actin reorganization, chemotaxis, and antiapoptosis, and Src, which is crucial for the mitogenic response (Heldin1999Mechanism).

PDGFA is essential during embryonic development, particularly in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and vascular development. It is produced by epithelial cells and acts in a paracrine manner on mesenchymal cells, suggesting its role in tissue organization and development (Fredriksson2004The). In the nervous system, PDGFA is critical for the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors, contributing to myelination and neural development (Funa2013The). The protein is also involved in maintaining blood-brain barrier homeostasis and modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Funa2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDGFA gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of diffuse astrocytic gliomas. In IDH wild-type (WT) low-grade astrocytomas (LGAs), PDGFA is notably upregulated compared to IDH mutant cases. This upregulation is linked to the enrichment of the PDGF signaling pathway, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of IDH WT glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). High PDGFA expression in these tumors is associated with aggressive behavior, poor prognosis, genomic instability, immune evasion, and aneuploidy (Kumar2023PDGF). The overexpression of PDGFA in IDH WT LGAs is potentially driven by the amplification of a chromosome 7 segment containing the PDGFA locus and is negatively correlated with promoter methylation, suggesting that hypomethylation may lead to increased expression (Kumar2023PDGF).

In contrast, IDH mutant cases exhibit low PDGFA expression due to promoter methylation, correlating with less genomic instability and better prognosis (Kumar2023PDGF). These findings suggest that PDGFA expression alterations contribute to the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of gliomas, particularly in IDH WT cases, where they may lead to more aggressive tumor phenotypes (Kumar2023PDGF).

## Interactions
PDGFA interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In glioblastoma (GBM), PDGFA can activate EPHA2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, independently of its traditional receptor PDGFRA. This interaction suggests that EPHA2 might serve as an alternative receptor for PDGFA, contributing to GBM cell proliferation and survival (Gai2022EPHA2). The activation of EPHA2 by PDGFA is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, indicating a direct interaction that influences PDGFA signaling pathways (Gai2022EPHA2).

PDGFA also interacts with the transcription factor Purα, which binds to G-rich, single-stranded regions of the PDGF-A promoter. This interaction is crucial for activating PDGF-A gene transcription. Purα's binding to the promoter is highly specific and involves consensus binding sites within the promoter's G-rich sequences (Zhang2005Purα). The presence of Purα enhances PDGF-A transcription, suggesting its role in regulating gene expression through stabilizing non-Bform DNA conformations (Zhang2005Purα). These interactions highlight PDGFA's involvement in complex signaling networks and its potential impact on cellular functions and disease progression.
