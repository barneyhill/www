# CCKAR

## Overview
The CCKAR gene encodes the cholecystokinin A receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to numerous physiological processes. This receptor is primarily activated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) and is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, including the gallbladder, pancreas, and small intestine. As a GPCR, CCKAR features a characteristic seven-transmembrane helical structure, facilitating its role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Zhang2021Structures). The receptor's activation by CCK leads to the modulation of digestive enzyme secretion, bile release, and regulation of gastrointestinal motility, thereby playing a crucial role in digestion and nutrient absorption (Wang2020An). Additionally, CCKAR is involved in appetite regulation and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including gallbladder cancer, gallstone formation, and neuropsychiatric disorders (Bienvenu2019Exome; Xu2013Variants). The receptor's ability to interact with multiple G protein subtypes underscores its diverse functional roles and potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021Ligand).

## Structure
The cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven-transmembrane helical bundle structure, typical of GPCRs (Zhang2021Structures). The receptor's transmembrane domains (TM3, TM4, TM5-7) and extracellular loops (ECL1-3) form the orthosteric binding pocket for its ligand, the sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) (Liu2021Structural). The second extracellular loop (ECL2) forms a β-hairpin structure, while the third extracellular loop (ECL3) adopts a unique two-turn α-helical conformation (Zhang2021Structures).

CCKAR's structure includes conserved motifs such as E/DRY and NPXXY, which are essential for receptor activation (Dufresne2006Cholecystokinin). The receptor is highly glycosylated, with three to four potential N-linked glycosylation sites in its amino termini, which can vary depending on the cell type (Dufresne2006Cholecystokinin). The receptor's ability to couple with different G protein subtypes is facilitated by structural features such as the outward displacement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and the 'wavy hook' residues of the Gα α5-helix, which are important for coupling promiscuity (Liu2021Structural).

## Function
The cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in humans. It is primarily activated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which is released from enteroendocrine I cells in response to digested fats and proteins. CCKAR is predominantly expressed in the gallbladder, sphincter of Oddi, pancreas, small intestine, gastric mucosa, and pyloric sphincter (Wang2020An).

Upon activation by CCK, CCKAR mediates several digestive functions. It triggers the secretion of digestive enzymes by the pancreas and the release of bile from the gallbladder, facilitating the digestion and absorption of nutrients such as fats, proteins, carbohydrates, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. CCKAR also regulates gallbladder contraction, sphincter of Oddi relaxation, and accelerates small intestinal transit, while inhibiting gastric emptying and acid secretion (Wang2020An).

In addition to its role in digestion, CCKAR is involved in regulating appetite and food intake through its action on vagal afferent neurons, making it a potential therapeutic target for obesity (Liu2021Structural). The receptor's ability to couple with multiple G-protein subtypes, including Gq, Gs, and Gi, contributes to its diverse signaling pathways (Liu2021Ligand).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCKAR gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants in the CCKAR gene have been linked to an increased risk of gallbladder cancer, particularly in females. The rs1800855 SNP and specific haplotypes in the CCKAR gene are significantly associated with gallbladder cancer risk, suggesting a genetic susceptibility to this disease (Xu2013Variants). 

CCKAR is also implicated in gallstone formation. Dysfunctional gallbladder emptying due to impaired CCKAR function can lead to cholesterol gallstone disease. This dysfunction is characterized by impaired gallbladder contractility and increased intestinal cholesterol absorption, contributing to cholesterol crystallization and gallstone formation (Wang2020An). 

Beyond gastrointestinal disorders, CCKAR has been associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. Variants in the CCKAR gene have been linked to anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. The gene's role in the regulation of food intake and energy balance, as well as its involvement in neurotransmission, suggests its significance in these conditions (Bienvenu2019Exome; Wank1992Purification). 

Overall, CCKAR's involvement in various physiological processes makes it a critical gene in understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases.

## Interactions
The cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various G protein subtypes, including Gq, Gs, and Gi, to mediate intracellular signaling pathways. CCKAR forms complexes with these G proteins, which include the Gα Ras-like domain, Gβγ subunits, and scFv16, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies (Liu2021Ligand; Liu2021Structural). The receptor exhibits coupling promiscuity, predominantly interacting with Gq due to the largest interface among the CCKAR-G protein complexes (Liu2021Structural).

The structural basis for this interaction involves specific conformational changes in the receptor, such as the outward displacement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and the role of the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) in Gq coupling selectivity. The 'wavy hook' at the C-terminus of the Gα α5 helix is crucial for G protein coupling specificity, with distinct conformational changes observed in different CCKAR-G protein complexes (Liu2021Ligand; Liu2021Structural). These interactions are characterized by hydrophobic contacts and specific residue interactions, such as those involving ICL3 and the Gαq subunit, which are critical for the receptor's coupling efficiency and selectivity (Liu2021Ligand; Liu2021Structural).
