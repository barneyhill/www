# THAP8

## Overview
THAP8 is a gene that encodes the THAP domain containing 8 protein, a member of the human THAP protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a THAP domain, a zinc-coordinating DNA-binding domain that plays a role in various cellular functions, including DNA binding and protein interactions (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). The THAP8 protein is notable for its C2CH zinc-coordinating motif, although variations in homologs may affect its DNA binding capabilities (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). Structurally, THAP8 includes predicted alpha helical regions that facilitate oligomerization, suggesting it may form both homo- and hetero-oligomers (Sanghavi2019Classification). Functionally, THAP8 is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly within the THAP family, and has been linked to neurological disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Ripke2020Mapping; McCallum2016Cortical).

## Structure
The THAP8 protein is part of the human THAP protein family, characterized by the presence of a THAP domain, a zinc-coordinating DNA-binding domain. This domain is typically located at the amino terminal end of the protein and is involved in various cellular functions, including DNA binding (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). The THAP domain in THAP8 is noted for its C2CH zinc-coordinating motif, although some homologs of THAP8 lack certain cysteine residues, which may affect DNA binding capabilities (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic).

The secondary structure of THAP8 includes predicted alpha helical regions, specifically spanning residues 180-209, which are rich in leucine and hydrophobic residues, characteristic of coiled coils (Sanghavi2019Classification). These regions are important for protein oligomerization, suggesting that THAP8 may form higher order oligomeric structures (Sanghavi2019Classification).

The tertiary structure predictions for THAP8, generated using tools like I TASSER, indicate a compact model, although specific details about the overall 3D folding are not provided (Sanghavi2019Classification). The quaternary structure of THAP8 is not explicitly detailed, but the potential for oligomerization suggests it may form both homo- and hetero-oligomers (Sanghavi2019Classification). The presence of insertions and deletions in the THAP domain of THAP8 homologs indicates possible structural and functional diversity (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic).

## Clinical Significance
The THAP8 gene has been associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Research indicates that decreased expression of THAP8 correlates with increased seizure frequency in TLE patients, marking the first reported link between this gene and a seizure disorder (McCallum2016Cortical). This association suggests that THAP8 expression levels could potentially serve as biomarkers for predicting epileptogenicity in TLE, offering implications for diagnosis and management (McCallum2016Cortical).

In addition to its role in epilepsy, THAP8 has been implicated in schizophrenia through genomic loci mapping. The gene is prioritized due to its alleles being in perfect linkage disequilibrium with high posterior probability of being causal, although specific diseases directly associated with THAP8 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in this context (Ripke2020Mapping).

THAP8 is also identified as a Cu-independent gene in studies examining the effects of copper deprivation on gene expression, though no specific diseases or conditions are directly linked to THAP8 in this context (Wu2019Copper). Overall, THAP8's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential clinical significance in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
THAP8, a member of the human THAP protein family, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its conserved coiled coil regions. These regions are characterized by leucine-rich and hydrophobic residues, which are typical of coiled coils and suggest a potential for oligomerization (Sanghavi2019Classification). THAP8 is part of the medium-sized THAP proteins (mTHAP), which includes THAP7, THAP10, and THAP11, and shares conserved leucine and basic amino acid residues in its alpha helical regions (Sanghavi2019Classification).

Although specific interactions of THAP8 are not detailed extensively, it is known to form heterodimers with THAP11, indicating a capacity for protein-protein interactions within the THAP family (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). The predicted alpha helical regions of THAP8 have a moderate amphipathic arrangement, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Sanghavi2019Classification). Despite these insights, detailed interaction partners or specific functional roles of THAP8 in multiprotein complexes remain to be fully elucidated. The presence of a coiled coil region suggests a potential for both homo- and hetero-oligomerization, which is crucial for many cellular processes (Sanghavi2019Classification).
