# CKLF

## Overview
The CKLF gene encodes the chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1), a protein that plays a crucial role in immune regulation and inflammatory responses. CKLF1 is a member of the CC chemokine family, characterized by its single CC motif, which distinguishes it from other chemokines that typically have additional cysteine residues. This protein is secreted and exhibits chemotactic properties, guiding immune cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes to sites of inflammation or injury. CKLF1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the spleen and lung, and exists in multiple isoforms, some of which are transmembrane proteins. The protein interacts with several chemokine receptors, including CCR4, CCR3, and CCR5, influencing immune cell behavior and contributing to processes such as tissue repair and vascular inflammation. CKLF1's involvement in pathological conditions, including rheumatic diseases, atherosclerosis, and certain cancers, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Li2023Role; Cai2020Chemokinelike; HAN2001Molecular).

## Structure
The chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a protein encoded by the CKLF gene, characterized by its unique structure and chemotactic activity. CKLF1 is a highly basic and hydrophobic polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 10.9 kDa, consisting of 99 amino acids (HAN2001Molecular; Wang2006Chemokinelike). It contains a single CC motif, a feature of the CC chemokine family, but lacks additional cysteine residues typically found in other members of this family (HAN2001Molecular; Liu2018Progress).

CKLF1 is secreted as a protein and has at least two C-terminal peptides, C19 and C27, which differ in their chemotactic properties and interactions with receptors such as CCR4 (Cai2020Chemokinelike; Liu2018Progress). The C27 peptide has a stronger effect on chemotaxis and calcium flux due to the presence of eight additional amino acids compared to C19 (Cai2020Chemokinelike). CKLF1 is expressed in various tissues, with higher levels in the spleen and lung, and lower levels in skeletal muscle and other tissues (Liu2018Progress).

CKLF1 has four RNA splicing isoforms: CKLF1, CKLF2, CKLF3, and CKLF4, which encode proteins of varying lengths and structural features (Cai2020Chemokinelike; HAN2001Molecular). CKLF1 and CKLF3 are secreted, while CKLF2 and CKLF4 are transmembrane proteins (Liu2018Progress). The isoforms share conserved N-terminal and C-terminal ends but differ structurally within certain regions (HAN2001Molecular).

## Function
CKLF1 (chemokine-like factor 1) is a secreted protein involved in various molecular processes, primarily functioning as a cytokine with chemotactic activity. It plays a significant role in guiding immune cells, such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, to sites of inflammation or injury, facilitating immune responses and tissue regeneration (Cai2020Chemokinelike; HAN2001Molecular). CKLF1 is highly expressed in tissues like the spleen, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes, indicating its active role in immune regulation and cell signaling (Cai2020Chemokinelike; Liu2018Progress).

CKLF1 is characterized by a unique structure within the CC chemokine subfamily, containing a single conserved CC motif, which contributes to its chemotactic properties (HAN2001Molecular). It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, including skeletal muscle cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, promoting cell growth and tissue repair (Cai2020Chemokinelike; Liu2018Progress). CKLF1's activity is not limited to immune cells; it also influences the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, playing a role in vascular inflammation and neointimal formation (Cai2020Chemokinelike).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CKLF1 gene have been implicated in a variety of diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory and immune responses. In rheumatic diseases such as psoriasis, CKLF1 induces lymphocyte migration and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, contributing to disease pathology (Li2023Role). In lupus nephritis, CKLF1 levels correlate with disease activity, suggesting its role in exacerbating inflammatory responses (Li2023Role). CKLF1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by influencing monocyte adhesion and smooth muscle cell migration (Li2023Role).

In the context of tumors, CKLF1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis due to its role in enhancing inflammation-mediated carcinogenesis and preventing apoptosis via the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway (Liu2019CKLF1). CKLF1's overexpression is linked to vascular invasion and tumor progression in HCC (Liu2019CKLF1). It is also implicated in ovarian cancer progression and is associated with keloid formation, where its expression is increased (Cai2020Chemokinelike).

In respiratory diseases, CKLF1 is overexpressed in conditions like asthma and pulmonary fibrosis, contributing to airway inflammation and remodeling (Liu2018Progress). Its interaction with CCR4 is a potential therapeutic target for reducing disease severity in these conditions (Cai2020Chemokinelike).

## Interactions
CKLF1 (chemokine-like factor 1) is known to interact with the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), acting as a functional ligand. This interaction is significant for inducing chemotaxis and calcium flux in CCR4-transfected cells, highlighting its specificity for CCR4 over other receptors like CCR6 (Wang2006Chemokinelike). CKLF1 can also desensitize CCR4 to subsequent treatments with other ligands, such as TARC/CCL17, indicating a competitive binding mechanism (Wang2006Chemokinelike).

The interaction between CKLF1 and CCR4 involves the N-terminal extracellular tail of CCR4, with peptides derived from CKLF1, such as CKLF1-C27 and CKLF1-C19, showing varying affinities. CKLF1-C27, with its additional eight amino acids, exhibits a stronger binding affinity and more potent activation of CCR4-mediated responses compared to CKLF1-C19 (Sun2009Interactions). Specific amino acids in CKLF1-C19, such as lysine and proline, are crucial for its interaction with CCR4, as mutations in these residues significantly reduce binding affinity (Sun2009Interactions).

CKLF1 also interacts with other receptors, such as CCR3 and CCR5, which are involved in various immune responses, including allergic inflammation and neutrophil migration (Li2023Role). These interactions suggest CKLF1's role in modulating immune cell behavior and inflammatory processes.
