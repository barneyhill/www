# ITGA7

## Overview
The ITGA7 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 7, a transmembrane protein that is part of the integrin family, which plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin alpha 7 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and is a key component of the α7β1-integrin complex. This complex is essential for linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining muscle integrity and function. The α7β1-integrin interacts with laminins in the basal lamina and is involved in muscle cell proliferation, adhesion, and mechanosignal transduction. Mutations in ITGA7 have been associated with various muscular disorders, including congenital myopathy and congenital muscular dystrophy, as well as playing a role in cancer biology as a tumor suppressor (Liu2008Increasing; Esposito2013Digenic; Vignier1999Structure; Guan2020Downregulating).

## Structure
The ITGA7 gene encodes the integrin alpha 7 protein, which is a part of the integrin family involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGA7 consists of a sequence of amino acids that includes seven conserved repeat domains and three divalent cation-binding regions, along with 18 conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular domain (Vignier1999Structure). The secondary structure features changes in beta strands and alpha helix structures, particularly due to mutations like E882K, which affect the protein's conformation (Esposito2013Digenic).

The tertiary structure of ITGA7 involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, although specific details on this structure are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure typically involves heterodimerization with a beta subunit, such as integrin beta 1, forming the integrin alpha 7 beta 1 complex (Kramer1991Lamininbinding).

ITGA7 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with distinct expression patterns and functions. These include cytoplasmic variants α7A, α7B, and α7C, and extracellular isoforms X1 and X2, which are developmentally regulated and tissue-specific (Burkin1999The; Vignier1999Structure). The protein also features potential glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications (Song1992H36alpha).

## Function
The ITGA7 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 7, which is a crucial component of the α7β1-integrin complex. This integrin is primarily involved in linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton in skeletal muscle, playing a significant role in maintaining muscle integrity and function. The α7β1-integrin binds to laminin in the basal lamina surrounding muscle fibers and associates with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton network through focal adhesion complexes. It is distributed along the sarcolemma at costameres and is concentrated at neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions, which are essential for transmitting the forces produced by muscle contractions (Liu2008Increasing; Vignier1999Structure).

In healthy cells, the α7β1-integrin is involved in muscle cell proliferation, adhesion, and resistance to apoptosis. It enhances muscle cell proliferation and adhesion without significantly altering gene expression, suggesting its primary role is structural rather than signaling. The integrin also acts as a mechanosensor, potentially regulating mechanosignal transduction and adaptation of muscle fibers to contraction and stretch (Liu2008Increasing). The α7β1-integrin is also crucial for normal myogenic differentiation and is involved in signal transduction processes, potentially through phosphorylation events (Song1993Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ITGA7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A specific mutation, E882K, in the ITGA7 gene is associated with congenital myopathy and left ventricular non-compact cardiomyopathy. This mutation, found in a homozygous form in affected individuals, induces a conformational change in the ITGA7 protein, affecting its beta sheet structures and leading to muscle-related phenotypes (Esposito2013Digenic). The ITGA7 gene is also linked to congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), characterized by muscle weakness and delayed motor development. A case study identified a homozygous variant in ITGA7 in a patient with CMD, highlighting its role in this rare subtype of muscular dystrophy (Xia2021Case).

In cancer, ITGA7 acts as a tumor suppressor in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Downregulation of ITGA7 in PTC is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, partly due to its role in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This downregulation results in decreased E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin and vimentin expression, facilitating cancer metastasis (Guan2020Downregulating). ITGA7's expression levels also influence tumor growth and metastasis in other cancers, such as glioblastoma and colorectal cancer (Guan2020Downregulating).

## Interactions
The ITGA7 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 7, which forms a complex with the beta 1 subunit to create the α7β1 integrin. This integrin is a key player in muscle cell adhesion and stability, primarily interacting with laminins, such as laminin-1, laminin-2, and laminin-4, in the extracellular matrix. These interactions facilitate the attachment of muscle fibers to the basal lamina, contributing to the structural integrity of skeletal muscle (Burkin2001Enhanced; Vignier1999Structure).

The α7β1 integrin also interacts with α dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, which is linked to the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. This interaction is crucial for maintaining muscle fiber stability and function (Vignier1999Structure). In the context of muscular dystrophies, the α7β1 integrin has been shown to compensate for the absence of dystrophin, suggesting its role in muscle fiber survival and integrity (Burkin2001Enhanced).

In merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, the expression and localization of α7β1 integrins are disrupted, indicating a dependency on merosin for proper integrin function. This disruption highlights the integrin's role as a receptor for merosin, essential for myofiber attachment and survival (Vachon1997Integrins).
