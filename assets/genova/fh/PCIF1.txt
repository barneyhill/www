# PCIF1

## Overview
PCIF1, or phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription and mRNA modification. The PCIF1 protein is characterized by its interaction with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, playing a critical role in transcription regulation by modulating the phosphorylation status of the polymerase (Fan2003PCIF1). It functions as a negative regulator of gene expression and is the sole mammalian enzyme responsible for the methylation of N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) in mRNA, a modification that influences mRNA stability and translation (Sendinc2018PCIF1; Akichika2019Capspecific). PCIF1's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in cellular function and its potential impact on various diseases, including cancer, where its expression levels and activity have been linked to tumor progression and prognosis (Zhuo2022m6Am; Li2023The).

## Structure
The PCIF1 protein is a human protein encoded by a 2556 bp cDNA, resulting in a polypeptide of 704 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 80.7 kDa (Fan2003PCIF1). The primary structure of PCIF1 includes a WW domain, a conserved region of about 40 amino acids that folds into a stable, triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. This domain contains two signature tryptophan residues spaced 20-23 amino acids apart, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions (Fan2003PCIF1). The WW domain is responsible for the direct interaction with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (pCTD) of RNA polymerase II (Fan2003PCIF1).

PCIF1 also contains two putative nuclear localization signals and a serine-rich domain, suggesting its nuclear localization (Fan2003PCIF1). The protein is known to interact with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, indicating a role in mRNA synthesis by modulating RNA polymerase II activity (Fan2003PCIF1). The interaction between PCIF1 and RNA polymerase II is mediated by the WW domain, which shows a higher affinity for the hyperphosphorylated CTD compared to the unphosphorylated form (Fan2003PCIF1). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation.

## Function
PCIF1 (phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in transcription regulation by interacting with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). It binds specifically to the phosphorylated form of the CTD, inhibiting its dephosphorylation by the small CTD phosphatase SCP1, which is crucial for maintaining the transcription cycle and the recruitment of RNA processing factors (Hirose2008Human). PCIF1 acts as a negative regulator of gene expression by repressing the transactivation of reporter gene expression driven by various transcription activation domains. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing PCIF1 levels results in increased transactivation, indicating its role as a repressor in gene expression (Hirose2008Human).

PCIF1 is also identified as the sole mammalian m6Am methyltransferase, responsible for catalyzing the methylation of N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) in mRNA. This modification occurs near the mRNA cap and is crucial for regulating protein translation by suppressing cap-dependent translation (Sendinc2018PCIF1). PCIF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of Pol II, suggesting its involvement in nascent transcript modification (Sugita2021The; Akichika2019Capspecific).

## Clinical Significance
PCIF1, a gene encoding the phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its function as an m6Am methyltransferase. In gastric cancer, PCIF1 expression is notably elevated, correlating with cancer progression and poor prognosis. Its upregulation leads to increased m6Am modification, which inhibits the translation of the tumor suppressor TM9SF1, thereby promoting tumor aggressiveness (Zhuo2022m6Am). Silencing PCIF1 in gastric cancer models has been shown to reduce tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhuo2022m6Am).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), PCIF1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It interacts with CTBP2 to regulate m6Am modification on mRNA, particularly affecting the tumor suppressor TET2. This interaction is crucial for tumor progression, as PCIF1 depletion leads to reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Li2023The). PCIF1's role in cancer is complex, as it can act as both a tumorigenic factor and a tumor suppressor, depending on the cancer type and context (Wu2023PCIF1).

## Interactions
PCIF1, also known as phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1, is involved in several protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. It interacts with the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, specifically binding to the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD through its WW domain. This interaction is crucial for regulating the phosphorylation status of RNA polymerase II, which affects transcription (Fan2003PCIF1; Wu2023PCIF1).

PCIF1 also interacts with the transcription factor PDX-1, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This inhibition is mediated through specific domains within PCIF1, including the TRAF and POZ domains, and does not involve histone deacetylase recruitment (Liu2004Identification; Liu2006Two). PCIF1 targets PDX-1 for ubiquitination via a Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, affecting PDX-1 protein stability and function (Claiborn2010Pcif1).

In the context of mRNA modification, PCIF1 is the only known methyltransferase responsible for the m6Am modification in mRNA, impacting gene expression and mRNA stability (Wu2023PCIF1). During oxidative stress, PCIF1 localizes to stress granules and binds mRNA coding regions, suggesting a role in posttranscriptional gene regulation (Tat2024PCIF1).
