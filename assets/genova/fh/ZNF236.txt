# ZNF236

## Overview
ZNF236 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 236, a member of the Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of multiple C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which are essential for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Holmes1999Cloning). The gene is located on chromosome 18q22-q23 and is expressed ubiquitously across various human tissues, with particularly high expression levels in skeletal muscle and brain (Holmes1999Cloning). ZNF236 is involved in cellular responses to glucose and is regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-374a-5p, which influence its expression in cell proliferation and differentiation processes (Suzuki2019MicroRNA374a). Despite initial investigations into its potential role in diabetic nephropathy, ZNF236 has not been implicated as a significant factor in the disease (Halama2003The). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles in the human body (Halama2003The).

## Structure
The ZNF236 gene encodes a Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein that is characterized by the presence of multiple C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which are crucial for DNA binding. The protein exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in at least three transcript variants: ZNF236a, ZNF236b, and ZNF236c. ZNF236a is the full-length transcript, while ZNF236b and ZNF236c arise from splicing events affecting exons 26 and 9, respectively. ZNF236c has a shortened exon 9, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon (Halama2003The).

The primary structure of ZNF236 includes a sequence rich in cysteine and histidine residues, forming the zinc-finger motifs. These motifs are organized in clusters of five to nine fingers, suggesting a role in DNA binding (Holmes1999Cloning). The protein's secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc-finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to facilitate interaction with DNA.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific modifications for ZNF236 are not detailed in the context. The gene is located on human chromosome 18q22-q23 and is expressed ubiquitously, with the highest levels in skeletal muscle and brain (Holmes1999Cloning).

## Function
ZNF236, a Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein, is involved in transcriptional regulation due to its multiple C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which suggest a role in DNA binding (Holmes1999Cloning). The gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with the highest levels in skeletal muscle and brain, indicating its potential importance in these tissues (Holmes1999Cloning). ZNF236 is upregulated in response to elevated D-glucose levels, suggesting a role in cellular responses to glucose (Holmes1999Cloning).

The gene produces several alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts, including ZNF236a and ZNF236b, with ZNF236b being more abundant (Halama2003The; Holmes1999Cloning). Despite its glucose-regulated expression, studies have not found a significant role for ZNF236 in diabetic nephropathy, as no mutations linking it to the disease were identified (Halama2003The).

ZNF236 expression is regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-374a-5p, which can downregulate its expression in cultured human palate cells, indicating a role in cell proliferation and differentiation processes (Suzuki2019MicroRNA374a). However, the specific functions of ZNF236 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF236, a Kruppel-like zinc-finger gene, has been investigated for its potential role in diabetic nephropathy (DN), a major cause of renal failure in diabetes patients. Initial studies suggested that ZNF236 might be involved in DN due to its glucose-regulated expression and location on chromosome 18q22-q23, a region linked to DN susceptibility (Holmes1999Cloning). However, subsequent research found no significant role for ZNF236 in the development of DN. Despite its upregulation in high glucose conditions and the presence of multiple splice variants, including ZNF236a, ZNF236b, and ZNF236c, no mutations were identified in patients with DN that would implicate ZNF236 as a susceptibility gene (Halama2003The).

The study also identified several polymorphisms in ZNF236 among different ethnic groups, but these did not lead to amino acid changes, suggesting no impact on protein function. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed no significant differences in mRNA expression levels between affected and unaffected individuals, further supporting the conclusion that ZNF236 is not a major factor in DN (Halama2003The). Other genes in the chromosome 18q22.3-q23 region, such as KIAA0222, may be more relevant to DN (Halama2003The).
