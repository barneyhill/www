# TRMT44

## Overview
TRMT44 is a gene that encodes the tRNA methyltransferase 44 homolog, an enzyme categorized as a methyltransferase. This enzyme plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules by catalyzing their methylation, a process essential for the stability and functionality of tRNA, which in turn influences protein synthesis. The activity of the tRNA methyltransferase 44 homolog is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to efficient translation and cellular protein homeostasis (Sokołowski2018Cooperativity). Mutations in the TRMT44 gene have been linked to various health conditions, including partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes and hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Dimitrova2019RNA; Zhang2023Integrated).

## Function
TRMT44 is a tRNA methyltransferase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the methylation of tRNA. This modification is crucial for maintaining the stability and proper functioning of tRNA, which in turn impacts protein synthesis. The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to efficient translation and overall cellular protein homeostasis (Sokołowski2018Cooperativity).

In the context of human health, tRNA modifications, including those facilitated by TRMT44, play a significant role in protecting tRNA molecules from degradation by the rapid tRNA decay pathway (RTD). This protection is essential for maintaining proper translation rates, particularly in neurons, which are highly susceptible to proteotoxic stress. The stability provided by these modifications is also critical in supporting the increased demand for protein synthesis in cancer cells, which rely on enhanced translation to sustain oncogenic processes (Sokołowski2018Cooperativity).

TRMT44's activity in the cytoplasm underscores its importance in cellular processes, ensuring that tRNA molecules are adequately modified to participate in the translation machinery, thereby supporting cellular growth and function (Sokołowski2018Cooperativity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRMT44 gene have been implicated in partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes (PEPS), a novel Mendelian idiopathic epilepsy. The specific mechanisms by which these mutations lead to PEPS are currently unknown, but the gene is predicted to function as a 2'-O-methyluridine methyltransferase, potentially affecting tRNA methylation (Angelova2018The; Dimitrova2019RNA; Park2020Epitranscriptomic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TRMT44 is associated with poor prognosis. Mutations in TRMT44, along with other RNA methylation writers, are linked to cancer-related pathways, including MYC targets, E2F targets, DNA repair, and oxidative phosphorylation. These mutations may influence the tumor microenvironment and immune response, suggesting a role in cancer development and progression (Zhang2023Integrated).

TRMT44 is also mentioned in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders and high myopia (HM), although its specific role in these conditions is not detailed beyond its association with partial epilepsy (Liu2023Screening). The gene's involvement in these diverse conditions highlights its potential significance in various pathological processes.
