# FAM168B

## Overview
FAM168B is a gene that encodes the protein family with sequence similarity 168 member B, which is involved in neuro-axonal guidance and neuronal differentiation within the central nervous system (CNS). This protein, also known as the myelin-associated neurite-outgrowth inhibitor (MANI), is primarily localized to neuronal cell membranes and plays a significant role in inhibiting neurite outgrowth, thereby influencing the differentiation of neural stem cells into catecholaminergic neurons (Pramanik2017Livebearing). FAM168B is specifically expressed in myelinated neurons, indicating its potential involvement in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin cell development (Zhang2019Copper). The gene is crucial for maintaining neuronal survival and differentiation, underscoring its importance in the structural and functional integrity of the nervous system (Zhang2019Copper).

## Function
FAM168B, also known as the myelin-associated neurite-outgrowth inhibitor (MANI), is a gene that encodes a protein involved in neuro-axonal guidance and neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS) (Pramanik2017Livebearing). This protein is localized to neuronal cell membranes and has the potential to inhibit neurite outgrowth, playing a crucial role in the differentiation of neural stem cells into catecholaminergic neurons (Pramanik2017Livebearing). FAM168B is specifically expressed in myelinated neurons in the CNS of humans and mice, suggesting its involvement in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin cell development (Zhang2019Copper).

The gene is also implicated in controlling neuronal survival and differentiation, indicating its importance in maintaining the structure and function of the nervous system (Zhang2019Copper). Although the precise molecular activities of FAM168B in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its role in neurodevelopmental processes highlights its significance in the proper functioning of the CNS. The gene's involvement in these processes suggests that it may contribute to the regulation of neuronal pathways and cellular signaling, essential for maintaining neural health and function.
