# DOHH

## Overview
The DOHH gene encodes the enzyme deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, a metal-dependent hydroxylase that plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). This enzyme is characterized by its unique HEAT-repeat structure and a diiron core, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Park2005Molecular; Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine to hypusine, a modification crucial for the activation of eIF5A, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as translation elongation and cell cycle progression (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine; Csonga1996Evaluation). The enzyme's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins involved in translation regulation and cellular metabolism (Sievert2012Proteinproteininteraction). The functional integrity of DOHH is vital for cell viability, and its inhibition can lead to cell cycle arrest, underscoring its importance in cellular proliferation and survival (Csonga1996Evaluation).

## Structure
The human deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) protein is characterized by a pseudosymmetric arrangement of two domains, each comprising four HEAT repeats. These domains are connected by a flexible loop, which is involved in electrostatic interactions (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). The HEAT repeats consist of pairs of α-helices connected by short loops, forming a superhelical structure that contributes to the protein's stability and function (Park2005Molecular; Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine).

The DOHH protein contains a diiron core, with iron ions coordinated by conserved histidine and glutamate residues. This coordination is crucial for the enzyme's hydroxylase activity (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). The diiron core is framed by even-numbered α-helices, with specific residues such as His89, Glu90, and His207 coordinating Fe1, and His56, His240, and Glu241 coordinating Fe2 (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine).

The tertiary structure of DOHH is compact, with the two central iron ions enclosed by the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. This structure is stabilized by a secondary coordination sphere, which includes hydrophilic and hydrophobic hemispheres (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). The presence of a peroxo-diiron(III) intermediate is crucial for the enzyme's function as an oxygen-activating enzyme (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine).

## Function
Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) by catalyzing the hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine to form hypusine. This modification is essential for the activation of eIF5A, which is involved in various cellular processes such as translation elongation, mRNA decay, nuclear export, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis (Park2005Molecular; Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). Hypusinated eIF5A is particularly important for the efficient translation of polyproline motifs, which are challenging for the ribosome to process, thereby facilitating protein synthesis (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine).

DOHH is a metal-dependent enzyme, requiring iron for its activity, and is characterized by a unique HEAT-repeat structure with a diiron core (Park2005Molecular; Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures the proper function of eIF5A, which is crucial for cell viability and proliferation in multicellular organisms (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). The enzyme's activity is linked to the stabilization of tRNA during translation, facilitating peptide bond formation and translocation (Lindae2018Deoxyhypusine). Inhibition of DOHH can lead to cell cycle arrest, highlighting its importance in cell cycle progression (Csonga1996Evaluation).

## Interactions
Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) is a key enzyme in the hypusine modification system, primarily interacting with eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) to catalyze the hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine to hypusine, a critical step for eIF-5A activation. DOHH is known to interact with specific proteins within the hypusine modification network, contributing to its functional role in cellular processes (Sievert2012Proteinproteininteraction).

In addition to its interaction with eIF-5A, DOHH has been shown to interact with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2. These interactions were identified through protein fragment complementation assays and confirmed in technical replicates, suggesting a broader role for DOHH in cellular metabolism and energy regulation (Sievert2012Proteinproteininteraction).

DOHH is a HEAT-repeat protein, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This structural feature may facilitate its interactions with other proteins involved in translation regulation and cytoskeletal organization (Park2005Molecular). The enzyme's unique structure, distinct from other hydroxylases, supports its specialized role in the hypusine modification pathway (Park2005Molecular).
