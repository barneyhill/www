# NLGN3

## Overview
NLGN3 is a gene that encodes the protein neuroligin 3, a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule involved in the formation and function of synapses in the nervous system. Neuroligin 3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a crucial role in synaptic connectivity by forming trans-synaptic complexes with presynaptic neurexins, thereby organizing both pre- and postsynaptic compartments. This protein is expressed at both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses, contributing to the balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition, which is essential for proper synaptic transmission and plasticity (Muellerleile2021Neuroligin3; Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3). Mutations in the NLGN3 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), highlighting its clinical significance (Trobiani2020The; Quartier2019Novel).

## Structure
Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion protein involved in synapse formation and function. The primary structure of NLGN3 includes a signal peptide, a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular tail. The extracellular domain contains a cholinesterase-like domain, which is crucial for synaptic binding and shares high sequence and structural homology with acetylcholinesterase, although it lacks a catalytic site (Bourne2014The).

The tertiary structure of NLGN3 is characterized by an a/b hydrolase fold, consisting of a 14-stranded central curved b-sheet surrounded by 25 a-helices. This structure forms symmetrical elliptical spheres in its dimeric form, with a dimer interface area of about 789 Å² (Zhang2022Expression). NLGN3 typically forms homodimers, which are essential for its synaptogenic effects (Bemben2015The).

Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation are important for the protein's folding and stability. NLGN3 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to functional diversity (Bourne2014The). The structural integrity and interactions of NLGN3 are crucial for its role in synaptic adhesion and are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (Zhang2022Expression).

## Function
Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) is a neuronal adhesion protein that plays a critical role in synaptic function by facilitating the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. It is expressed at both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses, where it forms transsynaptic complexes with presynaptic neurexins. This interaction is crucial for organizing both pre- and postsynaptic compartments, thereby influencing synaptic connectivity and neurotransmitter receptor organization (Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3).

NLGN3 is involved in synapse assembly and maintenance, as it can be recruited to postsynaptic structures induced by neurexins. It also forms complexes with other neuroligin isoforms, such as NLGN1 and NLGN2, suggesting a cooperative function in synaptic organization (Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3). The protein is enriched in synaptic plasma membranes and postsynaptic densities, indicating its significant presence in synaptic regions (Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3).

Functionally, NLGN3 enhances AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated currents at excitatory synapses, contributing to synaptic potentiation and the assembly of new functional synapses (Shipman2011Functional). It plays a role in maintaining the balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition, which is crucial for proper synaptic transmission and plasticity (Muellerleile2021Neuroligin3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NLGN3 gene have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities. One of the most studied mutations is the R451C substitution, which leads to impaired protein folding, dimerization, and trafficking, resulting in retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and degradation. This mutation also affects the protein's ability to bind to NRXNβ1, leading to defective synaptogenic functions and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Trobiani2020The). The R451C mutation is associated with increased excitatory synaptic transmission and alterations in inhibitory synaptic transmission, contributing to the phenotypic manifestations of ASD (Trobiani2020The).

Other NLGN3 variants, such as P514S and R597W, have been linked to ASD and intellectual disability. These mutations cause severe misfolding of the protein, leading to ER retention and a significant decrease in protein levels, which also triggers a strong UPR (Quartier2019Novel). These alterations in NLGN3 disrupt synaptic function and contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (Trobiani2020The; Quartier2019Novel).

## Interactions
Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a significant role in synaptic connectivity and function. It forms trans-synaptic complexes with presynaptic neurexins (NRXs), which are essential for organizing both pre- and postsynaptic compartments (Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3). NLGN3 is present at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, unlike other neuroligin isoforms, and can coaggregate with scaffolding proteins such as PSD95 and gephyrin when clustered by neurexin-expressing cells (Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3).

NLGN3 also interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) δ, forming noncanonical interactions that are crucial for social motivation and reward, as well as learning and memory processes (Li2024Differential). Additionally, NLGN3 can form complexes with other neuroligin isoforms, such as NL1 and NL2, suggesting that multiple neuroligin isoforms can coexist at single synapses and may interact in vivo (Budreck2007Neuroligin‐3).

The protein is involved in intracellular calcium signaling and interacts with various proteins, including EEF1A1, FLNA, and MT-CO2, which are implicated in processes like cytosolic calcium regulation and mitochondrial function (Shen2014Novel). These interactions highlight NLGN3's role in synaptic plasticity and its potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Shen2014Novel).
