# CASP7

## Overview
Caspase 7 (CASP7) is a gene that encodes the protein caspase-7, a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family, which plays a pivotal role in the execution phase of cell apoptosis and in the regulation of inflammation. As an executioner caspase, caspase-7 is activated by initiator caspases and is involved in the cleavage of various cellular substrates, leading to the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis (Walsh2008Executioner; Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). The protein is characterized by its ability to form a homodimer and its structural features, including a centrally located β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). Caspase-7 is also implicated in non-apoptotic processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, and is involved in inflammatory responses through its activation by caspase-1-containing inflammasomes (Lin2013Targeting; Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). The regulation of caspase-7 activity is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and dysregulation of CASP7 has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Safari2020Caspase7; Zhang2018A).

## Structure
Caspase 7 (CASP7) is a protease involved in apoptosis and inflammation, belonging to the executioner caspases subgroup. The primary structure of CASP7 consists of 303 amino acids, which are cleaved into a large subunit of approximately 20 kDa and a small subunit of about 11 kDa, connected by a linker sequence in the zymogen form (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). 

The secondary structure of CASP7 includes a centrally located 12-stranded β-sheet surrounded by 10 α-helices, forming an 'open α/β barrel fold' (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). The tertiary structure involves the formation of an active site through the spatial reorganization of loops L2, L3, and L4 upon activation (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). 

In terms of quaternary structure, CASP7 exists as a pre-assembled homodimer in the cytosol, with each enzymatic unit containing a singular active site (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). The dimeric nature of CASP7 is characterized by a more hydrophobic interface compared to apical caspases like caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Salvesen2008Caspase). 

Post-translational modifications include cleavage by initiator caspases, which is necessary for its activation (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). The crystal structure of CASP7 bound to the tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO has been determined, providing insights into its substrate and inhibitor selectivity (Wei2000The).

## Function
Caspase 7 (CASP7) is a crucial executioner caspase involved in apoptosis and inflammation. In apoptosis, CASP7 is activated through both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, leading to the cleavage of various substrates that manifest apoptotic features such as phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). CASP7, along with caspase-3, acts as an executioner caspase, but it also exhibits distinct functions, such as cleaving specific substrates not targeted by caspase-3 (Walsh2008Executioner). 

In healthy human cells, CASP7 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility, often following the activation of caspase-3 (Lin2013Targeting). CASP7 is also activated by caspase-1-containing inflammasomes in response to inflammatory stimuli, highlighting its role in regulating inflammatory responses and cell death (Lamkanfi2010Caspase7:). 

CASP7's activity is tightly regulated, and its deficiency can lead to altered cellular processes, such as reduced cell proliferation and viability, as observed in certain cell models (Safari2020Caspase7). These functions underscore CASP7's importance in both apoptosis and non-apoptotic cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASP7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, CASP7 is targeted by multiple miRNAs, such as miR-224, which is associated with the migration and proliferation of lung cancer cells, and miR-23a, which promotes growth in tumorous cells by targeting CASP7 (Safdar2020The). Alterations in CASP7 expression, such as its downregulation, are linked to early disease recurrence in tumors (Safdar2020The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, a rare missense variant in CASP7, identified as rs116437863, is associated with familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). This variant results in an amino acid substitution that is predicted to be deleterious, suggesting a role for CASP7 in AD pathogenesis (Zhang2018A). Conversely, a loss-of-function variant, rs10553596, in CASP7 has been found to protect against AD in individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele, indicating a complex role for CASP7 in neurodegeneration (Ayers2016A).

CASP7 also plays a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where it is involved in airway smooth muscle contractility under hypercapnic conditions. This nonapoptotic function of CASP7 contributes to increased airway resistance, highlighting its significance in COPD pathogenesis (Shigemura2018Hypercapnia).

## Interactions
Caspase-7 (CASP7) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate apoptosis. It interacts with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which inhibits CASP7 activity by binding to its active forms, p19/p12-CASP7, thereby preventing apoptosis in caspase-3-deficient cancer cells (Lin2013Targeting). The compound I-Lys can disrupt this interaction by binding to CASP7, specifically alkylating the Cys 246 residue, which prevents XIAP from inhibiting CASP7 and induces apoptosis in these cells (Lin2013Targeting).

CASP7 also interacts with survivin, a protein that inhibits caspase activity. Survivin binds to CASP7, blocking its catalytic activity and preventing dimer formation. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of the XIAP BIR2 domain, which stabilizes the survivin-CASP7 complex, further inhibiting CASP7's activity (Sarvagalla2021Survivin).

In the context of caspase-1-induced apoptosis, CASP7 acts as a mediator in a Bid-independent pathway, where it is activated downstream of caspase-1, contributing to the activation of caspase-3 and the progression of apoptosis (Mahib2019Caspase‐7).
