# ZSWIM8

## Overview
ZSWIM8 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger SWIM-type containing 8 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a zinc finger SWIM domain. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the regulation of protein homeostasis and RNA stability. It is involved in the degradation of intrinsically disordered region-containing proteins and RNA-binding proteins, which is essential for maintaining cellular function and proper brain development (Lei2024Turnover). Additionally, ZSWIM8 is implicated in actin dynamics, promoting linear actin filament polymerization, which is vital for cellular structures and processes (MolinaPelayo2022The). The gene's activity is conserved across species, with its ortholog in Drosophila, known as pelado, also playing a significant role in neurodevelopment (Pelayo2022The). Dysregulation or mutations in ZSWIM8 have been linked to developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Jones2023Targetdirected).

## Structure
ZSWIM8 is a human gene encoding a protein characterized by the presence of a zinc finger SWIM domain, which plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of ZSWIM8 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the foundation for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure of the ZSWIM8 protein may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is essential for its biological activity and interaction with other molecules. 

ZSWIM8 may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. These modifications are critical for regulating the protein's activity and its role in cellular processes. Additionally, ZSWIM8 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing of its mRNA transcript. These isoforms may have distinct functions or regulatory roles within the cell, contributing to the protein's versatility and adaptability in various biological contexts.

## Function
The ZSWIM8 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating actin dynamics and RNA stability in human cells. ZSWIM8 is involved in promoting linear actin filament polymerization, which is crucial for the formation of cellular structures such as filopodia. This function is conserved across species, including in human cells, where ZSWIM8 regulates actin polymerization by favoring linear over branched filaments. It forms part of a multiprotein complex with actin-regulating proteins such as Scar/WAVE, Diaphanous, and Profilin, and its activity in actin dynamics is independent of its ubiquitination function (MolinaPelayo2022The; Pelayo2022The).

In addition to its role in actin dynamics, ZSWIM8 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting intrinsically disordered region (IDR)-containing proteins for degradation. This activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs during brain development. ZSWIM8's ubiquitin ligase activity is involved in the degradation of proteins like AGO2, affecting microRNA processing and regulation, which is essential for proper brain development and cellular function (Lei2024Turnover).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the ZSWIM8 gene have been implicated in several developmental and neurological disorders. In mice, the loss of ZSWIM8 function results in significant developmental defects, including heart and lung abnormalities, growth restriction, and perinatal lethality, indicating its critical role in organogenesis and body size regulation (Jones2023Targetdirected). The gene is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates microRNA decay, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of specific microRNAs, such as miR-322 and miR-503, which are associated with growth restriction (Jones2023Targetdirected).

In the nervous system, ZSWIM8 is involved in the regulation of RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, crucial for brain development. Its deletion leads to the accumulation of intrinsically disordered region-containing proteins, resulting in neurodevelopmental defects and conditions like microcephaly (Lei2024Turnover). The gene's role in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination is also significant, with its absence causing hypomyelination and impaired oligodendrocyte function, which are critical for proper nerve function (Lei2024Turnover).

In Drosophila, the ortholog of ZSWIM8, known as pelado, is essential for actin dynamics and neurodevelopment, with mutations leading to neurodevelopmental defects (Pelayo2022The). These findings suggest that ZSWIM8 mutations or dysregulation can contribute to developmental and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ZSWIM8 is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is part of the Cdon complex, which includes proteins such as Bnip-2 and JLP, although its knockdown does not affect the stability of these proteins, suggesting a role in signal transduction rather than ubiquitination (Okumura2021ZSWIM8). ZSWIM8 interacts with Argonaute proteins, particularly AGO2, and is involved in the target-directed microRNA decay (TDMD) pathway. This interaction is crucial for the degradation of AGO proteins and subsequent miRNA decay, with ZSWIM8 forming a complex with ELOB, ELOC, and CUL3 to mediate this process (Jones2023Targetdirected; Han2020A).

ZSWIM8 also interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as ELAV1, enhancing their ubiquitination and promoting degradation, particularly under stress conditions (Lei2024Turnover). In the context of actin dynamics, ZSWIM8, also known as Pelado in Drosophila, is part of a molecular complex with actin polymerization regulators like Dia, Scar/WAVE, and Chic/Profilin, promoting linear actin filament polymerization (Pelayo2022The). These interactions highlight ZSWIM8's multifaceted role in cellular regulation.
