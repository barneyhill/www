# OR2L13

## Overview
OR2L13 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily L member 13, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in olfactory signaling, where it detects specific odor molecules and initiates signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2L13 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and has been identified in various neuronal tissues, including the substantia nigra, where it may play roles beyond olfaction, potentially influencing dopaminergic signaling. The receptor's involvement in neurological health and disease states, such as Parkinson's disease, suggests it may have broader implications in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (Grison2014Mesencephalic; Jovancevic2017Deep).

## Function
OR2L13 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in olfactory signaling, primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR2L13 is expressed in the substantia nigra (SN) of the brain, a region associated with dopaminergic neurons and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) (Grison2014Mesencephalic).

The receptor is activated by specific odorants, such as carvone enantiomers and eugenol, which trigger intracellular signaling cascades involving Gαolf proteins. This activation leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which subsequently opens cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, allowing ion influx and membrane depolarization (Grison2014Mesencephalic; Lee2018Therapeutic). OR2L13's expression in the brain suggests it may have roles beyond olfaction, potentially influencing dopaminergic signaling and contributing to the normal physiology of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons (Grison2014Mesencephalic). The receptor's activity in these neurons indicates a possible involvement in cell signaling processes that affect neurological health and disease states (Grison2014Mesencephalic).

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR2L13, encoding an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several neurological conditions due to its altered expression levels. In Parkinson's disease (PD), OR2L13 is significantly downregulated in the substantia nigra and frontal cortex, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology and associated olfactory dysfunction (Grison2014Mesencephalic; GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). This downregulation is not solely attributed to neuronal loss, indicating a more complex involvement in PD (Grison2014Mesencephalic).

In schizophrenia, OR2L13 expression is decreased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although this change is not statistically significant compared to controls (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). The expression of OR2L13 in the brain and its dysregulation in these conditions suggest it may have broader implications in neurological disorders, although the specific clinical significance of OR2L13 mutations remains unclear (Jovancevic2017Deep).

The potential involvement of OR2L13 in these diseases highlights the need for further research to explore its role as a target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. However, the identity of endogenous ligands for OR2L13 and its precise physiological functions in the brain are still unknown (Grison2014Mesencephalic).

## Interactions
OR2L13, an olfactory receptor, is involved in several interactions that influence platelet function and thrombosis. It is activated by the compound CCF0054500, which leads to the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). This phosphorylation event destabilizes and depolymerizes actin filaments in platelets, thereby reducing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation without affecting the coagulation cascade (Aggarwal2024Targeting). 

The activation of OR2L13 by CCF0054500 also increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in platelets, suggesting a role in modulating platelet signaling pathways. This activation inhibits platelet aggregation through interactions with multiple G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including P2Y12, PAR1, Thromboxane Receptor (TxR), and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptors (Aggarwal2024Targeting). 

In addition to its role in platelet function, OR2L13 is expressed in neuronal tissues, including the retina, trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and brain. Its expression is dysregulated in Parkinson's disease, indicating potential interactions within the nervous system, although specific protein interactions in this context are not well-documented (Raka2021Human; Jovancevic2017Deep).
