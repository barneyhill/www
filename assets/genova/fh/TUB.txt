# TUB

## Overview
The TUB gene encodes the TUB bipartite transcription factor, a protein that plays a critical role in transcription regulation and intracellular signaling. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a conserved carboxy-terminal tubby domain that facilitates binding to double-stranded DNA and specific membrane phosphoinositides. The TUB protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and energy metabolism, and is expressed in multiple tissues such as the retina, brain, and adipose tissue. It is particularly active in the hypothalamus, where it contributes to neuroendocrine regulation. Dysfunctions in the TUB protein are linked to obesity and neurosensory deficits, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic and sensory disorders (Santagata2001G-Protein; Mukhopadhyay2011The).

## Structure
The TUB gene encodes the TUB bipartite transcription factor, which is characterized by a unique molecular structure. The protein features a conserved carboxy-terminal tubby domain, approximately 260 amino acids in length, which is crucial for its function. This domain is structured as a closed β-barrel composed of 12 anti-parallel strands surrounding a central hydrophobic α-helix. This central helix forms the core of the protein, contributing to its stability and function (Mukhopadhyay2011The; Carroll2004Tubby).

The tubby domain is involved in binding to double-stranded DNA and specific membrane phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This interaction is facilitated by a positively charged cavity within the domain, involving conserved residues like K330, R332, R363, and N310 (Mukhopadhyay2011The). The amino-terminal region of TUB contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and has transcriptional activation activity, suggesting its role in transcription regulation (Carroll2004Tubby).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and may influence the protein's function and localization. Splice variant isoforms of TUB can result in structural and functional diversity, potentially affecting its role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation (Carroll2004Tubby).

## Function
The TUB gene encodes a protein that is part of the tubby family, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, the TUB protein is involved in transcription regulation, signal transduction, and energy metabolism. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the retina, brain, and adipose tissue, and is particularly active in the hypothalamus, where it is implicated in hypothalamic signaling and the regulation of the neuroendocrine axis (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

The TUB protein functions as a bipartite transcription factor, with its COOH-terminal domain binding to double-stranded DNA, suggesting a role in transcriptional modulation (Boggon1999Implication). It is also involved in G-protein signaling, where it translocates from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in response to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, linking GPCR signaling to gene expression regulation (Santagata2001G-Protein).

In adipose tissue, TUB is upregulated during adipocyte differentiation and is involved in insulin signaling, highlighting its role in energy metabolism and body weight regulation (Mukhopadhyay2011The). The protein's dysfunction is associated with obesity and neurosensory deficits, as observed in tubby mice (Mukhopadhyay2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUB gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting sensory functions and metabolism. In humans, TUB is a candidate gene influencing body weight, with polymorphisms linked to obesity (Mukhopadhyay2011The). Mutations in the TUB gene can lead to maturity-onset obesity, blindness, and deafness, as observed in tubby mice, which exhibit progressive obesity, insulin resistance, and altered metabolism (Mukhopadhyay2011The). 

In a consanguineous Chinese family, a novel homozygous mutation in the TUB gene was associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). This mutation affects the tubby domain, crucial for protein conformation and function, and is predicted to be deleterious (Xu2023A). The study challenges the previous classification of this variant as 'likely benign' due to its association with the RP phenotype (Xu2023A).

The TUB gene has also been implicated in essential tremor (ET), a common adult-onset movement disorder. A study identified a significant enrichment of rare nonsynonymous TUB variants in individuals with ET, suggesting that these variants are risk factors for the condition (Sailani2020Candidate). The TUB gene's involvement in thyroid hormone and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in the cerebellum may contribute to its role in ET (Sailani2020Candidate).

## Interactions
The TUB protein, also known as the TUB bipartite transcription factor, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and intracellular signaling. TUB is known to interact with src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, such as PLCγ, in response to insulin signaling. This interaction is facilitated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of TUB, which is necessary for its association with these proteins, suggesting its role as an adaptor protein linking the insulin receptor to downstream signaling pathways (Kapeller1999Tyrosine).

TUB also exhibits nuclear localization, where it binds specifically to double-stranded DNA, indicating a potential role in transcription regulation. The COOH-terminal domain of TUB binds avidly to DNA, suggesting that TUB may define a new class of DNA-binding proteins (Boggon1999Implication). The amino-terminal region of TUB has been shown to activate transcription when fused to a DNA-binding domain, further supporting its role in transcriptional regulation (Carroll2004Tubby).

Additionally, TUB interacts with Gαq, a subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, facilitating its translocation from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, which may be involved in transcriptional regulation (Carroll2004Tubby). These interactions highlight TUB's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
