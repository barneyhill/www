# OR52E8

## Overview
OR52E8 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily E member 8, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. Expressed predominantly in the olfactory epithelium, the OR52E8 protein plays a significant role in the olfactory system by binding to specific odor molecules, thereby contributing to the diversity and specificity of odor perception. The receptor is particularly noted for its interaction with HMHA, a human-specific odorant, although it exhibits a relatively low binding affinity (Natsch2020The). The gene is located on chromosome 11p15 and is part of a family of olfactory receptors that are up-regulated, highlighting its importance in olfactory processes (Yin2021Potential).

## Function
OR52E8 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR52E8 is specifically expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odor detection by binding to specific odorants. The receptor has been identified to respond specifically to HMHA, a human-specific odorant, although it has a relatively low affinity with an EC50 of around 100 µM (Natsch2020The).

The function of OR52E8 in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its role in olfactory transduction, a process that involves the conversion of chemical signals from odorants into electrical signals in the brain, resulting in the perception of smell. This receptor is also implicated in the perception of human sweat odors, as suggested by studies linking it to chemicals with a carboxylic acid group (Achebouche2022Application). The gene is located on chromosome 11p15 and is part of the up-regulated olfactory receptors family, indicating its active role in olfactory processes (Yin2021Potential).
