# HBD

## Overview
The HBD gene encodes the hemoglobin subunit delta, a crucial component of the hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2) variant found in adult red blood cells. This gene plays a significant role in the formation of the hemoglobin A2 tetramer, which consists of two alpha and two delta chains. The delta-globin chain, distinguished by its unique amino acid sequence, contributes to the structural and functional diversity of hemoglobin variants. The protein is categorized as a globin, a type of protein involved in oxygen transport. The delta subunit's structural features, including its alpha helices and specific amino acid residues, are essential for its stability and function in oxygen transport and its antisickling properties (Sen2004Crystal). Mutations in the HBD gene can lead to conditions such as delta-thalassemia, affecting hemoglobin composition and clinical diagnosis of thalassemia syndromes (Giardine2020Clinically; Moradi2021In).

## Structure
The HBD gene encodes the delta subunit of hemoglobin, which is a component of the hemoglobin A2 variant found in adult red blood cells. The primary structure of the delta-globin chain differs from the beta-globin chain at 10 amino acid sites, contributing to its unique properties (Sen2004Crystal). The secondary structure of the delta-globin chain includes alpha helices, which are crucial for its stability and function (Kasmi2021Analysis).

The tertiary structure of the delta-globin chain involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide, which is essential for its interaction with other hemoglobin subunits. Specific residues, such as Glu26δ, Arg116δ, and Met126δ, form stabilizing interactions and nonpolar contacts that enhance the thermal stability of hemoglobin A2 (Sen2004Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, the delta-globin chain assembles with two alpha chains to form the hemoglobin A2 tetramer. This assembly is characterized by additional hydrogen bonds at the δ1δ2 interface, which contribute to the stability of the homotetrameric structure compared to other hemoglobin variants (Sen2004Crystal). The δ-globin chain's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in oxygen transport and its antisickling properties (Sen2004Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HBD gene, which encodes the delta subunit of hemoglobin, can lead to conditions such as delta-thalassemia. This condition is characterized by reduced or absent production of the delta globin chain, affecting hemoglobin composition and potentially leading to mild anemia (Giardine2020Clinically). Variants in the HBD gene can result in decreased levels of Hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2), which is crucial for differentiating between α- and β-thalassemia carriers in clinical settings (Moradi2021In). 

In the Iranian population, several HBD gene variants have been identified, including HBD: c.82G>T and HBD: c.92+5G>T, which are the most frequent. These variants are associated with decreased Hb A2 levels and are classified as likely benign or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (Moradi2021In). The presence of δ-globin gene mutations can complicate the diagnosis of β-thalassemia by altering the expected hemoglobin profile, as seen in a case study of a Syrian patient with β-thalassemia intermedia (Moassas2019Hb). 

The HbVar database provides a comprehensive resource for understanding the clinical implications of HBD gene variants, aiding in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of hemoglobinopathies (Giardine2020Clinically).
