# NPR3

## Overview
NPR3 is a gene that encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor 3, a transmembrane receptor primarily involved in the clearance of natriuretic peptides such as ANP, BNP, and CNP. Unlike other natriuretic peptide receptors, NPR3 lacks a guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain, which distinguishes its function as a clearance receptor rather than a signaling receptor (Potter2005Natriuretic; Pereira2013Natriuretic). The receptor plays a significant role in cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by modulating blood pressure and fluid balance through the internalization and degradation of natriuretic peptides (Wong2015Natriuretic). NPR3 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and vasculature, and is involved in regulating local concentrations of natriuretic peptides, impacting processes such as vasodilation and neurotransmitter release (Matsukawa1999The; AnandSrivastava2005Natriuretic). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, where genetic variations can influence blood pressure regulation and disease risk (Cronjé2023Genetic; Kuang2017Association).

## Structure
The natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein characterized by a large extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail composed of 37 amino acids (Potter2005Natriuretic; Pereira2013Natriuretic). The extracellular domain (ECD) of NPR3 is approximately 450 amino acids long and is involved in binding natriuretic peptides such as ANP, BNP, and CNP (AnandSrivastava2005Natriuretic). The ECD has a bilobal protein fold with membrane-distal and membrane-proximal domains and forms a dimer in both free and ligand-bound forms (Pereira2013Natriuretic).

NPR3 lacks a guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain, distinguishing it from other natriuretic peptide receptors (Pereira2013Natriuretic). It is primarily involved in the clearance of natriuretic peptides through internalization and degradation (Potter2005Natriuretic). The protein is glycosylated and contains disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability (Potter2005Natriuretic).

The NPR3 gene can produce splice variant isoforms, which may alter the protein's function or localization. The protein undergoes common post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for its function.

## Function
Natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) functions as a clearance receptor for natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). It plays a crucial role in cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by modulating blood pressure and fluid balance. NPR3 binds to these peptides, facilitating their internalization and degradation, which is essential for maintaining normal circulatory homeostasis and providing an optimal response to cardiac stress or injury (Wong2015Natriuretic; Wang2018MicroRNA143).

NPR3 is widely expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, heart, and vasculature, and is involved in regulating local NP concentrations. This regulation affects processes such as urine concentration, blood volume, and blood pressure (Matsukawa1999The). In addition to its clearance function, NPR3 is involved in cell signaling pathways, such as the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, which impacts intracellular signaling and physiological processes like vasodilation and neurotransmitter release (AnandSrivastava2005Natriuretic).

The receptor's activity is modulated by various factors, including microRNAs, which can influence its expression and function, potentially impacting cardiovascular health and disease (Wong2015Natriuretic; Wang2018MicroRNA143).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPR3 gene have been linked to various cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. The NPR3 gene encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor C, which is involved in the clearance of natriuretic peptides, playing a crucial role in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular protection. Genetic variations in NPR3, such as the rs2270915 polymorphism, have been associated with changes in systolic blood pressure levels, although not directly linked to essential hypertension risk in some populations (Kuang2017Association).

NPR3 has also been implicated in cardiovascular diseases through its role in modulating natriuretic peptide levels. Reduced NPR3 function is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and stroke, potentially due to its effects on blood pressure and other cardiometabolic factors (Cronjé2023Genetic). Additionally, NPR3 genetic variations have been linked to left ventricular dysfunction and coronary artery disease risk (Abuzaanona2017Pharmacogenomics).

In metabolic contexts, NPR3 is a target of miR-146a, influencing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Alterations in NPR3 expression can affect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, linking it to conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes (Roos2020miR146a). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NPR3 in cardiovascular and metabolic health.

## Interactions
Natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the natriuretic peptide family. NPR3 specifically binds to musclin, a skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor, which competes with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) for binding to this receptor. Musclin exhibits a stronger binding affinity to NPR3 than ANP, suggesting a significant competitive interaction that may influence the local or systemic concentrations of ANP (Kita2009Competitive).

NPR3 functions as a clearance receptor for natriuretic peptides, lacking the guanylyl cyclase domain necessary for signal transduction. This receptor is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume by modulating the bioavailability of natriuretic peptides through its interactions (Kita2009Competitive).

The receptor also participates in signaling pathways by interacting with the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP system. NPR3, also known as NPR-C, is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through Gi proteins, which results in decreased cAMP levels. This interaction is crucial for various physiological processes, including the modulation of cell proliferation and contractile force generation (AnandSrivastava2005Natriuretic).
