# GRHL1

## Overview
The GRHL1 gene encodes the grainyhead-like transcription factor 1, a member of the grainyhead-like family of transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. This protein is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues and is integral to maintaining their structural and functional integrity. As a transcription factor, GRHL1 binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and chromatin accessibility, thereby influencing processes such as skin barrier formation and wound healing. Additionally, GRHL1 has been implicated in tumor suppression, particularly in the context of skin cancers, where its expression is often reduced. The protein's activity is modulated by various signaling pathways, including the EGFR-ERK pathway, which influences its nuclear translocation and function (Ming2018Structural; Kotarba2021Transcription; He2021EGFRERK).

## Function
The GRHL1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, including the epidermis, oral and olfactory epithelium, kidneys, urogenital tract, stomach, digestive tract, heart, and lungs (Kotarba2021Transcription). GRHL1 is involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of epithelial tissues by regulating the expression of genes critical for cell adhesion, such as desmoglein-1 (DSG1), which is important for desmosome organization (Ming2018Structural; Sundararajan2020Spotlight).

The protein product of GRHL1 functions in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs as a dimer, recognizing sequences like AACCGGTT, to modulate gene expression (Ming2018Structural). This DNA-binding activity is facilitated by its highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which shares structural similarities with the tumor suppressor p53, although GRHL1 does not form tetramers like p53 (Ming2018Structural). GRHL1's role extends to regulating chromatin accessibility, which is crucial for cellular differentiation and maintaining the epithelial state (Sundararajan2020Spotlight). Through these molecular activities, GRHL1 contributes to processes such as skin barrier formation, wound healing, and potentially acts as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Ming2018Structural; Kotarba2021Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GRHL1 gene have been implicated in various skin disorders and cancers. GRHL1 is identified as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin. In Grhl1-null mice, there is an increased progression from benign papillomas to malignant SCC, suggesting that GRHL1 loss accelerates this transition (Mlacki2014Loss). The absence of GRHL1 is associated with a compromised epidermal barrier, leading to increased expression of inflammatory markers and genes linked to cancerous transformation, such as S100A8 and S100A9 (Mlacki2014Loss).

In human non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and SCC, there is a significant reduction in GRHL1 expression compared to healthy tissue. This reduction may be regulated by the oncogenic microRNA miR-21, which is known to be induced by UV irradiation, a risk factor for NMSC (Kikulska2018Coordinated). GRHL1 mutations are also found in other cancers, such as stomach adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, where they are generally loss-of-function, impairing its tumor suppressive functions (Kotarba2020Grainyheadlike). These findings suggest that GRHL1 plays a critical role in maintaining skin integrity and its loss or altered expression can contribute to cancer susceptibility.

## Interactions
GRHL1, a transcription factor, engages in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its regulatory functions. In lung cancer cells, GRHL1 binds to the promoter regions of cell cycle-related genes such as CDC27, RAD21, CDC7, and ANAPC13, enhancing their transcription. This binding is sequence-specific, as mutations in these sequences prevent GRHL1 from increasing promoter activity (He2021EGFRERK). The EGFR-ERK signaling pathway activates GRHL1, promoting its nuclear translocation, which is crucial for its function. Phosphorylation at Ser76 by ERK is essential for this translocation and subsequent gene transcription (He2021EGFRERK).

In neuroblastoma, GRHL1 acts as a tumor suppressor and is negatively regulated by MYCN and HDAC3. MYCN and HDAC3 physically colocalize at the GRHL1 promoter, repressing its transcription. HDAC inhibitors can increase GRHL1 expression by enhancing histone H4 pan-acetylation at its promoter (Fabian2014GRHL1Acts). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that MYCN facilitates the recruitment of HDAC3 to the GRHL1 promoter, indicating a cooperative interaction between these proteins in repressing GRHL1 transcription (Fabian2014GRHL1Acts). These interactions highlight GRHL1's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on cancer progression.
