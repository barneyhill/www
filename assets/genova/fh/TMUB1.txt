# TMUB1

## Overview
TMUB1, or transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system and in cancer biology. The TMUB1 protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like domain and multiple transmembrane domains, classifying it as a transmembrane protein. It plays a crucial role in the recycling of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors in neurons, which is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity. Additionally, TMUB1 is implicated in regulating locomotor activity and wakefulness, as well as in centrosome assembly during cell cycles. In the context of cancer, TMUB1 interacts with proteins such as PD-L1 and STAT1, influencing immune evasion and cell proliferation, respectively. Alterations in TMUB1 expression have been associated with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential target for immunotherapy (Zhang2010Transmembrane; Yang2008Transmembrane; Shi2022Promoting; Chen2019Transmembrane).

## Structure
The TMUB1 protein, also known as HOPS, is characterized by a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and three transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function and localization within the cell (Castelli2019HOPSTMUB1; Yang2008Transmembrane). The protein is encoded by a gene that produces three isoforms: the long isoform (lHOPS), the short isoform (sHOPS), and an intermediate isoform (iHOPS). These isoforms arise from alternative translation initiation and regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Castelli2019HOPSTMUB1).

TMUB1's primary structure includes a conserved luminal domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as ERLIN1 and ERLIN2, forming complexes crucial for cellular processes (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The protein's secondary and tertiary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available literature, but its transmembrane nature suggests a configuration that spans cellular membranes, likely involving alpha-helical regions typical of transmembrane proteins (Yang2008Transmembrane).

Post-translational modifications of TMUB1 include ubiquitination, which plays a role in its interaction with other proteins and cellular pathways, such as the regulation of PD-L1 in tumor immunotherapy (Shi2022Promoting). The protein's quaternary structure involves its participation in multimeric complexes, particularly with ERLIN scaffolds and RNF170, which are essential for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

## Function
TMUB1, also known as transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. It is involved in the recycling of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors to the cell surface in neurons, which is crucial for maintaining synaptic transmission and plasticity. TMUB1 facilitates the recycling of internalized GluR2, thereby maintaining the synaptic surface number of GluR2-containing AMPARs, which is essential for basal synaptic transmission (Yang2008Transmembrane). 

TMUB1 is also implicated in regulating locomotor activity and wakefulness, as demonstrated in knockout mice studies where its deletion resulted in increased locomotor activity and wakefulness during the dark phase (Zhang2010Transmembrane). The protein interacts with CAMLG, a calcium modulating cyclophilin ligand, suggesting a role in calcium signal transduction and receptor recycling (Zhang2010Transmembrane).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, TMUB1 is involved in centrosome assembly during cell cycles and is overexpressed during liver regeneration, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation and regeneration processes (Zhang2010Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMUB1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low TMUB1 expression is associated with larger tumor sizes, poorer differentiation, and more advanced TNM stages, leading to a poorer prognosis. Patients with reduced TMUB1 levels tend to have shorter tumor-free and overall survival times, suggesting that TMUB1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in HCC (Chen2019Transmembrane).

In breast and gastric cancers, high TMUB1 expression correlates with increased PD-L1 levels, which may facilitate immune evasion by tumors. This interaction is linked to worse clinical outcomes, as TMUB1 stabilizes PD-L1 by inhibiting its degradation, thus promoting cancer progression (Shi2022Promoting). TMUB1's role in regulating PD-L1 suggests it as a potential target for immunotherapy, as its knockdown can enhance antitumor immune responses (Shi2022Promoting).

TMUB1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, influencing its stability and apoptotic functions. Alterations in TMUB1 expression can destabilize p53, potentially contributing to malignant progression, particularly in colon and central nervous system neoplasms (Castelli2019HOPSTMUB1; Ferracchiato2021HopsTmub1).

## Interactions
TMUB1, or transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with CAMLG (calcium modulating cyclophilin ligand), identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. TMUB1 and CAMLG co-localize in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in receptor trafficking and membrane trafficking of specific receptors (Zhang2010Transmembrane).

In the context of cancer, TMUB1 interacts with PD-L1, a protein involved in immune evasion by tumor cells. TMUB1 stabilizes PD-L1 by inhibiting its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the E3 ligase HUWE1. This interaction enhances PD-L1's stability and glycosylation, promoting immune escape in cancer cells (Shi2022Promoting). TMUB1's interaction with PD-L1 is crucial for its role in modulating antitumor immunity, as evidenced by studies showing that TMUB1 knockdown reduces PD-L1 levels and enhances T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells (Shi2022Promoting).

TMUB1 also interacts with STAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it regulates STAT1 expression and affects cell proliferation. Overexpression of TMUB1 increases STAT1 mRNA and protein levels, while knockdown decreases them, indicating a regulatory role in cancer cell proliferation (Chen2019Transmembrane).
