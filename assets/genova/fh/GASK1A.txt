# GASK1A

## Overview
GASK1A is a gene that encodes the protein golgi associated kinase 1A, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a kinase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. Golgi associated kinase 1A is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it is implicated in the regulation of protein trafficking and modification. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of interest due to their potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which has been linked to various cellular functions and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
