# H4C12

## Overview
H4C12 is a gene that encodes the histone protein H4 clustered histone 12, a fundamental component of the nucleosome core particle. Histone H4 is integral to the structural organization of chromatin, facilitating the packaging of DNA within the nucleus and playing a pivotal role in gene regulation. As a core histone, H4 is involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, thereby contributing to genome stability and cellular function. The protein is characterized by a conserved histone fold domain, which is essential for its interaction with other histones to form the nucleosome. Post-translational modifications of histone H4, such as acetylation and methylation, are crucial for modulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression. The expression and function of H4C12 have been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including aging and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining chromatin integrity and its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Ribeiro2024Integration; Hekmatshoar2024The; Murzina2008Structural).

## Structure
The H4C12 gene encodes a histone H4 protein, which is a key component of the nucleosome core particle. Histone H4 proteins have a highly conserved primary structure characterized by a histone fold domain, which is essential for their role in chromatin structure and function. The histone fold domain facilitates the formation of the nucleosome by allowing H4 to interact with other histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H3, to form an octamer around which DNA is wrapped (Murzina2008Structural).

In terms of secondary structure, the H4 histone tail, particularly residues 16-20, has a strong propensity to form an alpha-helical structure. This conformation is crucial for binding to the acidic patch of nucleosomes, which is important for chromatin compaction (Yang2011Structure). The tertiary structure of histone H4 involves interactions with histone chaperones like RbAp46, where the C-terminal amphipathic helix of H4 binds to specific hydrophobic and charged patches on RbAp46 (Murzina2008Structural).

Histone H4 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including acetylation and methylation. Acetylation of lysine 16 (K16) on the H4 tail affects chromatin structure by reducing the alpha-helical propensity and destabilizing interactions with the nucleosomal acidic patch, leading to chromatin unfolding (Yang2011Structure).

## Function
H4C12 encodes a histone protein, specifically histone H4, which is a core component of the nucleosome. Histones are essential for DNA packaging within the nucleus, facilitating chromatin structure and gene regulation. Histone H4 plays a crucial role in processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, impacting cellular function and genome stability. In the context of human aging, H4C12 has been identified as a significant feature in models integrating methylation, gene expression, and histology data, particularly in lung tissues. The depletion of histones, including H4C12, has been observed during human aging, suggesting its involvement in maintaining chromatin integrity and function over time (Ribeiro2024Integration). However, the specific roles of H4C12 in healthy human cells remain less understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions and contributions to cellular and organismal biology (Hekmatshoar2024The).

## Clinical Significance
The H4C12 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. It is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and alcoholism, with significant associations in the respective pathways, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis or progression of these conditions (Auwul2021Bioinformatics). In the context of cancer, H4C12 expression is notably affected in colorectal cancer cell lines. Folic acid treatment in SW480 colorectal cancer cells led to a significant decrease in H4C12 expression, indicating that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation might influence its expression and potentially impact cancer progression (Zsigrai2022Folic). In triple-negative breast cancer, H4C12 expression is decreased following treatment with olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, suggesting its involvement in the metabolic pathways affected by the drug and its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Hekmatshoar2024The). Additionally, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma, H4C12 is upregulated following the knockdown of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), highlighting its possible role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Shi2023Dihydroorotate).
