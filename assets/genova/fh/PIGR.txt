# PIGR

## Overview
The PIGR gene encodes the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in mucosal immunity. This receptor is primarily responsible for the transcytosis of polymeric immunoglobulins, such as dimeric IgA and polymeric IgM, across epithelial cells to mucosal surfaces. The PIGR protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which contains five immunoglobulin-like domains essential for ligand binding, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain that includes sorting signals for transcytotic pathways (Asano2011Polymeric; Baker2015Immunoglobulin). The receptor undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which enhance its function and facilitate the release of the secretory component into luminal secretions (Kaetzel1997The; Baker2015Immunoglobulin). PIGR's role in immune defense is critical, as it helps maintain mucosal homeostasis and provides a barrier against pathogens (Asano2011Polymeric; Turula2018The).

## Structure
The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the transport of polymeric immunoglobulins across epithelial cells. The primary structure of PIGR consists of an extracellular region of 620 amino acids, a 23-amino acid transmembrane region, and a 103-amino acid cytoplasmic region (Asano2011Polymeric; Baker2015Immunoglobulin). The extracellular region includes five immunoglobulin-like domains, which are crucial for ligand binding and contain internal disulfide bonds that contribute to the stability of the receptor (Asano2011Polymeric; Kaetzel1997The).

The secondary structure of PIGR features an α-helical transmembrane region, which is highly conserved and may play a role in signal transduction (Baker2015Immunoglobulin). The cytoplasmic domain contains sorting signals essential for directing the receptor through the transcytotic pathway (Apodaca1991The).

Post-translational modifications of PIGR include N-linked glycosylation, which enhances its immune functions and facilitates transcytosis (Baker2015Immunoglobulin). The receptor undergoes proteolytic cleavage, releasing the secretory component (SC) into luminal secretions, either in free form or complexed with IgA (Kaetzel1997The). The PIGR gene is located on chromosome 1 and can undergo alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms (Asano2011Polymeric).

## Function
The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity by facilitating the transcytosis of polymeric immunoglobulins, specifically dimeric IgA (dIgA) and polymeric IgM (pIgM), across epithelial cells to mucosal surfaces. This process is essential for maintaining mucosal homeostasis and providing a first line of defense against pathogens (Asano2011Polymeric; Turula2018The). PIGR is expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, where it binds to dIgA and pIgM, internalizes them, and transports them to the apical surface. There, the receptor is cleaved, releasing secretory IgA (SIgA) and free secretory component (SC) into the lumen (Asano2011Polymeric; Phalipon2003Novel).

SIgA plays a critical role in immune exclusion by neutralizing pathogens and preventing their adherence to mucosal surfaces, thus protecting the epithelial barrier (Turula2018The; Phalipon2003Novel). The secretory component of PIGR enhances the stability and localization of SIgA within the mucus layer, acting as a microbial scavenger and neutralizing toxins (Turula2018The). PIGR-mediated transport of SIgA is also involved in maintaining mucosal homeostasis by modulating immune responses and shaping the composition of the commensal microbiota (Johansen2011Regulation).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins that facilitate its role in immune function. PIGR interacts with the small GTPase Rab3b in the apical recycling endosome, where Rab3b in its GTP-bound form prevents transcytosis by directing PIGR to recycle. Upon binding of polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) to PIGR, Rab3b hydrolyzes its GTP and dissociates, allowing the PIGR-pIgA complex to be transcytosed to the apical surface (Baker2015Immunoglobulin).

PIGR also interacts with Rab3D in lacrimal gland acinar cells, where it may act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab3D, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This interaction is crucial for Rab3D's role in vesicle trafficking, and the GTP-bound form of Rab3D is incapable of interacting with PIGR (Evans2008Direct). The interaction between PIGR and Rab3D is modulated by the GTP-bound status of Rab3D, with physiological signaling pathways such as carbachol stimulation influencing this interaction (Evans2008Direct).

Additionally, PIGR interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase p62 YES, which activates phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) upon binding of pIgA, leading to downstream signaling events that promote transcytosis (Baker2015Immunoglobulin).
