# IFT140

## Overview
IFT140 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 140 protein, a critical component of the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A). This protein is integral to the retrograde transport within cilia, which are essential cellular structures involved in signaling and movement. The IFT140 protein is characterized by its β-propeller domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for its function in the IFT-A complex (Taschner2012Architecture). It plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of cilia by aiding in the transport of proteins along microtubules into and out of the cilium (Schmidts2013Combined). Mutations in the IFT140 gene are linked to various ciliopathies, including Mainzer-Saldino syndrome and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Sharova2023Rare; Schmidts2013Combined).

## Structure
IFT140 is a protein that is part of the IFT-A complex, which plays a crucial role in retrograde intraflagellar transport. The molecular structure of IFT140 includes a predicted β-propeller at the N-terminus, followed by another potential β-propeller, indicating that its primary structure contains sequences forming these β-propeller domains. These domains are common motifs in proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Taschner2012Architecture).

The secondary structure of IFT140 is characterized by these β-propellers, which contribute to its ability to interact with other proteins. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these β-propellers into a compact, stable form, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not extensively documented (Taschner2012Architecture).

There is no mention of a quaternary structure for IFT140, which would involve the assembly of multiple protein subunits. The protein's function is linked to its interaction with other proteins, such as TRPV4, which is involved in skeletal dysplasias and kidney ciliary signaling (Schmidts2013Combined). The presence of multiple WD40 repeats in IFT140 suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, which is consistent with its involvement in the IFT-A complex (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated).

## Function
IFT140 is a protein that plays a critical role in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically as a component of the IFT-A complex. This complex is essential for retrograde transport within cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells involved in signaling and movement (Schmidts2013Combined). IFT140 is crucial for the formation and maintenance of cilia, as it facilitates the transport of proteins synthesized in the cell body along microtubules into and out of the cilium (Schmidts2013Combined).

In healthy cells, IFT140 is involved in the localization of the TRPV4 calcium channel to the cilium, which is important for mechanosensory functions, particularly in renal cilia (Schmidts2013Combined). It is also essential for the development and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segments in the retina, where it aids in the transport of opsin through the connecting cilium (Crouse2014Distinct). The protein localizes to centrosomes and is involved in the proper functioning of cilia, which is critical for various cellular processes (Schmidts2013Combined).

Mutations in IFT140 can lead to ciliopathies, disorders characterized by defects in ciliary function, affecting multiple organ systems due to the widespread presence of cilia (Schmidts2013Combined).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT140 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in cilia. These conditions include Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MSS), Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), and Sensenbrenner syndrome (cranioectodermal dysplasia, CED), among others. MSS is characterized by cone-shaped epiphyses, early renal failure, and retinal dystrophy, while JATD involves skeletal abnormalities and early progressive kidney disease (Sharova2023Rare; Schmidts2013Combined). CED is marked by craniofacial, skeletal, ectodermal, liver, and renal anomalies, with IFT140 mutations being a rare cause (WalczakSztulpa2020Compound).

IFT140 mutations can also lead to non-syndromic retinal degenerative disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), expanding the known phenotype spectrum beyond syndromic ciliopathies (Xu2015Mutations). These mutations are often hypomorphic, meaning they partially reduce the protein's function, leading to varying degrees of disease severity (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated). The gene's role in intraflagellar transport is crucial for ciliary function, and its deficiency can result in severe conditions like cystic kidney disease and retinal degeneration (Schmidts2013Combined).

## Interactions
IFT140 is a core component of the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A) and is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for ciliary function. It interacts with several proteins, including known ciliary proteins like TULP3 and NUDC. The interaction between IFT140 and NUDC remains stable despite missense mutations, suggesting NUDC's role in the correct folding of IFT140 (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated). IFT140 also interacts with SYNJ2, which may play a role in membrane trafficking and signal transduction, and SMG9, implicated in brain, heart, and eye development (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated).

The IFT140 protein is part of a stable core complex with IFT122 and IFT144, essential for the stability of the IFT-A components (Zhu2017Functional). It has been shown to interact with TULP3, a protein involved in hedgehog signaling, with certain mutations in IFT140 leading to varying degrees of disruption in this interaction (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated). The interaction with TULP3 is crucial for the trafficking of components necessary for hedgehog signaling, such as Gpr161 (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated).

IFT140 does not tightly associate with IFT complex B proteins, as demonstrated by its lack of co-precipitation with these proteins in immunoprecipitation assays (Follit2009Characterization).
