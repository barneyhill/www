# RIPOR1

## Overview
RIPOR1, also known as RHO family interacting cell polarization regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell polarity and motility. The RIPOR1 protein interacts with RHO GTPases and other cytoskeletal components, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as migration and shape maintenance. It is categorized as a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein, contributing to the regulation of cell polarity and directional migration. RIPOR1 is significant in various biological contexts, including immune cell migration, neuronal development, and lung function, where it influences tissue repair, neural connectivity, and pulmonary health. Its involvement in immune-related pathways and association with diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Kachuri2019Immunemediated; Riboldi2022Transcriptome; Liang2021FAM65A).

## Function
RIPOR1, also known as RHO family interacting cell polarization regulator 1, is involved in regulating cell polarity and motility. It interacts with RHO GTPases, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell shape. RIPOR1 plays a significant role in immune cell migration and neuronal development, impacting processes like tissue repair and neural connectivity. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it contributes to the regulation of cell polarity and directional migration (Liang2021FAM65A).

In the context of lung function, RIPOR1 has been identified as a gene associated with the FEV1/FVC ratio, a measure of pulmonary function. This association suggests that RIPOR1 may play a role in maintaining proper lung function, potentially through its involvement in cell polarity and migration, which are critical for the structural integrity of lung tissues (Kachuri2019Immunemediated). Additionally, RIPOR1 is part of a gene expression signature for atopy, indicating its involvement in immune-related functions, which may further influence pulmonary health and susceptibility to conditions like lung cancer (Kachuri2019Immunemediated). These functions highlight the importance of RIPOR1 in both cellular and organismal processes, particularly in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to environmental challenges.

## Clinical Significance
RIPOR1, also known as FAM65A, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell polarity and migration. Alterations in RIPOR1 expression have been associated with several types of cancer. In particular, RIPOR1 is differentially expressed in tumor versus non-tumor tissues across multiple cancer types, and its expression is linked to the prognosis of colorectal cancer, where it is highly expressed (Liang2021FAM65A). The gene's expression is also correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) infiltration in several tumors, suggesting its involvement in tumor microenvironment interactions (Liang2021FAM65A).

In the context of lung cancer, RIPOR1 is associated with lung function traits, such as the FEV1/FVC ratio, which are linked to lung cancer susceptibility. Genetic variants in RIPOR1 have been identified as part of immune-mediated pathways that may contribute to pulmonary function impairment and increase lung cancer risk, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (Kachuri2019Immunemediated).

RIPOR1 is also involved in neurodegenerative disorders, as indicated by its differential expression in Parkinson's disease related to GBA mutations. This suggests a role in pathways related to neuroinflammation and cellular processes such as autophagy (Riboldi2022Transcriptome).

## Interactions
RIPOR1, also known as FAM65A, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell polarization and migration by interacting with various proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. It is known to interact with RHO family GTPases, such as RHOA, which are pivotal in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is essential for the modulation of cellular motility and the maintenance of cell shape.

RIPOR1 also associates with Myosin II, a motor protein that is integral to muscle contraction and cellular movement. This interaction influences the organization of actin filaments, which are critical components of the cytoskeleton. By modulating the activity of Myosin II, RIPOR1 contributes to the dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton necessary for cell migration.

Additionally, RIPOR1 interacts with Filamin A, a protein that crosslinks actin filaments and is involved in stabilizing the cytoskeletal network. This association further underscores RIPOR1's role in regulating actin filament organization and cellular motility. Through these interactions, RIPOR1 is a key regulator of the processes that govern cell movement and structural integrity.
