# TLR5

## Overview
The TLR5 gene encodes the Toll-like receptor 5 protein, a type I transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system. This receptor is primarily involved in recognizing bacterial flagellin, a component of bacterial flagella, and is crucial for initiating immune responses against bacterial infections. TLR5 is predominantly expressed on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, but it is also found in other tissues such as the heart, brain, spleen, kidney, and testis, indicating its broad role in host defense (Gewirtz2001Cutting). Structurally, TLR5 consists of an extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor domain, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Zhou2012Tolllike; Xu2019The). The receptor forms asymmetric homodimers, which are necessary for its activity, even in the absence of its ligand (Zhou2012Tolllike). TLR5's ability to distinguish between pathogenic and commensal bacteria is vital for preventing unnecessary inflammation, particularly in the gut, and it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including Crohn's disease and metabolic disorders (Gewirtz2001Cutting; Leifer2014Linking).

## Structure
The human Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the immune response, primarily recognizing bacterial flagellin. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: an extracellular domain (ECD) composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain (Zhou2012Tolllike; Xu2019The). The ECD of TLR5 is responsible for flagellin recognition and is characterized by a horseshoe-like structure typical of LRR domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Rout2021Insights).

The tertiary structure of TLR5 forms a curved LRR domain, which is crucial for its function in binding flagellin (Song2017A). TLR5 functions as a dimer, forming asymmetric homodimers through ectodomain interactions even in the absence of its ligand, flagellin (Zhou2012Tolllike). This dimerization is essential for its role in signal transduction.

Post-translational modifications of TLR5 include glycosylation, with seven predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, five of which have been experimentally confirmed. These glycosylation sites are fully exposed on the surface, away from the dimer interface, and are crucial for the protein's stability and function (Zhou2012Tolllike).

## Function
TLR5 (Toll-like receptor 5) is a protein that plays a critical role in the innate immune system by recognizing bacterial flagellin, a component of bacterial flagella. It is primarily expressed on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, where it detects flagellin and initiates proinflammatory gene expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway (Gewirtz2001Cutting). This activation is crucial for the immune response, as it leads to the secretion of cytokines like IL-8, which attract neutrophils to the site of infection (Gewirtz2001Cutting).

TLR5's ability to distinguish between pathogenic and commensal bacteria is essential for preventing unnecessary inflammation in tissues densely populated by commensal bacteria (Gewirtz2001Cutting). The receptor requires both its extracellular leucine-rich repeat and intracellular Toll/IL-1R homology domains to function properly, and mutations in these regions can impair its ability to signal in response to flagellin (Gewirtz2001Cutting).

In addition to its role in the intestines, TLR5 is expressed in other tissues, including the heart, brain, spleen, kidney, and testis, indicating its broad role in host defense (Gewirtz2001Cutting). TLR5 also contributes to maintaining immune homeostasis and has been implicated in enhancing vaccine efficacy and promoting tissue regeneration (Lim2024Mucosal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TLR5 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. A non-synonymous coding variant, rs5744174, in the TLR5 gene is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). This variant, specifically the risk allele 616F, leads to increased production of the inflammatory chemokine CCL20 in response to bacterial flagellin, suggesting a role in CD pathogenesis (Sheridan2013A). TLR5 deficiency can result in significant changes in the gut microbiota, leading to chronic intestinal inflammation and metabolic syndrome. TLR5-deficient mice exhibit altered microbiome diversity and increased susceptibility to inflammation, which can be transferred to wildtype germfree hosts, indicating the microbiome's role in these conditions (Leifer2014Linking).

The TLR5 392STOP mutation results in a truncated protein that reduces immune response to flagellin, linked to a protective effect against obesity but an increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes in certain populations (Leifer2014Linking). In mice, the absence of TLR5 in intestinal epithelial cells leads to low-grade inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and increased susceptibility to colitis, highlighting the importance of TLR5 in maintaining gut homeostasis (Chassaing2014Intestinal). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TLR5 in inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
TLR5 (Toll-like receptor 5) is known for its role in recognizing bacterial flagellin and initiating immune responses. It forms an asymmetric homodimer through ectodomain interactions, even in the absence of its ligand, flagellin. This dimerization is crucial for its function in the immune system (Zhou2012Tolllike; Berglund2015The). TLR5 interacts with the adaptor protein MyD88, which is essential for downstream signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hussain2020TLR5; Tahoun2017Host).

TLR5 also participates in a heteromeric complex with TLR4, enhancing MyD88-dependent signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in modulating TLR4 signaling, particularly in response to environmental lung injuries (Hussain2020TLR5). The interaction between TLR5 and TLR4 does not affect TLR4 internalization but promotes the assembly of the Myddosome at the plasma membrane, which is crucial for signaling (Hussain2020TLR5).

The structural analysis of TLR5 has revealed that it contains glycosylation sites on its surface, with a glycosylation-free face where the TLR5-TLR5 dimer interface and the ligand binding site are located (Berglund2015The). These interactions and structural features are essential for TLR5's role in the immune response.
