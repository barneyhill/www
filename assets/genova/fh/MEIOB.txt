# MEIOB

## Overview
MEIOB is a gene that encodes a meiosis-specific protein known as meiosis specific with OB-fold, which plays a pivotal role in meiotic recombination. This protein is characterized by its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain, which facilitates its function as a single-stranded DNA-binding protein with exonuclease activity. MEIOB is essential for the stabilization of recombination intermediates and the facilitation of crossover formation during meiosis, processes that are crucial for genetic diversity and fertility (Luo2013MEIOB; Souquet2013MEIOB). The protein forms a complex with SPATA22 and the replication protein A (RPA) heterotrimer, underscoring its role in meiotic recombination (Guo2020The). Mutations in the MEIOB gene have been associated with reproductive disorders such as azoospermia and primary ovarian insufficiency, highlighting its significance in human reproductive health (Guo2020The). Additionally, MEIOB has been identified as a cancer/testis antigen, suggesting potential implications in cancer therapy (Shiohama2014Identification).

## Structure
MEIOB is a meiosis-specific protein characterized by the presence of an OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding) domain, which is a common nucleic acid-binding motif. This domain is located in the central region of the protein, spanning amino acids 167-272, and is crucial for its single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding and exonuclease activities (Luo2013MEIOB). The OB fold is a compact, barrel-like structure that interacts with ssDNA, and mutations within this domain, such as R235, are essential for DNA binding (Luo2013MEIOB).

MEIOB forms a complex with SPATA22 and the replication protein A (RPA) heterotrimer, indicating its quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins (Guo2020The). This complex is crucial for its function in meiotic recombination, as it stabilizes recombination intermediates and facilitates crossover formation (Guo2020The). MEIOB's interaction with RPA suggests it may act as a paralog of RPA, specifically required for meiotic recombination (Souquet2013MEIOB).

The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, as evidenced by the critical role of serine 67 in its function, where its absence leads to phenotypes similar to a complete knockout (Guo2020The).

## Function
The MEIOB gene encodes a meiosis-specific protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic recombination, a process essential for fertility and genetic diversity. MEIOB functions as a single-stranded DNA-binding protein with exonuclease activity, which is vital for the progression of meiosis and the production of viable germ cells (Luo2013MEIOB; Souquet2013MEIOB). It forms a heterodimer with SPATA22, and their protein stability is interdependent (Guo2020The). MEIOB is involved in the later stages of meiotic recombination, particularly in the second-end capture, which is necessary for crossover formation (Luo2013MEIOB). This process is crucial for the reciprocal exchange of genetic information between parental chromosomes, ensuring proper chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis (Souquet2013MEIOB; Guo2020The).

MEIOB localizes to single-stranded DNA sites on meiotic chromosomes, particularly at recombination initiation sites, and overlaps with RPA, RAD51, and DMC1 foci (Souquet2013MEIOB). It is not required for the recruitment of RAD51/DMC1 to double-strand break sites but is essential for stabilizing recombination intermediates after strand invasion (Guo2020The). The absence of MEIOB leads to meiotic arrest and infertility, highlighting its critical role in meiotic recombination and fertility (Luo2013MEIOB; Souquet2013MEIOB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEIOB gene have been linked to several reproductive disorders. In humans, a missense mutation (N64I) in MEIOB is associated with azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen, leading to male infertility. This mutation results in protein degradation and reduced crossover formation, although mice with the same mutation remain fertile despite meiotic defects (Guo2020The). Frame-shift mutations in MEIOB have also been identified as causes of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and azoospermia, highlighting its role in human reproductive health (Guo2020The).

MEIOB functions in a dosage-sensitive manner, with protein levels correlating with the severity of meiotic defects. Reduced MEIOB protein abundance due to mutations can lead to increased apoptosis in spermatocytes and impaired spermatogenesis (Guo2020The). The gene's interaction with SPATA22 is crucial, as their stability is interdependent, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to meiotic failure (Luo2013MEIOB; Huang2021Meiotic).

Alterations in MEIOB expression have also been observed in cancer cells, where it is identified as a cancer/testis antigen. Its expression is enhanced in cancer cells following treatment with demethylating agents, suggesting potential as a target for cancer vaccine therapy (Shiohama2014Identification).

## Interactions
MEIOB is a meiosis-specific protein that plays a critical role in homologous recombination by interacting with several other proteins and nucleic acids. MEIOB forms a complex with SPATA22 and the replication protein A (RPA) complex, which is essential for meiotic recombination. This complex is involved in coating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and facilitating the capture of the second homologue end during recombination (Luo2013MEIOB; Ribeiro2018MEIOB). MEIOB and SPATA22 share structural similarities with RPA subunits, specifically RPA1 and RPA2, and interact through C-terminal OB-fold containing domains (Ribeiro2018MEIOB).

The interaction between MEIOB and SPATA22 is crucial for their function, as disruption of this interaction leads to meiotic failure and sterility in mice (Xu2020A). The D383 residue in MEIOB is essential for its interaction with SPATA22, and mutation of this residue disrupts the interaction, leading to the degradation of both proteins and meiotic arrest (Xu2020A). MEIOB also binds to ssDNA and exhibits exonuclease activity, which is important for processing recombination intermediates (Luo2013MEIOB). These interactions highlight MEIOB's role in stabilizing recombination intermediates and ensuring proper meiotic progression.
