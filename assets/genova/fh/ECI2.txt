# ECI2

## Overview
ECI2, or enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the crotonase superfamily, characterized by its role in fatty acid metabolism. The ECI2 protein functions as an enzyme that catalyzes the isomerization of unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA molecules, a critical step in the beta-oxidation pathway, which occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. This enzymatic activity is essential for the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units, thereby contributing to cellular energy production. Structurally, the ECI2 protein is a trimer with a unique acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) domain at its N-terminus, which is not present in yeast homologs. This domain is thought to enhance the enzyme's catalytic efficiency by facilitating substrate capture and delivery. ECI2's activity is particularly significant in energy-demanding tissues such as muscle and liver, supporting metabolic flexibility and energy homeostasis (Onwukwe2015Human; Němejcová2021A).

## Structure
The human ECI2 protein, encoded by the ECI2 gene, is a member of the crotonase superfamily and exhibits a canonical crotonase fold. This fold is characterized by two parallel beta-sheets, with the central beta-sheet providing a structural framework (Onwukwe2015Human). The protein is typically assembled as a trimer, with each subunit contributing to the overall structure (Onwukwe2015Human). 

A unique feature of the human ECI2 is the presence of an 80-residue acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) domain at its N-terminus, which is not found in yeast ECI2. This domain is connected to the isomerase domain by a linker region and adopts a four-helical bundle fold (Onwukwe2015Human). The ACBP domain protrudes from the central isomerase trimer, as shown by small angle X-ray scattering (Onwukwe2015Human).

The active site of ECI2 is located near the thioester moiety at the N-terminal end of helix-3, with Glu245 serving as the catalytic base (Onwukwe2015Human). Helix-10, a C-terminal helix, covers the active site and interacts with the substrate's phosphate moieties, playing a crucial role in catalysis (Onwukwe2015Human). The protein's quaternary structure is a highly flattened trimer, with the ACBP domains located at the periphery, indicating no cross-talk between ACBP domains from different chains (Onwukwe2015Human).

## Function
ECI2 (enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism, specifically within the beta-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the isomerization of unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA molecules, which is a key step in their breakdown into acetyl-CoA units. This process occurs in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, contributing significantly to energy production in cells (Němejcová2021A).

In healthy human cells, ECI2 facilitates the re-entry of enoyl-CoA into the beta-oxidation cycle, which is essential for the efficient metabolism of fatty acids. This function is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, as the acetyl-CoA units produced are further processed in the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Němejcová2021A).

The activity of ECI2 is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as muscle and liver, where fatty acid oxidation is a major source of energy. By enabling the conversion of unsaturated fatty acids into forms that can be fully oxidized, ECI2 supports the metabolic flexibility of cells, allowing them to adapt to varying energy requirements and substrate availability (Němejcová2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ECI2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). ECI2 is identified as a tumor-suppressive gene, and its expression is notably downregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, including larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and increased metastasis. High levels of ECI2 expression correlate with better disease-free and overall survival rates in CRC patients (Chen2024The; LI2023Lipid).

ECI2 plays a crucial role in inhibiting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, which is linked to cancer progression. By suppressing ether lipid metabolism-mediated IL-8 transcription, ECI2 reduces NETosis, thereby inhibiting CRC proliferation and metastasis. Silencing ECI2 leads to increased NET formation and cancer cell invasion, while its overexpression has the opposite effect (Chen2024The; LI2023Lipid).

In prostate cancer, ECI2 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. It is one of the androgen receptor target genes, and its overexpression correlates with EZH2 expression, although its exact role in clinical outcomes remains unclear (Dundr2020HNF1B).

## Interactions
ECI2, or enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 2, is involved in lipid metabolism and has been studied for its interactions with other proteins. ECI2 does not physically interact with AGPS directly, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Instead, it affects the interaction between AGPS and the PTS2 receptor PEX7, inhibiting the peroxisomal localization of AGPS, which is crucial for ether lipid metabolism (Chen2024The). This disruption in AGPS localization by ECI2 leads to reduced ether lipid production, impacting processes such as neutrophil extracellular trap formation and colorectal cancer progression (LI2023Lipid).

In structural studies, ECI2 has been shown to form trimeric structures in solution, with its acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) domain extending away from the core isomerase domain. This domain does not physically interact with other ACBP domains within the trimer, suggesting a highly flattened trimeric structure (Onwukwe2015Human). The ACBP domain may enhance catalytic proficiency by capturing substrates and delivering them to the isomerase domain, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Onwukwe2015Human). These studies focus on the structural and catalytic properties of ECI2 rather than direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids.
