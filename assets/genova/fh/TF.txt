# TF

## Overview
The TF gene encodes the protein transferrin, a glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in iron transport and homeostasis in the human body. Transferrin is primarily synthesized in the liver and functions by binding ferric iron (Fe3+) in a soluble form, facilitating its safe transport to various tissues, including the bone marrow, where it is crucial for red blood cell production (Yu2020Hepatic; Kawabata2019Transferrin). Structurally, transferrin is characterized by two lobes, each capable of binding an iron ion, and it interacts with transferrin receptors on cell surfaces to mediate iron uptake (AsadaSenju2002Molecular; Lawrence1999Crystal). This interaction is essential for maintaining systemic iron balance and preventing the toxic accumulation of free iron, which can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage (Li2002Transferrintransferrin). The TF gene and its protein product are also implicated in various clinical conditions, including hereditary hypotransferrinemia and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring their significance in human health (AsadaSenju2002Molecular; Robson2004Synergy).

## Structure
The human transferrin (TF) protein is a glycoprotein primarily involved in iron transport. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with approximately 679 amino acids. The secondary structure of transferrin includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of transferrin is characterized by two distinct lobes, each capable of binding one iron ion. These lobes are crucial for the protein's role in iron transport and regulation (AsadaSenju2002Molecular).

Transferrin undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is essential for its stability and function in the bloodstream. These modifications play a role in the protein's ability to bind and release iron ions effectively (AsadaSenju2002Molecular).

The protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. However, its interaction with the transferrin receptor (TfR) is critical for iron uptake in cells. The binding of transferrin to TfR facilitates the transport of iron into cells, where it is released in the endosome upon acidification (Lawrence1999Crystal). The structure and function of transferrin are integral to maintaining iron homeostasis in the human body.

## Function
Transferrin (TF) is a glycoprotein primarily synthesized in the liver, playing a crucial role in systemic iron homeostasis by binding ferric iron (Fe3+) in a soluble, non-toxic form and delivering it to various tissues, including the bone marrow, where it supports erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells (Yu2020Hepatic; Kawabata2019Transferrin). The cellular uptake of transferrin-bound iron is mediated by the transferrin receptor Tfr1, which is ubiquitously expressed. Once transferrin binds to Tfr1, the complex is internalized, and iron is released into the cytosol following endosomal acidification (Yu2020Hepatic).

In healthy human cells, transferrin prevents the accumulation of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which can be toxic, and plays a protective role in maintaining liver function and iron homeostasis (Yu2020Hepatic). Transferrin's role extends to preventing oxidative stress by regulating iron levels, as free iron can catalyze the formation of harmful free radicals (Li2002Transferrintransferrin). The protein is active in the blood and extracellular fluid, impacting overall iron metabolism and storage, and is essential for preventing ferroptosis-induced liver damage (Yu2020Hepatic). Transferrin also has the potential to transport a wide range of metal ions, including therapeutic and diagnostic metal ions (Li2002Transferrintransferrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the transferrin (TF) gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Hereditary hypotransferrinemia, a rare disorder characterized by severe anemia and growth retardation, results from extremely low levels of serum transferrin. This condition can be caused by mutations in the TF gene, such as a GAA to AAA transition at codon 394, leading to a nonconservative amino acid change that affects the protein's iron-binding capacity (AsadaSenju2002Molecular).

In neurodegenerative diseases, TF gene variants have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The TF C2 variant, in combination with the HFE C282Y allele, significantly increases the risk of AD, potentially due to iron misregulation and oxidative stress in neurons (Robson2004Synergy). Similarly, a haplotype in the TF gene has been associated with a decreased risk of PD, suggesting a protective role against iron accumulation in the brain (Rhodes2014Pooled).

Alterations in TF expression and its interaction with other iron metabolism genes can also influence the risk and progression of these diseases, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining iron homeostasis (Lehmann2012Transferrin).

## Interactions
Transferrin (TF) is a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in iron transport and homeostasis. It interacts with transferrin receptors (TfR1 and TfR2) on cell surfaces to facilitate iron uptake. The interaction between transferrin and the transferrin receptor is complex, involving multiple domains of both proteins. The primary receptor recognition site on transferrin involves both the C-lobe and N-lobe, with the C1 domain making the most contact with TfR. The apical domain of TfR interacts with the N1 and C1 domains of transferrin, while the protease-like and helical domains may also participate (Li2002Transferrintransferrin).

Transferrin can also participate in multiprotein complexes related to iron metabolism. For instance, the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE binds to the helical domain of TfR, suggesting overlapping binding sites for transferrin and HFE. This indicates that HFE can effectively compete with iron-bound transferrin for binding to TfR, despite high physiological concentrations of iron-bound transferrin (Bennett2000Crystal). These interactions are influenced by pH changes, which may affect the affinity of TfR for different forms of transferrin (Li2002Transferrintransferrin).
