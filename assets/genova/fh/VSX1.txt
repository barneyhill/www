# VSX1

## Overview
The VSX1 gene encodes the visual system homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of the vertebrate retina. This protein is characterized by a paired-type homeodomain and a CVC domain, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities and potential protein-protein interactions (Passini1998Cloning). VSX1 is involved in regulating gene expression during retinal development and is negatively regulated by its paralog Chx10 (Clark2008Negative). Mutations in the VSX1 gene have been associated with ocular disorders such as keratoconus and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2023Clinical; Valleix2006H244R). The protein's interaction with other genes, such as tal1 in zebrafish, underscores its importance in developmental processes (Zhang2020Zygotic).

## Structure
The VSX1 protein is characterized by a paired-type homeodomain and a CVC domain. The homeodomain, spanning amino acids 151-210, is crucial for DNA binding and is highly conserved across species, with only a single amino acid difference between zebrafish and goldfish orthologues (Passini1998Cloning). Adjacent to the homeodomain is the CVC domain, which extends from amino acids 211-271. Although the specific function of the CVC domain is not fully understood, it is suggested to play a role in protein-protein interactions and may act as a DNA binding domain similar to the RED domain in the paired-box (Passini1998Cloning).

The VSX1 protein also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of a sequence of positively charged amino acids (QKRKK), which overlaps with the homeodomain and is essential for its nuclear import (Kurtzman2001Ubc9). The protein includes conserved motifs such as an octapeptide sequence (FAITDLLG) and a hexapeptide motif (PSHIPI), which are common in other homeobox genes (Passini1998Cloning). The interaction with Ubc9, a SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme, facilitates the nuclear localization of VSX1 through a nonenzymatic mechanism independent of SUMO-1 modification (Kurtzman2001Ubc9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VSX1 gene have been linked to several ocular conditions, most notably keratoconus and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD). Keratoconus is characterized by progressive thinning and protrusion of the cornea, leading to visual impairment. Various studies have identified VSX1 mutations, such as p.G160V, p.L17V, and p.Leu268His, as potentially contributing to the development of keratoconus, although the pathogenicity of these mutations is not fully confirmed (Shetty2015Two; Zhang2023Clinical; Mok2008VSX1). The VSX1 gene is also associated with PPCD, a disorder affecting the corneal endothelium, and has been linked to macular dystrophy and selective cone ON bipolar cell dysfunction (Valleix2006H244R).

The phenotypic variability observed in conditions associated with VSX1 mutations may be influenced by genetic modifiers or environmental factors, complicating the genotype-phenotype correlation (Valleix2006H244R). Additionally, VSX1 mutations have been implicated in a broader spectrum of abnormalities, including craniofacial malformations and central nervous system defects, indicating a wider phenotypic impact than previously recognized (Valleix2006H244R).

## Interactions
VSX1, a transcription factor, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence gene expression. In the vertebrate retina, VSX1 is negatively regulated by its paralog Chx10 (also known as Vsx2). Chx10 binds directly to the Vsx1 promoter, acting as a transcriptional repressor. This interaction is crucial for maintaining distinct expression patterns of these genes during retinal development (Clark2008Negative). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have confirmed Chx10's binding to specific sites on the Vsx1 promoter, highlighting the sequence-dependent nature of this interaction (Clark2008Negative).

In zebrafish, VSX1 interacts with the tal1 gene by directly binding to its promoter, repressing its transcription. This interaction is essential for the proper specification of V2a interneurons, as VSX1 prevents ectopic tal1 expression in these cells. The binding of VSX1 to the tal1 promoter has been demonstrated through chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, confirming its role in regulating tal1 expression (Zhang2020Zygotic). These interactions underscore the importance of VSX1 in the regulation of gene expression during development.
