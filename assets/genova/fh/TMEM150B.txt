# TMEM150B

## Overview
TMEM150B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 150B, also known as damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM3). This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily involved in the regulation of macroautophagy, a critical cellular process for maintaining homeostasis and energy balance. TMEM150B is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in the accumulation of autophagosomes and enhancement of autophagic flux, which are essential for cell survival, particularly under stress conditions such as glucose deprivation (Fu2019Genetic; Shao2019Variation). The gene has been implicated in reproductive health, with genetic variations linked to early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in humans (Fu2019Genetic; Shao2019Variation). Despite these associations, studies in mice suggest that TMEM150B is not critical for oocyte maturation or female fertility, indicating a complex role that warrants further investigation (Liu2020TMEM150B).

## Function
TMEM150B, also known as damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM3), is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in modulating macroautophagy in human cells. It is involved in the accumulation of autophagosomes under basal conditions and enhances autophagic flux, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and energy balance (Fu2019Genetic). TMEM150B expression can repress cell death and promote long-term clonogenic survival of cells, particularly under conditions of glucose deprivation, by inducing autophagy (Shao2019Variation). This protein is typically located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis (Fu2019Genetic).

The gene is also associated with reproductive health, as it has been linked to early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in humans. Genetic variations in TMEM150B, such as certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified in genome-wide association studies and are strongly associated with early menopause, highlighting its role in the timing of menopause onset (Fu2019Genetic; Shao2019Variation). Despite its association with these conditions in humans, studies in mice suggest that TMEM150B is not essential for oocyte maturation or female fertility (Liu2020TMEM150B).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM150B gene has been associated with several reproductive conditions, particularly those related to ovarian function. It is linked to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by the loss of ovarian activity before the age of 40, leading to infertility and increased risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis (Shao2019Variation). TMEM150B is also associated with early menopause, with several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as being strongly linked to this condition (Fu2019Genetic; Thasneem2022Genes). These SNPs, including rs11668344, are located in intronic regions and are predicted to have weak enhancer and repressor activities (Chen2014Metaanalysis).

Despite its association with these conditions, studies in mice suggest that TMEM150B is not essential for female fertility, as its deletion did not affect oocyte maturation or follicle development (Liu2020TMEM150B). This indicates that while TMEM150B is linked to reproductive conditions in humans, its precise role and the impact of its mutations or altered expression levels require further investigation to fully understand its clinical significance.
