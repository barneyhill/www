# TMEM35B

## Overview
TMEM35B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 35B, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in cellular signaling and membrane protein interactions, playing a critical role in maintaining normal neurological function. The TMEM35B gene is of particular interest due to its implications in various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders. Research into TMEM35B focuses on understanding its function and the mechanisms by which mutations in this gene contribute to disease, with the aim of developing therapeutic strategies to address these genetic alterations (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the TMEM35B gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. These genetic changes can lead to conditions such as intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders. The gene's role in cellular signaling and membrane protein interactions is crucial for maintaining normal neurological function. Disruptions in these processes due to TMEM35B mutations can result in significant clinical manifestations, highlighting the gene's importance in brain development and function. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which TMEM35B mutations contribute to these disorders is an ongoing area of research, with the potential to inform therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of these genetic alterations.
