# OXCT2

## Overview
The OXCT2 gene encodes the enzyme 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 2, which is a key player in the metabolic pathway of ketolysis. This enzyme is categorized as a CoA-transferase and is primarily involved in the conversion of ketone bodies into acetyl-CoA within the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues. This process is crucial for energy production, especially during periods of low carbohydrate availability, as it allows for the utilization of fat-derived energy. The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart and brain. In addition to its metabolic role, the OXCT2 gene has been linked to male fertility, with mutations potentially affecting sperm function and contributing to infertility (H2018Male; Onishi2004Gene).

## Function
The OXCT2 gene encodes the enzyme 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 2, which plays a crucial role in the metabolic process of ketolysis. This process occurs in the mitochondria of many extrahepatic organs and involves the conversion of the ketone body acetoacetate into acetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential for utilizing fat-derived energy, particularly during periods when carbohydrates are scarce or cannot be effectively utilized (Onishi2004Gene). The enzyme is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it facilitates energy production by transferring CoA from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate, forming acetoacetyl-CoA. This activity is vital for energy production in tissues such as the heart and brain, especially during low glucose availability (Onishi2004Gene).

In humans, the OXCT2 gene is expressed in various tissues, contributing to the energy metabolism necessary for normal cellular function. The gene's role in ketone body metabolism underscores its importance in maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress. The enzyme's activity supports the energy needs of cells by enabling the use of ketone bodies as an alternative energy source, thus playing a significant role in overall organismal energy balance (Onishi2004Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OXCT2 gene, which encodes the testis-specific succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, have been implicated in male infertility. The SCOT-T enzyme, encoded by OXCT2, is crucial for ketone body metabolism in the testis, particularly in spermatids and the midpiece of ejaculated sperm. Studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SCOT-T gene are more prevalent in infertile males compared to fertile controls, suggesting that these genetic variations may impair enzyme activity and contribute to infertility (H2018Male). Specifically, SNPs causing amino acid changes, such as the c.854T/G SNP at amino acid 285 (L285R), have been found to be significantly more common in infertile individuals, indicating a potential causative role in male infertility (H2018Male).

The alterations in the SCOT-T gene may affect the enzyme's succinyl CoA transferase activity, which is essential for normal sperm function and spermiogenesis. This disruption in enzyme activity could lead to impaired energy metabolism in sperm cells, thereby affecting male fertility (H2018Male). The findings highlight the importance of SCOT-T in maintaining normal reproductive function and suggest that genetic variations in OXCT2 could be a contributing factor to infertility in males (H2018Male).
