# THAP12

## Overview
THAP12 is a gene that encodes the THAP domain containing 12 protein, which is a member of the THAP (Thanatos-associated protein) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved THAP domain, which is a zinc finger-like domain involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The THAP12 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell proliferation, through its role in transcriptional regulation. It is also involved in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for cellular signaling and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). The precise mechanisms by which THAP12 influences these pathways are still under investigation, highlighting its potential importance in understanding cellular homeostasis and disease.
