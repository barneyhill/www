# TMA16

## Overview
TMA16 is a gene that encodes the protein translation machinery associated 16 homolog, which is a conserved protein found in eukaryotes, including humans. This protein plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the assembly and export of pre-60S ribosomal particles, which are essential precursors to the large subunit of the ribosome. TMA16 functions as a nuclear export adapter, interacting with various ribosome biogenesis and export factors, such as Crm1/XPO1, to facilitate the proper maturation and export of ribosomal subunits. Its involvement in these processes underscores its critical role in maintaining efficient protein synthesis within cells, thereby influencing cellular function and health (Liang2020Structural).

## Structure


## Function
TMA16 is a conserved protein in eukaryotes, including humans, that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and export. It is involved in the assembly and export of pre-60S ribosomal particles, which are precursors to the large subunit of the ribosome. TMA16 interacts physically or genetically with several ribosome biogenesis and export factors, such as Crm1/XPO1, in both yeast and human cells (Liang2020Structural). The protein is identified as a component of pre-60S ribosomal particles, binding between the rotated 5S RNP and the P0 stalk, and may act as a nuclear export adapter, stabilizing these particles during nuclear export (Liang2020Structural).

TMA16's association with pre-60S particles is tightly regulated, occurring after the 5S RNP rotation and before the departure of GTPBP4, suggesting its role in the maturation and export of ribosomal subunits (Liang2020Structural). The interaction between TMA16 and ribosomal particles is stabilized by GTPBP4, enhancing the stacking pair between TMA16 and ribosomal RNA, which is essential for protein synthesis in cells (Liang2020Structural). These interactions highlight TMA16's importance in ensuring the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, impacting overall cellular protein production and organismal health.
