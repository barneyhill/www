# MLLT10

## Overview
The MLLT10 gene, also known as AF10, encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor and plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein, referred to as MLLT10 histone lysine methyltransferase DOT1L cofactor, is characterized by several domains, including a LAP/PHD-finger region, a nuclear localization signal, and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins involved in gene regulation (Hagen2014Characterization). MLLT10 acts as a cofactor for the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, aiding in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79, a crucial modification for the transcription of developmental genes and maintenance of genomic stability (Deutsch2020MLLT10; Ogoh2017Mllt10). The gene is implicated in various leukemias through chromosomal translocations, leading to the formation of oncogenic fusion proteins that disrupt normal hematopoietic processes (Forgione2020MLLT10).

## Structure
The MLLT10 gene, also known as AF10, encodes a protein that is 1027 amino acids long and functions as a putative transcription factor. The protein has several distinct domains, including an N-terminal LAP/PHD-finger region, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), an AT-hook domain capable of binding cruciform DNA, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal Q-rich domain (Hagen2014Characterization). The coiled-coil domain, spanning amino acids 755-796, is particularly significant as it is involved in interactions with other proteins such as GAS41 and hDOT1L, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation and leukemogenesis (Hagen2014Characterization; Zhou2021Structural).

The AF10 protein forms a left-handed supercoil with DOT1L, characterized by hydrophobic interactions primarily involving isoleucine and leucine residues, and hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the complex (Zhou2021Structural). The AF10-DOT1L interaction is essential for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79, a modification important for the transcription of developmental genes like HOXA in acute leukemia (Zhou2021Structural).

The AF10 protein also includes a PZP motif, an octapeptide motif, and a leucine zipper (OM-LZ) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and contribute to its role in chromatin remodeling (Zhou2021Structural). The coiled-coil domain's interaction with inhibitory peptides has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy in leukemia, as these peptides can disrupt the AF10-DOT1L interaction and downregulate HOXA gene expression (Zhou2021Structural).

## Function
The MLLT10 gene, also known as AF10, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. MLLT10 functions as a cofactor for the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, which is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79). This epigenetic modification is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression patterns (Deutsch2020MLLT10; Ogoh2017Mllt10).

MLLT10 is involved in recruiting DOT1L to target genes, facilitating the methylation of H3K79, which is important for genomic stability and the regulation of hematopoiesis. It interacts with various proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as GAS41, TIP60, and IKAROS, which are crucial for gene expression regulation and the DNA damage response (Deutsch2020MLLT10). MLLT10 also plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of specific target genes, including those in the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, and is recruited to TCF/b-catenin target genes in a b-catenin-dependent manner (Deutsch2020MLLT10).

In the context of somatic cell reprogramming, MLLT10 acts as a barrier by regulating DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation, maintaining the epigenetic landscape that prevents the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (UğurluÇimen2021AF10).

## Clinical Significance
The MLLT10 gene is implicated in various leukemias through chromosomal translocations, leading to the formation of fusion proteins that contribute to oncogenesis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly T-lineage ALL (T-ALL), MLLT10 rearrangements (MLLT10r) are significant. The KMT2A-MLLT10 fusion is the most common MLLT10r in B-ALL and AML, accounting for 80% of new MLLT10r diagnoses in AML. This fusion involves complex rearrangements due to the opposing transcriptional orientations of KMT2A and MLLT10 (Forgione2020MLLT10). 

In T-ALL, the PICALM-MLLT10 fusion is prevalent, often associated with the early thymic precursor (ETP) immunophenotype, a high-risk subgroup. MLLT10r T-ALL can present at various differentiation stages, from ETP-ALL to more mature TCR-positive phenotypes. While MLLT10r does not generally increase the risk of central nervous system disease, it is linked to poor outcomes in certain subgroups, such as ETP and TCR-negative phenotypes (Forgione2020MLLT10).

MLLT10 rearrangements lead to the upregulation of the HOXA gene cluster and other genes involved in chromatin assembly and DNA repair, contributing to genome instability and leukemic transformation (Forgione2020MLLT10). The PICALM-MLLT10 fusion also interacts with JAK1, driving pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling through JAK-STAT and NF-κB pathways (Forgione2020MLLT10).

## Interactions
MLLT10, also known as AF10, is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. A key interaction is with DOT1L, the only known histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase in humans. MLLT10 acts as a coactivator of DOT1L, facilitating the methylation of H3K79, which is essential for the activation of target gene expression (Deutsch2020MLLT10; Forgione2020MLLT10). This interaction is critical in both normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, where aberrant recruitment of DOT1L by MLLT10 fusions leads to the activation of leukemic genes (Forgione2020MLLT10).

MLLT10 also interacts with other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as GAS41, TIP60, and IKAROS. These interactions are important for maintaining genomic stability and proper hematopoietic development (Deutsch2020MLLT10). The protein contains several domains, including the octapeptide motif-leucine zipper (OM-LZ) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with DOT1L and other partners like IKAROS and GAS41 (Deutsch2020MLLT10).

Additionally, MLLT10 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it is required for the transcription of TCF/β-catenin target genes, potentially through the recruitment of DOT1L for histone methylation (Deutsch2020MLLT10). These interactions highlight MLLT10's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and its implications in leukemia.
