# CASP3

## Overview
The CASP3 gene encodes the protein caspase-3, a critical executioner caspase in the apoptosis pathway, which is a form of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and development. Caspase-3 is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a pivotal role in the execution phase of apoptosis by cleaving various cellular substrates, leading to the dismantling of the cell. The gene is located on chromosome 4 in humans and is expressed in various tissues, where it is involved in processes such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. The regulation of CASP3 is complex, involving post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins and microRNAs, which can influence its activity and stability. Mutations and alterations in CASP3 have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers, where they may contribute to tumorigenesis by allowing the survival of cells that evade apoptosis (Salvesen2008Caspase; Soung2004Somatic).

## Structure
Caspase-3 (CASP3) is a crucial executioner protease in the apoptosis pathway. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain that undergoes cleavage to form active subunits. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stable conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these subunits into a stable conformation, essential for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure of CASP3 is formed by the assembly of two large and two small subunits into a heterotetramer, which is necessary for its function as an executioner caspase (Salvesen2008Caspase).

CASP3 contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which is involved in the activation and regulation of the enzyme. This domain plays a role in the interaction with other proteins in the apoptotic pathway. CASP3 is often regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability (Salvesen2008Caspase).

Splice variants of CASP3 can lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, potentially affecting its role in apoptosis and other cellular processes. These structural features and modifications are critical for the precise regulation of CASP3 activity in apoptosis (Salvesen2008Caspase).

## Function
Caspase-3 (CASP3) is a critical execution-phase caspase involved in the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in mammalian cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development by eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells (Soung2004Somatic). Caspase-3 is activated in a protease cascade, often following cleavage by initiator caspases such as caspase-8 or caspase-9, leading to the cleavage of key structural proteins and enzymes involved in signaling, homeostasis, and repair (Porter1999Emerging; Kumar2006Caspase).

In healthy human cells, caspase-3 is essential for apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, which are hallmarks of apoptosis. It is required for the dismantling of the cell and the formation of apoptotic bodies (Porter1999Emerging). Caspase-3 also plays a significant role in DNA degradation, nuclear condensation, plasma membrane blebbing, and proteolysis of certain caspase substrates (Soung2004Somatic). The activation of caspase-3 is dependent on cytochrome c and Apaf-1, which are crucial for the execution phase of apoptosis (Zou1997Apaf1). The failure of apoptosis, in which caspase-3 is a key player, is a hallmark of cancer, as it allows the survival of transformed cells prone to further genetic damage (Soung2004Somatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASP3 gene, which encodes the caspase-3 protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In human tumors, somatic mutations in CASP3, including missense, silent, and intronic mutations, have been identified. These mutations are found in colon carcinomas, non-small cell lung cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, stomach carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and multiple myelomas, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis by potentially allowing the survival of transformed cells through the failure of apoptosis (Soung2004Somatic).

In breast cancer, downregulation or loss of caspase-3 expression is associated with chemoresistance. This downregulation may occur due to mechanisms such as CpG island hypermethylation or functional deletions in the CASP3 gene, leading to reduced apoptosis and contributing to cancer progression and resistance to treatment (Devarajan2002Downregulation).

CASP3 polymorphisms have also been linked to cancer risk. For instance, the rs1049253 SNP in the 3'-UTR of CASP3 affects miRNA binding, altering CASP3 expression and increasing the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Guan2012A). Additionally, CASP3 expression levels are associated with prognosis in various cancers, with overexpression linked to poor outcomes in certain types (Zhou2022A).

## Interactions
Caspase-3 (CASP3) is a key executioner in the apoptosis pathway, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate cell death. CASP3 cleaves several substrates, including GSDMD, MFN2, RNF4, and PAK2, which are not recognized by caspase-9. GSDMD is cleaved at D87, preventing pyroptosis by inhibiting membrane pore formation. MFN2 is cleaved at D499, potentially preventing mitochondrial fusion and promoting apoptosis. RNF4 is cleaved at D89 and D137, disrupting DNA repair and nucleic acid metabolism. PAK2 is cleaved at D89 and D148, activating its kinase domain to promote apoptosis (Araya2021Deorphanizing).

CASP3 is also involved in interactions with microRNAs. miR-126-5p interacts with CASP3, reducing its active form and substrate cleavage, thereby protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis. This interaction is facilitated by rapamycin, which induces the nuclear transfer of miR-126-5p, and involves the dissociation of miR-126-5p from AGO2 to bind CASP3, disrupting its dimerization (Santovito2020Noncanonical).

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) miRNAs target CASP3 by binding to its 3′-UTR, with nine EBV miRNAs binding to 13 specific locations, leading to repression of CASP3 expression. This interaction modulates apoptosis and suggests potential therapeutic applications (Harold2016EpsteinBarr).
