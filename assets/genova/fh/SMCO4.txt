# SMCO4

## Overview
SMCO4 is a gene that encodes the single-pass membrane protein with coiled-coil domains 4, a transmembrane protein characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its integration into cellular membranes. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still being elucidated. The SMCO4 protein is implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in disease mechanisms, particularly in oncology, where alterations in its expression have been associated with prognostic outcomes in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer (Shefer2023Blood; Li2019Early). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional dynamics of SMCO4 and its encoded protein in health and disease.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The SMCO4 gene has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), suppressed mRNA levels of SMCO4 are significantly correlated with higher overall survival rates in patients, suggesting its potential role in the prognosis of this disease (Li2019Early). This indicates that SMCO4 expression may be a valuable biomarker for assessing patient outcomes in CTCL.

In breast cancer, SMCO4 is part of a diagnostic panel used to differentiate untreated breast cancer patients from healthy individuals. The inclusion of SMCO4 in this panel achieves a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. However, removing SMCO4 from the panel reduces sensitivity to 89%, highlighting its importance in the early detection of breast cancer (Shefer2023Blood). The expression levels of SMCO4 in breast carcinoma cells are described as medium, with low tissue specificity, indicating its potential as a breast cancer marker.

While SMCO4 has been studied in the context of these diseases, its specific role in other conditions or its broader clinical significance remains under investigation. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of SMCO4 mutations and expression changes in various diseases.
