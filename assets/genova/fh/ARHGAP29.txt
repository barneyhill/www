# ARHGAP29

## Overview
ARHGAP29 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 29, a critical regulator of the Rho family of GTPases. This protein is categorized as a Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) and plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of RhoA, a key molecule involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein's structure includes a RhoGAP domain, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as PTPL1, to form signaling complexes (Vikkula2024Four; Tang2020Identification). ARHGAP29 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and tissue integrity, and is expressed in multiple tissues, notably in skeletal muscle and heart (KANSY2024ARHGAP29). Clinically, mutations in ARHGAP29 have been linked to non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate and its expression levels are associated with cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where it influences cell invasion and metastasis through the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway (KANSY2024ARHGAP29; Savastano2016Impact).

## Structure
ARHGAP29 encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. The protein structure of ARHGAP29 includes several important domains. It contains a RhoGAP domain, which is crucial for its function in converting active Rho-GTP to inactive Rho-GDP, particularly affecting RhoA signaling (Vikkula2024Four; Tang2020Identification). The protein also features a coiled-coil region that interacts with Rap2, a C1 domain, and a C-terminal region that interacts with PTPL1 (Tang2020Identification). The PTPL1-interaction domain is significant for linking membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and constructing signaling complexes (Vikkula2024Four).

ARHGAP29 has a strong affinity for RhoA and a weaker affinity for Rac2 and Cdc42, indicating its specificity in regulating different Rho GTPases (KANSY2024ARHGAP29). The protein also contains a cysteine-rich domain similar to the Zn2+ and diaglycerol-binding domain of the PKC family, and a ZPH region homologous to the nematode gene ZK669.1a (KANSY2024ARHGAP29). These structural features contribute to its role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, tissue integrity, and craniofacial development (Vikkula2024Four; Tang2020Identification).

## Function
ARHGAP29 is a Rho GTPase activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the RhoA GTPase, which is essential for actin cytoskeletal remodeling. This remodeling is necessary for various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and changes in cell shape (Reeb2023ARHGAP29). ARHGAP29 functions by inactivating RhoA, leading to decreased actin polymerization and contractility, which is vital for maintaining normal cell morphology and function (Reeb2023ARHGAP29).

In keratinocytes, ARHGAP29 is essential for both single and collective cell migration. Knockdown of ARHGAP29 results in impaired migration, increased cell size, and longer population doubling time, indicating its role in cell proliferation and migration (Reeb2023ARHGAP29). ARHGAP29 is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, as its reduction leads to increased population doubling time and smaller colony sizes in keratinocytes (Reeb2023ARHGAP29).

ARHGAP29 is expressed in various tissues, with high expression in skeletal muscle and heart tissue. It is involved in processes like angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration, acting as an inhibitor in the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway, which is important for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis (KANSY2024ARHGAP29).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ARHGAP29 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P), rare variants in ARHGAP29, particularly loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, have been implicated in the etiology of this congenital malformation. Studies have identified multiple pathogenic variants, including missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations, which contribute to the development of NSCL/P by disrupting normal protein function and affecting craniofacial development (Vikkula2024Four; Tang2020Identification; Savastano2016Impact).

ARHGAP29 is also involved in cancer progression. Its expression is linked to increased invasiveness in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast, renal, gastric, and prostate carcinomas. High expression levels of ARHGAP29 correlate with advanced tumor stages and lower survival rates, particularly in Luminal A-type breast cancer. The gene's role in cancer is attributed to its involvement in the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway, which affects cell migration and metastasis (Reeb2023ARHGAP29; KANSY2024ARHGAP29).

## Interactions
ARHGAP29, a Rho GTPase activating protein, participates in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family, to regulate actin dynamics and cell migration. This interaction is crucial for the RhoA-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway, which affects actin filament stabilization (Qiao2017YAP). ARHGAP29 also interacts with AKT1, a kinase in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting a role in regulating cancer cell invasion. Reduced expression of ARHGAP29 correlates with decreased AKT1 expression in breast cancer cells, indicating a potential signaling cascade between these proteins (Kolb2020Influence).

ARHGAP29 forms a complex with Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-Like 1 (PTPL1) through its PDZ domain, linking membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and constructing signaling complexes that regulate the RhoA-LIMK-cofilin pathway (Vikkula2024Four). It also interacts with RhoC, another Rho GTPase, which plays a significant role in breast cancer metastasis. Suppression of ARHGAP29 leads to reduced RhoC expression, suggesting its involvement in the ROCK-LIMK signaling pathway (KANSY2024ARHGAP29). These interactions highlight ARHGAP29's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration.
