# G2E3

## Overview
G2E3 is a gene that encodes the G2/M-phase specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and DNA damage response. This protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, characterized by its ability to tag proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. The G2E3 protein contains multiple domains, including PHD/RING and HECT domains, which contribute to its ubiquitin ligase activity, although the HECT domain is catalytically inactive. It is primarily localized in the nucleus and exhibits nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, which is essential for its function in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability. G2E3 is crucial for early embryonic development, and its inactivation can lead to embryonic lethality due to apoptosis. Additionally, alterations in the G2E3 gene have been linked to conditions such as obesity and breast cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Shen2022Comprehensive; Brooks2008G2E3; Brooks2007G2E3).

## Structure
The G2E3 protein is characterized by its complex domain architecture, which includes three N-terminal PHD/RING domains and a C-terminal HECT domain. The PHD/RING domains are involved in zinc coordination and ubiquitin ligase activity. The second PHD/RING domain (PHD/RING2) closely matches the C3XHC3 structure typical of RING domains, while the third PHD/RING domain (PHD/RING3) has a C4HC3 organization, showing features of both PHD and RING-variant domains (Brooks2008G2E3). Despite deviations from the classic RING structure, PHD/RING3 retains ubiquitin ligase activity (Brooks2008G2E3).

The HECT domain, located at the C-terminus, is typically associated with ubiquitin ligase activity, but in G2E3, it is catalytically inactive due to sequence deviations near the active site cysteine (Brooks2008G2E3). The protein also contains nuclear localization signals and a novel CRM1-independent nuclear export domain, contributing to its dynamic subcellular localization (Brooks2007G2E3). The G2E3 protein is primarily nuclear, with variable nucleolar accumulation, particularly in HeLa cells (Brooks2007G2E3). The context does not provide specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of G2E3.

## Function
The G2E3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a dual-function ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response. This protein is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, tagging proteins for degradation, particularly during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle, which is essential for proper cell division and genomic stability (Brooks2008G2E3; Brooks2007G2E3). G2E3 is characterized by its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling ability, allowing it to move between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and it is primarily localized in the nucleus with variable nucleolar accumulation (Brooks2007G2E3).

The protein contains multiple domains, including PHD/RING and HECT domains, which are involved in its ubiquitin ligase activity. The PHD/RING2 and PHD/RING3 domains are capable of catalyzing lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination, while the HECT domain is catalytically inactive (Brooks2008G2E3). G2E3's activity is crucial for early embryonic development, as its inactivation leads to embryonic lethality due to massive apoptosis (Brooks2008G2E3). The protein's expression is specific to the G2/M phase, indicating its role in mitotic regulation and the DNA damage response (Brooks2007G2E3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the G2E3 gene have been implicated in several health conditions, particularly obesity and breast cancer. In obesity, G2E3 knockout (KO) mice exhibit increased body fat and impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting that variants near the human G2E3 gene may decrease its activity, contributing to obesity. This is supported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data linking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near G2E3 to increased body mass index (BMI) and potentially type 2 diabetes (p&gt; Obesity; Powell2020&lt).

In breast cancer, G2E3 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. High G2E3 mRNA expression is associated with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), making it an independent prognostic predictor. The gene's expression is linked to cancer-related pathways such as E2F, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, and DNA repair, and is negatively associated with lymphocyte infiltration, indicating its role in tumor progression and immune evasion (Shen2022Comprehensive).

These findings suggest that G2E3 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of obesity and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Interactions
G2E3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein that interacts with various cellular components, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It has been shown to co-localize with nucleolin within nucleoli, indicating a potential interaction, although it does not associate with SUMO bodies, PML bodies, or spliceosomes (Brooks2007G2E3). G2E3 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it acts as a negative regulator of p53 activity and sustains the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway, suggesting interactions with proteins involved in these pathways (Schmidt2014Screening).

The interaction between G2E3 and the LST1 protein has been confirmed, with G2E3 potentially stabilizing LST1 in a non-enzymatic fashion or through polyubiquitination that does not lead to proteolysis (Weidle2018LST1:). G2E3's role in the ubiquitin proteasome system involves both HECT and RING-like domains, allowing it to participate in different ubiquitylation processes, which may involve interactions with various substrates and E2 enzymes (p&gt; Obesity; Powell2020&lt). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
