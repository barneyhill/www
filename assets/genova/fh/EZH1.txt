# EZH1

## Overview
The EZH1 gene encodes the enhancer of zeste 1 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit, a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. This protein functions as a histone methyltransferase, specifically catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27), a modification associated with transcriptional repression. EZH1 plays a significant role in maintaining stem cell identity and pluripotency, as well as in skeletal growth by regulating chondrocyte proliferation. Structurally, EZH1 shares a high degree of similarity with EZH2, another PRC2 component, and can form both monomeric and dimeric structures within the complex, enhancing its ability to compact chromatin. The gene's mutations have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid conditions, highlighting its importance in both normal development and disease (GraciaDiaz2023Gain; Shen2008EZH1; Lui2016EZH1).

## Structure
The EZH1 protein is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene silencing. Structurally, EZH1 contains a SET domain responsible for its histone methyltransferase activity, which is highly similar to the SET domain of EZH2, sharing 94% similarity (GraciaDiaz2023Gain). The protein's structure includes an upper catalytic lobe, comprising EZH1, EED, and the C-terminal VEFS domain of SUZ12, and a lower regulatory lobe, containing RBAP48 and the N terminus of SUZ12 (Grau2021Structures).

EZH1 can form both monomeric and dimeric structures within the PRC2 complex. The dimeric form is more effective at promoting chromatin compaction, with dimerization facilitated by interactions involving the SUZ12 subunit (Grau2021Structures). The protein's structure is characterized by flexible loops, such as the MCSS/SANT2L loop, which are crucial for nucleosome binding and methyltransferase activity (Grau2021Structures). These loops contain charged amino acids that enhance the protein's interaction with chromatin (Grau2021Structures).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, may influence EZH1's function and stability, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The structural flexibility and dimerization ability of EZH1 allow it to interact with various chromatin substrates, contributing to its role in gene regulation (Grau2021Structures).

## Function
EZH1 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing by catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) (Shen2008EZH1). This methylation leads to transcriptional repression, which is essential for maintaining stem cell identity and pluripotency (Shen2008EZH1). In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), EZH1 complements EZH2 by maintaining the H3K27me3 mark on chromatin, particularly on development-related genes, thereby safeguarding ESC identity (Shen2008EZH1). 

EZH1 is involved in both monomethylation and trimethylation of H3K27, with the former being associated with actively transcribed regions and the latter with silenced promoters (Shen2008EZH1). In the absence of EZH2, EZH1 can partially compensate by maintaining H3K27me3 marks, although its binding pattern becomes more focused at proximal promoters near transcription start sites (Shen2008EZH1). 

EZH1 is also active in skeletal growth, where it works alongside EZH2 to repress inhibitors of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, thus promoting normal bone development (Lui2016EZH1). This function is crucial for regulating the expression of growth-inhibitory factors in chondrocytes, which are essential for skeletal growth (Lui2016EZH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EZH1 gene are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and thyroid conditions. In neurodevelopmental disorders, both gain of function (GOF) and loss of function (LOF) variants in EZH1 can disrupt neurogenesis, leading to intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic features, and other developmental delays. Recessive variants, such as homozygous nonsense mutations and biallelic splice and deletion variants, result in LOF effects, while dominant variants are often heterozygous missense mutations with potential GOF effects (GraciaDiaz2023Gain). These mutations can lead to asynchronous neurogenesis, contributing to the clinical manifestations of NDDs (GraciaDiaz2023Gain).

In thyroid conditions, EZH1 mutations have been identified in autonomous thyroid adenomas (ATAs), a common cause of hyperthyroidism. A recurrent hot-spot mutation in EZH1 was found in 27% of ATAs, suggesting its significant role in these tumors. This mutation is associated with increased histone H3 trimethylation and thyroid cell proliferation, indicating a potential mechanism for tumor development (Calebiro2016Recurrent). Additionally, EZH1 mutations are more prevalent in benign or minimally invasive thyroid tumors, such as follicular adenomas and Hürthle cell adenomas, highlighting their role as early genetic events in these conditions (Jung2018Clinical).

## Interactions
EZH1 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), where it interacts with core components such as SUZ12, EED, RBBP4, and AEBP2. These interactions are crucial for the formation and function of the PRC2 complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (Shen2008EZH1). EZH1 and EZH2, although homologous, form alternative complexes within PRC2 and do not directly interact with each other. However, EZH1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous EZH2, suggesting an indirect interaction possibly mediated through EED and SUZ12 (Shen2008EZH1).

EZH1 also plays a role in nucleosome binding and methyltransferase activity. It contains a disordered loop near the SANT2L domain, which is essential for substrate binding and catalytic activity. The CXC motif of EZH1 is involved in primary contact with nucleosomal DNA, similar to EZH2 interactions (Grau2021Structures). The MS2L loop in EZH1 contributes to stronger nucleosome-binding and enhanced methyltransferase activity compared to EZH2 (Grau2021Structures).

In the absence of Jarid2, EZH1 can compensate for nucleosome-binding activity, allowing PRC2 to maintain its function. This is particularly evident in Jarid2-deficient myoblasts, where EZH1 becomes crucial for PRC2 recruitment and function (Son2013Nucleosomebinding).
