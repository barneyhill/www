# RFFL

## Overview
The RFFL gene encodes the ring finger and FYVE like domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular protein homeostasis through its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, and a FYVE-like domain, which is associated with membrane targeting. RFFL is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel, which is critical for cardiac repolarization (Roder2019Trafficking). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signaling pathways, and it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias and cancer (Roder2019Trafficking; Sun2023ETS1activated).

## Structure
RFFL is a protein characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and a FYVE-like domain. The RING finger domain is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, which is essential for processes such as protein degradation and trafficking (Roder2019Trafficking). The FYVE-like domain is similar to the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate-binding FYVE finger, which is often associated with membrane targeting (Roder2019Trafficking).

RFFL is a 363-amino-acid protein, and its structure includes an N-terminal FYVE-like domain and a C-terminal RING finger domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Roder2019Trafficking). The intact RING domain is necessary for its interaction with target proteins, such as the hERG potassium channel, and for mediating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Roder2019Trafficking).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. Splice variants of RFFL may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions or localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Sakai2019The).

## Function
The RFFL gene encodes a RING finger ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitination process. This protein is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it binds to and polyubiquitinates target proteins, marking them for proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded or excess proteins, thereby regulating various cellular functions such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and signaling pathways (Roder2019Trafficking).

In cardiac cells, RFFL regulates the trafficking of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel, which is critical for cardiac repolarization. RFFL mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of hERG, affecting the rapid delayed rectifier current (IKr) and influencing the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) (Roder2019Trafficking). This regulation is vital for proper cardiac electrophysiology and can impact cardiac conditions associated with QT interval variability.

RFFL is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular responses and organismal development. Its activity in these cellular compartments underscores its role in modulating ion channel trafficking and function, as well as its involvement in broader cellular and physiological processes (Roder2019Trafficking).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RFFL gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiac health. RFFL is a key regulator of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel, which is crucial for cardiac repolarization. Variations in RFFL expression can affect hERG levels on the cell membrane, impacting cardiac function and potentially leading to arrhythmias. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2074518, is associated with lower RFFL expression in the left ventricle, correlating with a shortened QT interval, which is a measure of cardiac electrical activity (Roder2019Trafficking).

Increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW), linked to a 50bp deletion in the Rffl gene, serves as an early risk factor for cardiovascular and renal comorbidities. This genetic alteration is associated with hematologic abnormalities and severe hypertension, suggesting a role for RFFL in cardio-renal disorders (Cheng2020Genetic).

In breast cancer, RFFL is involved in the ubiquitination of the DHX9 protein. Alterations in RFFL expression or its interaction with DHX9, mediated by LINC01016, can affect tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential role in cancer malignancy (Sun2023ETS1activated).

## Interactions
RFFL, also known as ring finger and FYVE like domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. RFFL interacts with the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel, promoting its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which affects cardiac repolarization (Roder2019Trafficking). This interaction is dependent on the RING domain of RFFL and involves the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Roder2019Trafficking).

RFFL also interacts with Rab11 effectors, such as EHD1, MICALL1, and class I Rab11-FIPs, which are crucial for the function of the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). These interactions are significant for the ubiquitination and recycling of proteins like the transferrin receptor (Sakai2019The). The RFFL-H333A mutant affects the recycling process by trapping Rab11 effectors and inhibiting their ubiquitination (Sakai2019The).

In breast cancer, RFFL interacts with the DHX9 protein, where it acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for DHX9 ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is inhibited by the long intergenic non-coding RNA LINC01016, which binds to DHX9 and prevents its degradation, thereby promoting tumor progression (Sun2023ETS1activated).
