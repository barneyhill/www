# OR1F1

## Overview
The OR1F1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily F member 1, which is part of the extensive family of olfactory receptors. These receptors are a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), known for their characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction (Centola1998Construction). The OR1F1 protein is involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the sense of smell, functioning by binding specific odorant molecules and activating intracellular signaling pathways. The gene is located in a genomic region rich in olfactory receptor genes, reflecting the evolutionary expansion and diversification of this gene family to accommodate a wide range of odorant detection (Centola1998Construction).

## Structure
The OR1F1 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, where the primary structure consists of amino acid sequences forming alpha-helices that span the cell membrane (Centola1998Construction). The molecular structure of OR1F1 includes conserved sequence motifs such as two cysteine residues, a 'MAYDRYVAIC' motif, a SY motif, and a serine residue. These motifs suggest potential sites for structural features like disulfide bonds and phosphorylation, which are common post-translational modifications in GPCRs (Centola1998Construction).

OR1F1 is predicted to have an open reading frame that aligns with the conserved translational start site for the 1F family of olfactory receptors, indicating its functional potential as a receptor (Centola1998Construction). The protein shares significant amino acid identity with other members of the 1F subfamily, such as Rat OLF-5, suggesting a conserved structure within this subfamily (Centola1998Construction). The OR1F1 gene is located in a genomic region with a high density of olfactory receptor genes, which are often organized in clusters (Centola1998Construction).
