# DENR

## Overview
The DENR gene encodes the density regulated re-initiation and release factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in translation reinitiation and ribosome recycling within human cells. This protein is characterized by its SUI1 domain, which is structurally similar to the eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1), and is involved in the initiation of translation (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1). DENR forms a heterodimeric complex with MCTS1, which is essential for the translation of mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (uORFs), thereby influencing the expression of oncogenes and stress response genes (Bohlen2020DENR). The DENR•MCTS1 complex also facilitates the recycling of post-termination 40S ribosomes, enhancing translation efficiency (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1). Clinically, alterations in DENR expression or mutations have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in cellular proliferation and potential as a therapeutic target (Young202140S; Chen2022DENR).

## Structure
The DENR protein, encoded by the human gene DENR, plays a crucial role in translation reinitiation and ribosome recycling. Structurally, DENR contains a SUI1 domain, which is similar to the eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1) and is involved in translation initiation (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1). The minimal region of DENR responsible for binding to MCTS1 is identified as amino acids 24-51. The N-terminus of DENR, particularly residues 25 to 33, is largely extended and lacks secondary structure (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1). The C-terminal part of DENR includes a partial zinc finger (residues 34 to 44) and a short α-helix (residues 44 to 46), which is predicted to extend to residue 60. This zinc finger is coordinated by three cysteine residues (Cys34, Cys37, and Cys44) and is completed in crystallo by MCTS1-His58 from a symmetry mate (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1).

The DENR-MCTS1 complex forms a heterodimer that is crucial for its function, with specific residues such as Glu42, Tyr43, and Tyr46 being important for MCTS1 binding (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1). The DENR-MCTS1 complex can bind tRNA independently of the ribosome, suggesting a role in recruiting tRNA to the ribosome during reinitiation (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1).

## Function
The DENR (density regulated re-initiation and release factor) gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in translation reinitiation and ribosome recycling in human cells. DENR forms a heterodimeric complex with MCTS1, which is essential for promoting the translation of mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (uORFs). This process is vital for the expression of certain oncogenes and stress response genes, such as ATF4, which are implicated in cellular proliferation and stress responses (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1; Bohlen2020DENR).

During mitosis, DENR is phosphorylated at serine 73 by Cyclin B/CDK1 and Cyclin A/CDK2, enhancing its stability and preventing degradation. This phosphorylation is critical for DENR's function in translating a set of target genes necessary for proper cell division, ensuring mitotic stability and faithful cell division (Clemm2022Cyclin). The DENR•MCTS1 complex also plays a role in recycling post-termination 40S ribosomes, facilitating efficient translation reinitiation (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1).

DENR is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular growth and proliferation by regulating protein synthesis. Its function is particularly important in the context of cancer therapy, where its role in mitotic translation is critical for preventing aberrant mitosis and mitotic cell death (Clemm2022Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DENR gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), mutations such as C37Y and P121L in the DENR gene have been identified. These mutations are associated with impaired 40S ribosome recycling, which is crucial for protein synthesis, and have been linked to disruptions in neuronal migration and differentiation, as well as dendritic spine density in mouse models (Young202140S).

In cancer, the DENR gene, often in conjunction with MCTS1, acts as an oncogene. The DENR•MCTS1 complex is involved in noncanonical translation initiation, promoting the translation of mRNAs with upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which are linked to cell proliferation and tumor progression. Overexpression or copy number gains of DENR have been observed in various tumor types, contributing to their pro-proliferative and protumorigenic roles (Schleich2017Identification; Clemm2022Cyclin). Additionally, DENR regulates the translation of JAK2, influencing PD-L1 expression and tumor immune evasion, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Chen2022DENR).

## Interactions
The DENR protein forms a crucial heterodimer with MCTS1, which is essential for its function in translation reinitiation. This interaction involves specific residues on DENR, such as Glu42, Tyr43, and Tyr46, which are critical for binding to MCTS1. Mutations in these residues can significantly reduce the binding affinity between DENR and MCTS1, impairing the complex's ability to promote translation reinitiation (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1).

The DENR-MCTS1 complex can bind tRNA independently of the ribosome, forming a trimeric complex in vitro. This binding is similar across different tRNAs, indicating a broad tRNA-binding capacity. The MCTS1 protein contains a PUA domain, commonly found in tRNA binding proteins, suggesting that the DENR-MCTS1 complex may recruit tRNA to the ribosomal 40S subunit (Ahmed2018DENR–MCTS1).

DENR is also phosphorylated at Ser73 by Cyclin B/CDK1 and Cyclin A/CDK2, which is crucial for its stability during mitosis. This phosphorylation prevents DENR's degradation and is important for its interaction with MCTS1 during mitosis, although both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms can bind MCTS1 (Clemm2022Cyclin).
