# TMEM121B

## Overview
TMEM121B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 121B, which is part of the broader family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cell structure. The specific functions and interactions of TMEM121B remain under investigation, but its categorization as a transmembrane protein suggests it may be involved in cellular communication or transport mechanisms. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and potential implications in human health and disease.
