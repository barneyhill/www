# OR1L8

## Overview
The OR1L8 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily L member 8, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. The OR1L8 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane and interact with odorant molecules. While the primary function of OR1L8 is related to olfaction, emerging research suggests its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including potential roles in neurological and hematological conditions (Alves2017[P1–214]:).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR1L8 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been explored in various contexts, particularly in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and environmental exposures. In Alzheimer's disease, OR1L8 expression is notably downregulated in the orbitofrontal cortex of female patients at early Braak stages, suggesting a potential role in the early pathogenesis of AD. This downregulation is not observed in male patients, indicating a possible sex-specific involvement of OR1L8 in AD (Alves2017[P1–214]:).

In environmental studies, OR1L8 expression is significantly downregulated in male California mice exposed to bisphenol A (BPA), a common environmental contaminant. This suggests that OR1L8 may be sensitive to environmental factors, although the direct implications for human health remain unclear (Johnson2017Hypothalamic).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), OR1L8 is upregulated in patients with low platelet counts, indicating a potential association with hematological conditions. However, the specific role of OR1L8 in these conditions is not fully understood (Park2022Investigation). Overall, while OR1L8 is implicated in various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
