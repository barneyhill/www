# CNN1

## Overview
The CNN1 gene encodes calponin 1, a regulatory actin-binding protein predominantly expressed in smooth muscle cells. Calponin 1 is integral to the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, primarily functioning as an inhibitor of actin-activated myosin ATPase, which is crucial for muscle contraction and cellular motility. This protein is characterized by its conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which, although not directly binding F-actin, is implicated in signaling pathways such as ERK. Calponin 1's interactions with proteins like tropomyosin, calmodulin, and protein kinase C (PKC) further underscore its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction. Clinically, alterations in CNN1 expression are linked to various pathologies, including cancer and vascular disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Liu2016Calponin; Hsieh2023Evolution; Wang2017Loss).

## Structure
Calponin 1 (CNN1) is a protein encoded by the CNN1 gene, primarily expressed in smooth muscle cells. The primary structure of calponin 1 includes a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, a middle region with two actin-binding sites, and a variable C-terminal segment (Liu2016Calponin; Hsieh2023Evolution). The CH domain, spanning amino acids 29-129, is a common feature in actin-binding proteins, though it does not directly bind F-actin in calponin 1 (Hsieh2023Evolution). Instead, it may play a role in ERK signaling pathways (Hsieh2023Evolution).

The secondary structure of calponin 1 includes α-helices, which are part of the CH domain's α-helical fold, contributing to its regulatory roles in cytoskeletal dynamics (Yin2020Structural). The tertiary structure is compact, maintained by hydrophobic interactions, and includes a triple-helix bundle formed by helices III, IV, and VI (Yin2020Structural).

Calponin 1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at tyrosine residues Tyr261 and Tyr182, which regulate its function as an inhibitor of actin-activated myosin ATPase (Hsieh2023Evolution). These modifications are crucial for its role in smooth muscle contractility and cell motility functions (Hsieh2023Evolution).

## Function
Calponin 1 (CNN1) is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. It primarily functions by inhibiting the MgATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin, thereby modulating muscle contraction. This inhibition is achieved through its binding to F-actin, with specific residues responsible for this regulatory activity (Liu2016Calponin). CNN1 stabilizes actin stress fibers by binding to actin, tropomyosin, and calmodulin, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of smooth muscle cells (Wang2017Loss).

In smooth muscle cells, CNN1 is involved in fine-tuning contractility by inhibiting actin-activated myosin ATPase and stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. It is highly expressed in phasic smooth muscle, such as that of the digestive tract, and minimally in other tissues like the avian trachea (Liu2016Calponin). CNN1 also plays a role in maintaining the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle cells, which is vital for the normal function of blood vessels, allowing them to control vessel wall caliber and blood flow (Long2011Smooth). Additionally, CNN1 is involved in stabilizing the cytoskeleton and tightening intercellular junctions, which can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and migration (Zhou2023Potential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CNN1 gene, which encodes calponin 1, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and vascular disorders. In the context of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) originating from the fallopian tube epithelium, downregulation of CNN1 is associated with increased anoikis resistance and tumor progression. This resistance to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, is a key factor in cancer metastasis, suggesting that CNN1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its loss is necessary for the transformation of fimbrial epithelium to HGSC, and CNN1 is poorly expressed in HGSC tissues (Wang2017Loss).

In vascular biology, CNN1 plays a crucial role in maintaining smooth muscle cell function and vascular integrity. Mutations or downregulation of CNN1 can lead to vascular remodeling and disorders such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Overexpression of CNN1 has been shown to suppress neointimal formation following arterial injury, indicating its protective role against vascular remodeling (Long2011Smooth).

In malignant melanoma, reduced expression of CNN1 in vascular smooth muscle within lesions is associated with increased blood vessel fragility and metastasis, although its role as a prognostic marker is less clear due to consistent downregulation during neoplastic transformation (Koganehira2003Reduced).

## Interactions
Calponin 1, encoded by the CNN1 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in muscle contractility and signaling pathways. It binds to extracellular regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2, with the interaction mediated by the calponin homology (CH) domain. This binding is specific to the N-terminal part of calponin, particularly involving the actin-binding TnI-like region and the CH domain, suggesting a role in ERK signaling cascades (LEINWEBER1999Extracellular).

Calponin 1 also interacts with protein kinase C (PKC), specifically binding to the regulatory domain of PKCε and PKCα. The interaction is stronger with PKCε and involves the region between amino acids 160-182 of calponin. This binding can activate PKC autophosphorylation and enhance its activity, indicating that calponin may function as an adaptor protein linking the PKC and ERK signaling pathways (Leinweber2000Regulation).

In addition to these interactions, calponin 1 binds to actin filaments, stabilizing actin stress fibers in smooth muscle cells. It also interacts with other proteins such as tropomyosin and Ca2+-calmodulin, which can dissociate calponin from actin filaments, facilitating muscle contraction (Liu2016Calponin).
