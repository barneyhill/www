# COL8A1

## Overview
The COL8A1 gene encodes the collagen type VIII alpha 1 chain, a non-fibrillar collagen protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of various tissues. This protein is primarily expressed in the cornea, aortic endothelial cells, and intraglomerular mesangial cells, where it contributes to the formation of hexagonal networks within the extracellular matrix. As a component of the extracellular matrix, the collagen type VIII alpha 1 chain is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue repair processes, which are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating vascular remodeling and atherogenesis (Zhou2020Upregulation). The protein's interactions with factors such as VEGFA and its involvement in signaling pathways underscore its significance in angiogenesis and disease pathologies, including cancer and age-related macular degeneration (Strafella2019Atopic; Corominas2018WholeExome).

## Structure
The COL8A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type VIII collagen, a non-fibrillar collagen. The primary structure of COL8A1 includes a triple-helical domain characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats, which are typical of collagen proteins (Wesp2024Constructing). The protein also contains non-collagenous domains, specifically the NC1 and NC2 domains, with the Y628H mutation located in the C1q-like domain of NC1 (Gansner2008Essential). This mutation is significant as it affects the protein's ability to fold properly, impacting its function (Gansner2008Essential).

The tertiary structure involves the formation of a triple helix, which is crucial for the protein's stability and function (Wesp2024Constructing). The quaternary structure of COL8A1 is a homotrimer, meaning it forms a complex of three identical alpha chains (Cheng2021Collagen). Post-translational modifications such as hydroxylation and glycosylation are common in collagen proteins, although specific modifications for COL8A1 are not detailed in the provided context (Wesp2024Constructing).

The Y628H mutation in the C1q-like domain of NC1 is analogous to a mutation in human COL10A1, which is known to cause Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, highlighting the importance of proper folding in the function of collagen proteins (Gansner2008Essential).

## Function
The COL8A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type VIII collagen, which is a non-fibrillar collagen involved in various cellular and molecular processes. In healthy human cells, COL8A1 is primarily expressed in the cornea, aortic endothelial cells, and intraglomerular mesangial cells. It plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of tissues by forming hexagonal networks that contribute to the extracellular matrix (Zhou2020Upregulation). This protein is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue repair processes, which are crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of tissues (Zhou2020Upregulation).

COL8A1 is also implicated in vascular remodeling and atherogenesis, where it influences cell migration and proliferation, promoting the growth of smooth muscle cells (Zhou2020Upregulation). These activities suggest that COL8A1 is essential for regulating cell biology and maintaining the extracellular matrix's structural framework. Although its expression is noted in the cornea and vascular tissues, the specific molecular activities of COL8A1 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed in the available literature. However, its role in forming structural networks and influencing cell behavior highlights its importance in tissue homeostasis and repair (Zhou2020Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the COL8A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), high expression of COL8A1 is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of recurrence. It correlates with higher TNM stage, extrathyroidal invasion, and dedifferentiation, and is linked to the BRAF V600E mutation. COL8A1 may promote cell migration and invasion through the ERK and AKT signaling pathways, contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic processes (Liang2024High).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), COL8A1 upregulates IFIT1 and IFIT3, which are crucial for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. This overexpression increases phosphorylated AKT and EGFR levels, promoting NSCLC progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zan2022COL8A1).

Rare protein-altering variants in COL8A1 are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These variants may compromise the integrity of Bruch's membrane, leading to drusen accumulation and AMD development (Corominas2018WholeExome).

In psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, the SNP rs13081855 in COL8A1 is linked to disease susceptibility. Although COL8A1 is slightly downregulated in psoriatic lesions, its role in extracellular matrix remodeling and interaction with proangiogenic factors like VEGFA may contribute to disease pathology (Caputo2020RNAseqBased).

## Interactions
COL8A1, encoding the alpha 1 chain of type VIII collagen, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in the extracellular matrix. One significant interaction is with VEGFA, a proangiogenic factor, which suggests a role in angiogenesis pathways. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of diseases like Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and potentially in atopic eczema (AE), where abnormal blood vessel growth is a factor (Strafella2019Atopic).

In the context of vascular injury, COL8A1 is upregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) following stimulation by platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (pEVs). This process involves the PIP3/Akt signaling pathway, where pEVs activate Akt, leading to increased COL8A1 production. The microRNA miR-92a-3p, delivered by pEVs, targets PTEN, further promoting COL8A1 expression. This interaction contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling and increased vascular stiffness (Bao2021PlateletDerived).

In colon adenocarcinoma, COL8A1 interacts with Wnt2, with both genes showing a significant correlation in expression levels. This interaction is associated with poor prognosis in patients, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression (Zhang2020Clinical).
