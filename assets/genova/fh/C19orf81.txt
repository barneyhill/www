# C19orf81

## Overview
C19orf81 is a gene located on chromosome 19 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 81. This protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and its specific biological functions remain largely uncharacterized. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in signaling pathways. The gene's expression and the protein's function are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of its role in human health and disease. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which C19orf81 operates could provide insights into its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.
