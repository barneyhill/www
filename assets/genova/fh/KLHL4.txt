# KLHL4

## Overview
KLHL4, or kelch like family member 4, is a gene located on the human X chromosome at Xq21.3, encoding a protein that is part of the Kelch-like (KLHL) family. The KLHL4 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch domains, which facilitate its role as a substrate adaptor in the CRL3-KLHL4 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is integral to cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, where it enhances the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to cell cycle arrest. KLHL4 is also crucial for embryonic development, particularly in ectodermal patterning and neurulation, by modulating signaling pathways involving small GTPases. Its interactions with various proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and developmental homeostasis, with dysfunction potentially leading to neurodevelopmental and craniofacial anomalies (Asmar2023A; Choi2020KLHL4; Asmar2022A).

## Structure
The KLHL4 protein is a member of the Kelch-like (KLHL) family, characterized by specific domains that contribute to its molecular structure. It contains a BTB/POZ domain at the N terminus, a BACK domain near the middle, and five to six Kelch domains at the C terminus (Choi2020KLHL4; Dhanoa2013Update). The BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein binding and dimerization, facilitating interactions with Cullin 3 to form a Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Choi2020KLHL4; Peng2023Genomic). The Kelch domains form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for recognizing target proteins during ubiquitin transfer (Dhanoa2013Update). 

KLHL4 is encoded by a gene located on the human X chromosome at Xq21.3 and consists of 718 amino acids (Choi2020KLHL4). While the specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of KLHL4 are not detailed in the provided context, these modifications are common in the Kelch-like protein family and may influence the protein's function and interactions. The precise molecular structure of KLHL4, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not fully described in the available literature.

## Function
KLHL4 (kelch like family member 4) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in healthy human cells. It functions as a substrate adaptor protein within the CRL3-KLHL4 complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination of proteins, a process crucial for various cellular functions. KLHL4 enhances the binding of p53 to its response elements, thereby increasing the transcriptional activation of p21, a key regulator of the cell cycle. This interaction leads to cell cycle arrest and inhibits cell proliferation (Choi2020KLHL4).

KLHL4 is also essential for ectodermal patterning and neurulation during early embryonic development. It interacts with the GIT-PIX-PAK signaling module, modulating the activity of small GTPases like CDC42 and RAC1, which are critical for cytoskeletal signaling and neural development. The CRL3-KLHL4 complex restricts CDC42 activity, ensuring proper ectodermal differentiation and neural tube formation (Asmar2023A; Asmar2022A).

In the context of organismal development, KLHL4 is crucial for brain, craniofacial, and skin development. Its dysfunction can lead to neurodevelopmental and craniofacial anomalies, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and developmental homeostasis (Asmar2023A; Asmar2022A).

## Interactions
KLHL4, a member of the Kelch-like protein family, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. KLHL4 physically interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing p53's binding to its response elements, which leads to the activation of the p21 WAF/CDKN1A gene, a key regulator of the cell cycle. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays in HCT116 p53 wild-type cells (Choi2020KLHL4).

KLHL4 also interacts with the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase, a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction suggests that KLHL4 may function as an adaptor protein, influencing p53's DNA-binding activity and stability. However, KLHL4 does not interact with other cullin proteins such as Cul1 or Cul2, indicating a specific interaction with Cul3 (Choi2020KLHL4).

In addition to its interactions with p53 and Cul3, KLHL4 is associated with POK family proteins, including PLZF, BCL6, and BOZF1. These proteins are known to regulate p21 by interacting with p53, suggesting that KLHL4 may have a broader role in modulating p53-related pathways (Choi2020KLHL4).
