# FREM3

## Overview
FREM3, or FRAS1 related extracellular matrix 3, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the extracellular matrix, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and tissue integrity. The FREM3 protein is part of a family that includes FRAS1, FREM2, and QBRICK/FREM1, all of which are involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of nervous tissue, suggesting a significant role in neural development and function (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). As an extracellular matrix protein, FREM3 is implicated in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, essential for tissue development and architecture. Although not directly linked to Fraser syndrome, a condition associated with congenital malformations, FREM3's related proteins have been implicated in this disorder, underscoring its importance in developmental processes (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). Additionally, variations in the FREM3 gene have been associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder, particularly through its influence on brain aging and expression patterns in regions associated with depression (Nikolova2015FRAS1related).

## Structure
The FREM3 protein, encoded by the FREM3 gene, is a component of the extracellular matrix involved in cell adhesion. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure of FREM3 may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other cellular components. 

FREM3 may also exhibit a quaternary structure, involving the assembly of multiple protein subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided. The protein contains specific domains, such as Calx-beta and CSPG, which are likely important for its functional roles in the extracellular matrix. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in FREM3 and can influence its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of FREM3 can result in different protein forms, potentially leading to varied functions within the cell. These structural features and modifications underscore the complexity and versatility of the FREM3 protein in human biology.

## Function
The FREM3 gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein that is part of the same family as FRAS1, FREM2, and QBRICK/FREM1. These proteins are involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of nervous tissue, suggesting a role in neural development and function (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). FREM3 is likely involved in cell-cell interactions, contributing to the structural integrity of tissues, and is active in the extracellular space (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). 

In healthy human cells, FREM3 is implicated in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, which are crucial for tissue development and maintaining tissue architecture (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). The protein's role in the extracellular matrix is significant for brain aging, as it influences the expression patterns in brain regions associated with depression (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). 

Although FREM3 has not been directly linked to Fraser syndrome, a disorder characterized by severe congenital malformations, its related proteins have been implicated in this condition, highlighting the importance of the FREM3 protein in developmental processes (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). The precise molecular mechanisms and full extent of FREM3's functions in healthy cells remain to be elucidated through further research (Nikolova2015FRAS1related).

## Clinical Significance
The FREM3 gene has been implicated in the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) through its association with specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The major A allele of the SNP rs7676614 is linked to an increased risk of MDD, particularly with symptoms of psychomotor retardation. This suggests that the SNP may contribute to a specific biological pathway of depression risk, potentially through an accelerated brain aging process (Nikolova2015FRAS1related). The expression of FREM3 declines with age in brain regions such as the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, which are involved in depression pathophysiology. This decline may indicate that the A allele predisposes individuals to depression by mimicking an older age pattern of gene expression (Nikolova2015FRAS1related).

While FREM3 is part of the same family as genes implicated in Fraser syndrome, there is no direct evidence linking FREM3 to this condition. However, its role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of nervous tissue suggests its involvement in neural development and function, which may influence depression risk through genetic variations (Nikolova2015FRAS1related).
