# POMP

## Overview
The POMP gene encodes the proteasome maturation protein, a crucial chaperone involved in the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. This protein is essential for the proper incorporation of catalytic subunits into the proteasome, facilitating the transition from the α-ring to the β-ring during proteasome assembly. POMP is characterized by its predominantly α-helical structure and its ability to form tetramers, which are vital for its function in proteasome assembly (Zhang2024Structural; Hoefer2006Possible). The protein operates in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating immune responses through antigen presentation (Poli2018Heterozygous). Mutations in the POMP gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including POMP-related autoinflammation and immune dysregulation disease (PRAID) and KLICK syndrome, underscoring its importance in immune regulation and cellular function (Poli2018Heterozygous; Takeichi2020KLICK).

## Structure
The POMP protein, also known as proteasome maturation protein, is a 16 kDa protein essential for the maturation of the 20S proteasome proteolytic core complex. Its primary structure is characterized by a low content of basic amino acids and aromatic residues, which contributes to its weak staining properties with Coomassie and Ponceau dyes (Hoefer2006Possible). The secondary structure of POMP is predominantly composed of long stretches of α-helices, with a high percentage of hydrophobic amino acids, particularly leucines, which may facilitate tetramerization through hydrophobic interactions (Hoefer2006Possible).

POMP's tertiary structure involves its folding into a form that allows it to interact with other proteasome assembly components, such as the β2 pro-peptide, during the final stages of 20S proteasome assembly (Zhang2024Structural). The protein does not independently form multi-subunit complexes, indicating a lack of quaternary structure. However, it can form tetramers, as suggested by gel-filtration chromatography, which showed an apparent molecular weight of approximately 64 kDa, corresponding to a tetrameric form (Hoefer2006Possible).

POMP is involved in the assembly of the β subunits onto the α-ring, marking the transition from α-ring to β-ring formation, and plays a crucial role in the structural dynamics of proteasome assembly (Zhang2024Structural).

## Function
The POMP gene encodes the proteasome maturation protein, which is essential for the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasome complex responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. In healthy human cells, POMP acts as a chaperone, facilitating the incorporation of catalytic subunits into the proteasome. It interacts with the initially formed alpha ring to enable the sequential incorporation of beta subunits into both the standard proteasome and the immunoproteasome (Poli2018Heterozygous). This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating the immune response by processing proteins for antigen presentation (Poli2018Heterozygous).

POMP is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it organizes proteasome assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Poli2018Heterozygous). In immune cells, POMP is involved in the formation of the i20S immunoproteasome, which is important for enhancing antigen presentation via class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules, crucial for generating a specific T cell response (Poli2018Heterozygous). The proper function of POMP ensures efficient degradation of proteins, preventing their accumulation and subsequent ER stress, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function (Poli2018Heterozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMP gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in proteasome assembly. One such condition is POMP-related autoinflammation and immune dysregulation disease (PRAID), characterized by early-onset combined immunodeficiency, inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis, and autoimmunity. This syndrome is caused by heterozygous truncating variants in POMP that escape nonsense-mediated decay, leading to a dominant-negative effect that disrupts proteasome assembly and increases type-1 interferon-inducible gene expression (Poli2018Heterozygous).

KLICK syndrome, another condition linked to POMP mutations, is a keratinization disorder caused by autosomal-recessive deletions in the 5' UTR of an alternative POMP transcript. This results in proteasome insufficiency in keratinocytes, leading to skin abnormalities without an inflammatory component (Takeichi2020KLICK).

POMP mutations can also mimic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) due to similar clinical features, as seen in a case study involving a de novo intragenic deletion in POMP, which was associated with systemic inflammatory disease and increased interferon signaling (GarcíaHerrera2023Infantile). These conditions highlight the critical role of POMP in immune regulation and its potential involvement in autoimmune diseases (Poli2023Proteasome).

## Interactions
POMP (proteasome maturation protein) is a key player in the assembly and maturation of the 20S proteasome complex. It interacts with various proteasome subunits and chaperones during this process. POMP is involved in scaffolding the β-ring during proteasome assembly, interacting with subunits such as β5 and β6, and stabilizing neighboring subunits through a network of interactions (Adolf2024Visualizing). It binds to PAC3/PAC4 chaperones, which help order the incorporation of β subunits by preventing untimely incorporation of later subunits (Adolf2024Visualizing). POMP also collaborates with the β5 propeptide in completing β-ring assembly and restraining the proteasome active sites before half-CP fusion (Adolf2024Visualizing).

POMP interacts with the α-ring and β-ring subunits during the proteasome assembly process, including interactions with the α1-α3 and α7 subunits of the α-ring (Adolf2024Visualizing). It also plays a role in the initiation of the β-ring with β2, where it co-recruits β2 and interacts with its propeptide (Adolf2024Visualizing). These interactions are crucial for the ordered assembly of the proteasome, ensuring proper subunit incorporation and stability. POMP's interactions with specific beta subunits, such as b1, b1i, b5, b5i, and b7, suggest its role in regulating the incorporation of subunits into proteasomes (Jayarapu2004Protein–protein).
