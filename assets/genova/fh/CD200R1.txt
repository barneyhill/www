# CD200R1

## Overview
CD200R1 is a gene that encodes the CD200 receptor 1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and plays a critical role in modulating immune responses. By interacting with its ligand, CD200, CD200 receptor 1 delivers inhibitory signals that help maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammation. The receptor's cytoplasmic domain, although lacking traditional signaling motifs, contains conserved tyrosine residues essential for its function, facilitating the recruitment of adaptor proteins that inhibit the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. This mechanism is vital for promoting immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Timmerman2020Identification). CD200R1's involvement in immune regulation has significant implications in various clinical contexts, including neuroinflammation, ischemic stroke, and cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (RabanedaLombarte2022Altered; Chang2020Prognostic).

## Structure
CD200R1 is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, which are typical of this family, including regions such as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 that are important for its interaction with CD200 (Gorczynski2008A). The protein's cytoplasmic domain lacks traditional signaling motifs, but it contains conserved tyrosine residues, notably Y286, Y289, and Y297, which are crucial for its signaling function. Y297, in particular, is embedded in an NPxY motif, which is associated with inhibitory signaling, although its role is debated (Timmerman2020Identification).

The intracellular domain also includes a novel conserved signaling motif characterized by negatively charged amino acids (EEDE279) and specific residues like P285 and K292, which are essential for the receptor's inhibitory function (Timmerman2020Identification). CD200R1 is subject to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common for cell surface glycoproteins. Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms of the protein, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein's structure is conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Gorczynski2008A).

## Function
CD200R1 (CD200 receptor 1) is a crucial component in the regulation of immune responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as certain T cell subsets. The receptor plays a significant role in modulating immune activity by interacting with its ligand, CD200, to deliver inhibitory signals that suppress immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Rijkers2008The).

The molecular function of CD200R1 involves the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain, which leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as Dok1 and Dok2. These proteins inhibit the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, reducing immune cell activation and cytokine production (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Timmerman2021Identification). This signaling cascade is essential for preventing excessive inflammation and promoting immune tolerance (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R).

CD200R1 is also involved in the differentiation of dendritic cells into a tolerogenic state, which enhances regulatory T cell activity and contributes to the suppression of immune responses (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R). Through these mechanisms, CD200R1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue protection and preventing autoimmunity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CD200R1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. In Parkinson's disease (PD), changes in CD200R1 expression have been observed, with increased expression noted in the hippocampus of PD patients. This alteration is associated with disrupted CD200-CD200R1 signaling, potentially affecting microglial function and contributing to disease progression (RabanedaLombarte2022Altered). 

In the context of ischemic stroke, CD200R1 signaling is crucial for controlling neuroinflammation and preventing infections. CD200R1-deficient mice exhibit worsened outcomes post-stroke, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and exacerbated neuroinflammatory responses, highlighting the gene's role in immune regulation and recovery (Ritzel2019CD200CD200R1).

In cancer, CD200R1 expression has been linked to prognosis. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high CD200R1 expression is associated with better overall survival, suggesting its role as a favorable prognostic biomarker (Chang2020Prognostic). Conversely, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high CD200R1 expression correlates with worse survival outcomes, indicating its complex role in cancer progression and immune modulation (Yoshimura2020CD200).

## Interactions
CD200R1 interacts with several proteins through its cytoplasmic tail, which contains critical tyrosine residues, particularly Y286 and Y297. These residues, upon phosphorylation, facilitate the recruitment of inhibitory adaptor proteins such as Dok1 and Dok2. Dok2 recruits the adaptor molecule Nck, while Dok1 recruits CrkL, leading to the inhibition of Ras/MAPK activation (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R). In human myeloid cells, CD200R1 primarily recruits Dok2, which through RasGAP activation, mediates inhibition. Dok1's effects are indirect or absent in this context (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R).

The interaction between CD200 and CD200R1 is also modulated by N-glycosylation, particularly at the N44 site of CD200R1. This glycosylation is crucial for maintaining the binding affinity between CD200 and CD200R1, which is important for inhibiting microglial activation and maintaining immune homeostasis in the central nervous system (Liu2018The).

CD200R1 engagement is involved in the overexpression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, contributing to immune system suppression. It also regulates TGFβ and IL-10 production, further contributing to immunosuppression (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R).
