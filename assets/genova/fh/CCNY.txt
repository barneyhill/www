# CCNY

## Overview
Cyclin Y (CCNY) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin Y, a member of the cyclin family known for its role in regulating cell cycle progression and various cellular processes. Cyclin Y is characterized by a single cyclin fold and is involved in the formation of active kinase complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as CDK16, which are crucial for processes like spermatogenesis and intracellular signaling pathways (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent; Mikolcevic2012Orphan). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics and synaptic plasticity in neurons, as well as in noncanonical Wnt signaling, which influences cell motility and cancer metastasis (Hwang2021Cyclin; Sun2014PFTK1). Cyclin Y's involvement in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Shi2018Cyclin; Yue2011Cell).

## Structure
Cyclin Y (CCNY) is a highly conserved protein among metazoans, characterized by a single cyclin fold, unlike conventional cyclins that typically have two such folds (Mikolcevic2012Orphan). This cyclin fold is essential for its interaction with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), with specific conserved residues such as Y195, R198, L222, and S224 playing a critical role in this binding (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent). CCNY also contains a myristoylation signal that targets it to the plasma membrane, a feature it shares with other cyclin-like proteins such as p35/39 (Mikolcevic2012Orphan).

CCNY exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a membrane-localized form (CCNYm) and a cytoplasmic form (CCNYc). The primary structure of CCNYm includes a myristoylation signal motif, which is absent in CCNYc, leading to their distinct subcellular localizations (Zhao2021Cytoplasmic). The 32 kD and 39 kD isoforms have been identified in various lung cancer cell lines, with the cytoplasmic isoform playing a significant role in cancer progression (Zhao2021Cytoplasmic). The interaction between CCNY and CDK16 is regulated by phosphorylation, which can inhibit or facilitate binding depending on the phosphorylation site (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent).

## Function
Cyclin Y (CCNY) is a member of the cyclin family that plays a significant role in regulating actin dynamics and synaptic plasticity in neurons. It functions as an actin-binding protein, influencing spine plasticity through the cofilin-actin pathway. CCNY enhances actin polymerization and inhibits actin severing and depolymerization, which is crucial for maintaining spine plasticity in neurons (Hwang2021Cyclin). In the context of long-term potentiation (LTP), CCNY acts as an inhibitory regulator by suppressing actin polymerization and depolymerization, affecting the dynamic pool of actin necessary for structural remodeling of dendritic spines (Hwang2021Cyclin).

CCNY also interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as CDK16, forming an active kinase complex essential for various cellular processes, including spermatogenesis (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent). This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects the localization and activity of CDK16 (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent). In addition to its role in the nervous system, CCNY is involved in Wnt signaling, which is critical for maintaining progenitor cell properties during cell division (Quandt2019Atypical). CCNY's functions extend to the regulation of intracellular vesicle formation, transport, and neurite outgrowth (Mikolcevic2012Orphan).

## Clinical Significance
Cyclin Y (CCNY) has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCNY expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This upregulation is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and reduced apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Shi2018Cyclin). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CCNY is overexpressed in tumor samples and cell lines, correlating with increased tumor size and proliferation. Silencing CCNY in NSCLC cells results in decreased proliferation and tumorigenesis, highlighting its role in lung cancer progression (Yue2011Cell).

CCNY is also overexpressed in breast cancer, where its knockdown leads to reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting its involvement in breast cancer cell growth (Yan2016RNAimediated). In ovarian cancer, CCNY stimulates cell proliferation by activating the WNT pathway, and its overexpression is linked to shorter survival times in NSCLC, indicating its prognostic significance (Quandt2020Atypical). These findings suggest that CCNY could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
Cyclin Y (CCNY) interacts with several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, CCNY binds to CDK4, activating it through T172 phosphorylation. This activation leads to the inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) via increased Rb phosphorylation, promoting the G1/S phase transition and influencing the expression of E2F target genes such as CDK2 and Cyclin A (Chen2020Cyclin).

CCNY also interacts with CDK16, a member of the PCTAIRE family of CDKs. This interaction is crucial for CDK16 activation and is regulated by phosphorylation at serine 153, which can inhibit CCNY binding. The CCNY-CDK16 complex is essential for spermatogenesis, as demonstrated by its role in murine testis (Mikolcevic2012CyclinDependent).

In the context of noncanonical Wnt signaling, CCNY forms a complex with PFTK1, a Cdc2-related protein kinase, in HCC cells. This interaction activates the noncanonical Wnt pathway, leading to increased levels of Dvl2 and Naked1, and the activation of Rho GTPases, which are involved in cell motility and cancer metastasis (Sun2014PFTK1).
