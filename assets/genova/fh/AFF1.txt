# AFF1

## Overview
AFF1, also known as AF4/FMR2 family member 1, is a gene that encodes the ALF transcription elongation factor 1, a protein integral to the regulation of transcription elongation. This protein is a key component of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), which is involved in the modulation of RNA polymerase II activity during transcription. As a transcription elongation factor, ALF transcription elongation factor 1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in epithelial tissues. It achieves this by interacting with various components of the transcription machinery, including the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) and the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, to regulate gene expression (Lu2013AFF1; Lloyd2022CDK9). The clinical significance of AFF1 is underscored by its involvement in chromosomal translocations that lead to the formation of fusion proteins associated with leukemias, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Qin2022Neonatal; chen2021High).

## Function
AFF1, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 1, is a crucial component of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), which plays a significant role in the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, AFF1 is involved in maintaining the balance between progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation, particularly in epithelial tissues such as the human skin epidermis. It achieves this by associating with the inactive form of CDK9, a component of the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb), to suppress the expression of differentiation-activating transcription factors in progenitor cells (Lloyd2022CDK9).

AFF1 is also a part of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, where it interacts with components like HEXIM1 and LARP7 to regulate the availability and activity of P-TEFb. This interaction is crucial for the sequestration of P-TEFb, preventing premature transcription elongation (Lu2013AFF1). AFF1's role in transcription regulation extends to its involvement in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, where it modulates the expression of genes related to osteogenic differentiation (Zhou2017AFF1). Through these mechanisms, AFF1 influences cell growth, renewal, and differentiation, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
The AFF1 gene, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 1, is clinically significant due to its involvement in various leukemias. Chromosomal translocations involving AFF1, particularly with the KMT2A (MLL) gene, result in fusion proteins that are implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These translocations disrupt normal gene function, contributing to oncogenesis (Qin2022Neonatal; chen2021High).

In the context of AML, AFF1 is highly expressed in patients compared to normal individuals, and this high expression is significantly negatively correlated with overall survival. This suggests that AFF1 could be a potential target for treatment in AML (chen2021High). The AFF1-KMT2A fusion is particularly noted as an independent risk factor for prognosis in infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia (chen2021High).

The presence of the AFF1-KMT2A fusion gene has been identified in cases of neonatal congenital leukemia, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of this rare and highly fatal condition (Qin2022Neonatal). These findings underscore the importance of AFF1 in the development and progression of certain leukemias.

## Interactions
AFF1, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 1, is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC), which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. AFF1 interacts with several proteins, forming part of the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEP), which includes AF5Q31 (AFF4), ENL (MLLT1), CDK9, and CyclinT1 (CCNT1). This complex is involved in activating transcription elongation by phosphorylating the RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) complex (Yokoyama2019RNA).

AFF1 interacts with SL1, a factor involved in both RNAP1- and RNAP2-dependent transcription. The serine-rich pSER domain of AFF1 recruits SL1, which loads TBP to the TATA box to initiate RNAP2-dependent transcription. MED26, a subunit of the Mediator complex, also associates with AEP and enhances SL1-mediated transcription (Yokoyama2019RNA).

AFF1 is part of the SEC, which includes elongation factors such as P-TEFb, ENL/MLLT1, and AF9/MLLT3. This complex is essential for the transcriptional regulation of genes like MYC, which is crucial in cancer cells, including leukemia (Luo2012The). AFF1, along with other AFF family members, shares a similar domain organization, suggesting potential interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Luo2012The).
