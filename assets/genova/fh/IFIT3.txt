# IFIT3

## Overview
The IFIT3 gene encodes the interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3, a key player in the innate immune response. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing it to function as a scaffold in multiprotein complexes. IFIT3 is primarily involved in antiviral defense, being induced by type I and type III interferons in response to viral infections. It forms complexes with other IFIT family proteins, such as IFIT1 and IFIT2, to recognize and neutralize viral RNA. Beyond its antiviral role, IFIT3 is involved in immune signaling pathways, including the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, and plays a role in regulating apoptosis. Its expression and activity are tightly regulated, and alterations in IFIT3 expression have been linked to various cancers and other diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhou2013Interferon; Schmeisser2010Identification; Pidugu2019Emerging).

## Structure
IFIT3 is a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are structural units that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These motifs form helix-turn-helix arrangements, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Diamond2012The; Pidugu2019Emerging). The TPR motifs in IFIT3 are similar to those in other IFIT family members, such as IFIT2, which has been shown to form domain-swapped dimers (Sen2012Crystal). Although the complete crystal structure of IFIT3 is not available, it is suggested that IFIT3 may form homodimers, similar to IFIT2, due to a 70% sequence similarity in their N-terminal domains (Pidugu2019Emerging).

IFIT3 acts as a central scaffold in protein complexes with IFIT1 and IFIT2, interacting via a conserved YxxxL motif in the C-terminus (Pidugu2019Emerging). This interaction is crucial for its function, as deletion or mutation of this motif decreases IFIT1 expression (Pidugu2019Emerging). IFIT3 is approximately 60 kDa in molecular weight, denoted as p60 (Pidugu2019Emerging). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Pidugu2019Emerging). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
IFIT3 (interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3) is a crucial component of the innate immune response, primarily involved in antiviral defense. It is induced by type I and type III interferons and is expressed in response to viral infections and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Schmeisser2010Identification; Zhou2013Interferon). IFIT3 functions by forming complexes with other IFIT family proteins, such as IFIT1 and IFIT2, to recognize and neutralize viral RNA, particularly PPP-RNA, in the cytoplasm (Zhou2013Interferon). 

In addition to its role in antiviral defense, IFIT3 acts as a bridge between the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) complex and TBK1, facilitating the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which are essential for promoting immune responses (Pidugu2019Emerging). IFIT3 also plays a role in regulating apoptosis by inhibiting IFIT2-dependent apoptotic pathways, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis during viral infections (Pidugu2019Emerging; Zhou2013Interferon).

IFIT3 is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular processes related to immune signaling and antiviral activity (Zhou2013Interferon). Its expression is tightly regulated by interferon-stimulated response elements and pattern recognition receptors, which detect viral components and activate downstream signaling pathways (Zhou2013Interferon; Pidugu2019Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFIT3 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), high expression of IFIT3 is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival. IFIT3 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing EGFR signaling, and its expression levels may influence the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies like gefitinib (Pidugu2019IFIT1; Pidugu2019Emerging).

In pancreatic cancer, IFIT3 overexpression is linked to an aggressive cancer phenotype, characterized by increased tumor mass, higher metastasis rates, and resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy. This is partly due to its role in promoting VEGF secretion and creating a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment (Wang2020Inflammatory; Niess2014Overexpression).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high IFIT3 expression correlates with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival. It is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune escape mechanisms, as well as resistance to certain drugs, although it may indicate sensitivity to dasatinib (Zhao2023The).

IFIT3 is also implicated in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), where its upregulation in biliary epithelial cells is linked to increased cell proliferation and decreased cellular senescence, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Sasaki2021Interferoninduced).

## Interactions
IFIT3, a member of the IFIT family, is known for its role in forming protein complexes and interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids. It primarily interacts with other IFIT family members, such as IFIT1 and IFIT2, through a conserved YxxxL motif in the C-terminus, forming multiprotein complexes that are crucial for antiviral activity (Vladimer2014IFITs:; Pidugu2019Emerging). IFIT3 acts as a central scaffold in these complexes, regulating the functions of IFIT1 and IFIT2. Although IFIT3 does not directly bind 5' triphosphate RNA (PPP-RNA), it enhances the binding activity of IFIT1, which is essential for inhibiting viral replication (Vladimer2014IFITs:).

IFIT3 also interacts with cellular proteins through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. These motifs allow IFIT3 to bind distinct cellular proteins, contributing to its role in forming complexes with other IFIT proteins (Pidugu2019Emerging). IFIT3 has been shown to interact with Annexin-2 (ANX2) to enhance EGFR endocytic recycling, promoting cancer cell invasion (Pidugu2019Emerging). Additionally, IFIT3 interacts with Hsp90α and Hsp90β, influencing the activity and stability of Hsp90 client proteins, which are important for cell survival and metastasis (Pidugu2019Emerging).
