# LRIG1

## Overview
LRIG1 (leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The LRIG1 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains, facilitating its role as a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 (Ji2022LRIG1; Simion2014The). By promoting the degradation of these receptors, LRIG1 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent excessive proliferation. It is particularly significant in maintaining stem cell quiescence in various tissues, including the epidermis and the central nervous system (Marqués-Torrejón2021LRIG1; Jensen2006Singlecell). Additionally, LRIG1 functions as a tumor suppressor, with its expression levels influencing cancer progression and patient prognosis in several types of cancer, including non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma (Ji2022LRIG1; Billing2021LRIG1).

## Structure
The LRIG1 protein is a type I single-transmembrane protein characterized by several distinct domains. Its structure includes an ectodomain with a signal peptide, 15 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), C2-type immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail (Ji2022LRIG1). The LRRs are 22-amino acid sequence motifs rich in leucine, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Ji2022LRIG1). The ectodomain is crucial for interacting with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, ErbB3, and TrkB, and is highly glycosylated (Neirinckx2017Harnessing). The LRR domain is crescent-shaped, while the Ig domains form a rod-shaped structure (Neirinckx2017Harnessing).

LRIG1 is involved in the regulation of growth factor receptors and functions as a negative regulator of several RTKs, including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 (Ji2022LRIG1; Simion2014The). It promotes the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl through its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the ubiquitylation and degradation of ERBB receptors (Ji2022LRIG1). LRIG1 can also regulate EGFR independently of Cbl, as seen in glioblastoma (Ji2022LRIG1). The protein may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization.

## Function
LRIG1 (leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and maintaining stem cell quiescence. It acts as a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by promoting their degradation, which helps control cell proliferation and differentiation (Jensen2006Singlecell; Ledda2008Lrig1). In the epidermis, LRIG1 expression defines a distinct population of multipotent stem cells and is essential for maintaining these cells in a quiescent, nondividing state. Loss of LRIG1 leads to hyperproliferation and epidermal hyperplasia (Jensen2009Lrig1; Jensen2006Singlecell).

In the central nervous system, LRIG1 is a critical regulator of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone, where it constrains proliferation by modulating epidermal growth factor signaling. Disruption of LRIG1 results in increased NSC activation and proliferation (Marqués-Torrejón2021LRIG1). LRIG1 also plays a role in the gastrointestinal tract, marking a distinct population of intestinal stem cells and acting as a tumor suppressor by regulating stem cell quiescence (Ji2022LRIG1). Through these mechanisms, LRIG1 contributes to tissue integrity and cancer suppression by preventing excessive cell proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the LRIG1 gene are associated with various cancers, where it often functions as a tumor suppressor. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high LRIG1 expression is linked to better survival outcomes, while its downregulation, often due to promoter hypermethylation, is associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ji2022LRIG1). In breast cancer, LRIG1 acts as a negative growth regulator, with higher expression correlating with improved clinical outcomes. Loss of LRIG1 is common in high-grade breast tumors and is linked to increased risk of metastasis and relapse (Ji2022LRIG1).

In melanoma, LRIG1 is a pan-negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and is downregulated during early melanoma development. Its expression levels correlate with patient survival, particularly in the triple wild-type subtype and tumors with high EGFR expression (Billing2021LRIG1). In glioma, LRIG1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, with reduced expression promoting tumor progression. Overexpression of LRIG1 in glioma cells can inhibit invasion and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mao2018Lrig1).

In thyroid cancer, LRIG1 negatively regulates RET mutants, and its downregulation is observed in thyroid carcinoma cases, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Lindquist2018LRIG1). Overall, alterations in LRIG1 expression or function are significant in the progression and prognosis of various cancers.

## Interactions
LRIG1 is known to interact with various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), playing a significant role in modulating their activity. It acts as an endogenous inhibitor of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, physically interacting with Ret to inhibit its activation and downstream signaling. This interaction reduces the binding of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to Ret, affecting its recruitment to lipid rafts and subsequent signaling pathways, such as MAPK activation (Ledda2008Lrig1).

LRIG1 also interacts with the Met receptor, enhancing its degradation through a lysosome-dependent mechanism. This process is largely independent of the proteasome and c-Cbl, a protein typically involved in receptor degradation. LRIG1's interaction with Met leads to decreased receptor expression and stability, impacting cellular responses to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Shattuck2007LRIG1).

In addition to these interactions, LRIG1 binds to receptors in the TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways. It interacts directly with TGFβ receptor subunits, particularly showing a stronger affinity for TGFβR1. LRIG1 also binds to the TGFβ1 ligand, suggesting its involvement in modulating these signaling pathways (Ouzikov2024LRIG1).
