# ACTB

## Overview
The ACTB gene encodes the beta-actin protein, a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic actin isoform in vertebrates. Beta-actin is a critical component of the cytoskeleton, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cell structure, motility, and integrity. As a member of the actin protein family, beta-actin is involved in forming microfilaments that are essential for various cellular processes, including cell growth, migration, and gene expression regulation. The protein's ability to polymerize and depolymerize allows it to facilitate dynamic cellular functions, such as the formation of cellular protrusions and the regulation of the G-actin pool. Beta-actin's interactions with actin-binding proteins and its involvement in signaling pathways underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and transcription regulation (Cuvertino2017ACTB; Pollard2016Actin; Bunnell2011βActin).

## Structure
The ACTB gene encodes the beta-actin protein, a highly conserved component of the cytoskeleton involved in various cellular functions. The primary structure of beta-actin consists of a 375-amino-acid polypeptide chain (Dominguez2011Actin; Pollard2016Actin). This chain folds into a flat protein with a deep medial cleft that binds ATP, a feature critical for its function (Pollard2016Actin). The secondary structure includes multiple domains, with domain 2 playing a crucial role in filament stability and intersubunit contacts (Dominguez2011Actin).

The tertiary structure of beta-actin involves the folding of its polypeptide chain into two major α/β domains, forming clefts for nucleotide and target binding (Dominguez2011Actin). The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of actin monomers into filamentous structures, with actin filaments composed of two strands of subunits in right-handed helices (Pollard2016Actin).

Beta-actin undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its function. These modifications are crucial for its role in cellular processes, including motility and structure maintenance (Dominguez2011Actin). The ACTB gene is also known for its evolutionary conservation, sharing high sequence homology with other actin genes across species (Pollard2016Actin).

## Function
The ACTB gene encodes β-actin, a cytoplasmic actin isoform that is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates and plays a critical role in various cellular processes. β-actin is essential for maintaining cell structure, motility, and integrity by forming microfilaments, which are crucial for cell growth, migration, and the regulation of the G-actin pool (Cuvertino2017ACTB; Bunnell2011βActin). It is predominantly localized at the leading edge of migrating cells, where it facilitates actin polymerization, promoting forward protrusion and cell motility (Ross1997Characterization; Condeelis2005How).

The localization of β-actin mRNA near the cell periphery is mediated by a sequence in the 3' untranslated region known as the 'zipcode,' which is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and directional movement (Ross1997Characterization). β-actin also interacts with various actin-binding proteins, such as profilin, which enhances actin filament elongation and polymerization, essential for cell motility (Condeelis2005How).

In addition to its structural roles, β-actin is involved in gene expression regulation, particularly through the SRF signaling pathway, where it negatively affects the expression of MAL-SRF target genes (Bunnell2011βActin). The protein is also implicated in cell-cycle progression and gene expression regulation within the nucleus (Cuvertino2017ACTB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTB gene, which encodes β-actin, are associated with several clinical conditions. One notable disorder is Baraitser-Winter syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, hearing loss, and brain abnormalities. This syndrome is primarily linked to missense mutations in ACTB, which can affect actin polymerization and interactions with binding proteins, leading to gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects (Patrinostro2018Essential; Parker2020Actin).

ACTB mutations also result in a distinct pleiotropic developmental disorder, marked by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and malformations of internal organs such as the heart and kidneys. These mutations often lead to ACTB haploinsufficiency, causing reduced cell proliferation and altered cell morphology (Cuvertino2017ACTB).

Syndromic thrombocytopenia, associated with variants in exons 5 and 6 of ACTB, is another condition linked to ACTB mutations. This disorder is characterized by thrombocytopenia with enlarged platelets, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The mutations disrupt cytoskeletal dynamics, affecting platelet formation and function (Latham2018Variants).

ACTB mutations can also lead to hearing loss due to their role in maintaining stereocilia length in sensory cells (Patrinostro2018Essential).

## Interactions
The ACTB gene encodes β-actin, a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. β-actin interacts with elongation factor 1α (EF1α) and β-actin mRNA, forming EF1α-F-actin bundles. This interaction is specific, saturable, and of high affinity, suggesting a role in anchoring β-actin mRNA in cell protrusions, which may influence mRNA localization and translation (Liu2002Interactions).

β-actin also interacts with the E2 protein of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). This interaction is crucial for the early stages of the CSFV replication cycle. The interaction occurs through specific regions of both proteins, with β-actin's domain identified between amino acids 95-188. Disruption of β-actin filaments significantly reduces viral replication, indicating its role in viral entry and replication processes (He2014Betaactin).

In cellular dynamics, β-actin is essential for maintaining cell growth, migration, and the G-actin pool. It is involved in the SRF signaling pathway, regulating gene expression by maintaining the G-actin pool. β-actin's interaction with chromatin-remodeling complexes and RNA polymerases suggests a role in transcription regulation (Bunnell2011βActin).
