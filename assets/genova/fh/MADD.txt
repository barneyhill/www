# MADD

## Overview
The MADD gene encodes the MAP kinase activating death domain protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and apoptosis regulation. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is involved in the activation of small GTPases, such as Rab3 and Rab27, which are crucial for membrane trafficking and synaptic vesicle exocytosis. MADD is integral to the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby promoting cell survival and protecting against TNF-α-induced apoptosis. The protein's structure includes a death domain and a DENN domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), influencing cellular responses to stress and apoptosis (Hassan2021Mechanistic; Schneeberger2020Biallelic). MADD's expression in pancreatic β cells also implicates it in insulin processing and secretion, highlighting its significance in glucose metabolism (Pulli2024A). Mutations in the MADD gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical importance (Schneeberger2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The MADD protein, encoded by the MADD gene, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a death domain, which is crucial for its role in apoptotic signaling and interaction with other proteins such as TNFR1 (Hassan2021Mechanistic). The death domain of MADD is composed of two helices joined by a small loop structure, which facilitates interactions with other proteins (Hassan2021Mechanistic). 

MADD is part of the DENN domain protein families and includes a central DENN module flanked by upstream and downstream modules (uDENN and dDENN) (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). The protein also features a serine-rich domain in its C-terminal region (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). 

MADD undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in at least seven different isoforms, each with distinct roles in cell survival and apoptosis (AbuLibdeh2021Homozygous; Schneeberger2020Biallelic). These isoforms include IG20, MADD/DENN, DENN-SV, and KIAA0358, which have varying effects on apoptosis and cell survival (AbuLibdeh2021Homozygous). 

The protein's structure and interactions are further influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and signaling pathways (Schneeberger2020Biallelic).

## Function
The MADD gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular functions, particularly in the regulation of small GTPases, such as Rab3 and Rab27, which are involved in membrane trafficking events. MADD acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate these Rab proteins, which are essential for processes like synaptic exocytosis and vesicle trafficking in neurons and other cell types (Schneeberger2020Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, MADD is involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway, specifically through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to TNF-α. This signaling is crucial for cell survival and function, as MADD helps protect cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis by maintaining proper MAPK signaling (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). MADD also interacts with the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), stimulating TNFR1-dependent activation of MAP kinases ERK and JNK, and the transcription factor NF-kB, which are important for cellular responses to stress (Schneeberger2020Biallelic).

Additionally, MADD is expressed in pancreatic β cells and is involved in insulin processing and secretion. It regulates insulin expression independently of other transcription factors, and its disruption can lead to altered insulin content and secretion, impacting glucose metabolism (Pulli2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MADD gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, ranging from mild developmental delay to severe multisystem disorders. These conditions often include severe developmental delay, hypotonia, sensory and autonomic neuropathy, endocrine and exocrine dysfunction, and hematological anomalies (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). Patients with biallelic MADD variants can exhibit symptoms such as apnoea at birth, muscular hypotonia, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, growth hormone deficiency, and low hemoglobin levels (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). 

A specific splice site variant in MADD, leading to the skipping of exon 30, has been linked to developmental delay, diabetes, congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. This variant affects hormone expression in pancreatic β cells and pituitary gonadotropes, resulting in reduced insulin content and secretion, as well as decreased luteinizing hormone expression (Pulli2024A). 

The clinical manifestations of MADD deficiency show overlap with other conditions, such as infantile-onset multisystem neurological, endocrine, and pancreatic disease (IMNEPD) and neonatal diabetes mellitus with congenital hypothyroidism (NDH) syndrome (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). Despite the variability in clinical presentation, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established (AbdelSalam2024New).

## Interactions
MADD (MAP kinase activating death domain) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1), playing a role in TNFR1-dependent activation of MAP kinases ERK and JNK, as well as the transcription factor NF-kB. Under stress conditions mediated by TNF-α, MADD can switch its binding partners from Rab proteins to TNFR1, highlighting its role in apoptosis and cell survival pathways (Schneeberger2020Biallelic).

MADD also acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab3, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release (Schneeberger2020Biallelic). In Alzheimer's disease, MADD interacts with TNFR1 to mediate downstream signaling pathways that lead to neuronal cell death. Key residues such as Asp400, Arg58, and Arg59 are involved in these interactions, which are significant for the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Hassan2021Mechanistic).

Additionally, MADD is associated with the apoptotic signaling pathway and is conserved in neoplastic cells. In Alzheimer's disease, altered expression of TNFR1 binding proteins promotes JNK activation via apoptosis signaling kinase (ASK1), with MADD and TRAF2 being inhibited, suggesting their non-participation in JNK-ERK mediated cell death or survival cascades (Hassan2021Mechanistic).
