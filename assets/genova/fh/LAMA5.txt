# LAMA5

## Overview
LAMA5 is a gene that encodes the laminin subunit alpha 5, a critical component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is a part of the laminin family, which are heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains. Laminin subunit alpha 5 plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of basement membranes, which are specialized structures that separate epithelial or endothelial cells from underlying tissues. It is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, by interacting with integrins and other cell surface receptors (Domogatskaya2012Functional; Miner2008Laminins). LAMA5 is particularly significant in the nervous system, kidney, and skeletal development, and its mutations are associated with several clinical conditions, including skeletal disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, and certain cancers (Luo2022Recessive; CarmonaRodríguez2022Superoxide; Barad2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The LAMA5 gene encodes the laminin subunit alpha 5, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is part of the laminin heterotrimer, which includes one alpha, one beta, and one gamma chain, forming a cross-shaped structure essential for basement membrane integrity (Miner2004LAMININ; Miner2008Laminins). The primary structure of LAMA5 includes a signal peptide, a Laminin N terminal domain, 22 Laminin EGF-like domains, one Laminin IV type A domain, and five Laminin G-like domains (Luo2022Recessive). 

The secondary structure of LAMA5 involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of laminin proteins, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates the assembly of the heterotrimer (Miner2004LAMININ). 

In terms of quaternary structure, LAMA5 forms part of laminin-10 and laminin-11 heterotrimers, which are involved in forming a polygonal network and interacting with extracellular matrix components (Luo2022Recessive; Miner2008Laminins). 

LAMA5 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functional properties. Notably, splice variants such as LaNt α5 have been identified, which contain a laminin N-terminal domain followed by laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like repeats (Hamill2009Identification).

## Function
Laminin subunit alpha 5 (LAMA5) is a crucial component of basement membranes, which are specialized extracellular matrices that separate epithelial or endothelial cells from underlying tissues. LAMA5 is involved in maintaining tissue structural integrity and facilitating communication between cell layers (Jones2020A). It forms part of the laminin family, which consists of alpha, beta, and gamma chains that assemble into various heterotrimeric isoforms, such as LM-511, LM-521, and LM-523, found in tissues like epithelia, endothelia, and the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney (Jones2020A).

In the nervous system, LAMA5 is essential for neurodevelopmental processes, including neurite outgrowth, neuronal migration, and synaptic stability. It is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it regulates neuronal migration and synapse stability (Luo2022Recessive). LAMA5 interacts with integrins and other membrane-associated proteins, facilitating cell adhesion and signaling pathways that are crucial for cellular integrity and motility (Domogatskaya2012Functional).

In the kidney, LAMA5 is vital for the development and function of the glomerular basement membrane, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the glomeruli, the kidney's filtering units (Steenhard2011Transgenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAMA5 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Biallelic mutations in LAMA5 can lead to a distinct skeletal disorder known as bent bone dysplasia. This condition is characterized by bent long bones, contractures, and facial dysmorphisms, resulting from disruptions in the noncanonical focal adhesion pathway and WNT signaling, which are crucial for proper skeletogenesis (Barad2020Biallelic).

In the eye, dominant mutations in LAMA5 are linked to early posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), a condition that affects the stability of the internal limiting membrane and is part of a multisystem LAMA5-related syndrome. This mutation may also interact with other genetic factors, such as P4HA2, to influence retinal alterations (Napolitano2018Early).

LAMA5 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants in this gene have been associated with epilepsy, particularly infant-onset epilepsy, and developmental delays. The severity of these conditions may depend on the specific location and nature of the LAMA5 variants (Luo2022Recessive).

In cancer, LAMA5 expression levels can influence tumor progression. High LAMA5 expression is negatively correlated with patient survival in certain cancers, such as gastric, lung, and ovarian cancers, due to its impact on immune cell infiltration and tumor microenvironment (CarmonaRodríguez2022Superoxide).

## Interactions
Laminin subunit alpha 5 (LAMA5) is involved in various interactions crucial for cellular processes and tissue architecture. LAMA5 forms part of a laminin network that interacts with integrins, particularly integrin α6β4, which is essential for cell-matrix adhesion and endothelial cell function under flow conditions (Béguin2020Flowinduced). This interaction is significant in maintaining the structural integrity of the endothelial basement membrane and facilitating cellular responses to mechanical forces.

LAMA5 also interacts with β1 integrin, forming a focal adhesion complex that includes noncanonical kinases PYK2 and FYN. This complex is vital for proper skeletogenesis and WNT signaling, impacting the actin cytoskeleton and vinculin localization (Barad2020Biallelic). The disruption of LAMA5 affects these pathways, leading to skeletal disorders characterized by bent bone dysplasia.

In the context of immune regulation, LAMA5 interacts with α6 integrin and α-dystroglycan, inhibiting the transendothelial migration of CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells. This interaction is crucial for modulating immune responses and maintaining lymph node structure (Li2020The). These interactions highlight LAMA5's role in various physiological and pathological processes, including skeletal development, vascular function, and immune regulation.
