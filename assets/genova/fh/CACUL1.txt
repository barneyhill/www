# CACUL1

## Overview
CACUL1 is a gene that encodes the protein CDK2 associated cullin domain 1, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and the antioxidant response. The protein functions as a regulatory component, particularly influencing the Nrf2 pathway, which is essential for cellular defense against oxidative stress. By interacting with the Cul3-Keap1 complex, CDK2 associated cullin domain 1 enhances the stability and activity of Nrf2, thereby promoting cell survival under stress conditions (Kigoshi2015CACUL1CAC1). Additionally, the protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle progression by modulating CDK2 activity, which is crucial for the transition from the G1 to S phase, thus facilitating cell proliferation and maintaining genomic stability (Kong2009Identification). The gene's expression and its protein product's interactions are implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states.

## Function
CACUL1 (CDK2 associated cullin domain 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the antioxidant response and cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It acts as a positive regulator of the Nrf2 pathway, which is crucial for the cellular antioxidant response. Under oxidative stress, CACUL1 is up-regulated and associates with the Cul3-Keap1 complex, reducing Nrf2 ubiquitination and enhancing its stability and activity. This stabilization of Nrf2 is essential for enhancing the cellular antioxidant response and cell survival under stress conditions (Kigoshi2015CACUL1CAC1).

In terms of cell cycle regulation, CACUL1 interacts with CDK2, a cyclin-dependent kinase critical for the G1 to S phase transition. It enhances CDK2 kinase activity, promoting cell proliferation. CACUL1 expression is cell cycle-dependent, peaking during the S phase, and it is involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, which is crucial for cell cycle control (Kong2009Identification). CACUL1's interaction with CDK2 suggests its role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (Kong2009Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CACUL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal, gastric, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In colorectal cancer, CACUL1 is highly expressed and acts as a tumor promoter, contributing to cell cycle progression and drug resistance. Its expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its knockout increases drug sensitivity by inducing apoptosis (Tan2022Circular). In gastric cancer, particularly in the context of Helicobacter pylori infection, CACUL1 is upregulated, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis. This upregulation is associated with increased expression of proteins like Slug and MMP-9, which are involved in cancer cell invasion (Kong2013Helicobacter).

In childhood ALL, a regulatory variant near CACUL1, rs1247117, affects its expression and is associated with vincristine resistance. The risk G allele of this variant decreases CACUL1 expression, correlating with increased risk of minimal residual disease after chemotherapy (Bhattarai2023Functional). These findings suggest that CACUL1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CACUL1, a gene encoding a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to be transcriptionally activated by CDC5L, a protein that shares homology with transcription factors and has been shown to activate transcription in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the NSF-CDC5L-CACUL1 axis is crucial for promoting tumor growth and metastasis, with CDC5L binding to the promoter region of CACUL1 to activate its transcription (Zhu2023NSF).

In colorectal cancer (CC), CACUL1 is regulated by the circZFR/miR-147a axis. CircZFR acts as a 'sponge' for miR-147a, which in turn downregulates CACUL1 expression. This interaction influences cell cycle progression and apoptosis in CC cells (Tan2022Circular). Additionally, miR-219a-5p has been shown to directly bind to the 3' UTR of CACUL1 mRNA, regulating its expression and affecting neuronal apoptosis through the akt/Foxo3a and p53/Bcl-2 signaling pathways (Yan2019Screening).

These interactions highlight CACUL1's role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cancer progression, through its involvement in complex regulatory networks.
