# SDC3

## Overview
Syndecan-3 (SDC3) is a gene that encodes the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan known as syndecan 3. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, primarily through its interactions with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Syndecan 3 is predominantly expressed in neural and developing musculoskeletal tissues, where it plays a critical role in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The protein's structure includes a core protein with multiple GAG attachment sites, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which are essential for its functional behavior and interactions with other molecules. Syndecan 3 is implicated in several physiological pathways, such as the INSR/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in muscle development and the WNT signaling pathway in bone formation. Additionally, it has clinical significance in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease, where it influences inflammatory responses and energy balance (Arokiasamy2020Syndecan3; Hudák2022Syndecan3; Jones2022The; Kehoe2014Syndecan3).

## Structure
Syndecan-3 (SDC3) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan composed of 442 amino acids in humans. Its primary structure includes a core protein with seven potential glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites, predominantly heparan sulfate (HS) chains, which are crucial for its biological interactions (Arokiasamy2020Syndecan3). The extracellular domain is characterized by these GAG attachment sites, with four near the N-terminus and three closer to the transmembrane domain (Arokiasamy2020Syndecan3).

The secondary structure of SDC3 includes a single transmembrane domain, which is involved in dimerization. This process is facilitated by motifs such as G9XXXA13, contributing to the formation of stable dimers (Chen2020Multiple; Chen2021Multiple). The cytoplasmic domain is 33 amino acids long and contains conserved C1 and C2 domains, with a variable region unique to each syndecan family member (Arokiasamy2020Syndecan3).

In terms of tertiary structure, SDC3 forms SDS-insoluble dimers mediated by residues in the transmembrane domain and a membrane-proximal ERKE motif (Arokiasamy2020Syndecan3). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for its functional behavior, with the GXXXA motif playing a significant role in stabilizing these dimers (Chen2020Multiple; Chen2021Multiple). The shedding of SDC3, where the extracellular domain is cleaved by matrix-metalloproteases, is a notable post-translational modification, although specific cleavage sites and proteases are not fully confirmed (Arokiasamy2020Syndecan3).

## Function
Syndecan-3 (SDC3) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. It is primarily expressed in neural tissues and developing musculoskeletal tissues, where it mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions through its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which can include both heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) (Afratis2016Syndecans). These GAG chains enable SDC3 to interact with growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components, influencing biological functions such as neurite outgrowth and neural development (Afratis2016Syndecans).

In the context of muscle development, SDC3 is involved in regulating myogenesis through the INSR/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. It acts as a molecular switch, promoting proliferation in early stages by inhibiting AKT activation, thus preventing premature differentiation. As myogenesis progresses, SDC3 expression decreases, allowing differentiation to proceed (Jones2022The). SDC3 also plays a role in bone formation by enhancing the canonical WNT signaling pathway, which is crucial for osteoblastogenesis and maintaining normal bone structure (Johnson2019Syndecan3).

SDC3 is also implicated in modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity during limb cartilage differentiation, acting as both a facilitator and inhibitor at different stages of chondrogenesis (Fisher2006Heparan). In muscle tissue, SDC3 is essential for proper satellite cell function and muscle repair, influencing the expression and localization of key myogenic factors (Cornelison2004Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Syndecan-3 (SDC3) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in inflammation and cell signaling. In the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SDC3 is pro-inflammatory in the joint, facilitating chemokine presentation and leukocyte recruitment, which contributes to joint inflammation and damage. SDC3 knockout mice exhibit reduced joint swelling and leukocyte accumulation, suggesting that targeting SDC3 could be beneficial in treating RA (Kehoe2014Syndecan3).

In obesity, SDC3 is involved in energy balance and body weight regulation. Mice lacking the SDC3 gene show resistance to diet-induced obesity, characterized by reduced adipose content and increased energy expenditure. This suggests that SDC3 could be a target for obesity treatment, particularly in the context of high-fat diets (Strader2004Mice).

SDC3 is also being explored as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its expression is increased in response to inflammatory stimuli like TNF-α, correlating with amyloid plaque load in the brain. This indicates that SDC3 could serve as a peripheral biomarker for AD, reflecting amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation (Hudák2022Syndecan3).

## Interactions
Syndecan-3 (SDC3) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that participates in various physical interactions with proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. SDC3 interacts with several growth factors, including Agouti related protein (AgRP), heparin binding growth associated molecule (HB-GAM), glial cell line derived growth factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), artemin (PSPN), and NOTCH, primarily through its heparan sulfate chains (De2013A). It also binds to chemokines such as CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL8, with low nanomolar binding affinities, playing a role in modulating chemokine interactions in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (Eustace2019Soluble).

SDC3 forms a molecular complex with the insulin receptor (INSR), selectively regulating the INSR signaling pathway, particularly the PI3K/AKT/mTOR branch, while not interacting with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) (Jones2022The). This interaction modulates insulin signaling, affecting processes such as myogenesis (Jones2022The). SDC3 also interacts with integrins, influencing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) adhesion to collagen and regulating signaling pathways like AKT and ERK1/2 (Jones2020Syndecan3). These interactions highlight SDC3's role in cellular adhesion, migration, and signaling.
