# SS18

## Overview
The SS18 gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) chromatin remodeling complex, which is instrumental in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. The SS18 protein, also known as the SS18 subunit of the BAF complex, plays a crucial role in cell differentiation and development by facilitating the pluripotent-somatic transition through phase separation mechanisms (Kuang2021SS18). As a stable subunit of the BAF complex, SS18 interacts with several key components, including Brg/Brm ATPase and BAF47, and is involved in the selective assembly of chromatin remodeling complexes (Kadoch2013Reversible). Clinically, the SS18 gene is significant due to its involvement in synovial sarcoma, where it forms a fusion with SSX genes, leading to oncogenic activity by disrupting normal chromatin remodeling processes (Kadoch2013Reversible; McBride2018The). Understanding the function and interactions of SS18 is essential for elucidating its role in both normal cellular processes and disease pathogenesis.

## Function
The SS18 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. In healthy human cells, SS18 is involved in the regulation of the pluripotent-somatic transition (PST), a crucial process in cell differentiation and development. SS18 facilitates this transition by forming nuclear condensates through phase separation, a process driven by its C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) rich in tyrosine residues (Kuang2021SS18).

The protein interacts specifically with the BAF complex, promoting its assembly while inhibiting the assembly of the PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF) complex. This selective interaction is mediated by the N-terminal domain of SS18, which is essential for recruiting components like BRG1, a key part of the BAF complex (Kuang2021SS18). The balance between BAF and PBAF complexes is crucial for proper cell fate transitions, with SS18 playing a pivotal role in maintaining this balance (Kuang2021SS18). Through these interactions, SS18 contributes to the precise regulation of cell fate decisions during early embryonic development (Kuang2021SS18).

## Clinical Significance
The SS18 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in synovial sarcoma, a type of aggressive soft tissue cancer. This malignancy is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation, t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which fuses the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 with one of the SSX genes on the X chromosome, resulting in the SS18-SSX fusion protein. This fusion protein is present in nearly all cases of synovial sarcoma and is often the sole cytogenetic abnormality, underscoring its critical role in the disease's pathogenesis (Kadoch2013Reversible; McBride2018The; Middeljans2012SS18).

The SS18-SSX fusion protein disrupts the normal function of BAF chromatin remodeling complexes by replacing the wild-type SS18 and evicting the tumor suppressor BAF47. This disruption leads to the activation of oncogenic pathways, such as the activation of Sox2, which is essential for tumor proliferation (Kadoch2013Reversible; McBride2018The). The fusion protein's ability to hijack BAF complex targeting and function is a key oncogenic mechanism in synovial sarcoma, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Cheng2022Phase; McBride2018The). Understanding the SS18-SSX fusion's impact on chromatin remodeling and gene expression provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for synovial sarcoma (McBride2018The).

## Interactions
The SS18 protein is a stable subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, interacting with several key components such as Brg/Brm ATPase, BAF250a, BAF155, and BAF47 (Kadoch2013Reversible). It does not associate with polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 or PRC2 and is not found as a free monomer, indicating its strong integration within the BAF complex (Kadoch2013Reversible).

In synovial sarcoma, the SS18 gene fuses with SSX genes, forming the SS18-SSX fusion protein, which competes with wild-type SS18 for incorporation into BAF complexes. This fusion protein displaces the tumor suppressor BAF47, affecting the complex's function and promoting oncogenic activity (Kadoch2013Reversible). The SS18-SSX fusion also interacts with chromatin modifiers and is involved in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), crucial for recruiting BRG1 into phase-separated condensates, which is essential for its oncogenic activity (Cheng2022Phase).

SS18 interacts with other proteins such as AF10, GAS41, and the histone acetyltransferase p300, suggesting its role as a transcriptional co-activator (de2006The). It also forms a heterodimer with BRG1, similar to the yeast SNF11/SNF2 interaction, indicating a conserved mechanism (Cheng2022Phase).
