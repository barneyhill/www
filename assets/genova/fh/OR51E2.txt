# OR51E2

## Overview
OR51E2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily E member 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in olfactory signaling and various physiological processes. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and is primarily known for its role in detecting short-chain fatty acids such as propionate and acetate. OR51E2 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the prostate, lung, and airway smooth muscle cells, where it participates in diverse cellular signaling pathways. In the context of human reproduction, it plays a crucial role in sperm chemotaxis and activation. Clinically, OR51E2 is significant due to its overexpression in prostate cancer, where it is associated with disease progression and neuroendocrine differentiation. Additionally, its involvement in other cancer types and potential implications in androgen sensitivity highlight its broader relevance in human health (Abaffy2018A; Aisenberg2016Defining; Teveroni2022ShortChain).

## Structure
The human odorant receptor OR51E2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in olfactory signaling. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes a conserved arginine residue (R262) critical for receptor activation by engaging the carboxylic acid of propionate (de2023Engineered). The secondary structure of OR51E2 is characterized by alpha helices typical of GPCRs, forming a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain (Billesbølle2022Structural). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a compact arrangement, with a binding pocket located in a region bounded by transmembrane helices 3, 4, 5, and 6. This pocket is smaller compared to other Class A GPCRs and is fully occluded from the extracellular environment (Billesbølle2022Structural). The receptor's binding site is specifically tuned to short-chain fatty acids like propionate, with interactions involving ionic and hydrogen bonds (Billesbølle2022Structural).

The quaternary structure of OR51E2 includes its interaction with G proteins, as demonstrated by the formation of an OR51E2-Gs complex, which is crucial for its function in cellular signaling (Billesbølle2022Structural). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may affect receptor function and signaling, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
OR51E2, also known as olfactory receptor 51E2, is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. In human sperm cells, OR51E2 is expressed on the surface and plays a crucial role in sperm chemotaxis and activation. It binds to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as propionate and acetate, which are metabolic by-products found in human follicular fluid and vaginal secretions. This binding promotes sperm migration and chemotaxis, essential for successful fertilization (Teveroni2022ShortChain).

OR51E2 is also involved in cellular signaling pathways, including ERK phosphorylation and calcium influx, which are critical for sperm activation. The receptor's activation by SCFAs leads to increased sperm motility and more directed movement towards the oocyte (Teveroni2022ShortChain).

In airway smooth muscle cells, OR51E2 functions as a chemo-mechanical receptor for SCFAs, influencing cytoskeletal remodeling. This receptor's activity affects the cytoskeletal network dynamics, suggesting a role in olfactory-like chemosensory signal transduction (Aisenberg2016Defining). OR51E2's expression in various tissues, including the lung, indicates its potential significance in lung physiology and other cellular processes (Aisenberg2016Defining).

## Clinical Significance
OR51E2, also known as the prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor (PSGR), is significantly implicated in prostate cancer. It is highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues, including prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, prostate adenocarcinoma, and castration-resistant prostate cancer. This overexpression is associated with the progression of prostate cancer to a more aggressive neuroendocrine phenotype, known as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) (Abaffy2018A; Maßberg2016The). Activation of OR51E2 by the testosterone metabolite 19-hydroxyandrostenedione induces neuroendocrine trans-differentiation of prostate cancer cells, characterized by decreased cell viability and cell cycle arrest (Abaffy2018A).

In addition to its role in prostate cancer, OR51E2 is involved in other cancer types, such as melanoma, where its activation can inhibit cell growth and migration (Tong2021Ectopic). The receptor's expression is also linked to androgen sensitivity, which may influence the severity of COVID-19 in males, suggesting a broader clinical significance beyond cancer (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, the diagnostic value of OR51E2 as a sole tumor marker is limited due to its expression in benign tissues and other cancer types (Maßberg2016The).

## Interactions
The olfactory receptor OR51E2 interacts with several proteins and participates in specific signaling pathways. It is known to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) through the Golgi-localized Gβγ-PI3Kγ-ARF1 pathway in prostate cancer cells. This activation involves the translocation and activation of ARF1, a small GTPase, to the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for ERK1/2 activation (Xu2022The). OR51E2 interacts with the G protein Gα12, enhancing Ca2+ signaling, cAMP production, and protein kinase activation (Xu2022The).

In terms of structural interactions, OR51E2 binds to odorants such as propionate, which induces conformational changes that enable G protein engagement. This binding involves specific residues in the receptor's binding pocket, such as R262, which forms a counter-ion interaction with the carboxylic acid group of propionate (Billesbølle2022Structural). The receptor's activation is facilitated by a unique hydrogen-bonding network involving conserved residues R121, H243, and Y217, which are crucial for stabilizing the active conformation (Billesbølle2022Structural). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in both olfactory and non-olfactory tissues, contributing to its function in cellular signaling pathways.
