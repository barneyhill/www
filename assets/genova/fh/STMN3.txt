# STMN3

## Overview
STMN3 is a gene that encodes the protein stathmin 3, a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins, which are crucial for the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Stathmin 3 is primarily involved in the modulation of microtubule depolymerization, a process vital for neuronal development and function, particularly in neurite extension and axonal branching (Chauvin2015Neuronal). The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, especially at neuritic tips and within the axonal growth cone, where it is subject to regulation by phosphorylation through kinases such as GSK-3b (Chauvin2015Neuronal). Beyond its role in neuronal cells, STMN3 is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in non-small cell lung carcinoma, where it contributes to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is regulated by factors such as ID1, nicotine, and epidermal growth factor (Nair2014Nicotinemediated). This dual role in both normal cellular function and disease states underscores the importance of STMN3 as a potential therapeutic target.

## Function
STMN3, or stathmin 3, is a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins that plays a critical role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which is essential for neuronal development and function. In healthy human cells, STMN3 is involved in the control of microtubule depolymerization, a process crucial for neurite extension and axonal branching. This regulation is mediated through its interaction with tubulin, where it sequesters tubulin dimers, preventing their polymerization into microtubules (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

STMN3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, particularly at neuritic tips and within the actin-rich peripheral zone of the axonal growth cone, where it is phosphorylated by kinases such as GSK-3b. This phosphorylation modulates its activity and interaction with microtubules, allowing for precise control of microtubule dynamics in response to intracellular signaling pathways (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

In Purkinje cells, STMN3 is essential for dendritic differentiation, with its depletion leading to inhibited dendritic arborization, while increased levels promote dendritic outgrowth and branching. In hippocampal neurons, STMN3 knock-down enhances axonal branching by preventing its microtubule-destabilizing activity, which promotes microtubule polymerization and splaying from the axon shaft (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
STMN3 (stathmin 3) is implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) through its role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The gene is regulated by the transcription factor ID1, which induces STMN3 expression by repressing other transcriptional repressors such as ZBP89 and NRSF. This regulation is significant in the context of cancer, as STMN3 is over-expressed in various cancers, including adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, contributing to a more malignant phenotype by promoting cell motility and invasion (Nair2014Nicotinemediated).

Nicotine and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been shown to induce STMN3 expression in an ID1-dependent manner, enhancing the tumorigenic properties of lung cancer cells. This induction is crucial as nicotine is a major risk factor for lung cancer, suggesting that STMN3 plays a role in nicotine-mediated cancer progression (Nair2014Nicotinemediated). The modulation of STMN3 by nicotine and EGF highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, as its downregulation can inhibit cell proliferation and invasion in NSCLC cells (Nair2014Nicotinemediated). Targeting STMN3 and its regulatory pathways could offer new strategies for cancer therapy, particularly in combating NSCLC (Nair2014Nicotinemediated).
