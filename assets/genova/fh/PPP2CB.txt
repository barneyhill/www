# PPP2CB

## Overview
The PPP2CB gene encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular processes. The protein product, protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit beta, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell growth, division, and signaling pathways by dephosphorylating serine and threonine residues on target proteins (Clark2019Protein). As a component of the PP2A holoenzyme, it forms a heterotrimeric complex with a scaffolding A subunit and a regulatory B subunit, which confers substrate specificity and localization (Vaneynde2022The). The PPP2CB-encoded protein is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the cell cycle (Seshacharyulu2013Phosphatase:). Through its involvement in diverse signaling pathways, PPP2CB contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and metabolism (Haesen2014The).

## Structure
The PPP2CB gene encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase. The primary structure of PPP2CB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the catalytic domain, which is highly conserved across the PPP family of phosphatases (Cohen2010Phosphatase). This domain is responsible for binding divalent metal ions, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Cohen2010Phosphatase).

The secondary structure of the PPP2CB protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its globular shape (Seshacharyulu2013Phosphatase:). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function as a catalytic subunit (Cohen2010Phosphatase).

In terms of quaternary structure, PPP2CB forms part of the PP2A holoenzyme, which typically includes a scaffolding A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. The B subunits confer substrate specificity and localization, allowing the formation of over 100 distinct PP2A complexes (Vaneynde2022The). Post-translational modifications such as methylation and phosphorylation regulate the activity and assembly of the PP2A holoenzyme, affecting its catalytic efficiency and interactions with other proteins (Seshacharyulu2013Phosphatase:).

## Function
PPP2CB encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. PP2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic C subunit, a scaffolding A subunit, and a regulatory B-type subunit. The C subunits are encoded by two genes, PPP2CA and PPP2CB, which produce nearly identical isoforms, Cα and Cβ, with distinct roles in cellular processes (Haesen2014The).

PPP2CB is involved in dephosphorylating serine and threonine residues on proteins, which is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as cell growth, division, and signaling pathways (Clark2019Protein). The specific composition of PP2A complexes, including the B-type subunit, determines their regulatory inputs and substrate specificity, allowing for specificity in their physiological functions (Haesen2014The). PPP2CB is active in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the cell cycle (Seshacharyulu2013Phosphatase:).

In healthy human cells, PPP2CB contributes to the regulation of various signaling pathways, including those controlling cell proliferation, death, division, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and metabolism (Haesen2014The).

## Interactions
PPP2CB, the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its regulatory functions in cellular processes. PPP2CB forms part of the PP2A heterotrimeric complex, which includes regulatory and scaffolding subunits. In a study by Glatter et al., PPP2CB was shown to interact with 32 proteins, including members of the human prefoldin family, suggesting a potential link between PPP2CB and the prefoldin complex (Glatter2009An). This interaction network is highly reproducible and robust, with many interactions occurring between paralogous proteins (Glatter2009An).

The study also identified a highly connected PP2A subnetwork using PPP2CB as a bait protein, which includes regulatory B subunits known as striatins, the serine/threonine protein kinase MST4, and other proteins such as SLMAP, FAM40A, and FAM40B (Glatter2009An). These interactions suggest the existence of higher-order PP2A complexes. The IGBP1/alpha4 module, which forms complexes with catalytic subunits in the absence of scaffolding A or regulatory B subunits, was also identified, indicating its involvement in processes like cell survival and learning (Glatter2009An).
