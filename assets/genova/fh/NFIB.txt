# NFIB

## Overview
The NFIB gene encodes the nuclear factor I B (NFIB) protein, a transcription factor that belongs to the Nuclear Factor I (NFI) family. This protein is characterized by its DNA-binding and dimerization capabilities, facilitated by the conserved MH1 domain, and plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during development and differentiation (Fletcher1999Exon; Zhang2023NFIB). NFIB is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization, replication licensing, and transcription regulation, through its interactions with components of the pre-replication complex and other proteins (Zhang2023NFIB). It is crucial for the development of the lung and brain, influencing the differentiation of epithelial and neural cells, respectively (Steele-Perkins2005The; Harris2014Nuclear). Additionally, NFIB has been implicated in cancer progression, acting as an oncogene in certain contexts, such as small cell lung cancer, while its altered expression is associated with various developmental disorders and malignancies (BeckerSantos2017Nuclear; Chen2017The).

## Structure
The NFIB protein is a member of the Nuclear Factor I (NFI) family and is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes several key domains. It contains an N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain known as the MH1 domain, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA and dimerization capabilities (Zhang2023NFIB). This domain is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in the protein's function (Fletcher1999Exon).

The C-terminal region of NFIB is involved in transcription modulation and mediates interactions with other proteins, such as components of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) (Zhang2023NFIB). This region is less conserved compared to the N-terminal domain, allowing for functional diversity among NFI family members (Fletcher1999Exon).

NFIB can form homo- or hetero-dimers, which is a feature of its quaternary structure, facilitating its role in transcription regulation and DNA replication (Zhang2023NFIB). The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have distinct functional roles (Fletcher1999Exon). These structural features enable NFIB to participate in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization and replication licensing (Zhang2023NFIB).

## Function
The NFIB gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression during development and differentiation. In healthy human cells, NFIB is involved in promoting the differentiation of various cell types while inhibiting excessive cell proliferation. It is particularly crucial in lung development, where it facilitates the differentiation of lung epithelial cells and the formation of lung saccules, essential for respiratory function. NFIB is predominantly expressed in the lung mesenchyme and works in conjunction with the glucocorticoid receptor to regulate lung maturation (Steele-Perkins2005The; Harris2014Nuclear).

In the brain, NFIB is essential for the development of structures such as the corpus callosum and hippocampus. It regulates the differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells, influencing the formation of neurons and glial cells. NFIB's absence leads to neuroanatomical defects, including agenesis of the corpus callosum and disrupted hippocampal formation (Steele-Perkins2005The; Harris2014Nuclear).

NFIB also plays a role in maintaining stem cell quiescence in adult tissues, such as melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle niche, preventing premature proliferation and differentiation (Harris2014Nuclear). It is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate transcription, impacting cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NFIB gene have been implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), NFIB is frequently underexpressed, and its down-regulation by oncofetal miRNAs like miR-92b-3p is associated with poor patient outcomes (BeckerSantos2016Developmental). In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), NFIB acts as an oncogene, promoting metastasis and tumor progression (BeckerSantos2017Nuclear; Chen2017The). Conversely, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NFIB down-regulation correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Chen2017The).

NFIB also plays a role in breast cancer, where its overexpression is linked to aggressive phenotypes in estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma (Chen2017The). In adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC), NFIB is involved in MYB-NFIB fusion events, which disrupt normal epithelial cell differentiation and contribute to tumorigenesis (Chen2017The). Additionally, NFIB has been associated with developmental defects, such as callosal agenesis and lung maturation issues, in NFIB-deficient mice, highlighting its importance in brain and lung development (Steele-Perkins2005The). These findings underscore the complex and context-dependent roles of NFIB in both cancer and development.

## Interactions
NFIB (nuclear factor I B) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in DNA replication and cancer progression. NFIB interacts with components of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) such as MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, CDT1, ORC1, and CDC6. These interactions are essential for NFIB's role in replication licensing, as it facilitates the assembly of the pre-RC by increasing chromatin accessibility (Zhang2023NFIB). 

In the context of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), NFIB is methylated by CARM1, which is crucial for tumor growth. This methylation promotes the recruitment of TRIM29, enhancing NFIB's transcriptional activity. The interaction between NFIB and TRIM29 is dependent on the methylation status of NFIB, highlighting the importance of CARM1-mediated methylation in SCLC progression (Gao2023The). 

NFIB also associates with the FACT complex, a histone chaperone involved in nucleosome remodeling, which further supports its role in increasing chromatin accessibility and facilitating replication (Zhang2023NFIB). These interactions underscore NFIB's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as an oncogenic driver in various cancers.
