# RNF44

## Overview
RNF44 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 44, which is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a category of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation or modulating their activity and localization. The RNF44 protein is involved in crucial cellular processes, including protein turnover and signal transduction, by mediating ubiquitination pathways. It operates within both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular pathways essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to external stimuli. The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular function and its potential implications in various diseases (Huang2021Bioinformatics; Mahood2015The; Viré2022Gene).

## Structure


## Function
RNF44, or ring finger protein 44, is a gene that encodes a protein containing a RING finger domain, which is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that plays a significant role in tagging proteins for degradation, regulating protein activity, or altering their cellular location. This process is essential for maintaining protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. RNF44 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular pathways. By participating in ubiquitination, RNF44 contributes to the regulation of signal transduction pathways, which are vital for cellular communication and response to external stimuli. The protein's activity in these pathways helps maintain the balance of cellular processes, ensuring proper cell function and organismal health. Through its involvement in these molecular processes, RNF44 plays a critical role in maintaining the stability and functionality of proteins within the cell, thereby supporting overall cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
RNF44, a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein degradation. In melanoma, RNF44 expression is significantly elevated in cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). This elevation is associated with the degradation of AMPK-α1, contributing to the cells' sensitivity to arginine deprivation, a potential therapeutic strategy for BRAFi-resistant melanoma (Li2014Abstract). 

In cervical cancer, RNF44 is linked to the expression of certain long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are involved in cancer-related pathways, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Huang2024A). 

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, RNF44 is a target of dysregulated microRNAs in prion diseases such as sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Altered miRNA expression leads to changes in RNF44 levels, which may contribute to disease progression (Viré2022Gene). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RNF44 in various diseases, where its altered expression or interaction with other proteins can influence disease pathways and potentially serve as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
RNF44, a member of the RING finger protein family, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a RING domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, often participating in ubiquitination pathways. In the context of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), RNF44 expression in embryonic rat lungs is positively correlated with miR-384-5P expression, suggesting a potential role in vascular remodeling associated with CDH-related pulmonary hypertension (Mahood2015The).

In osteoarthritis, RNF44 is part of a regulatory network involving miR-98-5p, indicating a potential interaction between these molecules (Huang2021Bioinformatics). The study by Jiménez-López et al. identifies RNF44 as part of a clade of RING-H2 ubiquitin ligases, suggesting evolutionary conservation and potential interactions with other proteins in this family (JiménezLópez2018CTLs).

Although the study by Liu et al. was retracted, it initially suggested that RNF44 interacts with miR-125a-5p in oral squamous cell carcinoma, affecting glycometabolism and cisplatin resistance (Liu2022RETRACTED). However, due to the retraction, these findings should be interpreted with caution.
