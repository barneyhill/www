# CNDP2

## Overview
CNDP2, or carnosine dipeptidase 2, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic enzyme belonging to the M20 metalloprotease family. The protein product of CNDP2 is a nonspecific metalloprotease that plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of dipeptides, particularly those involved in glutathione metabolism. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis by facilitating the availability of cysteine for glutathione synthesis (Kobayashi2021Carnosine). CNDP2 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and is characterized by its manganese-dependent catalytic activity, although it does not degrade homocarnosine or carnosine at physiological pH (Caruso2019Pivotal; Chmielewska2024Human). The enzyme's broad substrate specificity and involvement in cellular processes such as protein metabolism and oxidative stress management underscore its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer (Chmielewska2024Human).

## Structure
The CNDP2 protein, also known as carnosine dipeptidase 2, is a member of the M20 metalloprotease family. It is a cytosolic nonspecific metalloprotease with a molecular mass of approximately 52.7 kDa (Chmielewska2024Human). The protein is composed of 473 amino acids and forms a homodimer, with each subunit containing a catalytic domain and a dimerization domain (Okumura2017The; Teufel2003Sequence). The catalytic domain includes a dinuclear metal-binding site, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This site is composed of specific amino acids, including His99, Asp132, Glu167, Asp195, and His445, which coordinate manganese ions necessary for catalysis (Unno2008Structural; Okumura2017The).

The CNDP2 protein structure is characterized by a homodimeric arrangement, with each subunit divided into two domains. Domain A contains 12 α-helices and a large twisted β-sheet, while Domain B has a similar β-sheet and seven α-helices (Unno2008Structural). The active site of CNDP2 involves interactions with metal ions and is inhibited by bestatin, a competitive inhibitor (Unno2008Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by interactions between subunits, enhancing the interface surface area (Unno2008Structural).

## Function
CNDP2, or carnosine dipeptidase 2, is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of dipeptides, particularly those related to glutathione metabolism. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox balance by facilitating the availability of cysteine for glutathione synthesis, which is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent cell death (Kobayashi2021Carnosine). CNDP2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is a manganese-dependent metalloprotease with broad substrate specificity, although it does not degrade homocarnosine or carnosine at physiological pH (Caruso2019Pivotal; Chmielewska2024Human).

In healthy human cells, CNDP2 is involved in the breakdown of carnosine and other dipeptides, contributing to carnosine homeostasis and the regulation of histidine-containing dipeptides (Caruso2019Pivotal). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular processes such as protein metabolism and oxidative stress management, which may have implications for cancerogenesis (Chmielewska2024Human). CNDP2's role in hydrolyzing glutathione-related peptides is particularly important under conditions of cysteine insufficiency, supporting cell survival by maintaining glutathione levels (Kobayashi2021Carnosine).

## Clinical Significance
The CNDP2 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions through changes in its expression and interactions. In cancer, CNDP2 exhibits a dual role. It is upregulated in tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma and renal carcinoma, where it functions as a tumor suppressor by activating the MAPK pathway. Conversely, in colon cancer cells, CNDP2 knockdown inhibits growth, suggesting a tumorigenic role. This duality indicates that CNDP2's role in cancer is context-dependent, and its suppression could be beneficial for anticancer therapy (Kobayashi2021Carnosine).

CNDP2 also plays a protective role against oxidative stress, particularly in the liver and kidneys. CNDP2 knockout mice show aggravated liver and kidney damage following acetaminophen overdose, highlighting its protective function under oxidative stress conditions (Kobayashi2021Carnosine). The gene's involvement in ferroptosis suppression is linked to its ability to enhance glutathione peroxidase activities by elevating cellular glutathione levels, providing protection against oxidative stress (Kobayashi2021Carnosine).

Overexpression of CNDP2 in tumor cells can lead to resistance against anticancer agents due to increased glutathione content, suggesting that targeting CNDP2 activity with inhibitors like bestatin may enhance sensitivity to treatment and contribute to anti-tumorigenic effects (Kobayashi2021Carnosine).
