# SPRR2E

## Overview
SPRR2E is a gene that encodes the small proline-rich protein 2E, which is part of the SPRR family of proteins. These proteins are integral to the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in the epidermis, a critical component of the skin's barrier function. The SPRR2E protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining the integrity and resilience of the skin barrier. It contributes to the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing the antioxidant properties of the CE and protecting the skin from oxidative stress induced by environmental factors such as UV radiation (Vermeij2011ROS; Vermeij2012Proteomic). The expression of SPRR2E is predominantly observed in the upper layers of cornifying tissues, where it is regulated by various transcription factors to adapt to environmental challenges (Vermeij2012Proteomic). Through its structural and protective functions, SPRR2E plays a vital role in maintaining skin health and resilience.

## Function
SPRR2E (small proline-rich protein 2E) is a member of the SPRR family, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in the epidermis. This protein is involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to the antioxidant properties of the CE, which serves as the skin's first line of defense against oxidative stress caused by environmental factors such as UV irradiation (Vermeij2011ROS; Vermeij2012Proteomic). SPRR2E achieves this by forming disulfide bonds through its cysteine residues, which are essential for quenching ROS and protecting cellular components from oxidative damage (Vermeij2011ROS).

In healthy human cells, SPRR2E is expressed in the upper layers of cornifying tissues, where it helps maintain the integrity of the skin barrier by providing a protective antioxidant shield (Vermeij2012Proteomic). The protein's expression is regulated by various transcription factors, allowing the skin to adapt to oxidative stress and other environmental challenges (Vermeij2012Proteomic). Through these functions, SPRR2E plays a significant role in maintaining skin health and resilience against environmental stressors.
