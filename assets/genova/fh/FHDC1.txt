# FHDC1

## Overview
FHDC1 is a gene that encodes the protein FH2 domain containing 1, a member of the formin family known for its role in cytoskeletal dynamics. The FHDC1 protein is characterized by its ability to interact with both actin filaments and microtubules, facilitated by its FH1-FH2 domain module and a microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) (Tong2023Collective; Schönichen2010Fifteen). As a cytoskeletal bridging factor, FHDC1 is involved in critical cellular processes such as Golgi morphology regulation, intracellular trafficking, and actin wave propagation (Copeland2016Actin-; Tong2024Collective). Its function is essential for maintaining cell polarity, motility, and division, and it has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, where its expression levels may serve as a prognostic marker (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; Chen2018Gene).

## Structure
The FHDC1 protein, encoded by the human gene FHDC1, is characterized by a unique domain architecture that includes an FH1-FH2 domain module at the N-terminus and a microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) at the C-terminus (Tong2023Collective; Schönichen2010Fifteen). The FH1 domain contains proline-rich stretches that interact with profilin, enhancing actin polymerization (Schönichen2010Fifteen). The FH2 domain is crucial for actin filament nucleation and elongation, functioning in a dimeric state to bind G- and F-actin, and remains attached to the barbed end of the actin filament, promoting the formation of unbranched filaments (Schönichen2010Fifteen).

The C-terminal MTBD of FHDC1 is composed of two well-conserved regions and is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, suggesting a flexible and dynamic nature (Tong2023Collective; Schönichen2010Fifteen). This domain facilitates the association of FHDC1 with microtubules, playing a role in the coordination of actin and microtubule dynamics (Tong2023Collective). The central unstructured region of FHDC1 (residues 501-958) is sufficient for microtubule association, indicating that the binding region may extend beyond the previously identified domain (Tong2023Collective). The protein's ability to interact with both actin and microtubules is essential for its role in cellular processes such as wave propagation and Golgi morphology regulation (Copeland2016Actin-).

## Function
The FHDC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of Golgi morphology and intracellular trafficking in mammalian cells. FHDC1 is a unique microtubule-binding member of the formin family, involved in the formation and maintenance of the Golgi ribbon, a structure essential for cell polarity and subcellular organization (Copeland2016Actin-). It interacts with both the Golgi-derived microtubule network and the actin cytoskeleton, coordinating their dynamics to stabilize Golgi-derived microtubules (Copeland2016Actin-). FHDC1's function is crucial during Golgi assembly, where it is recruited to nascent Golgi-derived microtubules, particularly during recovery from nocodazole treatment (Copeland2016Actin-).

FHDC1 also plays a significant role in actin wave propagation, particularly in mast cells, where it acts as an early-phase regulator of cortical actin waves (Tong2024Collective). The protein's interaction with microtubules is significant, as it exhibits a phase shift ahead of actin, suggesting that its actin nucleation function is inhibited when associated with microtubules (Tong2024Collective). FHDC1's ability to bind directly to both F-actin and microtubules highlights its role as a cytoskeletal bridging factor, essential for maintaining cell polarity, motility, and division (Tong2024Collective).

## Clinical Significance
The FHDC1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. Although direct mutations in FHDC1 have not been extensively documented, alterations in its expression levels have been associated with cancer prognosis. In renal cancer, high levels of FHDC1 transcripts are linked to a favorable prognosis, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). Conversely, FHDC1 is generally downregulated in other cancers, which may affect cancer progression through its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

FHDC1's role in cellular transformation is also highlighted in studies of DNA methylation. It has been found to be hyper-methylated and down-regulated during the malignant transformation of human hepatocyte L02 cells, indicating that epigenetic changes can impact its expression and potentially contribute to cancer development (Chen2018Gene).

While FHDC1's involvement in specific diseases beyond cancer is not well-documented, its critical role in maintaining cell structure and function suggests that dysregulation could contribute to other pathological conditions. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of diseases associated with FHDC1 alterations (Tong2023Collective; Tong2024Collective).

## Interactions
FHDC1 interacts with both actin filaments and microtubules, playing a crucial role in cellular dynamics. The FH2 domain of FHDC1 is responsible for binding to actin filaments, facilitating actin polymerization and elongation, while the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) enables interactions with microtubules (Copeland2016Actin-). FHDC1's interaction with microtubules is particularly significant in the context of Golgi morphology, where it associates with Golgi-derived microtubules and is involved in the dispersion of the Golgi apparatus (Copeland2016Actin-). This interaction is dependent on the presence of GM130, a Golgi matrix protein, which is essential for FHDC1's association with microtubules and its role in Golgi assembly (Copeland2016Actin-).

FHDC1 also plays a role in wave propagation within cells, where its interactions with actin and microtubules are critical. The protein co-localizes with α-tubulin, indicating a close association with microtubules, and its release from microtubules is necessary for actin wave nucleation (Tong2024Collective). This dynamic interaction suggests that FHDC1 acts as a cytoskeletal bridging factor, coordinating the dynamics of actin and microtubules to stabilize cellular structures and processes (Copeland2016Actin-).
