# HCAR2

## Overview
HCAR2, or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism and immune regulation. The protein product of HCAR2, also known as GPR109A, is characterized by a heptahelical transmembrane structure typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in cellular signaling. This receptor is primarily expressed in adipocytes, immune cells, and epithelial cells, where it modulates lipolysis and immune responses through the Gi/o protein signaling pathway. HCAR2 is activated by endogenous ligands such as β-hydroxybutyrate and butyrate, which are significant under metabolic conditions like fasting. Beyond its metabolic functions, HCAR2 exerts anti-inflammatory effects, making it a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and conditions like Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer. The receptor's interactions with G-proteins and synthetic agonists further underscore its importance in maintaining metabolic and immune homeostasis (Cheng2023Orthosteric; Mao2023Orthosteric; Pan2023Structural).

## Structure
The human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical heptahelical transmembrane bundle (7TM) structure. This structure is connected by an extracellular N-terminus, three extracellular loops (ECL1-3), and three intracellular loops (ICL1-3) (Pan2023Structural). The receptor also features an amphipathic helix VIII and a long C-terminus, although these regions are highly flexible and not well-defined in cryo-EM maps (Pan2023Structural).

HCAR2 contains three disulfide bonds in its extracellular region, crucial for maintaining the architecture of the ligand-binding pocket and contributing to ligand recognition. These disulfide bonds are formed between C100 3.25 -C177, C18 N-term -C183 5.33, and C19 N-term -C266, providing structural stability to the ECL2 region, which acts as a lid capping the extracellular vestibule (Pan2023Structural).

The receptor's orthosteric binding pocket is compact and primarily composed of transmembrane segments 2, 3, and 7, along with ECLs 1 and 2. The binding pocket accommodates small ligands like niacin and 3-HB, with the carboxyl group of these ligands forming strong electrostatic interactions with the conserved R111 residue (Mao2023Orthosteric). The receptor's structure is stabilized by unique disulfide bonds, and the extracellular side is enclosed by ECL2 (Mao2023Orthosteric).

## Function
Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in adipocytes, immune cells, and epithelial cells, where it influences lipolysis and cellular immunity through the Gi/o protein signaling pathway (Mao2023Orthosteric). HCAR2 is activated by endogenous metabolites such as β-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) and butyrate, which are important under conditions like fasting or starvation. Activation of HCAR2 by these ligands reduces lipolysis and free fatty acid formation, promoting efficient fat energy utilization and preventing ketoacidosis (Pan2023Structural).

In addition to its metabolic functions, HCAR2 has significant anti-inflammatory effects. It suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in monocytes or macrophages, making it a potential target for treating inflammatory diseases (Cheng2023Orthosteric). HCAR2 is also involved in maintaining an immunoinhibitory environment in the retina, where its activation reduces leukocyte infiltration during inflammation, thus preserving retinal health and function (Powell2021Hydroxycarboxylic). These functions highlight HCAR2's role in both metabolic and immune regulatory processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HCAR2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, pharmacological activation of HCAR2 using Niaspan, a niacin formulation, has shown potential therapeutic benefits. This treatment in a mouse model resulted in reduced amyloid pathology, improved memory, and decreased neuronal loss, suggesting that HCAR2 activation enhances microglial efficiency in reducing amyloid deposition (Moutinho2022The).

In the context of colon cancer, HCAR2, also known as GPR109A, functions as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in colon cancer tissues and cell lines, often due to DNA methylation. Reexpression of HCAR2 in cancer cells can induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential role in cancer therapy (Thangaraju2009GPR109A).

HCAR2 is also involved in lipid metabolism and its loss is associated with aging-related hepatic steatosis. In mice lacking HCAR2, there is increased liver fat accumulation and inflammation, suggesting that HCAR2 plays a role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and its dysregulation can contribute to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Jadeja2019Loss).

## Interactions
HCAR2, also known as hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, engages in several interactions with other proteins, primarily involving G-proteins. It forms stable complexes with the Gi1 protein, even in the absence of an agonist, due to its unique extracellular architecture, particularly the ECL2 motif (Pan2023Structural). The interaction with the Gi1 protein is mediated by the α5 helix of the Gαi subunit and the receptor cores, including transmembrane helices TM1-3, TM5, TM6, and intracellular loops ICL2 and ICL3 (Pan2023Structural). Specific interactions include hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts, such as a salt bridge between R218 on HCAR2 and D341 on the α5 helix of Gαi (Pan2023Structural).

HCAR2 also interacts with synthetic agonists like MK-6892, which forms hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with residues in TM-II, -III, -VII, and ECL-2, crucial for receptor activation (Shenol2024Multiple). The receptor's interaction with the Gαi protein stabilizes certain conformations of the extracellular loop (ECL-2) and specific residues, such as Phe180 and Arg111, although Arg111 is not directly involved in the allosteric communication between G protein and agonist binding (Shenol2024Multiple). There is no mention of interactions with nucleic acids in the provided context.
