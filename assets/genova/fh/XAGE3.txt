# XAGE3

## Overview
XAGE3 is a gene that encodes the protein X antigen family member 3, which belongs to the cancer/testis antigen family. This family of proteins is characterized by their restricted expression in normal tissues, primarily the testis and placenta, and aberrant expression in various cancers. The XAGE3 protein is implicated in tumorigenesis, particularly in cancers such as melanoma and bladder cancer, where its expression is upregulated due to epigenetic modifications like DNA hypomethylation (Fratta2011The; Salmaninejad2016CancerTestis). While its expression is generally low in Ewing's sarcoma and melanocytic tumors, XAGE3 remains a promising target for cancer immunotherapy due to its limited expression in normal tissues, which reduces the risk of adverse effects (Zendman2002The). Current research is focused on understanding its expression patterns and exploring its potential as a therapeutic target (Zendman2003Cancertestis‐associated).

## Clinical Significance
XAGE3, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is primarily expressed in the testis and placenta under normal conditions. However, its expression is notably upregulated in various cancers, including melanoma and bladder cancer, due to epigenetic changes such as DNA hypomethylation of its promoter region. This demethylation leads to the activation of XAGE3 expression in cancer cells, contributing to tumorigenesis (Fratta2011The; Salmaninejad2016CancerTestis).

In Ewing's sarcoma and melanocytic tumors, XAGE3 expression is generally low or undetectable, suggesting a more limited role in these cancers compared to other members of the XAGE family (Zendman2002The). Despite its low expression in some tumors, the presence of XAGE3 in cancerous tissues makes it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy, as its restricted expression in normal tissues minimizes the risk of off-target effects (Fratta2011The).

The clinical significance of XAGE3 mutations or specific alterations in its interactions remains less well-documented, with current research primarily focusing on its expression patterns and potential as a therapeutic target (Zendman2003Cancertestis‐associated).
