# SAA4

## Overview
SAA4 is a gene that encodes the protein serum amyloid A4, constitutive, which is a member of the serum amyloid A family of proteins. Unlike other members of this family, such as SAA1 and SAA2, SAA4 is constitutively expressed and does not respond to inflammatory stimuli, indicating a distinct functional role (Buck2016Structure). The SAA4 protein is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream, where it is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in cholesterol transport, by binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Buck2016Structure). The protein's unique structure, including an N-linked glycosylation site, allows it to exist in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms, which may influence its interactions and functions (Buck2016Structure). SAA4's consistent expression across various tissues suggests a fundamental role in normal physiological processes, potentially contributing to inflammation regulation and tissue repair (Buck2016Structure).

## Structure
The SAA4 protein is a member of the serum amyloid A family and is characterized by a unique molecular structure. The mature SAA4 protein consists of 112 amino acids, which is longer than other SAA proteins like SAA1 and SAA2 due to the insertion of eight additional amino acids between positions 69 and 70 (Sack2020Serum; Buck2016Structure). This insertion includes an N-linked glycosylation site, resulting in both glycosylated (19 kDa) and unglycosylated (14 kDa) forms of SAA4 in serum (Buck2016Structure).

SAA4 is constitutively expressed and does not respond to inflammatory stimuli like SAA1 and SAA2, which are acute-phase proteins (Buck2016Structure). The protein binds to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), although its association with low-density lipoproteins (LDL) remains unclear (Buck2016Structure). The structural adaptability of SAA4, including its glycosylation and lipoprotein binding properties, distinguishes it from other SAA proteins (Buck2016Structure). The primary structure of SAA4 is encoded by exons 2-4, with an 18 amino acid N-terminal leader sequence that is cleaved before secretion (Sack2020Serum).

## Function
SAA4, a member of the serum amyloid A protein family, is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream. It is constitutively expressed, meaning its production is consistent and not significantly induced by inflammatory stimuli, unlike other SAA proteins such as SAA1 and SAA2 (Buck2016Structure). SAA4 is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in cholesterol transport, as it binds to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (Buck2016Structure). 

The protein plays a role in maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and microenvironment homeostasis, as its expression is negatively correlated with the ECM receptor interaction pathway (Li2024Low). SAA4 is also linked to fatty acid metabolism, where it may inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma aggressiveness by promoting fatty acid oxidation (Li2024Low). 

In healthy human cells, SAA4's consistent expression across various tissues, except the brain in Alzheimer's patients, suggests a fundamental role in normal physiological processes, potentially contributing to inflammation regulation and tissue repair (Buck2016Structure). Its evolutionary conservation and involvement in the acute phase response further underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Sack2020Serum).

## Interactions
Serum amyloid A4 (SAA4) is known to interact with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the bloodstream. SAA4 binds to HDL, particularly the HDL3 fraction, and can displace apolipoprotein A-I, which is a major protein component of HDL. This interaction is significant as it may influence lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport (Buck2016Structure). SAA4 also associates with very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), although its interaction with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) remains unclear (Buck2016Structure).

Unlike other serum amyloid A proteins, SAA4 is constitutively expressed and does not typically form amyloid deposits. It circulates in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms, which may affect its interactions and functions (Erickson2024Interactions). While SAA4 lacks most inflammatory regulatory regions, it is upregulated in peripheral atherosclerotic lesions and exhibits procoagulant activity, suggesting potential interactions with components of the coagulation cascade (Erickson2024Interactions).

The specific interactions of SAA4 with other proteins or nucleic acids in the context of inflammatory or immune responses are not well understood, and further research is needed to elucidate these potential interactions (Seok2017Identification).
