# VASH2

## Overview
VASH2 is a gene that encodes the protein vasohibin 2, which functions as a non-canonical cysteine protease involved in the detyrosination of α-tubulin, a critical post-translational modification affecting microtubule dynamics. The VASH2 protein forms a heterodimer with the Small Vasohibin Binding Protein (SVBP), which is essential for its solubility and enzymatic activity. This interaction facilitates the detyrosination process, impacting cellular processes such as mitosis, neuronal development, and muscle mechanotransduction (Zhou2019Structural; Aillaud2017VasohibinsSVBP). VASH2 is implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and diabetic nephropathy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Masuda2018Deletion; Xue2014MiR200upregulated).

## Structure
The VASH2 protein, encoded by the human VASH2 gene, is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes specific domains and a non-canonical catalytic architecture. The primary structure of VASH2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form two main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD is composed of five α-helices, while the CTD features a β-sheet and two α-helices, creating a V-shaped configuration (Zhou2019Structural).

VASH2 functions as a non-canonical cysteine protease, with a catalytic triad composed of Cys158, His193, and Ser210, differing from the typical Cys-His-Asp triad found in canonical proteases. This triad is located at the interface of the α5-helix and two β-strands (Zhou2019Structural). The protein forms a heterodimer with SVBP, which is crucial for its solubility and enzymatic activity. SVBP stabilizes the α1 and α2 helices of VASH2, which are otherwise dynamic and contribute to the protein's insolubility (Zhou2019Structural).

The VASH2/SVBP heterodimer does not form higher-order oligomers under the analyzed conditions, indicating a specific quaternary structure limited to the heterodimeric form (Zhou2019Structural). The positively charged groove around the catalytic pocket of VASH2 is essential for recognizing and detyrosinating the tubulin tail, highlighting its role in post-translational modification processes (Zhou2019Structural).

## Function
VASH2 (vasohibin 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the detyrosination of α-tubulin, a post-translational modification important for various cellular functions. VASH2 forms a heterodimer with the vasohibin binding protein (SVBP), which enhances its solubility and stabilizes its structure, allowing it to effectively cleave the C-terminal tyrosine from α-tubulin (Zhou2019Structural). This detyrosination process is part of the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle, which regulates microtubule stability and function, impacting processes such as mitosis, neuronal development, and muscle mechanotransduction (Zhou2019Structural; Aillaud2017VasohibinsSVBP).

VASH2 is involved in neuron differentiation and function, influencing neuronal growth cone pathfinding, axon differentiation, and neuron polarization (Aillaud2017VasohibinsSVBP). It also plays a role in mitosis by maintaining proper spindle function and chromosome segregation, as its depletion leads to delayed cell division and spindle misalignment (Liao2019Molecular). VASH2's activity is not limited to neurons; it may also detyrosinate other proteins like EB1 in endothelial and tumor cells, suggesting a broader functional scope (Aillaud2017VasohibinsSVBP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VASH2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), VASH2 overexpression promotes malignant transformation through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing invasive capabilities and anti-apoptotic properties of cancer cells (Xue2014MiR200upregulated). In ovarian cancer, VASH2 knockout increases sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel by reducing tubulin detyrosination, suggesting its potential as a target to enhance chemotherapy efficacy (Koyanagi2021Knockout).

In gastric cancer, VASH2 is crucial for tumor progression by promoting the accumulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts and upregulating genes like epiregulin and interleukin-11, which are associated with tumor growth (Suzuki2017Requisite). In medulloblastoma, particularly the SHH subtype, VASH2 overexpression is linked to increased cell invasion, migration, and altered cell cycle phases, indicating its role in tumor aggressiveness (Liu2023A).

VASH2 also plays a role in non-cancerous conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy, where its deletion in mice models ameliorates glomerular alterations, suggesting a protective effect against the disease (Masuda2018Deletion). These findings highlight VASH2 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and non-cancerous diseases.

## Interactions
Vasohibin 2 (VASH2) is known to interact with the Small Vasohibin Binding Protein (SVBP) to form a heterodimer complex that plays a crucial role in the detyrosination of tubulin. This interaction is essential for the solubility and stability of VASH2, as SVBP acts in a chaperone-like capacity, stabilizing the dynamic α1 and α2 helices of VASH2, which are critical for its enzymatic activity (Zhou2019Structural). The VASH2/SVBP complex targets the tubulin tail through a positively charged groove around the catalytic pocket, facilitating the detyrosination process (Zhou2019Structural).

VASH2 also interacts with microtubules, exhibiting distinct binding behaviors compared to its homolog VASH1. VASH2-SVBP shows longer and more static attachments to microtubules, with specific interactions at multiple sites on the microtubule surface, involving residues such as Arg134, Arg137, His257, and Met292 (RamirezRios2022VASH1SVBP). These interactions contribute to the localized detyrosination of microtubules, which is distinct from the global detyrosination pattern observed with VASH1-SVBP (RamirezRios2022VASH1SVBP). The structural integrity and function of the VASH2-SVBP complex are further supported by the interaction between Met66 of VASH2 and Leu42 of SVBP, which is crucial for the complex's stability (Parvathy2023Interfacial).
