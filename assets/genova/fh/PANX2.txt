# PANX2

## Overview
PANX2 is a gene that encodes the protein pannexin 2, which is a member of the pannexin family of proteins. Pannexin 2 is a transmembrane protein that forms large-pore channels, primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in intercellular communication and various physiological processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and synaptic signaling (He2023Structural; Zhang2023CryoEM). The protein is characterized by its heptameric structure, with each protomer contributing to a central ion conduction pore that facilitates the exchange of ions and small molecules such as ATP and Ca2+ (He2023Structural; Zhang2023CryoEM). Pannexin 2's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which influence its cellular localization and trafficking (SanchezPupo2018NGlycosylation). Beyond the central nervous system, PANX2 is also expressed in other tissues, including the skin and gastrointestinal tract, where it may contribute to skin homeostasis and gastrointestinal motility (Diezmos2015Pannexin‐2).

## Structure
The human PANX2 protein is a heptameric channel composed of seven identical protomers symmetrically arranged around a central axis, forming a transmembrane channel pathway (Zhang2023CryoEM). Each protomer consists of three main domains: an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and an intracellular domain (ICD) (He2023Structural). The ECD is characterized by two extracellular loops stabilized by disulfide bonds, contributing to a rigid extracellular constriction important for ion selectivity (He2023Structural). The TMD includes four helices (TM1-TM4), with TM1 and TM2 lining the pore (Zhang2023CryoEM). The ICD is a helix-rich structure composed of the cytoplasmic loop and C-terminal residues (Zhang2023CryoEM).

The PANX2 channel features a ring of seven arginine residues (R89) at the extracellular entrance, acting as a molecular filter and contributing to the positively charged extracellular entrance (Zhang2023CryoEM). The channel is N-glycosylated, similar to other pannexin channels (Zhang2023CryoEM). The absence of certain domains, such as the N-terminal helix (NTH) and C-terminal loop (CTL), suggests that PANX2 may adopt an open conformation (Zhang2023CryoEM). The structural and functional analysis of PANX2 highlights its role in cellular processes, with its heptameric assembly and specific domain interactions being crucial for its function (He2023Structural).

## Function
Pannexin 2 (PANX2) is a protein that forms large-pore channels involved in ATP release and intercellular communication, primarily expressed in the central nervous system. It plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and synaptic signaling (He2023Structural; Zhang2023CryoEM). PANX2 channels facilitate the exchange of ions and small molecules such as ATP, glutamate, and Ca2+ between cells and the extracellular matrix, contributing to cell communication and homeostasis (Zhang2023CryoEM).

Structurally, PANX2 forms a heptameric channel with a central ion conduction pore, which is crucial for its function in ion selectivity and ATP permeation (He2023Structural; Zhang2023CryoEM). The channel's extracellular entrance is characterized by a ring of arginine residues that act as a molecular filter, influencing its permeability to ATP (Zhang2023CryoEM). PANX2 is also involved in neuronal development and neurodegeneration, with its activity being modulated by post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, which affects its localization and trafficking within the cell (He2023Structural; SanchezPupo2018NGlycosylation). PANX2's expression and function are not limited to the CNS, as it is also found in other tissues, including the skin and gastrointestinal tract, where it may play roles in skin homeostasis and gastrointestinal motility (He2023Structural; Diezmos2015Pannexin‐2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PANX2 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), both nuclear and cytoplasmic expressions of PANX2 are linked to shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for this cancer type (Kim2019The). PANX2 expression is associated with poor clinical-pathologic prognostic parameters, including older age, larger tumor size, and higher tumor stage (Kim2019The).

In prostate cancer, PANX2 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous cell lines compared to non-tumorigenic cells. Its expression correlates with the Gleason score, indicating a role in cancer progression. PANX2 is involved in oxidative stress pathways and is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions due to its role in regulating malignant phenotypes and ferroptosis (Identification; Liao2020&lt; p&gt).

In zebrafish models, PANX2 deficiency leads to ocular and visual motor behavior defects, suggesting its role in maintaining lens structure and cellular energy homeostasis. This deficiency may contribute to myopia and other vision-related issues, highlighting its importance in ocular health (Shanbhag2024Pannexin2).

## Interactions
PANX2, a member of the pannexin family, is known to interact with other pannexin proteins, particularly PANX1. This interaction is glycosylation-dependent and affects the cellular localization and function of the proteins. PANX1 can facilitate the cell surface localization of PANX2, increasing its presence on the cell surface when coexpressed (Penuela2009Glycosylation). PANX2 interacts strongly with the core and high-mannose species of PANX1, but not with PANX3, indicating a selective interaction pattern within the pannexin family (Penuela2009Glycosylation). 

The interaction between PANX1 and PANX2 also influences channel function, as coexpression of these proteins results in compromised channel activity (Penuela2009Glycosylation). In Xenopus oocytes, PANX2 has been shown to reduce the current amplitude when coexpressed with PANX1, suggesting a potential inhibitory interaction (Swayne2010Pannexin). 

PANX2 is primarily localized to intracellular membranes, particularly in association with endolysosomal pathways, as indicated by its colocalization with the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (WickiStordeur2013Analysis). This intracellular localization suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in endolysosomal trafficking, although specific partners have not been detailed.
