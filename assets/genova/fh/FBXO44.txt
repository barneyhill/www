# FBXO44

## Overview
FBXO44 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 44, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is responsible for targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes. F-box protein 44 functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating the assembly of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that include Cullin 4B (CUL4B) and DNA Damage-Binding Protein 1 (DDB1), distinct from the classical SCF (Skp-cullin-F-box) complexes. It plays a critical role in the degradation of the Regulator of G protein Signaling protein 2 (RGS2), influencing G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. Additionally, FBXO44 is involved in transcriptional silencing through interactions with histone methyltransferases and chromatin remodeling complexes, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in cancer and other diseases (Sjögren2015FBXO44Mediated; Shen2021FBXO44; McNabb2020NTerminal).

## Function
FBXO44 is a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by targeting specific proteins for degradation. In healthy human cells, FBXO44 is involved in the degradation of the Regulator of G protein Signaling protein 2 (RGS2) through a novel E3 ligase complex that includes Cullin 4B (CUL4B) and DNA Damage-Binding Protein 1 (DDB1). This complex is distinct from the classical SCF (Skp-cullin-F-box) complex and specifically mediates the degradation of RGS2, but not the closely related RGS4, indicating a unique specificity (Sjögren2015FBXO44Mediated; McNabb2020NTerminal).

FBXO44 recognizes RGS2 through specific residues in its N-terminus, and phosphorylation of RGS2, particularly at Serine 3, can protect it from degradation by FBXO44. This suggests a regulatory mechanism that controls RGS2 stability, potentially involving protein kinase C (PKC) (McNabb2020NTerminal). The degradation of RGS2 by FBXO44 is important for regulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling, which is crucial for various cellular functions (McNabb2020NTerminal). FBXO44's activity in healthy cells is essential for maintaining the steady-state levels of RGS2, thereby influencing cell signaling pathways and potentially impacting conditions like hypertension and anxiety (Sjögren2015FBXO44Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO44 has been implicated in various human cancers, particularly adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG). In AEG, FBXO44 is significantly upregulated in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including distant metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and shorter survival times (Li2023Integrative). Experimental studies have shown that overexpression of FBXO44 in AEG cell lines increases cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while knockdown of FBXO44 has the opposite effects, suggesting its oncogenic role (Li2023Integrative).

In cancer research, FBXO44 is also involved in DNA replication-coupled repetitive element silencing. Its inhibition leads to decreased cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, without significantly affecting normal cells. This suggests that targeting FBXO44 could be a promising strategy in cancer therapy, particularly in enhancing immune responses and overcoming resistance to existing treatments (Shen2021FBXO44).

FBXO44 is also involved in the degradation of the RGS2 protein, which is important for cardiovascular and central nervous system functions. Alterations in this pathway could have implications for diseases such as hypertension and anxiety (Sjögren2015FBXO44Mediated; McNabb2020NTerminal).

## Interactions
FBXO44 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional silencing and protein degradation. It interacts with SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase, and components of the CRL4 complex, such as CUL4B and DDB1, to facilitate the transcriptional silencing of repetitive elements (REs) in cancer cells through H3K9me3-mediated mechanisms (Shen2021FBXO44). FBXO44 also associates with the Mi-2/NuRD complex, which is important for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Shen2021FBXO44).

FBXO44 functions as a substrate recognition factor for the SCF-type ubiquitin ligase and is involved in the degradation of the regulator of G-protein signaling RGS2. This interaction is mediated through a degron located near the N-terminus of RGS2, and phosphorylation of RGS2 at Ser 3 can interfere with its degradation by FBXO44 (McNabb2020NTerminal).

FBXO44 also interacts with DNA replication proteins such as PCNA, CHAF1A/B, and MCM7, and it binds to H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at the replication fork, coordinating RE silencing with DNA replication (Shen2021FBXO44). These interactions highlight FBXO44's role as an adaptor protein, recruiting various complexes to facilitate transcriptional silencing and protein degradation.
