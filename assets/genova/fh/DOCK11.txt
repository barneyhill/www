# DOCK11

## Overview
DOCK11, also known as dedicator of cytokinesis 11, is a gene that encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and various cellular processes. The DOCK11 protein, part of the DOCK-D family, primarily interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, playing a critical role in cell shape and movement (Li2024Roles; Parrado2020Expression). It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and is essential for immune cell function, particularly in B cell development and the induction of memory T follicular helper cells (Sugiyama2022The). Additionally, DOCK11 is implicated in the persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and has been associated with testicular carcinoma, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Li2024Roles; Parrado2020Expression).

## Structure
DOCK11, also known as Zizimin2, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is part of the DOCK-D family. The protein is composed of 2073 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 237,671 Da (Li2024Roles). It contains several important domains, including the DHR1 domain near the N terminus, which spans approximately 200 residues and has a C2-like architecture. This domain is involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns P3) to recruit DOCK complexes to the cell membrane (Li2024Roles). The catalytic DHR2 domain, located at the C-terminal region and spanning approximately 500 residues, is the primary site for GEF activity. This domain is organized into three lobes (A, B, and C), with lobe A mediating homodimerization and stabilizing lobe B, while lobes B and C serve as binding sites for CDC42. Lobe C acts as the active center of the GEF reaction (Li2024Roles).

DOCK11 lacks the SH3 domain and proline-rich region found in other DOCK subfamilies (Li2024Roles). The protein is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and is involved in the regulation of cytokinesis in the cytoplasm (Doan2023SuperResolution).

## Function
DOCK11, also known as dedicator of cytokinesis 11, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that primarily interacts with the small GTPase CDC42. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which influences cell shape and movement (Li2024Roles; Parrado2020Expression). DOCK11 is involved in the activation of GTPases, cycling them between active and inactive states, which is essential for various cellular processes, including immune cell function (Li2024Roles).

In the immune system, DOCK11 plays a significant role in B cell development and function. It is involved in the expansion of antigen-specific populations among germinal center B cells upon immunization, facilitating secondary immune responses through the induction of T-cell help (Sugiyama2022The). DOCK11 expression in B cells is crucial for the induction of memory T follicular helper cells, which are important for providing cognate help in recall responses of memory B cells (Sugiyama2022The).

DOCK11 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, liver, and lymphoid tissues, and is localized in the cytosol and nucleoplasm of certain cell types (Li2024Roles). Its expression is regulated by age-dependent mechanisms, and its downregulation in B cells could impact immune responses (Li2024Roles).

## Clinical Significance
DOCK11 is implicated in the persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. It plays a crucial role in HBV entry and persistence in hepatocytes by facilitating retrograde trafficking and the maintenance of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is essential for HBV replication. Alterations in DOCK11 expression have been observed in HBV-infected cells, and its levels are influenced by antiviral treatments such as entecavir. This suggests that changes in DOCK11 expression may be linked to chronic hepatitis B and could impact immune system modulation (Li2024Roles).

DOCK11 is also associated with testicular carcinoma, indicating its potential role in cancer biology. The abnormal expression of DOCK11 has been linked to this type of cancer, suggesting that it may serve as a biomarker for certain malignancies (Parrado2020Expression).

While there are no direct reports linking DOCK11 mutations to specific diseases, its involvement in HBV infection and cancer highlights its clinical significance. The potential therapeutic targeting of DOCK11, such as through the inhibition of its activity with novel peptides, is being explored as a strategy for treating chronic hepatitis B (Li2024Roles).

## Interactions
DOCK11, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the Rho GTPases CDC42 and RAC, facilitating the GDP-GTP exchange necessary for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell signaling (Hashimoto2021DOCK11). DOCK11 also interacts with AGAP2, a protein involved in retrograde trafficking, suggesting a potential complex formation that may enhance GEF activity or contribute to GTPase specificity (Li2024Roles). This interaction is significant in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence, as DOCK11 aids in the association of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) with transcriptionally active markers like H3K4me3 and RNA Pol II, thereby activating cccDNA transcription (Li2024Roles).

In HBV-infected cells, DOCK11 is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a notable perinuclear localization, indicating its involvement in HBV retrograde trafficking and cccDNA maintenance (Li2024Roles). Despite these interactions, DOCK11 does not directly colocalize with certain histone marks or RNA Pol II CTD, but its knockdown leads to reduced enrichment of these markers on HBV cccDNA, highlighting its indirect role in modulating these interactions (Li2024Roles).
