# ZIC3

## Overview
ZIC3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger transcription factor Zic family member 3, which plays a pivotal role in early embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The ZIC3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which classify it as a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression. It is crucial for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and is integral to the left-right patterning of internal organs, influencing pathways such as Nodal signaling. ZIC3's interactions with other transcription factors, including those in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, underscore its importance in neural development and organ positioning. Mutations in the ZIC3 gene are associated with X-linked heterotaxy and other congenital anomalies, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental disorders (Lim2007Zic3; Bellchambers2018ZIC3; Winata2015Changing).

## Structure
The ZIC3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It contains five tandem C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding and are essential for its role in nuclear localization (Mizugishi2001Molecular; Hatayama2008Functional). The zinc finger domains ZF1 to ZF4 have been structurally analyzed using NMR, revealing that ZF1 and ZF2 form a single structural unit, while ZF3 and ZF4 exist as independent units (Hatayama2008Functional). These domains are stabilized by zinc coordination and hydrophobic interactions, with a hydrophobic core formed by residues such as W255, Y298, and W299 (Hatayama2008Functional).

The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of ZIC3 is primarily located in the ZF2 and ZF3 regions, with basic residues like R320, K337, and R350 playing a critical role in nuclear import (Hatayama2008Functional). Mutations in these regions can disrupt nuclear localization, affecting the protein's function (Bedard2006Nuclear). The ZIC3 protein is part of the GLI superfamily, sharing structural similarities with GLI proteins, which suggests a common evolutionary origin (Mizugishi2001Molecular).

## Function
The ZIC3 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation during early embryonic development. In healthy human cells, ZIC3 is involved in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells by preventing differentiation into endodermal lineages. It functions downstream of key pluripotency factors such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, enhancing their expression and supporting the pluripotent state (Lim2007Zic3). ZIC3 also plays a significant role in left-right patterning of internal organs, influencing the Nodal signaling pathway essential for the development of left-sided structures like the heart and gut (Winata2015Changing; Cast2012An).

During neural development, ZIC3 acts as a transcriptional regulator, interacting with other transcription factors such as Gli proteins in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. It promotes neural fate while inhibiting endodermal differentiation, maintaining neural progenitors and regulating neural differentiation (Winata2015Changing). ZIC3 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to promoter regions and distal regulatory elements, influencing gene expression patterns crucial for proper organ positioning and neural development (Winata2015Changing). Its evolutionary conservation across species underscores its importance in nervous system development (Winata2015Changing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZIC3 gene are associated with X-linked heterotaxy, a condition characterized by abnormal arrangement of internal organs along the left-right axis of the body. This disorder can lead to a range of congenital heart defects, including septal defects, atrioventricular canal defects, and conotruncal anomalies (Bellchambers2018ZIC3; Ware2004Identification). ZIC3 mutations are highly penetrant but exhibit variable phenotypic expression, resulting in diverse heart defects and situs anomalies such as asplenia, polysplenia, left isomerism, and right isomerism (Bellchambers2018ZIC3).

The gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in left-right axis development, and mutations often disrupt the zinc finger domain, crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Cowan2013Genetic; Li2018A). These mutations can lead to aberrant subcellular localization and loss of transcriptional activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of heterotaxy and related congenital heart defects (Ware2004Identification).

ZIC3 mutations are also linked to VACTERL syndrome, a condition involving multiple congenital anomalies, and have been implicated in isolated congenital heart defects, although their contribution to isolated cases remains unclear (Bellchambers2018ZIC3; Cowan2013Genetic). The gene's role in laterality disorders is underscored by its involvement in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, affecting organogenesis and heart development (Li2018A).

## Interactions
ZIC3, a zinc finger transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its regulatory functions. ZIC3 interacts with GLI3, another transcription factor, through specific domains. The intact ZIC3 protein shows strong interaction with the GLI3 ZF3-5 domains, although certain nonsense mutants of ZIC3 do not bind effectively. However, all tested missense mutants retain the ability to bind GLI3, indicating that specific domains in ZIC3 are essential for this interaction (Zhu2007Characterization).

ZIC3 also binds to DNA, specifically to a GLI consensus binding sequence, similar to its mouse counterpart. This binding is crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation (Zhu2007Characterization). In zebrafish, ZIC3 primarily interacts with distal regulatory elements rather than promoter regions, suggesting its role in long-distance transcriptional regulation. This interaction is significant during early embryonic development, particularly in neural and mesendodermal patterning (Winata2013Genome).

The protein's ability to bind DNA and interact with other transcription factors like GLI3 highlights its role in modulating gene expression, which is essential for processes such as neural development and body asymmetry (Winata2013Genome).
