# SREK1IP1

## Overview
SREK1IP1, or SREK1 interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of RNA splicing and processing. The protein, also named SREK1 interacting protein 1, plays a critical role in modulating splice site selection during alternative splicing events by interacting with the serine-arginine (SR)-rich splicing regulatory protein SREK1. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly of spliceosomal complexes, which are crucial for maintaining cellular function and organismal development. SREK1IP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to pre-mRNA splicing and is associated with nucleic acid binding. It is considered a potential splicing regulator involved in cellular survival and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression. The gene's expression levels have clinical significance, particularly in cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker (Liao2023Prognostic; AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4).

## Structure


## Function
SREK1IP1 (SREK1 interacting protein 1) is involved in RNA splicing and processing, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in human cells. It interacts with the serine-arginine (SR)-rich splicing regulatory protein SREK1, influencing splice site selection during alternative splicing events. This interaction is significant for the proper assembly of spliceosomal complexes, which are essential for maintaining cellular function and organismal development (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4).

SREK1IP1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to pre-mRNA splicing. It is associated with nucleic acid binding and is considered a possible splicing regulator involved in cellular survival. The protein interacts with several splicing factors, supporting its role in pre-mRNA splicing (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4). The interaction of SREK1IP1 with SRrp86, a protein involved in alternative splicing, further suggests its involvement in the splicing process of genes (Akiyama2015Reduced).

In the context of cancer, downregulation of SREK1IP1 has been shown to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in tumor cell lines, indicating its potential role in suppressing tumor growth (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4).

## Clinical Significance
The SREK1IP1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), higher expression levels of SREK1IP1 are associated with worse survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker in this type of cancer (Liao2023Prognostic). The gene is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA, which may influence cancer progression by competitively binding to shared miRNAs (Liao2023Prognostic).

In addition to its role in cancer, SREK1IP1 is involved in fundamental cellular processes such as translocation and splicing regulation, which are crucial for cellular survival. Although it has not been directly associated with specific diseases, its regulatory functions suggest that alterations in its expression could impact disease progression (Patel2019Ocimum).

Furthermore, SREK1IP1 is influenced by the tumor-suppressive protein lysine methyltransferase SETD7, which enhances its expression through monomethylation of H3K4. This regulation is linked to decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role in certain contexts (Aziz2023Tumorsuppressive).

## Interactions
SREK1IP1, also known as SREK1 interacting protein 1, is involved in RNA splicing and processing. It interacts with the serine-arginine (SR)-rich splicing regulatory protein SREK1, modulating splice site selection during alternative splicing events (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, as SREK1IP1 is associated with the deposition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) marks on mRNAs and U6 snRNA, which are important for RNA processing and stability (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4).

In humans, SREK1IP1 has been identified to interact with several splicing factors, including NKAP, as confirmed through affinity purification mass spectrometry assays (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4). These interactions suggest a conserved role for SREK1IP1 in pre-mRNA splicing across species, including humans and Arabidopsis (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4). The protein is also involved in cellular survival, as its downregulation has been linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in tumor cell lines, indicating its role in suppressing tumor growth (AceitunoValenzuela2024CXIP4). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SREK1IP1 in gene expression regulation and cellular processes.
