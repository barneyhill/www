# LIX1L

## Overview
LIX1L is a gene that encodes the protein known as limb and CNS expressed 1 like, which is a putative RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. The protein is characterized by a double-stranded RNA binding motif, indicating its role in RNA interactions and post-transcriptional gene regulation (Nakamura2015Novel). LIX1L is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular compartments and processes (Nakamura2015Novel). It interacts with several proteins, such as RIOK1, nucleolin, and PABPC4, and is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins like Cofilin, which is crucial for actin dynamics and cell movement (Nakamura2015Novel). LIX1L also influences the expression of microRNAs, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Nakamura2015Novel). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions highlight its potential impact on cancer progression and other cellular functions, making it a subject of interest in clinical research (Moore2022DCHS1; Li2022LIX1L).

## Function
LIX1L is a putative RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. It contains a double-stranded RNA binding motif, suggesting its role in RNA interactions and post-transcriptional gene regulation (Nakamura2015Novel). LIX1L is known to interact with several proteins, including RIOK1, nucleolin, and PABPC4, forming complexes that influence cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis (Nakamura2015Novel).

In healthy human cells, LIX1L is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins like Cofilin, which is crucial for actin dynamics and cell movement. This phosphorylation is mediated by kinases such as ROS1, highlighting LIX1L's role in modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell division (Nakamura2015Novel). LIX1L is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular compartments and processes (Nakamura2015Novel).

The protein also influences the expression of microRNAs, which are key regulators of gene expression, affecting processes like cell differentiation and growth. This suggests that LIX1L plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Nakamura2015Novel).

## Clinical Significance
LIX1L has been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and liver conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LIX1L expression is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and overall survival. High levels of LIX1L promote tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing cell proliferation and migration, partly through the miR-21-3p-mediated inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), which alters glucose metabolism in cancer cells (Zou2021LIX1like). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LIX1L is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). It interacts with nucleolin to induce ribosomal RNA synthesis, promoting tumor progression and drug resistance (Li2022LIX1L).

LIX1L also plays a role in cholestatic liver diseases, where its expression is upregulated during cholestasis, contributing to liver injury by affecting bile acid metabolism. LIX1L deficiency in mouse models has been shown to alleviate liver injury and fibrosis by reducing bile acid synthesis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for cholestatic liver diseases (Li2021Limb). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LIX1L in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
LIX1L is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with several proteins, including RIOK1, nucleolin (NCL), and PABPC4, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs) such as has-miRNA-520a-5p, -300, -216b, -326, -190a, -548b-3p, -7-5p, and -1296 in HEK-293 cells (Nakamura2015Novel). LIX1L's interaction with NCL is particularly notable in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to EGFR-TKIs through nucleolin-mediated ribosomal RNA synthesis (Li2022LIX1L).

LIX1L also forms part of the DCHS1-LIX1L-SEPT9 protein complex, where it stabilizes the complex and is crucial for actin polymerization and cell organization (Moore2022DCHS1). The interaction between LIX1L and SEPT9 is essential for maintaining cell organization within valve tissue, as disrupting this interaction leads to decreased actin polymerization (Moore2022DCHS1). These interactions highlight LIX1L's role in regulating cellular dynamics and its potential impact on cancer progression and other cellular functions.
