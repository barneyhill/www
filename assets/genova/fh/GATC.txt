# GATC

## Overview
The GATC gene encodes the glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase subunit C, a critical component of the GatCAB complex, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This gene is essential for the transamidation process that converts misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln, ensuring the accuracy of mitochondrial translation and the proper assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) (Friederich2018Pathogenic; Nagao2009Biogenesis). The protein encoded by GATC acts as a stabilizing linker within the complex, facilitating interactions between the catalytic subunits GatA and GatB, and is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Friederich2018Pathogenic). Mutations in the GATC gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and preventing conditions such as mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

## Function
The GATC gene encodes the glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase subunit C, which is a crucial component of the GatCAB complex. This enzyme complex is responsible for the transamidation reaction that converts misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln in human mitochondria. This process is essential for maintaining the fidelity of mitochondrial protein synthesis, as it ensures the correct amino acid is paired with each tRNA, which is necessary for proper protein formation and the assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) (Friederich2018Pathogenic; Nagao2009Biogenesis).

The GatCAB complex, including the GATC subunit, operates within the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in mitochondrial translation. The GATC subunit acts as a stabilizing linker between the catalytic amidase and kinase functions of the other subunits, GatA and GatB, respectively (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The activity of the GatCAB complex is crucial for the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA^Gln with glutamine, a process that is impaired in cells lacking sufficient glutamine, leading to defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The proper function of this complex is essential for cellular energy production and overall mitochondrial function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GATC gene, which encodes a subunit of the GatCAB complex, are associated with a lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy disorder. This condition is characterized by severe metabolic dysfunctions, including cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis, often leading to early lethality. Pathogenic variants in GATC, such as the Met78Arg mutation, disrupt the interaction between the GatC and GatA subunits, compromising the stability and function of the GatCAB complex. This disruption results in decreased levels of the GatC protein and affects the assembly of the GatCAB holocomplex, which is crucial for mitochondrial function (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

Patients with GATC mutations exhibit decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and IV, and low or borderline-low activity of complex III, indicating a defect in mitochondrial translation. These deficiencies contribute to clinical manifestations such as intrauterine growth restriction, postnatal prematurity, hypoglycemia, and hearing loss (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The tissue-specific impact of these mutations is most pronounced in the heart, with less effect in skeletal muscle and near absence in fibroblasts, although the effects are exaggerated under conditions of reduced glutamine (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

## Interactions
The GATC gene encodes the glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase subunit C, which is a crucial component of the GatCAB complex. This complex is essential for the transamidation reaction that converts misacylated Glu-tRNA to Gln-tRNA, a process vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis. GATC interacts with the other subunits of the complex, GatA and GatB, to form a functional enzyme complex. GATC serves as a stabilizing linker between the catalytic subunits GatA and GatB, facilitating their interaction and ensuring the structural integrity of the complex (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

Mutations in GATC can disrupt its interaction with GatA and GatB, leading to impaired function of the GatCAB complex. For instance, the Met78Arg mutation in GATC is noted to disrupt interactions at the interface with GatA, potentially compromising the interaction between these subunits and affecting the overall stability and function of the complex (Friederich2018Pathogenic). These interactions are critical for the proper assembly and function of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is necessary for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The integrity of these interactions is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing disorders such as mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (Friederich2018Pathogenic).
