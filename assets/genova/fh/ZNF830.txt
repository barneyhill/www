# ZNF830

## Overview
ZNF830 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 830, a crucial component in the cellular DNA repair machinery. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain, which facilitates binding to double-stranded DNA, particularly at sites with 3' or 5' overhangs, and its coiled-coil domain, which is essential for interactions with other proteins involved in homologous recombination repair, such as CtIP (Chen2017ZNF830). ZNF830 is phosphorylated by ATR kinase, a modification necessary for its recruitment to DNA double-strand break sites, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability (Chen2017ZNF830). The protein's involvement in DNA repair processes is significant not only in normal cellular function but also in the context of cancer, where its expression levels are linked to chemoresistance and cancer progression (Chen2017ZNF830). As such, ZNF830 represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing the efficacy of DNA-damaging agents in cancer treatment.

## Structure
ZNF830 is a protein characterized by the presence of three functional domains: a zinc finger (ZNF) domain, a Glu-rich domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The ZNF domain is involved in DNA binding, with a preference for double-stranded DNA with 3' or 5' overhangs, rather than blunt-ended DNA (Chen2017ZNF830). The coiled-coil domain is crucial for the interaction with CtIP, a protein involved in homologous recombination repair, and this interaction is essential for DNA end resection during DNA repair processes (Chen2017ZNF830).

ZNF830 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at serine 362 by ATR kinase, which is necessary for its recruitment to DNA double-strand break sites and its function in homologous recombination repair (Chen2017ZNF830). This phosphorylation facilitates the formation of foci co-localized with γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage (Chen2017ZNF830).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with other proteins, such as PPIL2, with which it forms a complex through nanomolar-affinity binding. This interaction involves both the U-box motif and the isomerase domain of PPIL2 (Rajiv2018Structural). The specific molecular structure of ZNF830, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
ZNF830 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes, particularly in homologous recombination (HR) repair. It interacts with CtIP, a protein essential for DNA end resection, a key step in HR repair. This interaction is facilitated by the coiled-coil domain of ZNF830 and is enhanced during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, which are critical for HR repair (Chen2017ZNF830). ZNF830 is phosphorylated at serine 362 by ATR kinase in response to DNA damage, which is necessary for its recruitment to DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites. This phosphorylation is crucial for its localization and function in HR repair (Chen2017ZNF830).

ZNF830 also binds to double-stranded DNA with overhangs through its zinc finger domain, aiding in the repair process and maintaining genomic stability (Chen2017ZNF830). Its role in DNA repair is not limited to cancer cells; it is also significant in healthy cells, where it contributes to genomic integrity and error-free DNA repair through HR (Chen2017ZNF830). ZNF830's activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining proper gene expression and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF830 is implicated in cancer progression and chemoresistance, particularly in lung and gastric cancers. High expression levels of ZNF830 are associated with poor patient survival in these cancers, as it plays a crucial role in homologous recombination (HR) repair, a key DNA repair pathway. This function enhances cancer cell survival in response to DNA damage agents, contributing to chemoresistance (Chen2017ZNF830). Knockdown of ZNF830 sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damage agents, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome resistance to chemotherapy (Chen2017ZNF830).

In lung cancer, ZNF830 expression is elevated compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. Depletion of ZNF830 sensitizes lung cancer cells to PARP inhibitor treatment, such as olaparib, due to impaired HR repair activity (Chen2017ZNF830). A single nucleotide polymorphism within ZNF830 is associated with acute adverse skin reactions following radiotherapy for breast cancer, potentially due to its role in DNA double-strand break repair (Chen2017ZNF830).

ZNF830's interaction with CtIP and its phosphorylation by ATR are essential for its recruitment to DNA damage sites, facilitating DNA end resection and HR repair. These interactions underscore its role in maintaining genomic stability and contributing to cancer chemoresistance (Chen2017ZNF830).

## Interactions
ZNF830 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA repair processes. It directly interacts with CtIP, a protein involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair, through its coiled-coil domain. This interaction is crucial for DNA end resection, a key step in HR repair, and is regulated by cell cycle progression, being stronger during the S and G2 phases. The interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of CtIP at Ser327, which increases its binding affinity to ZNF830 (Chen2017ZNF830).

ZNF830 is phosphorylated at Ser362 by the ATR kinase in response to DNA damage, which is essential for its recruitment to double-strand break (DSB) sites. This phosphorylation allows ZNF830 to form foci that co-localize with γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, facilitating its role in DNA repair (Chen2017ZNF830).

ZNF830 also binds directly to double-strand DNA (dsDNA) through its zinc finger DNA binding domain, with a preference for 3' or 5' overhangs over blunt ends. This binding capability is confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using recombinant ZNF830 proteins (Chen2017ZNF830). These interactions highlight ZNF830's critical role in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
