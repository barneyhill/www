# TMEM64

## Overview
TMEM64 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 64, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling and bone metabolism. As a transmembrane protein, it plays a significant role in osteoclasts, influencing bone resorption and maintaining bone health by regulating intracellular calcium levels and modulating key signaling pathways. TMEM64 is also a novel regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, particularly affecting the secretion of Wnt3a and the nuclear localization of β-catenin, which are crucial for transcriptional activity. The protein's function has been extensively studied in the context of prostate cancer, where it is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Additionally, TMEM64 has been associated with liver disease and oculomotor nerve palsy, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various pathological conditions (Moon2019Transmembrane; Wu2023The; Salgüero2023PBMCs).

## Structure


## Function
Transmembrane protein 64 (TMEM64) is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of calcium signaling and bone metabolism. TMEM64 is primarily active in osteoclasts, where it plays a crucial role in bone resorption by influencing the differentiation and function of these cells. This activity impacts bone density and health by maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and modulating signaling pathways essential for osteoclast function.

In the context of cellular signaling, TMEM64 is a novel regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, particularly through its involvement in the secretion of Wnt3a, a key protein in this pathway. TMEM64 modulates the nuclear localization of β-catenin, which is important for β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity, although it does not affect the glycosylation status of Wnt3a (Moon2019Transmembrane). The protein's role in regulating Wnt3a secretion is specific to its wild-type form, as mutations in TMEM64 do not impact Wnt3a secretion or β-catenin activity (Moon2019Transmembrane).

TMEM64's expression and function have been studied extensively in the context of prostate cancer, where it is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis by modulating Wnt3a secretion (Moon2019Transmembrane). However, specific information about its function in healthy human cells remains limited.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM64 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes such as calcium signaling and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In prostate cancer, TMEM64 is overexpressed in PC3 prostate cancer cells, which are derived from bone metastases. This overexpression is associated with the inhibition of Wnt3a secretion, a factor involved in cancer progression and metastasis. The expression of TMEM64 is downregulated in metastatic lesions, suggesting its involvement in metastatic progression and its potential as a therapeutic target against bone metastasis in prostate cancer (Moon2019Transmembrane).

In the context of liver disease, TMEM64 is positively associated with liver stiffness measurement values in HIV/HCV coinfected patients with advanced cirrhosis. This association indicates a potential role in liver fibrosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, as TMEM64 modulates Wnt signaling, which is implicated in these conditions (Salgüero2023PBMCs).

TMEM64 is also upregulated in oculomotor nerve palsy, where it may serve as a biomarker due to its increased expression in affected tissues. This suggests a potential role in the pathology of the condition, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Wu2023The).
