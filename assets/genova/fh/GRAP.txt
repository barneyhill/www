# GRAP

## Overview
The GRAP gene encodes the GRB2 related adaptor protein, a cytoplasmic signaling protein that plays a pivotal role in the Ras signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. These domains facilitate the protein's interaction with phosphotyrosine-containing sites on activated receptor protein kinases and cytoplasmic proteins, thereby promoting signal transduction. GRAP is involved in various cellular processes, including actin filament organization and neural development, particularly within the auditory system. It is expressed in neurons that innervate hair cells, indicating its significance in hearing and neural connectivity. Mutations in the GRAP gene have been associated with nonsyndromic profound sensorineural hearing loss, underscoring its clinical relevance (Vanshylla2018Grb2; Li2019Dysfunction).

## Structure
The GRAP protein is a cytoplasmic signaling protein characterized by its structural arrangement, which includes a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. The SH2 domain is essential for recognizing and binding to phosphotyrosine-containing sites on activated receptor protein kinases and cytoplasmic proteins, facilitating signal transduction. The SH3 domains, particularly the amino-terminal SH3 domain, interact with the C-terminal tail of the Sos protein, promoting the stable association of GRAP with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, and leading to the activation of Ras signaling pathways (Li2019Dysfunction).

A specific variant, p.Gln104Leu, is located within the SH2 domain near the peptide-binding pocket, suggesting it may affect interactions with cellular partners. This residue is conserved among mammals, indicating its potential importance in function (Li2019Dysfunction). GRAP is involved in various cellular processes, including actin filament organization and neural development, particularly in the auditory system, where it is expressed in neurons innervating hair cells (Li2019Dysfunction). The protein's activity and interactions can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are common in proteins involved in signal transduction.

## Function
The GRAP gene encodes a cytoplasmic signaling protein that plays a crucial role in the Ras signaling pathway. Structurally similar to Grb2, GRAP is involved in the activation of Ras signaling by binding to the Sos protein through its SH3 domain. This interaction is essential for the membrane localization of the Grb2/drk-Sos complex, leading to subsequent Ras activation (Li2019Dysfunction). In human B cells, GRAP, along with GRB2, amplifies signaling by stimulated B-cell receptors and connects them to the activation of the Ras-controlled Erk-MAP kinase pathway. This suggests that GRAP is involved in mediating mitogenic responses and may act as a negative regulator in lymphocytes (Li2019Dysfunction).

GRAP is also expressed in neurons innervating hair cells in the hearing organ, indicating its involvement in neural development and the transmission of electrical signals related to hearing. Its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and role in Ras signaling suggest it may be crucial for the development of neural connections in the hearing organ (Li2019Dysfunction). In the context of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, GRAP, along with Grb2, is critical for linking BCR activation to the Erk MAP kinase pathway, highlighting its role in immune responses (Vanshylla2018Grb2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRAP gene, specifically the c.311A>T (p.Gln104Leu) variant, have been linked to nonsyndromic profound sensorineural hearing loss. This variant was identified in individuals from two consanguineous Turkish families and is associated with hearing loss as an autosomal recessive trait. The variant is rare, appearing in only 1 of 242,154 alleles in the gnomAD database and is absent in over 500 Turkish exomes in the researchers' database (Li2019Dysfunction). Functional studies in model organisms, such as mice and Drosophila, have demonstrated that GRAP and its orthologs are expressed in the hearing organs, and mutations can lead to hearing deficits and morphological abnormalities in sensory neurons (Li2019Dysfunction).

The GRAP gene encodes a protein involved in Ras signaling, which is crucial for transmitting signals from receptor protein kinases to downstream pathways. Alterations in GRAP can disrupt these signaling pathways, potentially affecting neural development in the hearing organ (Li2019Dysfunction). The study suggests that GRAP may play a role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of sensory neurons (Li2019Dysfunction). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GRAP mutations in sensorineural hearing loss.

## Interactions
GRAP (GRB2 related adaptor protein) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for signal transduction pathways. It specifically interacts with the granulocyte macrophage–colony-stimulating factor receptor α subunit (GMR-α), as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a selective interaction that does not occur with the IL-3 receptor α subunit (Tu2000Molecular). GRAP contains a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are essential for binding to phosphotyrosine-containing sites on activated receptors and cytoplasmic proteins (Li2019Dysfunction).

GRAP is also known to interact with the Sos protein through its amino-terminal SH3 domain, facilitating the stable association with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, which is critical for Ras signaling activation (Li2019Dysfunction). In T-cell signaling, GRAP forms complexes with other proteins, including Sos, upon T-cell activation, and it amplifies signaling by stimulated B-cell receptors, linking them to the activation of the Ras-controlled Erk-MAP kinase pathway (Li2019Dysfunction). These interactions highlight GRAP's role in cellular processes such as growth and differentiation, as well as its involvement in specific signaling pathways related to hematopoietic and sensory systems.
