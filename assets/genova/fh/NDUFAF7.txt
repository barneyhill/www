# NDUFAF7

## Overview
NDUFAF7 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 7, which is a crucial component in the assembly of Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein functions as an arginine methyltransferase, specifically targeting the NDUFS2 subunit of Complex I, and is essential for the stability and proper assembly of the complex. The methylation activity of NDUFAF7 is vital for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism. The protein is characterized by a DUF185 domain with a methyltransferase motif and is primarily found as a monomer in the mitochondrial matrix. Mutations in the NDUFAF7 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including pathologic myopia and mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (Zurita2014The).

## Structure
NDUFAF7 is a soluble mitochondrial matrix protein involved in the assembly of Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It contains a DUF185 domain with a methyltransferase motif, which is crucial for its function as an arginine methyltransferase (Zurita2014The). The protein is primarily found as a monomer at approximately 50 kDa and is associated with Complex I subassemblies (Zurita2014The). NDUFAF7 has a conserved region similar to motif I of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, indicating its role in methylation processes (Zurita2014The).

The primary structure of NDUFAF7 includes 10 exons and 13 predicted transcript variants, with the long isoform encoding a 441 amino acid protein. This isoform has a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (Zurita2014The). The protein's molecular structure features a conserved region present in RNA methylases with an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase fold, suggesting its functional relevance in Complex I biogenesis (Zurita2014The).

NDUFAF7 is known to methylate the NDUFS2 subunit of Complex I, which is necessary for the stability or further assembly of the complex (Zurita2014The). This methylation is a post-translational modification critical for its function (Zurita2014The).

## Function
NDUFAF7 is an arginine methyltransferase that plays a critical role in the assembly of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in ATP production, which is vital for cellular energy metabolism (Zurita2014The). NDUFAF7 specifically methylates the NDUFS2 subunit of complex I at arginine 85, a modification crucial for the stability and proper assembly of the complex (Zurita2014The). This methylation stabilizes an early intermediate in the assembly pathway, ensuring the correct formation and function of complex I (Zurita2014The).

In healthy human cells, NDUFAF7 is primarily detected as a monomer and does not typically associate with complex I subassemblies, although it may interact with them in certain contexts (Zurita2014The). The protein's methyltransferase activity is necessary for its function, as mutations in this motif lead to reduced levels of complex I subunits, particularly affecting the ND1 subunit (Zurita2014The). NDUFAF7's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, highlighting its importance in cellular respiration and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Zurita2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFAF7 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. A notable mutation, c.798C>G (p.Asp266Glu), has been linked to pathologic myopia, a severe form of myopia characterized by excessive elongation of the eye and vision impairment. This mutation impairs complex I activity, leading to decreased ATP production and altered phototransduction in retinal cells, which may contribute to the development of pathologic myopia (Wang2017A). The mutation is particularly impactful in eye tissues, suggesting a significant role in eye-related diseases (Wang2017A).

Other mutations in NDUFAF7, such as p.Thr332Lys and p.His320Gln, have been identified in individuals with early-onset high myopia. These mutations are predicted to affect the protein structure and function, potentially contributing to the disease (Liu2020Mutation). Additionally, NDUFAF7 mutations have been implicated in mitochondrial disorders, presenting with symptoms like dysphagia, delayed milestones, and recurrent pneumonia, highlighting the gene's broader impact on mitochondrial function and associated diseases (Hu2020Clinical).

## Interactions
NDUFAF7 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of complex I of the electron transport chain. It functions as a SAM-dependent methyltransferase and is involved in the methylation of the complex I subunit NDUFS2. This methylation is essential for the stability and assembly of complex I subcomplexes (Zurita2014The; Wu2021Protein). NDUFAF7 interacts with NDUFS2, and mass spectrometry analysis has shown that NDUFS2 is dimethylated on arginine 85, a modification mediated by NDUFAF7 (Zurita2014The).

NDUFAF7 is also associated with the ND1 subunit of complex I. Knockdown of NDUFAF7 results in a significant decrease in the labeling of the ND1 subunit, indicating its role in the translation or stability of this subunit. This defect is attributed to rapid degradation mediated by the protease AFG3L2 (Zurita2014The). Although NDUFAF7 is primarily found as a monomer, some interaction with complex I subassemblies has been suggested through immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments (Zurita2014The).

In addition to its interactions with NDUFS2 and ND1, NDUFAF7 may have other potential targets within complex I, although these interactions are less well characterized (Zurita2014The).
