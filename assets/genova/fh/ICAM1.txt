# ICAM1

## Overview
ICAM1, or intercellular adhesion molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory responses by mediating cell-cell adhesion and signaling. ICAM1 is primarily expressed on endothelial and immune cells, where it facilitates leukocyte adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium, a critical process in immune surveillance and inflammation. The protein interacts with integrins such as LFA-1 and Mac-1, and its expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory cytokines. ICAM1's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by inflammation and immune dysregulation (Staunton1990The; Bui2020ICAM1:).

## Structure
ICAM1 is a cell surface glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses. The protein is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and consists of five tandem immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D5), which are arranged in a bent rod-like structure approximately 18.7 nm long (Staunton1990The). Each domain is about 3.7 nm in length, contributing to the overall elongated shape of the molecule (Staunton1990The).

The primary structure of ICAM1 includes a polypeptide core of 55 kDa, which is heavily glycosylated, resulting in a molecular weight between 76 and 114 kDa depending on the cell type (Staunton1988Primary). The second, third, and fourth Ig-like domains are heavily N-glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification for ICAM1 (Bella1998The).

The tertiary structure of ICAM1 features a hinge region between the second and third domains, allowing for flexibility and enhancing binding kinetics with ligands such as LFA-1 and rhinovirus (Staunton1990The). The binding sites for these ligands are primarily located in the first and second domains, with specific amino acid residues playing critical roles in these interactions (Staunton1990The).

ICAM1 can form homodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, and has several splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions (Staunton1988Primary).

## Function
ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) is a critical cell surface glycoprotein involved in various molecular processes essential for immune function and cellular interactions. In healthy human cells, ICAM1 plays a pivotal role in leukocyte trafficking and transendothelial migration (TEM), facilitating the firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. This process is crucial for leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and migration across the endothelial barrier to sites of inflammation (Bui2020ICAM1:; Lawson2009ICAM1).

ICAM1 interacts with β2 integrins, such as LFA-1 and Mac-1, through its immunoglobulin-like domains, which are essential for leukocyte adhesion and trafficking (Bui2020ICAM1:). It is expressed at low basal levels in endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells but is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines TNFα, IL-1, and IFNγ (Hubbard2000Intercellular).

ICAM1 also functions as a signaling receptor, linking leukocyte adhesion with epithelial and endothelial functions. It associates with the actin cytoskeleton through adaptor proteins, facilitating signaling pathways that regulate barrier properties in endothelial and epithelial cells (Bui2020ICAM1:). This signaling capability makes ICAM1 a master regulator of essential cellular functions, particularly in the context of inflammation and injury resolution (Bui2020ICAM1:).

## Clinical Significance
The ICAM1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ICAM1 is implicated in metastasis, especially to the lungs. It facilitates circulating tumor cell (CTC) cluster formation and trans-endothelial migration, critical steps in metastasis. High ICAM1 expression is associated with increased tumor cell aggregation and enhanced tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions, promoting metastasis. An anti-ICAM1 neutralizing antibody has been shown to reduce lung metastasis in experimental models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Taftaf2021ICAM1).

In cardiovascular diseases, the K469E polymorphism of the ICAM1 gene is linked to coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI). The T allele of this polymorphism is an independent risk factor for these conditions, suggesting a role in atherosclerosis through its involvement in leukocyte adhesion and migration (Jiang2002CT).

ICAM1 is also associated with diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). Elevated serum ICAM1 levels are observed in diabetes patients, and its gene expression is increased in diabetic kidney tissues, indicating a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Gu2013Association).

## Interactions
ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune responses and cell signaling. It primarily interacts with integrins such as LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on leukocytes, facilitating firm adhesion and transmigration across the endothelium (Lawson2009ICAM1; Hopkins2004ICAM1:). ICAM-1 also binds to fibrinogen, rhinoviruses, and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, highlighting its role in pathogen interactions (Lawson2009ICAM1).

The protein is associated with cytoskeletal proteins, including ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin), which are involved in the formation of endothelial docking structures for leukocytes (Barreiro2002Dynamic). ICAM-1's cytoplasmic tail, although lacking classical signaling motifs, is crucial for recruiting downstream signaling molecules and interacting with proteins like a-actinin, cortactin, and b-tubulin (Lawson2009ICAM1).

ICAM-1 engagement can activate signaling pathways, such as the MAP kinase pathway, through interactions with SHP-2, Grb2, and SOS, leading to the activation of transcription factors like c-Fos and c-Jun (Lebedeva2005ICAM1). These interactions underscore ICAM-1's role in immune regulation and inflammation.
