# NEURL1B

## Overview
NEURL1B is a gene that encodes the neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1B, a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein regulation and degradation within cells. This protein is characterized by its E3 ligase activity, facilitated by a RING finger domain, and is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT pathway. NEURL1B is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role during embryogenesis, indicating its importance in early development. The gene's expression and activity are influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, which can impact its function in both normal and cancerous tissues. NEURL1B's involvement in cancer, particularly colon and gallbladder cancers, underscores its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, although its specific roles and mechanisms in different cancer types require further investigation (Ge2020A; Liu2020Aberrant).

## Structure
NEURL1B encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for marking proteins for degradation. The protein structure of NEURL1B includes a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity. This domain is responsible for facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to the substrate protein, a key step in the ubiquitination pathway. Additionally, NEURL1B may contain WWE domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in mediating interactions with other proteins involved in the ubiquitination process.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of NEURL1B, potentially affecting its function in ubiquitination. These modifications may alter the protein's conformation or its interaction with other molecules, thereby modulating its activity. The existence of splice variants of NEURL1B suggests that different isoforms of the protein may exist, each with potentially distinct functions. These isoforms could vary in their domain composition or post-translational modifications, leading to differences in their activity or interactions within the cell. The presence of these structural features and modifications highlights the complexity and regulatory potential of NEURL1B in cellular processes.

## Function
The NEURL1B gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical cellular mechanism for protein regulation and degradation. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is active during embryogenesis, suggesting a role in early development (Liu2020Aberrant). NEURL1B contains three crucial domains: the RING Zn-finger (RZD) domain and two Neuralized Homology Repeat (NHR) domains, which are essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Liu2020Aberrant).

In cellular processes, NEURL1B is associated with multiple signaling pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the PI3K/AKT pathway (Liu2020Aberrant). These pathways are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell proliferation and survival. The protein's activity is influenced by DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression and is commonly altered in cancerous tissues (Liu2020Aberrant).

While the specific role of NEURL1B in healthy human cells is not extensively studied, its involvement in these pathways suggests it plays a significant role in normal cellular functions and development, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Liu2020Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
NEURL1B is implicated in various cancers, notably colon cancer (CC) and gallbladder cancer. In colon cancer, NEURL1B is significantly downregulated, primarily due to hypermethylation, which is associated with poor prognosis. This downregulation is linked to increased expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and is negatively correlated with clinicopathological variables such as age, tumor stage, and lymph metastasis. Low NEURL1B expression is an independent prognostic factor for shorter survival in CC patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation (Liu2020Aberrant).

In gallbladder cancer, NEURL1B is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. However, unlike in colon cancer, the expression level of NEURL1B in gallbladder cancer does not significantly correlate with patient prognosis, indicating a different role or mechanism in this type of cancer (Ge2020A).

The study of NEURL1B in these cancers highlights the importance of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, in tumor development and progression. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of NEURL1B expression alterations and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NEURL1B, or neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1B, is involved in the ubiquitination process, tagging proteins for degradation. It interacts with other proteins through its E3 ligase activity, potentially forming complexes or engaging in transient interactions. These interactions can influence various cellular processes, including protein turnover and signaling pathways.

NEURL1B has been shown to interact with PDE9A, a member of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase family. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments in HEK293-FT cells. NEURL1B, however, shows only minor overlap with PDE9A at the plasma membrane and none in the cytoplasm, indicating a weaker interaction compared to NEURL1 (Taal2019Neuralized). Despite this, NEURL1B does not promote the ubiquitination of PDE9A, unlike NEURL1, which suggests a distinct functional role for NEURL1B in this context (Taal2019Neuralized).

In the context of colon cancer, NEURL1B is involved in protein-protein interactions and is suggested to potentially act as a ligand competing with Notch receptors. This highlights its possible role in signaling pathways related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and PI3K/AKT, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Liu2020Aberrant).
