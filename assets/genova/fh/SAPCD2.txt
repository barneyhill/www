# SAPCD2

## Overview
SAPCD2, or suppressor APC domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer progression. The SAPCD2 protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including the Suppressor_APC domain, which is linked to cell cycle regulation, and the EF-hand domain, associated with metal ion binding and intracellular regulatory functions (Jingchun2023Homologous). This protein plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, and is implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as neuroblastoma, fibrosarcoma, and lung adenocarcinoma (Tomioka2023The; Zhu2020Silencing; Zhang2022SAPCD2). SAPCD2's interactions with key signaling pathways and transcription factors, such as E2F7 and components of the Hippo pathway, highlight its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in oncology (Zhu2020Silencing; Zhang2022SAPCD2).

## Structure
The SAPCD2 gene encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cancer progression. The primary structure of the SAPCD2 protein consists of 394 amino acids, while its splice variant, SAPCD2X1, contains 424 amino acids due to an additional exon that adds 30 amino acids (Jingchun2023Homologous). Both proteins share high similarity in their primary structures and contain several conserved domains, including the Suppressor_APC, GAS, Mplasa_alph_rch, and EF-hand domains (Jingchun2023Homologous).

The secondary structure of SAPCD2 includes 176 α-helices and 14 β-pleated sheets. The insertion of 30 amino acids in SAPCD2X1 alters its secondary structure, impacting its functional properties (Jingchun2023Homologous). The tertiary structure of SAPCD2 features two independent regions: a long arm composed mainly of α-helices within the Suppressor_APC and Mplasa_alph_rch domains, and a short arm composed of random coils and an EF hand-like domain. These arms are located on the same plane (Jingchun2023Homologous). In contrast, the SAPCD2X1 protein's structure is altered, resulting in a 90-degree rotation of the short arm, which distances the EF-hand-like domain from the Suppressor_APC domain (Jingchun2023Homologous).

## Function
SAPCD2 (suppressor APC domain containing 2) is involved in several molecular functions and biological processes in human cells. It is associated with enzyme regulator activity, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, and signaling receptor activity, playing roles in the cell cycle, cell population proliferation, and cell death (Jingchun2023Homologous). The SAPCD2 protein contains structural domains such as the Suppressor_APC domain, which is derived from the Adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein and may be involved in cell cycle regulation and spindle orientation during cell division. The EF-hand domain is associated with metal ion binding and is similar to domains found in the S100 oncoprotein family, which is involved in intracellular regulatory functions like proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining calcium homeostasis (Jingchun2023Homologous).

In neuroblastoma cells, SAPCD2 is linked to the regulation of the cell cycle and E2F activity, with knockdown experiments showing reduced E2F-mediated transcriptional activity and decreased expression of E2F transcription activators and cell cycle-related genes (Zhang2022SAPCD2). Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, SAPCD2's involvement in these processes suggests it plays a role in normal cellular regulation and homeostasis (Jingchun2023Homologous).

## Clinical Significance
SAPCD2 is implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its overexpression and role in cell cycle regulation. In fibrosarcoma, SAPCD2 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with early progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Silencing SAPCD2 in fibrosarcoma cells activates the Hippo signaling pathway, reducing tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2020Silencing). In neuroblastoma, SAPCD2 is also overexpressed and associated with poor outcomes. It alters the subcellular distribution of E2F7, a transcription factor, leading to increased E2F activity and promoting tumor progression. Knockdown of SAPCD2 in neuroblastoma cells results in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting its oncogenic role (Zhang2022SAPCD2).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SAPCD2 is identified as a gene negatively impacting prognosis when highly expressed. It is involved in the malignant transformation of cancer cells and functions as a mitotic phase-promoting factor. miR-486-5p, a tumor suppressor, targets SAPCD2, suppressing cell malignancy in lung adenocarcinoma (Tomioka2023The). These findings across different cancer types underscore the clinical significance of SAPCD2 as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SAPCD2 interacts with the transcription factor E2F7, primarily in the cytoplasm, affecting its subcellular distribution and activity. This interaction prevents E2F7 from translocating to the nucleus, where it would typically repress E2F transcriptional activity, thereby promoting neuroblastoma progression (Zhang2022SAPCD2). The interaction between SAPCD2 and E2F7 has been validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence staining (Zhang2022SAPCD2).

In fibrosarcoma, SAPCD2 is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. Silencing SAPCD2 activates this pathway, leading to increased phosphorylation of MST1/2, LATS1, and YAP1, and decreased nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ, which are downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway (Zhu2020Silencing). This suggests that SAPCD2 may interact with components of the Hippo pathway to influence cell proliferation and metastasis.

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, SAPCD2 expression is regulated by the long noncoding RNA PXN-AS1-L, which interacts with the 3′UTR of SAPCD2 mRNA. This interaction protects SAPCD2 mRNA from degradation, thereby upregulating its expression (Jia2019Long). In triple-negative breast cancer, SAPCD2 is a target of miR-29a-3p, and its expression is modulated by the long non-coding RNA DUXAP8, which sponges miR-29a-3p to regulate SAPCD2 levels (Yang2021YY1inudced).
