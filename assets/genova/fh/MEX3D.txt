# MEX3D

## Overview
MEX3D is a gene that encodes the protein mex-3 RNA binding family member D, which is part of the MEX-3 family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a K-homology (KH) domain and a RING finger domain, the latter conferring E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. These structural features enable the protein to participate in post-transcriptional regulation by binding to RNA molecules and modulating their stability, localization, and translation. MEX3D is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with target mRNAs, influencing various cellular processes. The protein is notably expressed in immune-privileged tissues such as the placenta and testis, where it plays a role in modulating immune responses. Additionally, MEX3D has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including cervical, prostate, and non-small-cell lung cancer, due to its involvement in RNA decay and translational regulation (BuchetPoyau2007Identification; Shao2021MEX3D; Zheng2022RNAbinding).

## Function
MEX3D, a member of the MEX-3 RNA-binding protein family, functions as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with a K-homology (KH) domain and a RING finger domain, which confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This structure allows MEX3D to modulate the ubiquitination of target proteins, influencing their stability and subcellular localization (BuchetPoyau2007Identification; Zheng2022RNAbinding). MEX3D is involved in post-transcriptional regulation by binding to RNA molecules, affecting their stability, localization, and translation. It is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with target mRNAs (BuchetPoyau2007Identification).

In healthy human cells, MEX3D is expressed at high mRNA levels in immune-privileged tissues such as the placenta and testis, which helps these tissues avoid inflammatory reactions by downregulating classical HLA class Ia molecules and upregulating anti-inflammatory molecules (JasinskiBergner2020The). The expression of MEX3D does not always correlate with protein levels, indicating post-transcriptional regulation (JasinskiBergner2020The). MEX3D's role in RNA binding and ubiquitination suggests it may be involved in RNA decay and translational regulation, potentially relocating to stress granules under certain conditions (BuchetPoyau2007Identification).

## Clinical Significance
MEX3D has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), MEX3D overexpression is associated with worse overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2022Investigation). Although no significant mutations in MEX3D were found in NSCLC, its overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes (Zhang2022Investigation).

In cervical cancer, MEX3D acts as an oncogene by destabilizing TSC22D1 mRNA, which promotes tumorigenesis. Its expression is notably higher in HPV16-positive cervical cancer tissues, influenced by the HPV16 E7 oncogene. Knocking down MEX3D in cervical cancer cells reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zheng2022RNAbinding).

In prostate cancer, MEX3D is identified as an oncogenic driver, particularly in cases with PTEN loss and TMPRSS2/ERG fusion expression. It is associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion, and its interaction with the transcription factor TCF3 further contributes to cancer progression (Shao2021MEX3D).

## Interactions
MEX3D, a member of the MEX-3 RNA-binding protein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA, such as those found in BCL2 mRNA, promoting its degradation and influencing apoptosis regulation in neuronal cells (BuchetPoyau2007Identification; Sagata2017Dysregulated). In cervical cancer, MEX3D interacts with TSC22D1 mRNA, destabilizing it and promoting tumorigenesis by reducing apoptosis and enhancing cell proliferation (Zheng2022RNAbinding).

In prostate cancer, MEX3D has been identified as an oncogenic driver, with a strong correlation to the TCF3 gene. MEX3D and TCF3 proteins have been shown to interact directly, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a significant role in cancer progression (Shao2021MEX3D). MEX3D also interacts with RNA through its KH domains, which are crucial for its RNA-binding capabilities (BuchetPoyau2007Identification). These interactions highlight MEX3D's role in post-transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on various cellular processes and diseases.
