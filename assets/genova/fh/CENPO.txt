# CENPO

## Overview
CENPO, or centromere protein O, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a vital component of the centromere protein family. The centromere protein O is integral to the proper functioning of the kinetochore, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. As a part of the CENP-O complex, this protein plays a critical role in ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability. Dysregulation of CENPO expression has been linked to various cancers, where it is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2023Prognostic; Si2024High).

## Function
CENPO (centromere protein O) is a crucial component of the centromere protein family, playing a significant role in the processes of meiosis and mitosis. It is primarily involved in chromosome segregation and the normal cell division process, ensuring accurate distribution of genetic material to daughter cells. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer (Wang2023Prognostic).

CENPO is part of the larger CENP-O complex, which is essential for the formation and function of kinetochores during cell division. Kinetochores are structures that attach chromosomes to microtubules, facilitating their separation during mitosis. CENPO's role in kinetochore function is critical for proper chromosome alignment and segregation, contributing to the stability of the genome (Si2024High).

In healthy human cells, CENPO is active at the centromere, where it helps prevent premature sister chromatid separation. This activity is crucial for the accurate progression of the cell cycle and normal cellular function, supporting organismal development and cellular homeostasis (Wang2023Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CENPO gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high expression of CENPO is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (Wang2023Prognostic). CENPO expression is also linked to the TNM stage in LUAD, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2023Prognostic).

In ovarian cancer, CENPO is highly expressed in several cell lines, promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Knockdown of CENPO in these cells leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene in ovarian cancer (Si2024High). The gene's dysregulation is associated with cancer progression and may serve as a molecular therapeutic target (Si2024High).

CENPO is also upregulated in gastric cancer, where its expression correlates with enhanced tumorigenicity. Downregulation of CENPO in gastric cancer models results in reduced tumor growth and altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as ATM, CCND1, and c-Jun (Cao2019CENPO). These findings highlight CENPO's role in cancer development and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
