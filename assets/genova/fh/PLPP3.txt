# PLPP3

## Overview
Phospholipid phosphatase 3 (PLPP3) is a gene that encodes the integral membrane protein known as lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3). This protein is a member of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) family and is characterized by its six transmembrane alpha-helices and three extracellular catalytic domains, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Busnelli2018Lipid). LPP3 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by dephosphorylating lipid substrates such as lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate, thereby modulating key signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration, and vascular development (Busnelli2018Lipid; Van2022Lipid). Beyond its catalytic functions, LPP3 is involved in cellular interactions, particularly with integrins, influencing endothelial cell adhesion and vascular pathophysiology (Busnelli2018Lipid). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining endothelial integrity and has significant implications in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other pathological conditions (Tang2015Lipid; Panchatcharam2013Lipid).

## Structure
Lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3), encoded by the PLPP3 gene, is an integral membrane protein characterized by six transmembrane alpha-helices (Busnelli2018Lipid). The protein includes three catalytic domains, labeled C1, C2, and C3, which are located on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane or the luminal surface of intracellular organelles. These domains are crucial for substrate recognition and the phosphotransferase reaction (Busnelli2018Lipid).

LPP3 interacts with integrins through an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) recognition motif found in the second extracellular loop between transmembrane alpha-helices III and IV (Busnelli2018Lipid). This interaction is significant for its role in vascular pathophysiology.

The protein is part of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) family and is involved in the dephosphorylation of various lipid substrates, including lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate (Busnelli2018Lipid). While the context does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, LPP3's structure and function are integral to its role in lipid metabolism and vascular development. The protein's structure supports its enzymatic activity and interactions with other cellular components.

## Function
Lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3), encoded by the PLPP3 gene, is an integral membrane protein involved in the dephosphorylation of various lipid substrates, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating lipid signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, migration, and vascular development (Busnelli2018Lipid; Van2022Lipid). LPP3 is active at the cell surface, where it dephosphorylates extracellular LPA and S1P, thereby modulating receptor-mediated signaling and maintaining endothelial integrity (Busnelli2018Lipid).

In healthy human cells, LPP3 plays a significant role in maintaining endothelial cell homeostasis and barrier function by enhancing cell-cell interactions and reducing vascular permeability (Busnelli2018Lipid). It also regulates intracellular signaling by dephosphorylating phosphatidic acid, ceramide-1-phosphate, and S1P, affecting processes such as inflammation and apoptosis (Busnelli2018Lipid). LPP3's non-catalytic functions include binding to integrins at the plasma membrane, promoting endothelial cell adhesion, and influencing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and axis patterning (EscalanteAlcalde2003The). These activities underscore LPP3's role in vascular pathophysiology and its potential impact on atherosclerosis development (Busnelli2018Lipid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLPP3 gene, which encodes phospholipid phosphatase 3, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. Genetic variants associated with lower PLPP3 expression are linked to increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). These variants can exacerbate vascular injury responses, leading to enhanced intimal hyperplasia and vascular inflammation (Panchatcharam2014Mice; Panchatcharam2013Lipid). Genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PPAP2B gene, which encodes LPP3, associated with atherosclerotic CAD, suggesting that alterations in LPP3 expression or function could have clinical significance in vascular diseases (Reschen2015LipidInduced; Panchatcharam2013Lipid).

In the context of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), dysregulation of PLPP3, potentially due to epigenetic changes, may contribute to the osteogenic reprogramming of valve interstitial cells, promoting disease progression (Mkannez2018DNA). In cancer, decreased LPP3 expression is observed in several types, which may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis by affecting cell migration and invasion (Tang2015Lipid). These findings underscore the importance of PLPP3 in maintaining vascular integrity and its potential role in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PLPP3, also known as phospholipid phosphatase 3, participates in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It is known to stabilize β-catenin, a key protein in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, by preventing its phosphorylation. This stabilization enhances β-catenin's interaction with lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1), which is important for transcriptional activity related to endothelial cell migration and fibronectin synthesis (Humtsoe2010Lipid).

PLPP3 also interacts with p120-catenin (p120ctn) in endothelial cells, particularly in confluent cell conditions. This interaction is specific and does not require VE-cadherin, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The C-terminal domain of PLPP3 is crucial for binding with p120ctn, and this interaction is significant for the formation of multiprotein complexes at the cell surface, influencing cell adhesion and migration (Humtsoe2010Lipid).

Additionally, PLPP3 is involved in the dephosphorylation of lipid mediators like sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which plays a role in various cellular processes, including endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Humtsoe2010Lipid). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PLPP3 in cellular signaling and structural integrity.
