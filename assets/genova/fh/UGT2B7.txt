# UGT2B7

## Overview
UGT2B7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B7, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme is a member of the glycosyltransferase family and plays a pivotal role in the glucuronidation process, a critical phase II metabolic pathway in humans. UGT2B7 is involved in the detoxification and elimination of a wide array of endogenous and exogenous compounds by catalyzing the transfer of glucuronic acid, thereby enhancing their solubility and facilitating excretion. The enzyme is highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract and is essential for the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous molecules, including steroids and bile acids. UGT2B7's activity is modulated by genetic polymorphisms, alternative splicing, and protein-protein interactions, which can influence its substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency (Fujiwara2010Interactions; Meech2019The).

## Structure
UGT2B7 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, consisting of approximately 530 amino acids. The protein is organized into two main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) with a cleavable signal peptide for ER membrane targeting, and the C-terminal transmembrane domain (CTD) that anchors the protein to the ER membrane (Xue2022Integrate). The C-terminal domain includes a single transmembrane helix that spans the phospholipid bilayer (Xue2022Integrate).

The secondary structure of UGT2B7 is characterized by eleven alpha-helices and nine beta-sheets, with additional helices labeled A0, B0, C0, and F0. The tertiary structure is organized into two main catalytic domains connected by I, J, and K helices, and a flexible A-A0 loop region (Lewis2011Homodimerization). The C-terminal domain, which has been crystallized, features a Rossman-type fold with a core parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, consistent with the GT-B fold family of glycosyltransferases (Miley2007Crystal).

UGT2B7 forms homodimers, with a dimerization domain identified within the B0-C loop domain, spanning residues 183 through 200. This domain includes a signature motif FPPSYVPVVMS, characterized by 'proline brackets' at positions 190 and 195, which are typical of protein-protein interaction sites (Lewis2011Homodimerization). Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification for UGT2B7, affecting its stability and activity (GirardBock2016A).

## Function
UGT2B7 is a UDP-glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process, a major phase II metabolic pathway in humans. This enzyme is highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, where it facilitates the detoxification and elimination of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds by catalyzing the transfer of glucuronic acid to these substrates, increasing their solubility and promoting excretion via bile or urine (Yuan2015Homo; Meech2019The; Ménard2013Expression).

UGT2B7 is involved in the metabolism of various therapeutic drugs, such as zidovudine, morphine, and tamoxifen, as well as endogenous molecules like steroids, bile acids, and fatty acids (Meech2019The; Ménard2013Expression). It also plays a role in the inactivation of mutagenic metabolites of estrogens, which is significant for modulating estrogen bioavailability and potentially influencing cancer risk (Thibaudeau2006Characterization).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by genetic polymorphisms, alternative splicing, and interactions with other proteins, such as cytochrome P-450 enzymes, which can affect its substrate specificity and catalytic rates (Fujiwara2010Interactions; Meech2019The). UGT2B7's function is essential for maintaining homeostasis and protecting cells from toxic substances.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UGT2B7 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, UGT2B7 expression is significantly reduced in invasive breast cancers, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressor role. This reduction may compromise the enzyme's ability to glucuronidate 4-hydroxyestrone, potentially leading to increased oxidative DNA damage and cancer progression (Gestl2002Expression). In contrast, in situ carcinomas often show preserved or increased expression of UGT2B7, indicating a complex role in cancer development (Gestl2002Expression).

UGT2B7 polymorphisms have also been associated with drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Specifically, the UGT2B7*2 allele is linked to an increased risk of diclofenac-induced liver injury, as individuals with this allele may be 'rapid glucuronidators', leading to higher concentrations of reactive metabolites that contribute to hepatotoxicity (Daly2007Genetic).

Additionally, genetic variants of UGT2B7, such as the À79 G>A promoter polymorphism, are associated with decreased transcriptional activity, potentially affecting the inactivation of estrogen metabolites and influencing the risk of breast and endometrial cancers (Thibaudeau2006Characterization).

## Interactions
UGT2B7 is involved in extensive protein-protein interactions within human liver microsomes. It specifically interacts with other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms such as UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9, as well as with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP3A4. These interactions suggest the formation of a "metabolosome," a complex that may facilitate substrate and metabolite transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Fujiwara2014Extensive).

UGT2B7 also forms homodimers, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. A specific dimerization domain within the B0-C loop domain, spanning residues 183-200, has been identified, which stabilizes the dimer interface through interactions such as salt bridges and π-π interactions (Lewis2011Homodimerization).

The interaction between UGT2B7 and CYP3A4 involves specific domains of CYP3A4, including the J-helix region, which is crucial for their association. This interaction may modulate the functions of both enzymes, impacting drug metabolism (Takeda2009Interaction). These protein-protein interactions highlight the complex role of UGT2B7 in metabolic processes.
