# MAP2K4

## Overview
MAP2K4, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The protein product of MAP2K4, also referred to as MKK4, plays a pivotal role in cellular responses to stress, cytokines, and growth factors by phosphorylating and activating c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAP kinases (Dérijard1995Independent; Ho2003A). As a kinase, MKK4 is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, which is essential for its function in signal transduction. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and cell differentiation, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of healthy human cells (Ho2003A). MAP2K4's interactions and regulatory mechanisms make it a significant focus of research, particularly in the context of cancer and autoimmune diseases, where its expression and activity can influence disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Shchetynsky2015Gene–gene; Pavese2014MitogenActivated).

## Structure
MAP2K4, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, is a dual-specificity kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. The protein structure includes a kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is characterized by a smaller N-terminal lobe composed of five beta-sheets and one alpha-helix, connected to a larger C-terminal lobe mainly consisting of alpha-helices via a flexible hinge region (Matsumoto2010Crystal). The ATP binding pocket is located between these two lobes, with specific residues such as Glu179 and Met181 forming hydrogen bonds with the adenine moiety of ATP analogs (Matsumoto2010Crystal).

MAP2K4 can exist in different conformational states, including an inactive unphosphorylated form and an active phosphorylated form. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as serine 257 and threonine 261, is essential for its activation (Shevchenko2020The). The protein also has a pseudo-beta-barrel architecture in its apo form, which becomes more compact upon binding with ATP analogs (Matsumoto2020Ensemble).

A novel splice variant, Map2k4δ, has been identified, which is expressed alongside the canonical form in various tissues. This variant may play a role in modulating the balance between cell growth and apoptosis (Haeusgen2014Map2k4δ).

## Function
MAP2K4, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway. It is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinases, which are crucial for cellular responses to stress, cytokines, and growth factors (Dérijard1995Independent; Ho2003A). MAP2K4 is activated by various mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs) and interacts with these kinases through a domain for versatile docking (DVD) at its C-terminus, which is essential for its phosphorylation and specificity in signaling pathways (Haeusgen2011The).

In healthy human cells, MAP2K4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as apoptosis, inflammation, and cell differentiation (Ho2003A). It contains a docking site that mediates high-affinity binding to JNK MAPKs, which is crucial for forming stable complexes and ensuring efficient signal transmission within the JNK cascade (Ho2003A). This interaction is vital for modulating JNK activity, which is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and differentiation (Ho2003A).

## Clinical Significance
MAP2K4 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in the MAPK signaling pathway. In prostate cancer, overexpression of MAP2K4 is associated with increased metastasis and invasion, potentially through the upregulation of proteins such as MMP-2 and HSP27, which are linked to poor prognosis (Pavese2014MitogenActivated). The gene's overexpression leads to increased cellular invasion and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer (Pavese2014MitogenActivated).

In ovarian cancer, MAP2K4 is often inactivated, with frequent deletions observed in high-grade serous and endometrioid carcinomas. This inactivation is associated with tumor suppressor functions, and its loss correlates with reduced overall survival in some studies (Davis2011Analysis). The gene's inactivation in ovarian cancer suggests a complex role, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor in this context.

In rheumatoid arthritis, MAP2K4 expression is influenced by genetic interactions, such as those involving the SNP rs10468473 and HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles. These interactions affect MAP2K4 mRNA expression and are associated with the development of autoantibody-positive rheumatoid arthritis (Shchetynsky2015Gene–gene).

## Interactions
MAP2K4, also known as MKK4, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway. It interacts with various proteins to mediate cellular responses to stress and inflammation. MAP2K4 directly phosphorylates and activates c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), specifically MAPK8 (JNK1) and MAPK9 (JNK2), which are crucial for stress signaling pathways (Ahn2011Map2k4). 

In the context of cancer, MAP2K4 has been shown to interact with heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), which are associated with increased cell invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer. MAP2K4 overexpression leads to elevated levels of these proteins, enhancing the invasive capabilities of cancer cells (Pavese2014MitogenActivated). 

MAP2K4 is also targeted by microRNA miR-27a, which acts as a tumor suppressor by binding to the coding sequence region of MAP2K4, thereby regulating its expression. This interaction is part of a complex network involving the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which influences prostate cancer progression (Wan2016Androgeninduced). 

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MAP2K4 in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
