# SCP2D1

## Overview
SCP2D1 is a gene that encodes the SCP2 sterol binding domain containing 1 protein, which is involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is categorized as a sterol carrier protein, playing a crucial role in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and other lipids. The SCP2 sterol binding domain containing 1 protein is implicated in various metabolic pathways, influencing processes such as bile acid metabolism and cellular protein metabolic processes. Its expression and function have been linked to several health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease and cardiovascular disorders such as spontaneous coronary artery dissection and aortic aneurysm. Additionally, SCP2D1 expression levels have been associated with sperm density in reproductive biology, suggesting a potential role in fertility (Chai2022GenomeWide; Ing2020Identification; Vishweswaraiah2022Methylated).

## Clinical Significance
The SCP2D1 gene has been implicated in several conditions due to its role in lipid metabolism and its interactions with other metabolic pathways. In Parkinson's Disease (PD), alterations in the methylation of SCP2D1 have been observed, particularly the hypomethylation of the cg23330137 locus. This epigenetic change is negatively correlated with taurine levels, suggesting a potential link between SCP2D1 methylation and metabolic dysregulation in PD brains (Vishweswaraiah2022Methylated). Although SCP2D1 has not been directly associated with neurodegenerative diseases before, these findings indicate its possible involvement in PD pathogenesis through bile acid metabolism pathways.

In cardiovascular conditions, SCP2D1 is among the proteins affected by genetic variants at the 1q21.2 locus, which is associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD). These genetic associations suggest that SCP2D1 may play a role in the regulation of peptidase activity and cellular protein metabolic processes, potentially impacting cardiovascular health (Chai2022GenomeWide).

In reproductive biology, SCP2D1 expression is notably higher in more dense stallion spermatozoa, indicating its potential role in sperm density and fertility, although its direct link to fertility-related conditions remains unexplored (Ing2020Identification).
