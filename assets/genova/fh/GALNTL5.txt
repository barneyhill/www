# GALNTL5

## Overview
The GALNTL5 gene encodes the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like 5 protein, which is a member of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like family involved in O-linked glycosylation. This protein is characterized by a transmembrane domain and catalytic motifs typical of pp-GalNAc-T proteins, although it notably lacks the C-terminal lectin domain found in other family members (Takasaki2014A). While its glycosyltransferase activity has not been confirmed, GALNTL5 is believed to play a crucial role in spermatogenesis, particularly affecting sperm formation and motility (Hagiuda2019Mutation). The gene is predominantly expressed in the testes, with localization in specific regions of spermatids and spermatozoa, suggesting its involvement in processes such as vesicle cargo transport and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Takasaki2014A). Mutations in GALNTL5 have been associated with male infertility, specifically asthenozoospermia, and the gene exhibits a cancer/testis expression pattern, implicating it in certain cancer types (Jamin2021Combined; Takasaki2014A).

## Structure
The GALNTL5 protein is part of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like family, which is involved in O-linked glycosylation. It possesses a typical transmembrane domain and a catalytic unit with two conserved motifs found in pp-GalNAc-T proteins. However, it lacks the typical C-terminal lectin domain, distinguishing it from other similar proteins like GALNT3 (Takasaki2014A). The catalytic domains of GALNTL5 are highly conserved, although its activity as a glycosyltransferase has not been confirmed (Hagiuda2019Mutation).

The GALNTL5 gene has been shown to produce splice variants, including a novel variant named GALNTL5-AS, which lacks exon 2. This variant results in a shorter protein that lacks key motifs such as the glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) and Gal/GalNAc-T motifs, potentially leading to a dysfunctional protein (Li2016A). The 3D structure analysis of the GALNTL5 protein confirms these findings, indicating structural differences between the splice variants (Li2016A).

The expression of GALNTL5 is restricted to the testes, primarily in round and elongated spermatids, and it accumulates in the neck region of mature spermatozoa (Hagiuda2019Mutation).

## Function
The GALNTL5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like family, which is involved in the initial step of O-glycosylation. This process is crucial for protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions. Although the glycosyltransferase activity of GALNTL5 has not been confirmed in vitro, it is believed to play a significant role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the formation and motility of sperm (Hagiuda2019Mutation; Takasaki2014A).

In healthy human cells, GALNTL5 is primarily expressed in the testis, with its mRNA found mainly in round and elongated spermatids. The protein is localized in specific regions of spermatids and spermatozoa, such as the acroplaxome and the neck region around the head-tail coupling apparatus (Takasaki2014A). GALNTL5 is hypothesized to participate in vesicle cargo transport and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, contributing to protein loading into acrosomes and the accumulation of ubiquitin-proteasome components in the neck region of spermatozoa (Takasaki2014A).

The gene's expression pattern is consistent with a classical cancer/testis gene, with strong expression in adult testis, enriched spermatocytes, and round spermatids, suggesting its role in the male germline (Jamin2021Combined).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALNTL5 gene have been linked to male infertility, specifically a condition known as asthenozoospermia, which is characterized by reduced sperm motility. In both mice and humans, heterozygous mutations in GALNTL5 result in immotile sperm due to disruptions in glycolytic enzymes necessary for motility, improper protein loading into acrosomes, and mislocalization of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Takasaki2014A). These mutations can lead to morphological abnormalities in sperm and are associated with a significant decrease in sperm motility (Takasaki2014A).

In humans, specific mutations such as a nucleotide deletion in the sixth exon of GALNTL5 have been identified in patients with asthenozoospermia, suggesting a genetic basis for the condition (Takasaki2014A). The presence of GALNTL5 mutations in sperm, but not in somatic cells, indicates a potential for these mutations to resolve over time, leading to improved sperm motility (Hagiuda2019Mutation).

GALNTL5 has also been implicated in cancer, showing a cancer/testis gene expression pattern in certain cancer types, such as endometrial adenocarcinoma and thyroid cancer, suggesting a role in cancer cell division and resistance to chemotherapy (Jamin2021Combined).
