# ZNF764

## Overview
ZNF764 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 764, a C2H2-type zinc finger protein characterized by its role as a transcriptional coactivator. This protein is involved in modulating the activity of several steroid hormone receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), androgen receptor (AR), and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency). The protein contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its interaction with DNA and other proteins, thereby influencing transcriptional regulation (Fadda2017Genomewide). ZNF764 is crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions related to steroid hormones, and its haploinsufficiency can lead to resistance to multiple steroid hormones, underscoring its importance in endocrine signaling pathways (Fadda2017Genomewide; Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
The ZNF764 protein is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein composed of 407 amino acids. It features a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain located between amino acids 40-95 and seven C2H2-type zinc fingers distributed in its N-terminal and C-terminal halves, respectively (Fadda2017Genomewide). The KRAB domain is known for its role in protein-protein interactions, particularly with the KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), which is involved in chromatin modulation (Fadda2017Genomewide). The zinc fingers are crucial for DNA binding, allowing the protein to interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) and modulate transcriptional activity (Fadda2017Genomewide).

The secondary structure of the zinc fingers includes one α-helix and two β-sheets, with the α-helix fitting into the major groove of the DNA double helix (Fadda2017Genomewide). This structural arrangement enables ZNF764 to wrap around the DNA polymer, facilitating its role as a transcriptional coactivator for several steroid hormone receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Fadda2017Genomewide). The protein's interaction with GR is dexamethasone-dependent and occurs at the ligand-binding domain through its KRAB domain (Fadda2017Genomewide). The context does not provide detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structures, specific folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of ZNF764.

## Function
ZNF764 is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional coactivator for several steroid hormone receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), androgen receptor (AR), and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency). It enhances the transcriptional activity of these receptors by modulating their DNA-binding profiles and directing their activity toward specific biological pathways (Fadda2017Genomewide). ZNF764 interacts with the GR at the ligand-binding domain through its KRAB domain, which is essential for its regulatory function (Fadda2017Genomewide).

In healthy human cells, ZNF764 is involved in maintaining normal physiological functions related to steroid hormones, such as organ homeostasis and adaptive responses (Fadda2017Genomewide). It plays a crucial role in hormone signaling pathways, influencing the transcriptional activity of hormone-responsive genes (Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency). ZNF764's activity is predominantly located in intergenic regions and introns, with significant co-localization with GR binding sites, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation through interaction with GRs (Maksimenko2021CTCF). Haploinsufficiency of ZNF764 can lead to tissue resistance to multiple steroid hormones, highlighting its importance in healthy human cells (Fadda2017Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF764 haploinsufficiency has been implicated in partial resistance to glucocorticoids, androgens, and thyroid hormones, particularly in cases involving a 16p11.2 microdeletion. This genetic alteration can lead to reduced expression of ZNF764, which is thought to be responsible for the observed hormone resistance in affected individuals (Fadda2017Genomewide; Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency). A study involving a patient with a 1.1-Mb heterozygous microdeletion at 16p11.2 demonstrated that ZNF764 is crucial for the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid, androgen, and thyroid hormone receptors, suggesting its significant role in hormone action (Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency).

Mutations in ZNF764, such as nonsense mutations, can introduce premature stop codons, potentially resulting in truncated proteins that may lose their functional capability or gain inappropriate functions. These mutations can contribute to severe disease states or aberrant cellular behavior (He2024Preliminary). The clinical significance of ZNF764 mutations is further supported by cases of multiple steroid hormone resistance, where ZNF764's interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor is crucial for regulating transcriptional activity (Fadda2017Genomewide). These findings highlight the potential impact of ZNF764 mutations and altered expression on endocrine disorders and developmental issues.

## Interactions
ZNF764 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) through its KRAB domain and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GR. This interaction is glucocorticoid-dependent and is crucial for modulating GR's transcriptional activity on glucocorticoid-responsive genes (Fadda2017Genomewide). ZNF764 does not alter the affinity of GR to dexamethasone but modulates the transcriptional activity of GR on glucocorticoid-responsive genes by potentially affecting chromatin structure through its KRAB domain, which attracts chromatin modulatory proteins (Fadda2017Genomewide).

ZNF764 also interacts with transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (TIF1), a general nuclear hormone receptor coactivator, to enhance GR activity. This interaction suggests that ZNF764 cooperates with general nuclear receptor coactivators to mediate its effects on GR transcriptional activity (Kino2012ZNF764Haploinsufficiency). The zinc fingers in ZNF764 may contribute to its regulatory actions by binding to DNA or other proteins, directing GR transcriptional activity towards specific biological pathways (Fadda2017Genomewide). ZNF764's interaction with GR and its influence on GR's regulatory functions are supported by various experimental methods, including co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays (Fadda2017Genomewide).
