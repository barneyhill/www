# OSTC

## Overview
The OSTC gene encodes a non-catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is integral to the process of N-linked glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that, while not directly involved in the catalytic activity of the OST complex, plays a crucial role in the proper assembly and function of the complex. The OST complex is essential for the co-translational addition of oligosaccharides to nascent proteins, a process vital for protein folding and stability. OSTC is expressed in various tissues, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein maturation. Although the specific functions of the OSTC-encoded protein in human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in the OST complex suggests a significant role in glycosylation pathways, with potential implications for understanding congenital disorders of glycosylation and other glycosylation-related conditions (Bryant2020Oligosaccharyltransferase; Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated; Wilson2021The).

## Function
The OSTC gene encodes a non-catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is essential for N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. This process involves the transfer of oligosaccharides to nascent proteins, a critical step for proper protein folding and stability. OSTC is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue types, including the brain, heart, liver, and kidney, indicating its widespread importance in cellular function (Bryant2020Oligosaccharyltransferase).

In the OST complex, OSTC is suggested to influence nascent polypeptide N-glycosylation, although its specific function in human cells remains unclear (Roboti2012Keratinocyteassociated). The OST complex, which includes OSTC, is crucial for the co-translational addition of glycans to nascent proteins, affecting the glycosylation of specific glycoproteins and leading to increased levels of non-glycosylated or hypoglycosylated forms when disrupted (Roboti2012The). The OST complex's role in N-glycosylation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein maturation, impacting various cellular processes and potentially leading to multi-organ dysfunction when defective (Bryant2020Oligosaccharyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
The OSTC gene, which encodes a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, plays a role in N-linked protein glycosylation. Alterations in the OSTC gene have been implicated in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations (Wilson2021The). While specific diseases directly caused by OSTC mutations are not detailed, the gene's involvement in the OST complex suggests its potential role in glycosylation-related disorders.

Copy-number variations (CNVs) involving the OSTC gene have been identified in patients with heterotaxy, a condition affecting the left-right patterning of organs, and congenital heart disease (CHD) (Kostiuk2021Xenopus). These genetic variations may influence developmental pathways associated with these conditions, although a direct causal relationship has not been established (Rigler2015Novel).

Research indicates that while OSTC is a unique subunit of the OST complex, it was not found to be essential for certain glycosylation processes, such as LOX N-glycosylation, in specific experimental assays (Kas2023Functional). This suggests that its role in glycosylation may be context-dependent, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
OSTC is a non-catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which plays a crucial role in N-linked glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum. OSTC interacts with other subunits of the OST complex, such as STT3A and STT3B, which are catalytic subunits involved in the glycosylation process (Roboti2012The). The OST complex is composed of multiple subunits, including OST48 and DAD1, which are essential for the stability and assembly of the complex. OSTC is part of the OSTC500 complex, which contains the STT3A isoform, and is involved in the glycosylation of specific substrates (Roboti2012The).

The interactions of OSTC within the OST complex are significant for maintaining the integrity and function of the complex. The presence of OSTC in the OST complex is crucial for the proper glycosylation of nascent proteins, as it interacts with other subunits to facilitate the transfer of oligosaccharides to target proteins (Roboti2012The). These interactions highlight the importance of OSTC in the broader context of protein quality control and the glycosylation pathway in mammalian cells.
