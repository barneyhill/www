# KANSL3

## Overview
KANSL3 is a gene that encodes the KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 3, a protein integral to the Non-Specific Lethal (NSL) complex, which is involved in transcription regulation through histone acetylation. The KANSL3 protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit within this complex, playing a pivotal role in the acetylation of histone H4, which is crucial for transcription initiation and gene expression (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). Beyond its role in transcription, KANSL3 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitosis, where it stabilizes microtubules, and mitochondrial function, where it influences mitochondrial DNA transcription and respiration (Sheikh2019The). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as Parkinson's disease, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a contributing factor (Kelly2023Proteina).

## Function
KANSL3 is a core component of the NSL (Non-Specific Lethal) complex, which plays a crucial role in histone acetylation, a key process in gene expression regulation. Within the NSL complex, KANSL3 is involved in the acetylation of histone H4 at lysines 5 and 8 (H4K5ac and H4K8ac), marks that are enriched at transcription start sites and are essential for transcription initiation (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). KANSL3 predominantly localizes to transcription start sites and is involved in the expression of a subset of essential genes, facilitating gene expression by co-localizing with active transcription markers like H3K4me3 (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent).

KANSL3 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including mitosis and mitochondrial activity. It relocates from nuclear chromatin to microtubules during mitosis, stabilizing them and interacting with spindle assembly factors, which is crucial for microtubule assembly and stability (Sheikh2019The). In mitochondria, KANSL3 helps maintain mitochondrial DNA transcription, impacting mitochondrial respiration (Sheikh2019The). The NSL complex, including KANSL3, is involved in autophagy regulation and interacts with DNA-binding transcription factors, facilitating transcription activation (Sheikh2019The). KANSL3's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper transcriptional regulation.

## Clinical Significance
KANSL3, a component of the NSL complex, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) through its role in mitochondrial function and mitophagy. Alterations in the NSL complex, including KANSL3, may contribute to PD by affecting mitochondrial quality control, particularly through the regulation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy. This process is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health, and disruptions can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, a known factor in PD pathogenesis (Kelly2023Proteina; Kelly2023Protein).

While specific diseases directly associated with KANSL3 mutations are not extensively documented, the gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis suggests potential implications in various conditions. The NSL complex, including KANSL3, is involved in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and regulating stress responses, indicating that its dysregulation could impact developmental processes and stress-related conditions (Sheikh2019The).

KANSL3's role in stabilizing microtubules during mitosis and maintaining mitochondrial DNA transcription further underscores its importance in cellular processes. Its depletion has been shown to impair mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that alterations in KANSL3 expression or function could contribute to mitochondrial-related disorders (Sheikh2019The).

## Interactions
KANSL3 is a component of the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation and cellular homeostasis. Within this complex, KANSL3 interacts with several proteins, including KANSL1, KANSL2, KAT8, MCRS1, PHF20, HCFC1, and WDR5, forming a multiprotein assembly essential for histone acetylation and transcription initiation (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent; Sheikh2019The). KANSL3 is also involved in microtubule dynamics during mitosis, where it interacts with spindle assembly factors such as TPX2 in a RanGTP-dependent manner, stabilizing microtubule minus ends and promoting spindle assembly (Meunier2015An).

KANSL3 has been shown to interact with nuclear pore components like NUP98 and NUP153, as well as members of the NURF complex, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Sheikh2019The). Additionally, KANSL3 is implicated in mitochondrial functions, where it localizes to the D-loop of mitochondrial DNA, suggesting a role in mitochondrial genome transcription (Sheikh2019The). These interactions highlight KANSL3's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including chromatin modification, transcription regulation, and mitotic progression.
