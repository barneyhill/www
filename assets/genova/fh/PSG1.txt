# PSG1

## Overview
Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) is a gene that encodes the protein pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is predominantly expressed in the placenta and plays a crucial role in modulating the immune environment during pregnancy, thereby promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. PSG1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several immunoglobulin-like domains and extensive glycosylation, contributing to its functional interactions with other proteins. It is involved in key physiological processes such as the activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), endothelial tubulogenesis, and immune modulation. These functions are essential for successful pregnancy outcomes, as they support angiogenesis and immune tolerance. Additionally, PSG1 has been implicated in clinical conditions, including cancer and pregnancy-related disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Ballesteros2015Induction; Lisboa2011Pregnancyspecific; Mendoza2020Glycan).

## Structure
Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, primarily expressed in the placenta. The protein structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide followed by several immunoglobulin-like domains. PSG1 consists of one Ig variable region-like N-terminal domain and three Ig constant region-like domains, named A1, A2, and B2 (Ballesteros2015Induction). The N-terminal domain is characterized by a four-amino acid sequence (LYHY) within the CC loop, crucial for inducing TGF-β1 secretion in macrophages (Ballesteros2015Induction). The B2 domain is responsible for activating latent TGF-β1 by binding to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) (Ballesteros2015Induction).

PSG1 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. It has seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites, with confirmed sites at Asn61, Asn199, Asn268, and Asn303, which carry complex N-glycans (Mendoza2020Glycan). These glycans are predominantly sialylated with α2,3 linkages and include core fucosylation (Mendoza2020Glycan). The glycan structures contribute to PSG1's interaction with galectin-1, a carbohydrate-dependent binding (Mendoza2020Glycan). PSG1 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its domain organization and function (Moore2014Pregnancyspecific).

## Function
Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) is a key player in modulating the immune environment during pregnancy, promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. It is primarily secreted by placental cells and is abundant in the maternal bloodstream during late pregnancy (Ballesteros2015Induction; Lisboa2011Pregnancyspecific). PSG1 is involved in several molecular processes, including the activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), which is crucial for immune regulation, angiogenesis, and embryogenesis. This activation is mediated through PSG1's B2 domain, which binds to the latency-associated peptide of TGF-β1 (Ballesteros2015Induction).

PSG1 also plays a significant role in endothelial tubulogenesis by interacting with cell surface proteoglycans, such as syndecans and glypican-1, to promote tube formation by endothelial cells. This interaction is essential for angiogenesis, contributing to the development of placental vasculature (Lisboa2011Pregnancyspecific). Additionally, PSG1 modulates immune responses by inducing alternative activation in monocytes and suppressing T cell proliferation, which supports immune tolerance during pregnancy (Motrán2002Human). These functions highlight PSG1's critical role in ensuring successful pregnancy outcomes by maintaining a balanced immune environment.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSG1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and pregnancy-related disorders. In breast cancer, PSG1 is implicated in mediating chemoresistance, especially in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells. High levels of PSG1 expression are linked to resistance against chemotherapeutic agents such as adriamycin and paclitaxel. Targeting PSG1 with dicumarol has been shown to reduce chemoresistance, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapy efficacy (He2016Targeting).

In pregnancy, PSG1 expression is crucial for normal placental function, and its dysregulation is associated with adverse outcomes. Low levels of PSG1 in maternal serum have been correlated with complications such as preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and potential damage to organ systems during pregnancy (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). PSG1 is also involved in the activation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), which plays a role in immune regulation and fetal tolerance. Alterations in PSG1's interaction with TGF-β1 could impact immune responses during pregnancy, potentially leading to conditions like preterm delivery and low birth weight (Ballesteros2015Induction).

## Interactions
Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing significant roles in pregnancy-related processes. PSG1 interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which is essential for its pro-angiogenic activity, as it induces endothelial tube formation (Lisboa2011Pregnancyspecific). It also binds to integrin αIIbβ3, inhibiting fibrinogen binding to platelets, and interacts with integrin α5β1, which is crucial for the adhesion and migration of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) (Rattila2019Interaction). This interaction enhances EVT migration, which is vital for placental development (Rattila2019Interaction).

PSG1 is a novel ligand for galectin-1 (Gal-1), a protein involved in angiogenesis and immune homeostasis during pregnancy. This interaction is mediated by glycans in PSG1, contributing to the stabilization of Gal-1 in the placental extracellular space (Mendoza2020Glycan). PSG1 also binds to the latency-associated peptide of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), activating TGF-β1 and modulating its activity, which is important for immune regulation (Blois2014Pregnancyspecific; Warren2018Activation). These interactions highlight PSG1's multifaceted role in supporting pregnancy through modulation of cellular adhesion, angiogenesis, and immune responses.
