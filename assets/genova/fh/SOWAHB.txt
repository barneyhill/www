# SOWAHB

## Overview
SOWAHB is a gene that encodes the protein sosondowah ankyrin repeat domain family member B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. These domains suggest that the protein may play a role in cellular signaling pathways or structural organization within the cell. While the specific functions of SOWAHB and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, research indicates potential involvement in regulatory mechanisms that could have implications for understanding certain diseases or conditions. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise biological roles and interactions of this protein.
