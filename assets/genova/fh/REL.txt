# REL

## Overview
The REL gene encodes a protein that is a member of the NF-kB family of transcription factors, specifically known as the REL proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, cell proliferation, and survival. As a transcription factor, REL is involved in the modulation of gene expression by forming dimers with other NF-kB subunits, such as p50 and p65, to bind specific DNA sequences. The REL protein is characterized by a Rel homology domain (RHD), which is essential for its DNA-binding and dimerization capabilities. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of the REL gene has been implicated in various diseases, including lymphomas and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (EncisoMora2010A; Dolcet2005NFkB; Hoesel2013The).

## Structure
The REL proto-oncogene encodes a protein that is part of the NF-kB family of transcription factors, characterized by the presence of a Rel homology domain (RHD). This domain is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, shared among related proteins such as the Drosophila morphogen dorsal and the avian oncogene v-rel (Ghosh1990Cloning; Rushlow1992The). The RHD spans approximately 300 amino acids and is located in the N-terminal region of the protein (Rushlow1992The).

The REL protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and subcellular localization (Kieran1990The). The protein's structure includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site, both conserved across the rel family, indicating their importance in nuclear transport and regulatory functions (Kieran1990The).

The C-terminal region of REL proteins shows little sequence homology with other NF-kB subunits but may contain transcriptional activation domains characterized by proline-rich regions and glutamine repeats (Rushlow1992The). The REL protein can form heterodimers with other NF-kB family members, such as the p50 subunit, to modulate gene expression (Kieran1990The).

## Function
The REL proto-oncogene encodes a subunit of the NF-kB transcription factor complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, cell proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, REL is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This binding is facilitated by the Rel homology domain (RHD), which is essential for dimerization and DNA interaction (Hoesel2013The).

REL is involved in the regulation of genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses. It is part of the NF-kB family, which includes other subunits like p65 (RelA), RelB, NF-kB1, and NF-kB2. These proteins can form homo- or heterodimers, allowing for diverse regulatory functions (Dolcet2005NFkB). In quiescent cells, NF-kB dimers, including those containing REL, are bound to inhibitory IκB proteins in the cytoplasm, rendering them inactive. Upon activation, these dimers translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Hoesel2013The).

REL is particularly important in lymphocyte activation and cytokine production, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is crucial for T cell proliferation and immune response regulation (Köntgen1995Mice). Its activity is tightly regulated to ensure proper immune function and prevent aberrant cell proliferation (Dolcet2005NFkB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the REL gene, which encodes a subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor complex, are implicated in various diseases, particularly lymphomas and autoimmune disorders. In Hodgkin's lymphoma, genomic amplifications of REL are associated with increased c-Rel expression, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis through enhanced NF-κB signaling (EncisoMora2010A). REL gene rearrangements and point mutations have been identified in B cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where these alterations lead to increased nuclear κB site DNA-binding activity and overexpression of REL target genes, promoting cell proliferation and survival (Gilmore2011The).

In autoimmune diseases, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the REL locus have been linked to increased susceptibility to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, and psoriasis. These SNPs may affect REL transcription or mRNA maturation, potentially altering REL protein expression and contributing to disease susceptibility (Gilmore2011The). The REL gene is also identified as a risk locus for rheumatoid arthritis, with specific SNPs showing significant associations with the disease, suggesting that alterations in REL interactions contribute to its pathogenesis (Gregersen2009REL). These findings underscore the clinical significance of REL in both cancer and autoimmune disease contexts.

## Interactions
The REL proto-oncogene encodes a subunit of the NF-kB transcription factor complex, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in gene regulation. REL is homologous to the v-rel oncogene and shares similarities with the Drosophila gene dorsal, indicating a conserved function in nuclear-cytosolic translocation and transcriptional regulation (Ghosh1990Cloning; Kieran1990The).

REL interacts with other NF-kB subunits, such as p50 and p65, to form active transcription factor complexes. These interactions are facilitated by the rel-homologous regions, which act as dimerization motifs, allowing REL to form heterodimers with these subunits (Ghosh1990Cloning). The DNA-binding activity of these complexes can be inhibited by IKB proteins, which interact with the NF-kB complex to regulate its activity by sequestering it in the cytoplasm (Nolan1991DNA; Beg1993The).

IKB proteins, including IKB-α and IKB-β, preferentially bind to the p65 subunit but can also inhibit the DNA binding of c-Rel, a protein closely related to REL. This inhibition is crucial for controlling the DNA-binding activity of NF-kB and its subunits (Grimm1993The). The interactions between REL and IKB proteins are essential for the regulation of NF-kB's nuclear translocation and its role in gene transcription (Beg1993The).
