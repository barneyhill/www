# FOLR1

## Overview
FOLR1 is a gene that encodes the folate receptor alpha, a high-affinity receptor protein primarily involved in the transport and cellular uptake of folate, particularly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF), which is crucial for numerous cellular processes such as DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation. This receptor is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, playing a vital role in the assimilation and distribution of folates, especially in the choroid epithelium, where it facilitates the transfer of folate into the cerebrospinal fluid, essential for normal brain development and function (Opladen2010Effect; Chen2013Structural). Beyond its canonical role in folate transport, FOLR1 is also implicated in neural tube formation, where it regulates cell-cell adhesion and cadherin turnover, influencing neural plate folding and morphogenesis (Balashova2024Noncanonical).

## Function
The FOLR1 gene encodes the folate receptor alpha, a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport and cellular uptake of folate, particularly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF), the predominant form of folate in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (Opladen2010Effect). FOLR1 is a high-affinity receptor that facilitates the endocytosis of folate into cells, which is essential for various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation (Chen2013Structural). This receptor is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in the assimilation, distribution, and retention of folates, particularly in the choroid epithelium, where it aids in transferring folate into the cerebrospinal fluid, crucial for normal brain development and function (Opladen2010Effect).

In addition to its role in folate transport, FOLR1 has a noncanonical function in neural tube formation. It is involved in regulating cell-cell adhesion and the turnover of cadherin, a key molecule in adherens junctions, which is essential for the apical constriction and folding of the neural plate (Balashova2024Noncanonical). FOLR1 also modulates calcium dynamics during neural plate folding, influencing the degradation of adherens junction components necessary for neural tube formation (Balashova2024Noncanonical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOLR1 gene, which encodes the folate receptor alpha, are associated with cerebral folate transporter deficiency syndrome. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a deficiency in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) in the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to a range of neurological symptoms. These include developmental regression, epilepsy, ataxia, and leukodystrophy, often manifesting in late infancy (Brunetti2021Cerebral; Kobayashi2017Severe; Grapp2012Molecular). 

The condition results from a brain-specific folate transport defect due to mutations in FOLR1, which impair the transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier. This leads to impaired myelin formation and neurodegeneration (Potic2023Hypomyelination). MRI findings in affected individuals often show hypomyelination and cerebellar atrophy (Potic2023Hypomyelination; Wang2024Case). 

Treatment with folinic acid can stabilize or improve symptoms, particularly if initiated early. However, the response to treatment can vary, and delayed diagnosis often results in incomplete recovery (Potic2023Hypomyelination; Zhang2020First). The phenotypic variability among patients with the same FOLR1 mutation suggests that additional factors may influence the clinical presentation (Potic2023Hypomyelination).

## Interactions
FOLR1, or folate receptor alpha, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function beyond folate transport. FOLR1 interacts with CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), an adaptor protein that connects membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and promotes ubiquitination and endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases. This interaction is significant in neural tube formation, where FOLR1 and CD2AP have opposing roles in neural plate cell apical endocytosis and adherens junction turnover. FOLR1 downregulation increases CD2AP protein levels, suggesting that FOLR1 may target CD2AP for degradation, while CD2AP knockdown upregulates FOLR1 protein levels, indicating a reciprocal regulatory mechanism (Balashova2024Noncanonical).

FOLR1 also interacts with C-cadherin and β-catenin, proteins involved in cell adherens junctions. It regulates the intracellular turnover of C-cadherin, which is crucial for neural plate folding. FOLR1 depletion leads to increased endocytosis and degradation of C-cadherin, affecting neural tube formation (Balashova2024Noncanonical). These interactions highlight FOLR1's role in cell-cell adhesion and neural tube morphogenesis, independent of its role in folate metabolism (Balashova2024Noncanonical).
