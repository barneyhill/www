# PTH

## Overview
The PTH gene encodes the parathyroid hormone, a critical peptide hormone involved in the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the human body. This gene is located on chromosome 11 and is primarily expressed in the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid hormone, a product of the PTH gene, is a peptide hormone composed of 84 amino acids and functions as a key regulator of calcium levels by acting on bones, kidneys, and the intestines. It is classified as a peptide hormone due to its structure and mode of action. The hormone's biological activity is primarily mediated through its interaction with the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTHR1), which triggers various intracellular signaling pathways essential for bone remodeling and calcium reabsorption (Gensure2005Parathyroid; GaffneyStomberg2017Parathyroid). Mutations in the PTH gene can lead to disorders such as hypoparathyroidism, underscoring its importance in endocrine function and mineral metabolism (Gordon2018Genetic).

## Structure
The parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a peptide hormone composed of 84 amino acids, with an amino-terminal alanine and a carboxyl-terminal glutamine (Brewer1970Bovine). The primary structure of PTH is crucial for its biological activity, particularly the N-terminal 34 amino acids, which are sufficient for receptor activation (Gensure2005Parathyroid). The secondary structure of PTH includes alpha-helical regions, as indicated by NMR studies, which show an alpha-helical structure in both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, with a flexible hinge between residues 16 and 20 (Gensure2005Parathyroid). X-ray crystallography also supports an alpha-helical structure throughout the molecule, with only a slight bend (Gensure2005Parathyroid).

PTH functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure. The hormone is synthesized as a pre-pro-hormone, with the initial 25 residues forming a hydrophobic domain crucial for membrane passage (Gensure2005Parathyroid). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect its activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The PTH gene structure includes three exons, with exon III coding for the mature hormone (NavehMany2020Parathyroid).

## Function
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a peptide hormone crucial for maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. It is synthesized by the parathyroid glands and acts primarily on bones, kidneys, and the intestines. In bone tissue, PTH increases bone turnover by signaling in osteoblasts and osteocytes, which involves both bone resorption and formation. This dual action is mediated through the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTHR1), which activates several signaling pathways, including Gsα/PKA, Gq/PLC/PKC, and MAPK (GaffneyStomberg2017Parathyroid; Bergwitz2010Regulation).

In the kidneys, PTH enhances calcium reabsorption and decreases phosphate reabsorption, while also activating vitamin D to its active form, 1,25(OH)2D3, which facilitates calcium absorption in the intestines (GaffneyStomberg2017Parathyroid). PTH's actions on bone are complex; continuous exposure leads to bone resorption, whereas intermittent exposure promotes bone formation, making it a key factor in bone remodeling and health (Silva2015Parathyroid).

PTH also influences the expression of proteins involved in bone metabolism, such as sclerostin and Dickkopf1, which are part of the Wnt signaling pathway crucial for bone formation (Silva2015Parathyroid). These molecular processes ensure that calcium levels remain within a narrow range, vital for various physiological processes (GaffneyStomberg2017Parathyroid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTH gene, which encodes the parathyroid hormone, can lead to various parathyroid disorders. Isolated hypoparathyroidism is one such condition, resulting from mutations that impair the synthesis and secretion of PTH. These mutations can be autosomal dominant or recessive. In autosomal dominant cases, mutations like p.C18R and p.M14K affect the hydrophobic core of the leader sequence, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis of parathyroid cells (Arnold1990Mutation; Gordon2018Genetic). Autosomal recessive mutations, such as p.S23P and p.S23X, result in a non-secreted PTH molecule (Gordon2018Genetic).

Other conditions associated with PTH gene mutations include familial isolated hypoparathyroidism (FIH), where mutations like the C18R cause ER stress and apoptosis, leading to impaired hormone secretion (Lee2020RarePTHGene; Datta2007Signal). Additionally, mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor can lead to disorders such as Blomstrand's lethal chondrodysplasia and Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, which are characterized by skeletal abnormalities and altered calcium metabolism (Gensure2005Parathyroid). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of the PTH gene in maintaining calcium homeostasis and bone health.

## Interactions
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in its regulation and function. PTH mRNA is subject to translational regulation through specific RNA-protein interactions. Proteins in the parathyroid cytosol bind to the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of PTH mRNA, influencing its translation. Proteins with molecular masses of approximately 68 and 66 kDa bind specifically to the 5'-UTR, while proteins of 70 and 48 kDa bind to the 3'-UTR. These interactions are specific to parathyroid cells and are not observed in other tissues like the kidney, liver, or muscle (Vadher1996Translational).

The 3'-UTR of PTH mRNA is particularly important for the inhibition of translation by cytosolic factors, as demonstrated by experiments using chimeric RNAs (Vadher1996Translational). Additionally, the K-homology splicing regulator protein (KSRP) binds to PTH mRNA, promoting its decay, while AUF1 stabilizes PTH mRNA by blocking KSRP binding. This balance between KSRP and AUF1 is crucial for determining PTH mRNA levels in response to physiological stimuli (NavehMany2020Parathyroid). These interactions highlight the complexity of PTH regulation at the translational level, involving specific protein interactions that modulate its expression.
