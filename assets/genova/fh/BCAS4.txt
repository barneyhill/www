# BCAS4

## Overview
BCAS4, or breast carcinoma amplified sequence 4, is a gene located on chromosome 20q13.2 that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including its role as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in Alzheimer's disease pathology. The BCAS4 protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with microRNAs, particularly in the context of neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease (Sabaie2022Identification). In addition to its neurological implications, BCAS4 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer, suggesting its involvement in oncogenic processes. The gene is known to form a fusion transcript with BCAS3, which has been identified in specific breast cancer cell lines, indicating a potential role in cancer development (Løvf2011Fusion; Bärlund2002Cloning). The spatial arrangement of BCAS4 with other BCAS genes may contribute to its susceptibility to oncogenic translocations, further linking it to cancer progression (Zeitz2013Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
BCAS4 is implicated in breast cancer through its frequent amplification and overexpression. Located on chromosome 20q13.2, BCAS4 is often amplified in breast cancer cell lines, with significant overexpression observed in nine out of thirteen studied lines. Notably, the MDA-157 cell line shows a 15-fold increase in BCAS4 expression compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells (Bärlund2002Cloning). In the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, BCAS4 is highly amplified, with 40 signals per cell, indicating a strong association with breast cancer pathogenesis (Bärlund2002Cloning).

BCAS4 is also involved in a specific fusion transcript with BCAS3, known as the BCAS4-BCAS3 fusion, identified in the MCF7 cell line. This fusion results from the combination of sequences from BCAS4 and the last two exons of BCAS3, producing a 66 amino acid protein. This fusion is unique to the MCF7 cell line and suggests a potential role in the development of breast cancer (Løvf2011Fusion; Bärlund2002Cloning).

The spatial proximity of BCAS4 to other BCAS genes in normal breast cells may predispose these regions to oncogenic translocations, contributing to cancer progression (Zeitz2013Genomic).

## Interactions
BCAS4 is involved in a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network that plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It acts as a ceRNA to regulate the expression of the SHISA7 gene by sponging the microRNA hsa-miR-185-5p. This interaction is significant in the context of AD-associated neurofibrillary pathology, particularly in the temporal cortex tissue specimens. The expression of BCAS4 is positively correlated with SHISA7 expression, supporting the ceRNA theory that suggests ceRNAs regulate each other through miRNA interactions (Sabaie2022Identification).

In AD patients, BCAS4 expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in certain Braak stages, which are used to measure the extent of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Despite this downregulation in brain tissues, BCAS4 expression levels in peripheral blood samples from AD patients do not significantly differ from controls, indicating its potential as an inflammatory biomarker rather than a direct marker of AD pathology (Sabaie2022Identification).

The BCAS4/hsa-miR-185-5p/SHISA7 axis is highlighted as a potential biomarker for AD, suggesting that BCAS4 could be a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating this ceRNA network (Sabaie2022Identification).
