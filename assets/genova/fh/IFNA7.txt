# IFNA7

## Overview
The IFNA7 gene encodes the protein interferon alpha 7, a member of the type I interferon family, which is primarily involved in antiviral defense and immune response modulation. As a cytokine, interferon alpha 7 plays a crucial role in the activation of immune cells and the regulation of antigen presentation, contributing to the organism's defense mechanisms against viral infections. The protein is characterized by a monomeric structure with a cylindrical arrangement of five alpha-helices, stabilized by disulfide bridges and hydrogen bonds, which facilitate its interaction with the heterodimeric receptor composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits (Wittling2021Shared). While IFNA7 shares functional similarities with other type I interferons, it exhibits relaxed selective constraints, suggesting potential redundancy or ongoing pseudogenization (Manry2011Evolutionary). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease contexts (Bianchi2020Wholegenome; Lu2014Single).

## Structure
The IFNA7 protein is a member of the type I interferon family, characterized by its monomeric cytokine structure with antiviral activity and immune response modulation. The mature IFNA7 protein is composed of 166 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 20 kD (Wittling2021Shared). The three-dimensional structure of IFNA7, like other type I interferons, is cylindrical and consists of five alpha-helices labeled A-E, which are parallel to the long axis of the cylinder. These helices are connected by loops, with the AB loop being notably long and containing three short 3_10 helices (Wittling2021Shared).

The tertiary structure of IFNA7 is stabilized by conserved disulfide bridges and a network of hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity. The protein signals through a heterodimeric receptor composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits, with specific binding sites located in the helices and loops of the protein structure (Wittling2021Shared). Despite the lack of detailed information on the quaternary structure, the protein's ability to form a ternary complex for signaling suggests a functional assembly with other molecular components. The structural features of IFNA7 are consistent with its role in the canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways of type I interferons.

## Function
IFNA7, a member of the type I interferon family, plays a role in the immune response to viral infections. It is involved in the activation of immune cells and the upregulation of antigen presentation. The protein encoded by IFNA7 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it initiates signaling pathways that lead to the expression of antiviral and immunomodulatory genes, contributing to the organism's defense mechanisms (Lin2000Selective).

The activation of IFNA7 is specifically regulated by interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), which binds to the promoter regions of IFNA7 and other related genes. This binding is crucial for the transcriptional induction of IFNA7 following viral infection, through a mechanism involving phosphorylation and interaction with other transcription factors and coactivators (Lin2000Selective). The expression of IFNA7 is part of a coordinated response to viral infection, with its activation being a delayed-type response dependent on new protein synthesis (Lin2000Selective).

In terms of evolutionary biology, IFNA7 shows relaxed selective constraints compared to other type I interferons, suggesting it may have a less critical role or be undergoing pseudogenization (Manry2011Evolutionary). This indicates that while IFNA7 contributes to immune responses, its function may be more redundant compared to other interferons.

## Clinical Significance
The IFNA7 gene, part of the type I interferon family, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In dogs, a deletion involving the IFNA7 gene has been associated with a protective effect against hypothyroidism. This deletion overlaps with the promoter, 5′ UTR, and first protein coding codons of the IFNA7 gene, creating a fusion gene with another unannotated IFNA gene. The study suggests that this deletion may alter the expression of IFNA genes, potentially providing protection against hypothyroidism in dogs, although the exact functional impact remains unclear (Bianchi2020Wholegenome).

In humans, type I interferons, including those encoded by IFNA7, have been linked to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune hypothyroidism. The role of IFNA7 in these conditions is thought to be related to its involvement in immune responses, where alterations in its expression could contribute to disease pathogenesis (Bianchi2020Wholegenome).

Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near IFNA7 have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility and survival, suggesting that genetic variations in IFNA7 may influence cancer progression and patient outcomes (Lu2014Single).
