# SPDYE17

## Overview
SPDYE17 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E17, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family of proteins. These proteins are recognized for their role as atypical cyclins that activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. The SPDYE17 gene is considered a pseudogene of SPDYE3, and its expression is correlated with other members of the Speedy family, indicating its involvement in co-expression gene networks (Wang2018Extensive). While the specific functions of SPDYE17 in normal human cells remain to be fully elucidated, the Speedy family is known to be involved in reproduction and cancer, with some members serving as potential biomarkers for various cancer types (Wang2018Extensive). The protein encoded by SPDYE17 is typically localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with CDKs to facilitate proper cell division and growth, and to mediate cellular responses to DNA damage.

## Function
SPDYE17 is a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, which functions as an atypical cyclin involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). These proteins are crucial for cell cycle progression, particularly in the transitions from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase. SPDYE17, as a pseudogene of SPDYE3, displays expression correlation with other Speedy family genes, suggesting a potential role in co-expression gene networks (Wang2018Extensive). 

The Speedy family, including SPDYE17, is implicated in reproduction-related functions and cancer, with some members being differentially expressed in various cancer types and associated with patient survival (Wang2018Extensive). Although SPDYE17's specific function in healthy human cells is not highlighted, the overall analysis of Speedy family genes suggests they may serve as biomarkers for different cancer types and have roles in reproduction and cancer (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE17 is typically active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with CDKs to ensure proper cell division and growth, influencing cellular responses to DNA damage. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal cell proliferation and function.
