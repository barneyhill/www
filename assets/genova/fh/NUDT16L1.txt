# NUDT16L1

## Overview
NUDT16L1 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 16 like 1, also known as TIRR. This protein is categorized as a nudix hydrolase, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of DNA damage response. TIRR interacts with the 53BP1 protein, a key player in DNA repair, by forming a complex that inhibits 53BP1's binding to methylated lysines, thereby modulating its role in DNA double-strand break repair (Wang2018Molecular; Dai2018Structural). Additionally, NUDT16L1 has been identified as an RNA-binding protein, suggesting its involvement in RNA interactions and indicating a broader regulatory function in cellular processes (Siprashvili2012Identification). The gene's multifaceted roles in both protein and nucleic acid interactions underscore its significance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
NUDT16L1, also known as TIRR, interacts with the 53BP1 protein, playing a crucial role in DNA damage response regulation. TIRR forms a complex with the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain (TTD), inhibiting 53BP1's ability to bind to methylated lysines, such as histone H4K20me2, by masking its methyl-lysine binding pocket. This interaction prevents 53BP1 from relocating to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and participating in DNA repair processes (Wang2018Molecular; Dai2018Structural). 

The binding affinity between TIRR and 53BP1 is strong, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 0.78 Î¼M, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays (Wang2018Molecular). Specific mutations in TIRR, such as H106W, significantly enhance its binding to 53BP1, highlighting the importance of certain residues in this interaction (Dai2018Structural). 

NUDT16L1 also exhibits significant RNA-protein binding activity, despite lacking well-characterized RNA interaction domains. It was identified as a common RNA-binding protein in a study using protein microarrays, suggesting a potential role in RNA interactions (Siprashvili2012Identification). These interactions indicate that NUDT16L1 is involved in both protein and nucleic acid interactions, contributing to its regulatory functions in cellular processes.
