# CYP27C1

## Overview
CYP27C1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily C member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is categorized as a retinoid 3,4-desaturase and is primarily expressed in the skin, where it plays a crucial role in retinoid metabolism by converting all-trans-retinol to 3,4-dehydroretinol (Johnson2017Human). The enzyme's activity is dependent on electron transfer from adrenodoxin and is facilitated by interactions with cellular retinoid-binding proteins, such as CRBP-1 and CRABP-2, which assist in substrate transfer (Glass2021Cellular). While CYP27C1 has been implicated in certain clinical conditions, including Parkinson's Disease and avascular necrosis of the femoral head, its precise biological functions and clinical significance remain areas of active research (Nebert2013Human; Hartz2023A).

## Function
The human gene CYP27C1 encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 27C1, which is primarily localized in the skin and functions as a retinoid 3,4-desaturase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of all-trans-retinol to 3,4-dehydroretinol, a process that is significant for retinoid metabolism in the skin (Johnson2017Human). CYP27C1 also catalyzes minor reactions, such as the formation of 3- and 4-hydroxyretinol, although these are not intermediates in the primary desaturation pathway (Johnson2017Human).

The enzyme's activity is dependent on electron delivery from adrenodoxin (Adx), and the presence of substrate enhances the rate of reduction by Adx (Johnson2017Human). CYP27C1 interacts with cellular retinoid-binding proteins, such as CRBP-1 and CRABP-2, which facilitate the transfer of retinoid substrates to the enzyme for metabolism (Glass2021Cellular). The enzyme's function in healthy cells is related to the metabolism of retinoids, which are crucial for skin health and potentially other physiological processes (Johnson2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP27C1 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease (PD), particularly in genetic PD (GPD) patients. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP27C1 have shown moderate associations with PD, with odds ratios (OR) between two and five, indicating a potential risk factor. Conversely, one SNP in CYP27C1 was identified with an OR less than 0.2, suggesting a protective effect against PD (Hartz2023A). Despite these associations, the role of CYP27C1 in PD is considered moderate compared to other genes involved in the disease.

CYP27C1 is also categorized as an 'orphan' cytochrome P450, with its precise biological function not fully established. It has been identified as one of the most statistically significant, highly expressed genes in patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head, although no direct disease associations have been confirmed (Nebert2013Human).

The gene is involved in the conversion of vitamin A1 to vitamin A2, and its expression in various tissues suggests it may mediate a switch between vitamin A and D substrate specificity. However, the clinical significance of this function remains unclear (Annalora2017Alternative). Overall, while CYP27C1 is linked to certain conditions, its clinical significance requires further investigation.

## Interactions
CYP27C1 interacts with several proteins involved in retinoid metabolism and electron transfer. It forms a tight complex with all-trans-retinol, as indicated by a shift in the heme Soret peak, with a dissociation constant (K_d) of approximately 5.6 nM. The binding kinetics reveal a second-order binding reaction with a k_on value of 1.9 × 10^5 M^-1 s^-1 (Johnson2017Human). CYP27C1 also interacts with adrenodoxin (Adx) and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) for electron delivery, although no spectral perturbation was observed upon Adx addition. The presence of the substrate retinol enhances the rate of reduction by Adx, suggesting a role in electron transfer (Johnson2017Human).

CYP27C1 interacts with cellular retinoid-binding proteins, specifically holo-CRBP-1 and holo-CRABP-2, which channel retinoid ligands to CYP27C1. The rate of the desaturation reaction by CYP27C1 is limited by the rate of retinoid transfer from these binding proteins. Increased concentrations of apo-CRBPs typically inhibit CYP27C1 desaturation (Glass2021Cellular). The interaction between CYP27C1 and CRABPs is described as transient, and attempts to detect physical binding through cross-linking and other methods were unsuccessful (Glass2021Cellular). These interactions support CYP27C1's role as an in vivo retinoid desaturase (Glass2021Cellular).
