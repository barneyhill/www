# ICA1L

## Overview
The ICA1L gene encodes the islet cell autoantigen 1 like protein, which is primarily involved in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and myelination. This protein is active within the Golgi apparatus and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is particularly enriched in cortical glutamatergic excitatory neurons, contributing to neural development and neuropathology (Almorox2024Gene; Chaar2024Multiancestry). ICA1L is abundantly expressed in the brain and testes, where it is involved in the formation of the acrosome, nucleus, and mitochondrial sheath, as well as in spermatid development (Gu2023Identifying). The protein's interactions, including its binding with SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp16 and PICK1, underscore its significance in both viral inhibition and cellular structural dynamics (Mihalič2023Identification; Suurmeijer2019Novel). These multifaceted roles highlight ICA1L's potential importance in various biological processes and disease contexts.

## Structure


## Function
The ICA1L gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and is active in the Golgi apparatus, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Almorox2024Gene). ICA1L is crucial for myelination and is activated by type IV collagen, which is important for neural development and neuropathology. It is enriched in cortical glutamatergic excitatory neurons, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, neural network formation, and cell death (Chaar2024Multiancestry; Zhang2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, ICA1L is abundantly expressed in the brain and testes, where it plays a role in the formation of the acrosome, nucleus, and mitochondrial sheath (Gu2023Identifying). It is also involved in spermatid development and is located in acrosomal vesicles (Almorox2024Gene). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and its involvement in the secretory pathway suggest its role in processes affecting insulin secretion and pancreatic function. ICA1L's molecular activities include protein domain-specific binding, which is crucial for its regulatory functions in transport and cellular signaling (Almorox2024Gene).

## Interactions
The ICA1L protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cellular processes and disease mechanisms. One notable interaction is with the SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp16. The ICA1L peptide, specifically residues 450-465, binds to Nsp16 with a dissociation constant (K_D) of 30 μM. This interaction is characterized by a hydrophobic motif (WxxxF) within the peptide, which is crucial for binding. The ICA1L peptide competes with Nsp10 for binding to Nsp16, potentially acting as an inhibitor of the Nsp10-Nsp16 interaction, which is essential for viral replication (Mihalič2023Identification).

In the context of cellular functions, ICA1L interacts with PICK1, a protein involved in the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and membranes. This interaction is significant in processes such as organelle trafficking, particularly in spermatids where ICA1L and PICK1 are localized, playing a role in vesicle trafficking from the Golgi region and acrosome formation in mature spermatozoa (Suurmeijer2019Novel).

These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ICA1L in both viral inhibition and cellular structural dynamics, underscoring its potential importance in various biological processes and disease contexts.
