# CD1A

## Overview
The CD1A gene encodes the CD1a protein, a member of the CD1 family of glycosylated cell surface receptors involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells. This protein is structurally similar to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and forms a stable heterodimer with β2-microglobulin, which is essential for its function. CD1a is primarily expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and Langerhans cells, where it plays a critical role in immune surveillance and response by facilitating the recognition and presentation of lipid antigens to T cells. The CD1a protein is involved in various immune processes, including the activation of T cells and the production of cytokines, which are crucial for skin immunity and homeostasis. Alterations in the CD1A gene have been implicated in several inflammatory skin diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (de2010CD1aautoreactive; Cohen2009Chapter; Hardman2022CD1a).

## Structure
The CD1A protein is a member of the CD1 family, which are glycosylated cell surface receptors involved in presenting lipid antigens to T cells. Structurally, CD1A is similar to MHC class I molecules, consisting of a heavy chain that forms a stable heterodimer with β2-microglobulin (Zajonc2024Architecture). The primary structure of CD1A includes a polypeptide chain with α1, α2, and α3 domains, and a transmembrane region. The secondary structure features two anti-parallel α-helices (α1, α2) sitting on a six-stranded β-sheet platform, forming a deep and narrow antigen-binding groove (Zajonc2024Architecture).

The tertiary structure of CD1A involves the folding of these domains to create a unique binding groove composed of two main pockets, A and F. The A pocket is characterized by a large roof formed by a hydrogen bond between Arg73 and Thr158, creating a long tube with a single entrance through the F pocket (Zajonc2024Architecture). The quaternary structure is defined by the association with β2-microglobulin, which is essential for the stability of the CD1A molecule (Zajonc2024Architecture).

CD1A is glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification that contributes to its molecular weight of approximately 49 kDa (Zajonc2024Architecture). This glycosylation is crucial for its function in antigen presentation.

## Function
The CD1A gene encodes the CD1a protein, which is involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells, playing a crucial role in the immune response. CD1a is primarily expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells, where it facilitates the recognition and presentation of lipid antigens to T cells, particularly CD1a-autoreactive T cells (de2010CD1aautoreactive; Cohen2009Chapter). This interaction is essential for the activation of T cells and the subsequent immune response, including the production of cytokines like IL-22, which is important for skin immunity and homeostasis (de2010CD1aautoreactive).

CD1a expression is associated with the production of IL-12 by DCs, which is crucial for Th1 T cell polarization and immune responses against pathogens (Cernadas2008CD1a; Cohen2009Chapter). In the skin, CD1a is highly expressed on Langerhans cells, contributing to the formation of a network of CD1a-containing membranes that facilitate immune surveillance and responses (de2010CD1aautoreactive). CD1a can bind a wide variety of lipid ligands, including sphingolipids and phospholipids, allowing it to present a diverse range of antigens to T cells (de2013CD1aautoreactive).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CD1A gene, which encodes the CD1a molecule, are implicated in various inflammatory skin diseases. CD1a-restricted T cells play a significant role in conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In atopic dermatitis, CD1a-reactive T cells are activated by neolipid antigens generated by PLA2 enzymes, with sources including house dust mites and endogenous cytoplasmic PLA2G4D. Mutations in the filaggrin gene, associated with atopic dermatitis, can impair the skin barrier and influence PLA2 activity, affecting CD1a function (de2021CD1a).

In psoriasis, CD1a is involved in presenting lipid antigens to T cells, facilitating responses that produce cytokines like IL-17, which are implicated in the disease. Blocking CD1a with antibodies has been shown to reduce skin inflammation in both mouse models and human patients, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Kim2016CD1a). CD1a is also linked to systemic manifestations of skin inflammation, contributing to conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, with CD1a-reactive T cells present in non-cutaneous sites like the gut and lungs (Hardman2022CD1a).

CD1a expression is also associated with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, where CD1a+ myeloid lineage cells interact with T cells, potentially influencing disease pathogenesis (Mitchell2021Does).

## Interactions
CD1A interacts with various T cell receptors (TCRs) and antibodies, playing a crucial role in immune response modulation. The CD1a protein forms complexes with β2-microglobulin (β2m), which is essential for its structural stability and function in antigen presentation. The interaction between CD1a and the CO3 γδ TCR is characterized by a unique 'sideways' binding mode, involving substantial contact with β2m and the α1 domain of CD1a, rather than the α3 domain. This interaction is lipid-independent and involves specific contact residues, including aromatic residues in the α1 domain that engage in pi-stacking interactions with the TCR (Wegrecki2022Atypical).

CD1a also interacts with αβ TCRs, such as the BK6 TCR, which recognizes CD1a presenting self-lipid ligands. The BK6 TCR docks orthogonally across the CD1a antigen-binding cleft, primarily interacting with the CD1a protein itself rather than the antigen. This interaction involves the TCR α and β chains contacting the α2 and α1 helices of CD1a, respectively, over the A'-roof of CD1a (Birkinshaw2015αβ).

Additionally, CD1a interacts with various anti-CD1a antibodies, such as OX16, OX77a, OX110, OX111, and OX116. These antibodies target specific regions of CD1a, including the A' roof and F' portal, which are important for its function in antigen presentation (Hardman2022CD1a).
