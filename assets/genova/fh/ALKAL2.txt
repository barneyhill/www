# ALKAL2

## Overview
ALKAL2, also known as FAM150B or augmentor-α, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a ligand for the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) receptors. The ALKAL2 protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a disulfide-linked homodimer formation and a three-helix bundle stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its interaction with ALK and LTK receptors (Reshetnyak2018Identification; Felix2024Reanalysis). As a ligand, ALKAL2 plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways that regulate neural development, cell differentiation, and pain modulation. It is highly expressed in sensory neurons, particularly in TRPV1 nociceptors, where it promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal excitability (Defaye2022The). Clinically, ALKAL2 is implicated in various diseases, including neuroblastoma and colon cancer, where its misregulation contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Mazzeschi2022The; Guan2021Chromosome). Additionally, its involvement in pain pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for pain management (Defaye2022The).

## Structure
The ALKAL2 protein, also known as AUG-α, is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a cysteine residue (C66) at its N-terminal end, which facilitates the formation of a disulfide-linked homodimer (Reshetnyak2018Identification; Felix2024Reanalysis). The primary structure of ALKAL2 begins at Gly25 and extends to amino acid 152, with a molecular mass of approximately 29,402 kDa, indicating a dimeric form (Reshetnyak2018Identification).

The secondary structure of ALKAL2 features a three-helix bundle stabilized by disulfide bonds, including intramolecular bridges between Cys111 and Cys147, and Cys125 and Cys134 (Reshetnyak2018Identification; De2021Structural). The tertiary structure is suggested to involve a leucine zipper-like coiled-coil formation in the N-terminal region (Felix2024Reanalysis).

In terms of quaternary structure, ALKAL2 forms a covalent dimer through a disulfide bridge at Cys66, which is specific to primates (Reshetnyak2018Identification). This dimerization allows ALKAL2 to engage in complex formations with ALK receptors, contributing to its role in cellular signaling pathways (Felix2024Reanalysis). The protein's structure is further characterized by a conserved ALKAL domain, which is crucial for its interaction with ALK and LTK receptors (Li2021Structural).

## Function
ALKAL2, also known as FAM150B, functions as a ligand for the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) receptors. It plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways that regulate neural development and cell differentiation. In sensory neurons, particularly TRPV1 nociceptors, ALKAL2 is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth and increasing neuronal excitability. This is achieved through its interaction with the ALK receptor, which is crucial for the development of neural crest-derived cells (Defaye2022The).

ALKAL2 is highly expressed in sensory neurons and is associated with nociceptor-specific transcripts. It enhances neurite outgrowth and excitability via interaction with the ALK receptor, which is important for the development of neural crest-derived cells (Defaye2022The). The protein is selectively expressed in afferent fibers, as confirmed in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, but not in the spinal cord (Defaye2022The).

In addition to its role in neural development, ALKAL2 is involved in the regulation of pain pathways. It contributes to nociceptor sensitization and pain modulation, suggesting its potential as a target for pain management therapies (Defaye2022The).

## Clinical Significance
ALKAL2, also known as augmentor-α or FAM150b, plays a significant role in various diseases through its interactions with the ALK receptor. In neuroblastoma, ALKAL2 is located on chromosome 2p25.3, near ALK and MYCN, and is implicated in the disease's pathogenesis. Approximately 30% of neuroblastoma cases exhibit 2p-gain or amplification in this region, which is associated with poor event-free survival (EFS) in patients. The misregulation of ALKAL2, along with ALK and MYCN, suggests a potential autocrine/paracrine activation of ALK in tumor settings, contributing to tumor progression (Javanmardi2019Analysis; Guan2021Chromosome).

In colon cancer, particularly in the consensus molecular subtype 1 (CMS1), ALKAL2 stimulates ALK downstream signaling, promoting an invasive phenotype. High ALKAL2 expression is linked to poor prognosis, and inhibiting the ALK pathway has shown potential in reducing tumor invasiveness and improving survival outcomes in CMS1 patients (Mazzeschi2022The).

ALKAL2 is also involved in mediating persistent pain through its expression in TRPV1 nociceptors. Enhanced ALKAL2 expression in chronic inflammatory pain conditions leads to increased neuronal excitability and sensitization, suggesting its potential as a target for pain management (Defaye2022The).

## Interactions
ALKAL2 interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases, specifically ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase), to form multiprotein complexes that are crucial for receptor activation and signaling. ALKAL2 adopts a disulfide-stabilized three-helix bundle structure, engaging ALK at specific sites. In site 1, ALKAL2 uses a hydrophobic patch surrounded by arginine residues to contact the ALK receptor via its TNFL subdomain (De2021Structural). The interaction involves a 2:1 stoichiometry, where a single ALKAL2 molecule interacts with two ALK receptors, facilitating receptor dimerization and activation (Felix2024Reanalysis).

ALKAL2 also forms 2:2 stoichiometric complexes with ALK, where interactions are stabilized by additional ALK-ALKAL2' contacts, covering a buried surface area of 250 Å² (Felix2024Reanalysis). These interactions are crucial for the juxtapositioning of the intracellular kinase domains of ALK, necessary for signaling (Felix2024Reanalysis). The presence of different stoichiometries in ALK-ALKAL2 complexes suggests distinct signaling outcomes, potentially influenced by local cytokine concentrations (Felix2024Reanalysis). ALKAL2's interactions with ALK and LTK are significant for therapeutic targeting in cancer, as they play a role in receptor dimerization and activation (De2021Structural).
