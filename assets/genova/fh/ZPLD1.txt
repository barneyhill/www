# ZPLD1

## Overview
ZPLD1 is a gene that encodes the protein zona pellucida-like domain containing 1, also known as cupulin. This protein is characterized by its zona pellucida (ZP) domain, which is integral to its function in forming extracellular matrices and fibrils. Cupulin is a transmembrane protein, featuring a domain that spans the cell membrane, and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and migration. The protein is notably involved in the structure and function of the cupula in the inner ear, playing a critical role in vestibular function. ZPLD1 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to medical conditions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and vestibular dysfunctions, highlighting its clinical significance (Vijayakumar2019Spontaneous; Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1; Knepper2022Zona).

## Structure
The ZPLD1 protein, encoded by the human ZPLD1 gene, features a zona pellucida-like domain, which is crucial for its structural and functional roles. This domain is approximately 260 amino acids long and is involved in the polymerization of proteins into fibrils or extracellular matrices (Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1; Vijayakumar2019Spontaneous). The protein includes a transmembrane domain, which spans amino acids 386-412, suggesting its role as an integral membrane protein (Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1). 

ZPLD1 contains two hydrophobic motifs: an internal hydrophobic patch (IHP) within the zona pellucida module and an external hydrophobic patch (EHP) outside the module. These motifs are essential for regulating polymerization and preventing premature intracellular polymerization (Knepper2022Zona). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage during secretion, which separates the regulatory motif from the mature monomer, enabling polymerization (Knepper2022Zona).

The protein is glycosylated, as indicated by a reduction in molecular weight upon deglycosylation, which suggests the presence of N-glycosylation sites (Dernedde2014Cupulin). ZPLD1 is highly conserved across species, showing significant homology from fish to humans (Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1).

## Function
The ZPLD1 gene encodes a protein known as cupulin, which plays a significant role in the structure and function of the cupula, a gelatinous structure in the inner ear involved in vestibular function (Knepper2022Zona; Vijayakumar2019Spontaneous). ZPLD1 is capable of forming high-molecular-weight polymers through its zona pellucida (ZP) module, a feature common among extracellular proteins that self-assemble into matrices (Knepper2022Zona). This polymerization is regulated by two hydrophobic motifs, the internal hydrophobic patch (IHP) and the external hydrophobic patch (EHP), which are crucial for maintaining the protein in an inactive conformation until it is ready to polymerize into extracellular filaments (Knepper2022Zona).

In healthy human cells, ZPLD1 is involved in cell-cell adhesion, migration, and nervous system development, suggesting roles beyond its structural function in the cupula (Knepper2022Zona). The protein's activity in the extracellular space may also be linked to complex signaling pathways related to blood vessel formation and other cellular processes (Knepper2022Zona). The gene is highly conserved across species, indicating its potential importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZPLD1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In humans, a disruption of the ZPLD1 gene due to a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 3 and X has been associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). This translocation results in a 2.5-fold decrease in ZPLD1 expression, suggesting that reduced expression may contribute to the development of CCM (Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1; Cavalcanti2012Cerebral). Despite this association, mutation screening in CCM-affected families did not reveal common mutations in ZPLD1, indicating that such mutations might be rare causes of CCM (Gianfrancesco2008ZPLD1).

In mice, mutations in the Zpld1 gene, such as the 'spiral' (sprl) and 'circler with hearing' (cwh) mutations, lead to vestibular dysfunction characterized by abnormal circling behavior. These mutations specifically impair semicircular canal function without affecting hearing or gravity receptor functions, highlighting the gene's role in balance and spatial orientation (Vijayakumar2019Spontaneous). The Zpld1 gene's involvement in vestibular function suggests its potential clinical significance in understanding human peripheral vestibular disorders (Vijayakumar2019Spontaneous).
