# KLHL38

## Overview
KLHL38 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 38, which is part of the Kelch-like (KLHL) protein family. This protein functions as an adaptor in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a critical role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its structural integrity (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics; Peng2023Genomic). KLHL38 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissue, implicating its involvement in muscle function and cardiac health (hai2024pan). The gene's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton organization and cell shape regulation (hai2024pan). Dysregulation of KLHL38 has been associated with pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cancer, where it influences tumor progression and patient prognosis (Xu2021KLHL38).

## Structure
KLHL38 is a member of the Kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by the presence of specific domains that contribute to its molecular structure. The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and form a β-propeller structure (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics; Peng2023Genomic). The Kelch motifs are ancient sequence motifs, approximately 50 amino acids long, and are typically found in repeats that contribute to the protein's tertiary structure (Shilovsky2023Regulation).

KLHL38 is part of the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of specific substrates, such as BECN1 (Li2021CUL3). The protein's structure allows it to interact with Cullin3, forming a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets proteins for degradation (Peng2023Genomic).

The gene also contains a retrogene derived from KLHL30, located in exon 2, which contributes to its open reading frame and encodes the BTB/POZ and BACK domains, as well as two of the Kelch repeats (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). This retrogene has a high sequence identity with its parent gene, indicating a recent retrotransposition event (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Function
KLHL38 is a member of the Kelch-like (KLHL) protein family, which functions as substrate adaptors for Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases. These proteins are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Peng2023Genomic). KLHL38 contains BTB/POZ, BACK domains, and Kelch motifs, which are essential for its role in forming E3 ligase complexes that target proteins for ubiquitination (hai2024pan).

In healthy human cells, KLHL38 is involved in various molecular processes, including protein binding, muscle organ development, actin cytoskeleton organization, and regulation of cell shape (hai2024pan). The protein is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissue, suggesting its involvement in muscle function and cardiac health (hai2024pan). KLHL38's interactions with other proteins and its role in ubiquitination highlight its importance in cellular differentiation and homeostasis, contributing to the regulation of cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Peng2023Genomic). The gene's expression and activity are crucial for normal cellular function, and dysregulation may lead to pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
KLHL38 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations affecting prognosis and disease progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KLHL38 is overexpressed and correlates with poor clinical outcomes, including increased tumor size and lymph node metastasis. It promotes cancer progression through the activation of the Akt signaling pathway, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Xu2021KLHL38). 

In breast cancer, KLHL38, in conjunction with CUL3, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1, a tumor suppressor gene. This process inhibits autophagy and promotes tumor progression, with high KLHL38 expression linked to poor prognosis (Li2021CUL3). 

Pan-cancer analyses have shown that KLHL38 expression varies across different tumor types, with high expression associated with worse overall survival in cancers such as mesothelioma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uveal melanoma. Conversely, low expression is linked to worse progression-free intervals in kidney chromophobe cancer (hai2024pan). KLHL38 mutations are also associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in breast cancer (hai2024pan). 

These findings suggest that KLHL38 may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
KLHL38 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role as an adaptor in the CUL3-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1. KLHL38 is part of the Kelch-like protein family and contains a BTB domain necessary for substrate recognition by CUL3, an E3 ligase of the Cullin-Ring family. This interaction facilitates the proteasomal degradation of BECN1, a tumor suppressor gene, thereby inhibiting autophagy and promoting tumor progression in breast cancer cells (Li2021CUL3). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed that KLHL38 interacts with both BECN1 and CUL3, forming a complex that enhances BECN1 ubiquitination and degradation (Li2021CUL3).

KLHL38 also plays a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression by promoting PTEN ubiquitination, which activates the Akt signaling pathway. This activation leads to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting KLHL38's involvement in cancer cell behavior (Xu2021KLHL38). These interactions underscore KLHL38's significance in cellular processes related to cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
