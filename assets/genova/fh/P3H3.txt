# P3H3

## Overview
P3H3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3, which is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. This enzyme plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically through the hydroxylation of proline residues, which is essential for the proper folding and stability of collagen fibrils (Hudson2017P3h3null). Although initially thought to function directly as a prolyl 3-hydroxylase, recent studies suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 may also act as a chaperone, optimizing the activity of lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1) for lysine hydroxylation (Hudson2017P3h3null). This enzyme is involved in collagen biosynthesis within the endoplasmic reticulum, forming complexes with other proteins such as SC65, LH1, and cyclophilin B (CypB) to facilitate collagen cross-linking (Hudson2017P3h3null). Alterations in P3H3 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may function as a tumor suppressor, and its deficiency is associated with collagen-related disorders (Li2018Collagen; Hudson2017P3h3null).

## Structure
The P3H3 protein, also known as prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3, is part of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, which is characterized by a double-stranded β-helix fold. This structural feature is typical of enzymes in this family and is crucial for their catalytic activity (Ishikawa2019Reevaluation). P3H3 is involved in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically hydroxylating proline residues, which is essential for proper collagen folding and stability (Hudson2017P3h3null).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and stability. These modifications are common in proteins involved in collagen biosynthesis and are important for their activity and interactions (Hudson2017P3h3null). Although specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of P3H3 are not provided, its role in collagen modification suggests a complex structure that facilitates interactions with other proteins involved in collagen biosynthesis, such as lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1) and cyclophilin B (CypB) (Ishikawa2019Reevaluation).

Splice variants of P3H3 may result in different isoforms, potentially leading to functional diversity, although specific isoforms and their functions are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
P3H3 (prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically in the hydroxylation of proline residues. This modification is crucial for the proper assembly and function of collagen fibrils, contributing to the stability and structural integrity of tissues (Gjaltema2016Molecular). P3H3 is part of a complex in the endoplasmic reticulum that facilitates lysyl hydroxylation, which is essential for collagen cross-linking and stability (Hudson2017P3h3null). Although P3H3 was initially thought to function as a prolyl 3-hydroxylase, studies suggest it may have a chaperone role, optimizing lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1) activity for lysine hydroxylation (Hudson2017P3h3null).

In healthy human cells, P3H3 is implicated in collagen biosynthesis and modification processes, although its specific substrate specificity remains unclear (Gjaltema2016Molecular). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues, as evidenced by the phenotypic abnormalities observed in P3h3-null mice, which exhibit collagen lysine under-hydroxylation and cross-linking defects (Hudson2017P3h3null). Despite its critical role in collagen modification, the exact molecular activities and interactions of P3H3 in human cells are not fully elucidated (Hudson2017P3h3null).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the P3H3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including lung and breast cancer. In lung cancer, P3H3 is often downregulated due to DNA methylation, and its reduced expression is associated with higher tumor grade and stage. Functional studies have shown that overexpression of P3H3 in lung cancer cells can inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Li2018Collagen).

In breast cancer, P3H3 is frequently subject to epigenetic silencing through aberrant CpG methylation, leading to its downregulation. This silencing is associated with higher tumor grades and a higher Nottingham Prognostic Index, indicating a potential role in cancer progression. The re-expression of P3H3 in breast cancer cell lines lacking endogenous expression has been shown to decrease colony formation, highlighting its tumor suppressive properties (Shah2009The).

Beyond cancer, P3H3 is involved in collagen modification, and its deficiency in mice models has been linked to collagen lysine under-hydroxylation and cross-linking abnormalities, similar to those observed in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIA (Hudson2017P3h3null).

## Interactions
P3H3 (prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3) is involved in collagen biosynthesis and interacts with several proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. It forms a complex with SC65, lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1), and cyclophilin B (CypB), which is essential for normal lysine hydroxylation in the collagen triple-helix (Hudson2017P3h3null). This complex facilitates the access of LH1 to lysine residues on newly synthesized collagen chains, playing a crucial role in collagen cross-linking chemistry (Hudson2017P3h3null). 

P3H3 is suggested to act as a chaperone for LH1, aiding its function in lysine hydroxylation, although this role is not required for all LH1 sites (Ishikawa2019Reevaluation). The interactions between P3H3 and other proteins are complex and involve distinct protein-protein interactions rather than a single tight complex (Ishikawa2019Reevaluation). Despite its homology to other prolyl 3-hydroxylases, P3H3 does not appear to directly participate in prolyl 3-hydroxylation, indicating a possible retained chaperone function in the ER (Hudson2017P3h3null). The absence of P3H3 leads to under-hydroxylation of lysine residues, affecting collagen stability and cross-linking (Hudson2017P3h3null).
