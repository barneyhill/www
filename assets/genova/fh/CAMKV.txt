# CAMKV

## Overview
The CAMKV gene encodes the CaM kinase-like vesicle-associated protein, a pseudokinase primarily expressed in neural tissues. Despite its classification as a pseudokinase due to the absence of key residues necessary for catalytic activity, the protein plays a significant role in neuronal function, particularly in the maintenance and stability of dendritic spines, which are crucial for synaptic connectivity and plasticity (Liang2016The; Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated). The protein is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity by acting as a molecular link between AMPA receptor signaling and RhoA-dependent actin dynamics (Liang2016The). CAMKV's expression is regulated by synaptic activity and sensory experiences, implicating it in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning processes (Liang2016The). Additionally, CAMKV is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and neuroblastoma, where its dysregulation is associated with disease pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Rozen2023A; Sussman2020CAMKV).

## Structure
The CAMKV protein, also known as CaM kinase-like vesicle-associated protein, is characterized as a pseudokinase due to the absence of key residues necessary for ATP binding and autophosphorylation, which are typical in other kinases (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated). The protein contains an N-terminal kinase domain with 39% identity and 59% similarity to the kinase domain of CaMKIIÎ±, followed by a central calmodulin-binding domain and an extended C-terminal intrinsically disordered domain (approximately residues 330-501) (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated). The putative active site of CAMKV includes a His168 residue replacing the glycine in the conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, which is critical for catalysis in active kinases, suggesting that CAMKV likely does not express kinase activity (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated).

CAMKV undergoes palmitoylation at Cysteine 5, a post-translational modification that affects its localization to the plasma membrane (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated). This modification contributes to the protein's recruitment to the plasma membrane, although it is not essential for membrane binding (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated). The presence of an EGFP tag can influence the distribution of CAMKV, with N-terminal tagging potentially suppressing palmitoylation of Cys5 (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated).

## Function
The CAMKV gene encodes a pseudokinase known as CaM kinase-like vesicle-associated protein, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance of dendritic spines, essential structures for synaptic connectivity and plasticity in neurons. Despite lacking kinase activity, CaMKv functions as a molecular link between AMPA receptor signaling and RhoA-dependent actin dynamics, which are vital for spine stability (Liang2016The). CaMKv is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, acting as a convergence point for calcium signals to the neuronal cytoskeleton via RhoA. It interacts with the RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lfc, inhibiting RhoA activity to maintain dendritic spine density (Liang2016The).

CaMKv is predominantly expressed in brain and neural tissues, where it is implicated in synaptic strengthening during spatial learning by stabilizing and enriching dendritic spines (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated). Its expression is regulated by synaptic activity and sensory experiences, suggesting a role in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (Liang2016The). CaMKv is localized in the synaptic plasma membrane and postsynaptic density, where it is involved in the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity, contributing to learning and memory processes (Liang2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAMKV gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. CAMKV is located on chromosome 3 (3p21.31), and changes in this region, such as copy-number variants and microdeletions, have been associated with autism, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. This suggests a potential link between CAMKV dysregulation and neurodevelopmental disorders (Liang2016The).

In the context of cancer, CAMKV is significantly overexpressed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that primarily affects children. This overexpression is correlated with poor patient survival and is considered a potential immunotherapeutic target due to its minimal expression in normal tissues (Rozen2023A; Sussman2020CAMKV). MYCN amplification is a predictive biomarker for high CAMKV expression, and MYCN protein directly controls CAMKV transcription. In some high-risk neuroblastomas lacking MYCN amplification, MYC can also drive CAMKV transcription (Sussman2020CAMKV).

CAMKV's role in neuroblastoma is further highlighted by its interaction with DYRK3, which phosphorylates CAMKV, influencing cell proliferation and survival. This interaction is crucial for neuroblastoma pathogenesis and suggests that targeting the DYRK3/CAMKV signaling module could be a therapeutic strategy (Rozen2024A; Rozen2023A).

## Interactions
CAMKV, or CaM kinase-like vesicle-associated protein, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic function. CAMKV binds to calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein, which is essential for maintaining dendritic spine density. A mutant form of CAMKV that cannot bind calmodulin fails to rescue spine density, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Liang2016The).

CAMKV also interacts with the RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Lfc, but not with other GEFs like Ephexin1 or TIAM1. This specific interaction suggests that CAMKV inhibits RhoA activity by preventing its interaction with Lfc, thereby regulating spine morphogenesis (Liang2016The). CAMKV is a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and its phosphorylation at Thr345 by Cdk5 inhibits its function in spine morphogenesis (Liang2016The).

In the context of neuroblastoma, CAMKV interacts with DYRK3, a kinase involved in cell proliferation. CAMKV is phosphorylated by DYRK3, and this interaction is implicated in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis (Rozen2023A). CAMKV also interacts with the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), and this interaction is influenced by the palmitoylation of CAMKV (Barylko2022Palmitoylationregulated).
