# BTF3L4

## Overview
BTF3L4 is a gene that encodes the protein basic transcription factor 3 like 4, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. BTF3L4 is implicated in the modulation of transcriptional activities that are essential for cell proliferation and survival. Its expression and function have been linked to significant physiological and pathological processes, including liver injury and cancer. The protein's interaction with other molecular pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease contexts (Lin2024BTF3L4; Huang2022Genomewide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
BTF3L4 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In the context of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI), BTF3L4 is significantly overexpressed, with a 6.4-fold increase observed in mouse models. This overexpression is associated with increased liver injury, promoting inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, which are key factors in the pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) (Lin2024BTF3L4). The gene's expression correlates positively with markers of liver injury, such as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for AILI (Lin2024BTF3L4).

In cancer, BTF3L4 is identified as an oncogene necessary for tumor cell proliferation in stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers. It is directly targeted by miR-194, a tumor suppressor miRNA, which downregulates BTF3L4 expression, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. This interaction highlights BTF3L4's role in gastrointestinal cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Huang2022Genomewide). The dysregulation of BTF3L4, therefore, contributes to both liver injury and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance in these conditions.
