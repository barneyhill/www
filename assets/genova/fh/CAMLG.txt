# CAMLG

## Overview
The CAMLG gene encodes the calcium-modulating ligand protein, which is integral to calcium signaling pathways within human cells. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is characterized by its transmembrane nature, containing three transmembrane segments that facilitate its integration into the ER membrane. CAMLG plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular calcium levels, impacting processes such as T-cell activation and function. It is also involved in the posttranslational insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane, functioning as part of the TRC40 pathway. This pathway is essential for the proper insertion and stability of these proteins, which are vital for various cellular functions. Additionally, CAMLG interacts with several proteins, including those from pathogens like the Classical Swine Fever Virus, highlighting its role in both cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms (Borgese2020Searching; Diener2018Modulation; Yamamoto2015The).

## Structure
The CAMLG protein, also known as calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand, is characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes both transmembrane and cytosolic regions. The protein contains three transmembrane segments (TMS) in its C-terminal region, which are crucial for its integration into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and interaction with the WRB protein (Carvalho2019The; Yamamoto2015The). The first TMS has the most favorable free energy for membrane insertion, while the third TMS is predicted to be part of a cytosolic loop rather than a transmembrane segment (Borgese2020Searching).

The N-terminal region of CAMLG contains a conserved basic cluster (RRRK), which is essential for its interaction with TRC40, a cytosolic ATPase involved in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane (Borgese2020Searching; Yamamoto2015The). This region acts as an antenna, capturing TRC40-substrate complexes and facilitating their delivery to the ER membrane (Borgese2020Searching).

CAML is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are important for its proper integration and function within the ER membrane (Carvalho2019The). The protein's structure and function are conserved across various species, indicating its evolutionary significance (Borgese2020Searching).

## Function
The CAMLG gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways within human cells. CAMLG is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it influences calcium homeostasis and signaling, impacting various cellular functions. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, which are crucial for processes such as T-cell activation and function. Overexpression of CAMLG in Jurkat cells leads to an IP3-independent influx of extracellular calcium, facilitating NFAT-controlled transcription events, which are essential for T-cell function (Diener2018Modulation).

CAMLG also interacts with the angiotensin II-type I receptor, suggesting a role in angiotensin II signaling, which is relevant to vasoregulatory actions and hypertension (Wei2011Differential). Additionally, CAMLG is involved in the posttranslational insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane, functioning as part of the TRC40 pathway. This pathway is crucial for the proper insertion and stability of tail-anchored proteins, which are vital for various cellular functions (Yamamoto2015The). The interaction between CAMLG and other proteins, such as WRB, is essential for the stability and correct folding of these proteins, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Inglis2019Differential).

## Clinical Significance
The CAMLG gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in calcium signaling pathways. In multiple myeloma (MM), CAMLG is identified as a promising drug target, with drugs like cyclosporine and belinostat showing potential in treatment (Satria2023Identification). Alterations in CAMLG expression have also been associated with in-stent restenosis (ISR) in geriatric patients with coronary artery disease. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CAMLG, rs12657663, has been linked to an increased risk of ISR, with a genetic risk score model highlighting its significance (Hsu2023Application).

In the context of viral infections, CAMLG interacts with the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) p7 protein, affecting calcium permeability at the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is crucial for the virus's pathogenic mechanisms, suggesting that alterations in CAMLG's normal interactions can impact disease progression (Gladue2018Classical).

Furthermore, CAMLG is part of a common methylation signature in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), indicating its involvement in signaling pathways that may be disrupted in this condition (Figueroa2013Integrated). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CAMLG in various diseases.

## Interactions
CAMLG, also known as calcium-modulating ligand, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the p7 protein of the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), a nonstructural protein with viroporin activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating calcium permeability at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is essential for the virus's virulence. The interaction was confirmed using a yeast two-hybrid system and confocal microscopy, with specific amino acid residues in p7 identified as critical for binding to CAMLG (Gladue2018Classical).

CAMLG also interacts with proteins secreted by Toxoplasma gondii, such as GRA3, GRA5, and GRA6. These interactions occur within the ER membrane and are involved in modulating intracellular calcium concentrations, which can inhibit host cell apoptosis, aiding in the parasite's survival (Ahn2006Interactions).

Additionally, CAMLG is part of the TRC40 pathway in mammals, where it functions as a receptor for TRC40, facilitating the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane. This role is analogous to the yeast Get2 protein, despite the lack of sequence similarity (Yamamoto2015The).
