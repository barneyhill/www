# SIGMAR1

## Overview
The SIGMAR1 gene encodes the sigma-1 receptor, a unique non-opioid intracellular receptor that functions as a chaperone protein. This receptor is primarily located at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM), where it plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and homeostasis. Unlike traditional receptors, the sigma-1 receptor is involved in modulating ion channels and neurotransmitter systems, contributing to its classification as a multifunctional chaperone rather than a conventional receptor (Kim2017Introduction; Hayashi2007Sigma1). The receptor's structural features, including a single transmembrane domain and a cupin-like ligand-binding barrel, facilitate its interactions with various proteins, influencing processes such as calcium signaling, autophagy, and the unfolded protein response (Lachance2023Overview; Hayashi2007Sigma1). SIGMAR1's involvement in neuroprotection and cellular stress responses underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (Aishwarya2021Sigmar1’s; Lachance2023Overview).

## Structure
The SIGMAR1 protein, also known as the Sigma-1 receptor, is characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains a cupin-like ligand-binding barrel (Kim2017Introduction). This structure contrasts with earlier models that suggested a two-transmembrane domain topology (Kim2017Introduction). The protein is known to form homodimers, which are essential for its function (Hayashi2007Sigma1). 

SIGMAR1 is located primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrion interface, specifically in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) domains, where it plays a role in calcium signaling and cell survival (Hayashi2007Sigma1). The receptor's structure includes a C-terminal region that is crucial for its proper localization and interaction with cholesterol, affecting lipid raft composition and cell adhesion (Lachance2023Overview). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence SIGMAR1's function, although specific details are not fully elucidated in the provided context. The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which can impact its activity and cellular localization (Lachance2023Overview). These structural features contribute to SIGMAR1's role in modulating ion channels and neurotransmitter systems.

## Function
The SIGMAR1 gene encodes the sigma-1 receptor, a multifunctional chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, the sigma-1 receptor is primarily located at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM), where it facilitates communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. This localization is essential for regulating calcium (Ca2+) signaling, which is vital for various cellular functions, including mitochondrial activity, lipid metabolism, and autophagy (Couly2023SIGMAR1; Hayashi2007Sigma1).

The sigma-1 receptor stabilizes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3) at the MAM, promoting Ca2+ efflux from the ER to the mitochondria, which is crucial for maintaining cellular bioenergetics and survival (Couly2023SIGMAR1; Hayashi2007Sigma1). It also plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), interacting with the IRE1 pathway to stabilize IRE1 during ER stress, thereby aiding in proper protein folding and stress response (Couly2023SIGMAR1).

The sigma-1 receptor is involved in autophagy, particularly in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a critical step for autophagic waste clearance (Yang2019SIGMAR1Sigma1). Its chaperone activity is linked to neuroprotection and cellular stress responses, making it a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders (Aishwarya2021Sigmar1’s; Lachance2023Overview).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SIGMAR1 gene are linked to several neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of neuromuscular diseases, SIGMAR1 mutations are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), juvenile ALS, and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). Specific mutations, such as p.E102Q and p.L95fs, are unstable and non-functional, leading to cellular dysfunction in ALS (Aishwarya2021Sigmar1’s; Al‐Saif2011A). The SIGMAR1 mutation c.500A>T, resulting in the p.Asn167Ile substitution, is linked to distal hereditary motor neuronopathy of the Jerash type, causing progressive muscle weakness and atrophy (Ververis2019Distal).

In neurodegenerative diseases, SIGMAR1 mutations are implicated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND). The c.672*51G>T mutation in the 3' untranslated region of SIGMAR1 affects transcript stability and is associated with altered protein expression and localization, contributing to the pathogenesis of FTLD-MND (Luty2010Sigma). SIGMAR1 also plays a role in psychiatric disorders and cancer progression, with its expression linked to disease progression in various cancers, including breast, lung, and prostate cancers (Aishwarya2021Sigmar1’s). These findings highlight SIGMAR1 as a potential therapeutic target for these conditions.

## Interactions
SIGMAR1, also known as the sigma-1 receptor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms a multicomplex with ankyrin B isoforms (ANK220 and ANK135) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R-3) in NG-108 cells. Approximately 43% of IP3R-3 and 20% of ANK220 are associated with SIGMAR1, while a significant 97% of ANK135 is coupled to it. SIGMAR1 agonists can cause the dissociation of ANK220 from IP3R-3, indicating selective interaction (Hayashi2001Regulating).

SIGMAR1 also interacts with the chaperone protein BiP at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM). This interaction is highly specific and sensitive to ER stress, with rapid dissociation occurring under stress conditions. The presence of calcium or manganese stabilizes the SIGMAR1-BiP complex, while chelators or other cations decrease the association (Hayashi2007Sigma1).

In the nucleus accumbens, SIGMAR1 associates with the voltage-dependent potassium channel Kv1.2, enhancing its trafficking and upregulation at the plasma membrane. It also interacts with ankyrin-B, which is involved in growth cone formation and axon development (Couly2023SIGMAR1). SIGMAR1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in neuroprotection and cellular signaling.
