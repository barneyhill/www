# ATAD3A

## Overview
ATAD3A is a gene that encodes the ATPase family AAA domain containing 3A protein, a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, which is integral to mitochondrial function. The ATAD3A protein is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, including fission, fusion, and the organization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Gilquin2010The; Teng2019ATAD3A). It is involved in critical cellular processes such as mitochondrial interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for cholesterol transfer and metabolism (Lang2020Emerging). The protein's ATPase activity is crucial for its function, and mutations in the ATAD3A gene can lead to a variety of mitochondrial and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Cooper2017ATPasedeficient; Dorison2020Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The ATAD3A protein is a mitochondrial inner membrane AAA+ ATPase with a complex molecular structure. It is composed of 586 amino acids and includes several distinct domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-245) is located in the intermembrane space and interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OM) (Gilquin2010The). This domain contains two coiled-coil regions (CC1 and CC2) between amino acids 85-115 and 180-220, which are involved in oligomerization (Gilquin2010The; Zhao2019ATAD3A). The central transmembrane segment (TMS) spans residues 246-264, anchoring the protein in the inner membrane (IM) (Gilquin2010The).

The C-terminal region (amino acids 337-586) forms the ATPase core domain, characterized by Walker A and B motifs, an SRH motif, sensor I and II residues, and an Arg finger, which are typical of the AAA+ ATPase subfamily (Hubstenberger2010Topological; Gilquin2010The). This domain is located within the mitochondrial matrix and is crucial for ATP binding and mitochondrial targeting (Gilquin2010The).

ATAD3A's quaternary structure involves oligomerization, which is essential for its function in mitochondrial dynamics and interaction with other mitochondrial components (Gilquin2010The; Zhao2019ATAD3A). The protein's structure allows it to mediate interactions between the IM and OM, playing a role in processes such as mitochondrial fission and fusion (Gilquin2010The).

## Function
The ATAD3A gene encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, including the processes of fission and fusion. It is involved in the organization and distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by interacting with nucleoproteins that mediate mtDNA attachment to the inner mitochondrial membrane, ensuring mtDNA maintenance and replication (Lang2020Emerging; Teng2019ATAD3A). ATAD3A is also essential for mitochondrial interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating cholesterol transfer and metabolism, which is critical for steroidogenesis (Gilquin2010The; Lang2020Emerging). 

The protein is part of the AAA+ ATPase family and is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane, with its N-terminal domain interacting with the outer membrane. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Gilquin2010The; Cooper2017ATPasedeficient). ATAD3A's ATPase activity is vital for its function, and mutations affecting this activity can lead to altered mitochondrial dynamics and increased autophagy (Cooper2017ATPasedeficient). In healthy cells, ATAD3A is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis and maintaining cristae structure, which is essential for the proper functioning of the respiratory chain (Cooper2017ATPasedeficient).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATAD3A gene are associated with a range of neurological and mitochondrial disorders. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in conditions such as axonal sensory-motor neuropathy, neonatal cataract, spastic paraplegia, dyskinetic cerebral palsy, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and fatal neonatal cardiomyopathy with corneal clouding and encephalopathy (Dorison2020Mitochondrial). The recurrent de novo c.1582C>T (p.Arg528Trp) variant is linked to global developmental delay, hypotonia, optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, functioning through a dominant-negative mechanism (Harel2016Recurrent).

Biallelic deletions in the ATAD3 gene cluster, including ATAD3A, can cause severe neurological conditions such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia, characterized by hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and encephalopathy (Desai2017ATAD3; Skopkova2023ATAD3Arelated). Monoallelic dominant missense variants are associated with Harel-Yoon syndrome, which includes delayed development, mild intellectual disability, and peripheral neuropathy (Skopkova2023ATAD3Arelated).

Mutations in ATAD3A can also disrupt mitochondrial dynamics, leading to altered mitochondrial structure and function, abnormal cholesterol metabolism, and increased mitophagy (Cooper2017ATPasedeficient; Harel2016Recurrent). These disruptions contribute to the clinical manifestations observed in ATAD3A-related disorders.

## Interactions
ATAD3A is a mitochondrial protein that participates in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with the WASF3 metastasis-promoting protein, a relationship crucial for maintaining WASF3 stability at the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of GRP78, which increases WASF3 levels in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. The interaction between ATAD3A and WASF3 occurs at their N-terminal ends within the mitochondria, and the knockdown of ATAD3A leads to decreased WASF3 protein levels, impacting cancer cell metastasis (Teng2015Mitochondrial).

ATAD3A also interacts with the calcium-binding protein S100B. This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves a specific binding motif within ATAD3A, comprising residues 290 to 310. The binding of S100B to ATAD3A prevents aggregation of ATAD3A and enhances its mitochondrial localization, suggesting a role in the cytoplasmic processing of ATAD3A (Gilquin2010Thea). The interaction is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and is crucial for the proper folding and subcellular localization of ATAD3A, preventing aggregation of cytoplasmic ATAD3A mutants and restoring their mitochondrial localization (Gilquin2010Thea).
