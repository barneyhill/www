# SPRR2D

## Overview
The SPRR2D gene encodes the small proline-rich protein 2D, which is a member of the small proline-rich protein (SPRR) family. These proteins are involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, a critical component of the epidermal barrier in the skin. SPRR2D, like other members of its family, is characterized by its high proline content and is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues. The protein plays a significant role in the structural integrity and protective functions of the skin and other epithelial surfaces. Alterations in the expression of SPRR2D have been linked to various pathological conditions, including eosinophilic esophagitis, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Lazar2013Integrated; Sinha2024A; Yan2021Singlecell).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPRR2D gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), a chronic allergic condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa, SPRR2D has been identified as a gene with a confirmed connection to the disease. The Differential Gene Expression Based Simulated Annealing (DGESA) method has validated the biological relevance of SPRR2D in EoE, highlighting its potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Sinha2024A).

SPRR2D is also implicated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where it is part of the SPRR gene family that is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is associated with the progression of cSCC, suggesting that SPRR2D may play a role in the disease's development and progression (Yan2021Singlecell).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), SPRR2D has been identified as a non-secreted gene candidate for immunohistochemistry biomarker use, which may aid in distinguishing between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Lazar2013Integrated). These findings indicate that SPRR2D may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.
