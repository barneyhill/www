# RMDN2

## Overview
RMDN2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as regulator of microtubule dynamics 2, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation and stabilization of microtubules within cells. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is essential for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport. It is particularly involved in processes such as mitosis and cellular signaling, where it ensures proper chromosome segregation by localizing to spindle microtubules and spindle poles during cell division (Jiang2021Concomitance; Andrade2020Large). Mutations in the RMDN2 gene can lead to defects in chromosome segregation, which may result in various cellular dysfunctions. Additionally, RMDN2 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, due to its association with tau pathology and its expression in brain regions affected by the disease (Nho2024CYP1B1RMDN2; Nho2023NovelCYP1B1RMDN2Alzheimer’s).

## Function
The RMDN2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport. This protein is involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules, impacting processes such as mitosis and cellular signaling (Jiang2021Concomitance; Andrade2020Large). RMDN2 contains multiple coiled-coil domains and localizes to spindle microtubules and spindle poles during cell division, ensuring proper chromosome segregation. Mutations in RMDN2 can lead to defective chromosome segregation, resulting in the non-segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase (Jiang2021Concomitance; Andrade2020Large).

In healthy human cells, RMDN2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules to influence their dynamics. This interaction is crucial for processes like mitosis, where it ensures the correct distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells, and for cellular signaling pathways that rely on microtubule-mediated transport (Jiang2021Concomitance). The protein's role in microtubule dynamics is vital for maintaining cellular integrity and function, highlighting its importance in cell biology.

## Clinical Significance
RMDN2 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its association with tau pathology, a hallmark of the disease. Studies have shown that RMDN2 is down-regulated in the parahippocampal gyrus of AD patients, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology (Nho2024CYP1B1RMDN2; Nho2023NovelCYP1B1RMDN2Alzheimer’s). The gene is highly expressed in brain regions associated with tau deposition, such as the temporal lobe and visual cortex, which are areas affected in AD (Nho2023NovelCYP1B1RMDN2Alzheimer’s). The minor allele of the SNP rs2113389, located near RMDN2, is linked to higher tau levels and faster cognitive decline, indicating that genetic variations at this locus may influence AD progression (Nho2023NovelCYP1B1RMDN2Alzheimer’s).

While the functional studies on RMDN2 are limited, its role in microtubule dynamics suggests that alterations in its expression could disrupt cellular processes critical for neuronal function, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative conditions like AD (Nho2023NovelCYP1B1RMDN2Alzheimer’s). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of RMDN2 expression alterations and their impact on AD and other diseases.
