# RIPOR3

## Overview
RIPOR3 is a gene that encodes the protein RIPOR family member 3, which is part of the RIPOR (Rho family interacting cell polarization regulator) protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of cell polarity and motility, playing a crucial role in cellular processes that are essential for maintaining normal physiological functions. The RIPOR3 protein is categorized as a regulatory protein, influencing pathways that are critical for immune response and cellular dynamics. Research has highlighted its significance in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis in various cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and breast cancer (MaresQuiñones2024Identification; Zhou2019Integrated). The gene's potential as a prognostic biomarker underscores its importance in the study of cancer pathogenesis and therapy.

## Clinical Significance
RIPOR3 has been identified as a significant gene in the context of cancer, particularly in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (SCCT) and breast cancer. In SCCT, RIPOR3 is one of the significantly differentially expressed mRNAs associated with patient survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Zhou2019Integrated). In breast cancer, specifically the HER2 ampl subtype, RIPOR3 is highlighted as a hub gene. Its expression is linked to the modulation of immune pathway functions and hypermethylation, suggesting its utility as a prognostic biomarker. Downregulation of RIPOR3 in tongue cancer is associated with a worse prognosis, implying that alterations in its expression may impact cancer prognosis, particularly concerning immune cell infiltration in cell carcinoma of the mobile tongue (MaresQuiñones2024Identification).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of RIPOR3 in cancer, where its altered expression levels may influence disease progression and patient outcomes. The gene's involvement in immune response regulation and its potential as a diagnostic biomarker highlight its importance in understanding and potentially treating various cancer types.
