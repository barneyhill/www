# BUD23

## Overview
BUD23 is a gene that encodes the BUD23 rRNA methyltransferase and ribosome maturation factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis. This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, specifically involved in the methylation of guanine at position 1575 of 18S rRNA, a modification essential for the proper assembly and function of the small ribosomal subunit (White2008Bud23). The BUD23 protein is characterized by a Rossmann-fold methyltransferase (RFM) superfamily structure, which includes a central seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Létoquart2014Structural). It forms a complex with the coactivator Trm112, which is crucial for its stability and function in ribosome synthesis (Figaro2012Trm112; Létoquart2014Structural). BUD23's activity is significant in cells with high ATP demand, such as cardiac cells, where it supports mitochondrial function by facilitating the translation of mitochondria-targeted proteins (Baxter2020Cardiac). The gene's role extends to clinical implications, including its involvement in mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac health, as well as potential links to cancer pathologies (Baxter2020Cardiac; Haag2014WBSCR22/Merm1).

## Structure
The BUD23 protein is a methyltransferase involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically methylating G1575 of 18S rRNA. Its primary structure includes residues 10 to 210, forming a well-folded globular domain rich in alpha-helices and beta-strands, characteristic of the Rossmann-fold methyltransferase (RFM) superfamily (White2008Bud23). The N-terminal region of BUD23 contains the methyltransferase domain, which adopts a typical class I SAM-dependent MTase fold, composed of a central seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by four α-helices on one side and two on the other (Létoquart2014Structural).

The tertiary structure of BUD23 is modeled with the N-terminal region forming an alpha/beta globular domain, while the C-terminal region is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, with a tendency to form two alpha-helices (White2008Bud23). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a complex with the coactivator Trm112, which stabilizes BUD23 and is crucial for its function in ribosome synthesis (Figaro2012Trm112; Létoquart2014Structural).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may affect BUD23's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. Splice variants of BUD23 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with different functional properties, but these are not explicitly described in the provided context.

## Function
The BUD23 gene encodes a ribosomal RNA methyltransferase that plays a critical role in ribosome maturation and function in healthy human cells. It specifically methylates guanine at position 1575 of 18S rRNA, a modification essential for the proper assembly and function of the small ribosomal subunit (White2008Bud23). This methylation occurs on late 40S precursor ribosomes and is crucial for efficient synthesis and maturation of the small ribosomal subunit (Létoquart2014Structural).

BUD23 is involved in the processing of pre-18S RNA into its mature form, maintaining the normal stoichiometry of ribosomal RNA components, and modulating the translation of mitochondrial transcripts (Baxter2020Cardiac). It preferentially promotes the selection of mRNA species with low GC-content 5'UTRs, which is important for the efficient translation of certain mRNA transcripts (Baxter2020Cardiac).

In terms of cellular localization, BUD23 is abundant in the cytosolic fraction and not detected in the mitochondrial fraction, indicating its action is outside the mitochondria (Baxter2020Cardiac). Its role is particularly significant in cells with high ATP demand, such as cardiac cells, where it supports mitochondrial function by facilitating the translation of mitochondria-targeted proteins (Baxter2020Cardiac).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the BUD23 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to mitochondrial function and cardiac health. BUD23 is crucial for ribosome maturation and the translation of mitochondrial transcripts. Its deficiency in cardiac muscle leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by heart enlargement, ventricle dilatation, and decreased wall thickness, ultimately causing premature death in mice (Baxter2020Cardiac). The gene's role in mitochondrial homeostasis is linked to the regulation of nuclear-encoded genes, such as mTOR, which are vital for mitochondrial activity (Baxter2020Cardiac).

BUD23 is also associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a complex genetic disorder involving multiple genes, where its deletion may contribute to the syndrome's phenotype, although its specific role remains unclear (Garcia2021BUD23–TRMT112; Baxter2020Cardiac). Additionally, BUD23 has been implicated in cancer pathologies, with its human homolog, WBSCR22, identified as a promoter of cancer metastasis (Haag2014WBSCR22/Merm1). These findings suggest that BUD23's involvement in ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial function may have broader implications for various diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
BUD23, a methyltransferase involved in ribosome biogenesis, participates in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the DEAH-box RNA helicase Ecm16, which is essential for the cleavage at site A2 of the pre-rRNA. This interaction is crucial for ribosome biogenesis, and mutations in Ecm16 can suppress the growth and rRNA processing defects of a bud23Δ mutant (Sardana2014Physical). BUD23 also interacts with Trm112, forming a complex that is necessary for its stability and function. This complex is involved in the methylation of 18S rRNA at position G1575 (Létoquart2014Structural).

BUD23 is associated with the small subunit (SSU) processome and interacts with factors such as Utp2 and Utp14, indicating its role in early small subunit processing (Sardana2013The). It also interacts with middle-stage 40S biogenesis factors, including Enp1, Nob1, Hrr25, and Ltv1, but not with early or late-stage factors, suggesting its involvement in intermediate steps of 40S ribosomal subunit assembly (Sardana2013The). These interactions highlight BUD23's role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly.
