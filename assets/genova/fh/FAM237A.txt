# FAM237A

## Overview
FAM237A is a gene that encodes a protein known as family with sequence similarity 237 member A, which functions as a ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83). This protein is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating energy metabolism and certain behaviors. The mature form of the protein undergoes specific posttranslational modifications, including C-terminal amidation and the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which are essential for its biological activity. These modifications enable FAM237A to bind with high affinity to GPR83, activating the receptor through the Gαq signaling pathway and leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) as a second messenger. The interaction between FAM237A and GPR83 suggests a significant role in brain function and energy regulation, although the precise physiological functions in humans remain to be fully elucidated (Sallee2020A; Li2022FAM237A).

## Structure
FAM237A is a protein primarily expressed in the brain, synthesized as a precursor that undergoes posttranslational modifications to become active. The mature form of FAM237A consists of 80 amino acids, featuring an amidated C-terminus and an intramolecular disulfide bond, which are crucial for its activity as a ligand for the orphan receptor GPR83 (Li2022FAM237A). The protein's three-dimensional structure includes three helical segments stabilized by the disulfide bond and a hydrophobic core formed by conserved residues such as W17, L24, W28, F39, W40, M43, L46, F58, L61, and F65 (Li2022FAM237A). The C-terminal fragment of FAM237A is predicted to extend outside and potentially insert into the ligand-binding pocket of its receptor, with residues H78, G79, and L80 being essential for binding (Li2022FAM237A).

FAM237A undergoes specific posttranslational modifications, including C-terminal amidation and the formation of a disulfide bond, which are necessary for its biological function (Sallee2020A; Li2022FAM237A). These modifications are conserved across FAM237A orthologs from fish to mammals, highlighting their importance in the protein's activity (Li2022FAM237A).

## Function
FAM237A encodes a protein that functions as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83), primarily expressed in the brain. This interaction suggests a role in regulating energy metabolism and certain behaviors (Li2022FAM237A). FAM237A is synthesized as a precursor and undergoes posttranslational modifications, including C-terminal amidation and the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which are crucial for its activity (Li2022FAM237A). The mature protein binds to GPR83 with high affinity, activating the receptor and inducing its internalization, which implies a specific signaling function in human cells (Li2022FAM237A).

FAM237A's role as an endogenous agonist of GPR83 is supported by its ability to activate the receptor via the Gαq signaling pathway, leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) as a second messenger (Sallee2020A). The protein's expression pattern overlaps with GPR83 in the brain, suggesting a significant biological role in this organ (Sallee2020A). The specific function of FAM237A in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its interaction with GPR83 indicates potential involvement in brain function and energy regulation.

## Interactions
FAM237A is a protein that interacts specifically with the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR83. It acts as a ligand for GPR83, binding with high affinity and specificity. This interaction is characterized by a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 70 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity (Li2022FAM237A). The binding of FAM237A to GPR83 is reversible, as demonstrated by competition assays where the addition of a competitor reduces bioluminescence, suggesting that FAM237A can be displaced from the receptor (Li2022FAM237A).

FAM237A activates GPR83 through the Gαq signaling pathway, leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) but not affecting cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels (Sallee2020A). This activation is dependent on specific posttranslational modifications, including C-terminal amidation and disulfide bond formation, which are crucial for its interaction with GPR83 (Sallee2020A). The C-terminal residues H78, G79, and L80 of FAM237A are particularly important for its binding to GPR83, as mutations in these residues significantly reduce binding ability (Li2022FAM237A).

FAM237A's interaction with GPR83 is also supported by its expression pattern, which overlaps with GPR83 in the brain, suggesting a physiological role in GPR83 biology (Sallee2020A).
