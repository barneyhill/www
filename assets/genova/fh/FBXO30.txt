# FBXO30

## Overview
FBXO30 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 30, a member of the F-box protein family characterized by the presence of an F-box domain. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by targeting specific proteins for degradation. F-box protein 30 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway and the modulation of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) levels, which are crucial for neural development (Cheng2019Fbox). Additionally, FBXO30 acts as a tumor suppressor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) for degradation, thereby inhibiting oncogenic pathways (Yuan2023FBXO30). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by factors such as retinoic acid and zinc ion concentration, highlighting its complex role in cellular homeostasis and disease (Yuan2023FBXO30; Cheng2019Fbox).

## Structure
FBXO30 is characterized by the presence of an F-box domain and a zinc finger domain. The F-box domain, located between amino acids 373-409, is essential for its interaction with the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) and is a defining feature of the F-box protein family, which is involved in protein-protein interactions within the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex (Cheng2019Fbox). The zinc finger domain, spanning amino acids 48-109, plays a role in regulating BMP-responsive BRE-luc activity, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Cheng2019Fbox).

FBXO30 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of RARγ, a process crucial for modulating BMP signaling pathways during neural development (Cheng2019Fbox). The protein's activity is influenced by retinoic acid (RA), which decreases FBXO30 protein levels through post-translational regulation, without affecting its mRNA levels (Cheng2019Fbox). This suggests that FBXO30 undergoes post-translational modifications that regulate its stability and function. The specific structural details of FBXO30's tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
FBXO30 encodes an F-box protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, primarily involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of specific target proteins. In healthy human cells, FBXO30 interacts with the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ), facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is crucial for regulating the levels of RARγ, a nuclear receptor involved in various cellular processes, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway (Cheng2019Fbox). FBXO30 acts as a positive regulator of BMP signaling by promoting the degradation of RARγ, which otherwise inhibits BMP pathway activity. This regulation is evidenced by increased BMP-responsive activity and elevated levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5, a key molecule in BMP signaling, upon FBXO30 overexpression (Cheng2019Fbox).

FBXO30 is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis by degrading misfolded or damaged proteins and regulating the turnover of short-lived proteins (Stepaniants2014Genes). This role in protein quality control is crucial for normal cellular function and development, particularly in processes like neural tube development (Cheng2019Fbox).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBXO30 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and neural tube defects (NTDs). In ccRCC, FBXO30 is expressed at significantly lower levels in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This reduced expression is associated with poor patient outcomes, as higher levels of FBXO30 correlate with better overall survival. FBXO30 functions as a tumor suppressor by mediating the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a protein that promotes tumor progression. Its downregulation enhances tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in ccRCC (Yuan2023FBXO30).

In the context of neural development, reduced FBXO30 expression is linked to NTDs. The gene plays a role in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which is crucial for neural tube closure. Dysregulation of FBXO30, particularly in the presence of high retinoic acid levels, leads to decreased BMP signaling activity, contributing to the development of NTDs. This highlights FBXO30's clinical significance in understanding and potentially addressing these defects (Cheng2019Fbox).

## Interactions
FBXO30, an F-box protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts specifically with the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. This interaction is mediated by the F-box domain of FBXO30, which is necessary and sufficient for binding to RARγ. FBXO30 acts as a ubiquitin ligase, promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of RARγ. This interaction is selective, as FBXO30 does not interact with other RAR family members such as RARα and RARβ (Cheng2019Fbox).

In the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FBXO30 functions as a tumor suppressor and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction occurs under normoxic conditions, inhibiting the oncogenic effects of HIF-1α. The interaction between FBXO30 and HIF-1α is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating direct binding (Yuan2023FBXO30). FBXO30's activity is modulated by human ZRT, IRT-like protein 1 (hZIP1), which regulates its expression and that of HIF-1α through zinc ion concentration (Yuan2023FBXO30).
