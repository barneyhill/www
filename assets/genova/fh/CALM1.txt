# CALM1

## Overview
The CALM1 gene encodes calmodulin 1, a highly conserved calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling pathways across eukaryotic cells. Calmodulin 1 is categorized as a calcium-binding protein and is integral to numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and synaptic plasticity. The protein's structure, characterized by EF-hand motifs, allows it to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, facilitating interactions with a wide array of target proteins. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of various physiological functions, such as muscle contraction, metabolism, and neuronal signaling (Villalobo2019Proteins; Jensen2018Human). Mutations in CALM1 have been implicated in severe cardiac arrhythmias, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining cardiac rhythm and overall cellular homeostasis (Crotti2023Clinical; Crotti2019Calmodulin).

## Structure
Calmodulin 1 (CALM1) encodes a calcium-binding messenger protein known as calmodulin, which is highly conserved across species. The primary structure of calmodulin consists of a polypeptide chain with 149 amino acids, although the mature protein has 148 amino acids due to the removal of the initiator methionine (Jensen2018Human). The protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions. These motifs are organized into two lobes, the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, each containing two EF-hand domains (Villalobo2019Proteins; Jensen2018Human).

The secondary structure of calmodulin is predominantly composed of alpha helices, which are crucial for its function in both the apo and calcium-bound states (Jensen2024Calmodulin). The tertiary structure of calmodulin is compact and globular, allowing it to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, which is essential for its role in cellular signaling (Villalobo2019Proteins).

Calmodulin functions as a monomer and does not have a quaternary structure. It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with target proteins (Jensen2024Calmodulin). The protein's ability to bind calcium and interact with various targets is central to its function in cellular processes (Jensen2018Human).

## Function
The CALM1 gene encodes calmodulin 1, a calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling within eukaryotic cells. Calmodulin is involved in regulating a wide array of cellular processes by interacting with numerous target proteins. It is essential for cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, where it regulates the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins (Berchtold2014The). Calmodulin's dynamic localization during the cell cycle, moving from the cytosol to the nucleus and associating with the mitotic spindle, is vital for processes such as chromatin condensation and nuclear membrane lysis (Berchtold2014The).

In neurons, CALM1 is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of calmodulin pools, which is critical for synaptic signal transmission and plasticity. The 4.1 kb CALM1 transcript is particularly associated with neurite extension and morphology, suggesting a role in long-term cellular events (Toutenhoofd2000The). Calmodulin is also active in the centrosomal region during mitosis, crucial for progression through specific cell cycle points (LU1993Regulation). Overall, CALM1's regulation of calmodulin is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CALM1 gene are associated with several life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT). These conditions are characterized by abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest, particularly in young individuals (Crotti2023Clinical; Crotti2019Calmodulin). Specific mutations, such as D130G and F142L, have been linked to severe forms of LQTS, which involve prolonged QT intervals and recurrent cardiac arrests (Rocchetti2017Elucidating; Crotti2013Calmodulin). These mutations impair calcium binding, affecting the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channels, which is crucial for normal cardiac repolarization (Rocchetti2017Elucidating; Crotti2013Calmodulin).

Calmodulinopathies, caused by CALM1 mutations, also include idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and sudden unexplained death (SUD) in young individuals (Marsman2014A; Crotti2019Calmodulin). These mutations often result in a high incidence of arrhythmic events triggered by adrenergic stimuli, with many patients requiring interventions such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) (Crotti2023Clinical; Crotti2019Calmodulin). The clinical presentation can vary widely, from severe cardiac events to asymptomatic cases, complicating phenotype prediction based solely on genotype (Crotti2023Clinical).

## Interactions
CALM1, encoding the protein calmodulin, is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its role in calcium signaling. Calmodulin interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, enhancing its tyrosine kinase activity. This interaction occurs both in the presence and absence of calcium, with apo-calmodulin (calmodulin without calcium) being particularly effective in activating Src through a calcium-independent mechanism. The presence of multiple calmodulin-binding sites on Src, including atypical IQ-like motifs, facilitates this interaction (Stateva2015Ca2+Calmodulin).

In the context of oncogenesis, calmodulin interacts with the MYC oncogene. The brain acid-soluble protein 1 (BASP1) competes with MYC for binding to calmodulin, affecting MYC's stability and transcriptional regulation. BASP1 acts as a tumor suppressor by disrupting the MYC:calmodulin interaction, leading to decreased MYC protein stability. Overexpression of calmodulin can counteract the inhibitory effects of BASP1 on MYC, highlighting a complex interplay between these proteins (Hartl2020The).

Calmodulin also plays a role in glioblastoma cell invasion by interacting with proteins involved in invadopodia formation, such as Src and NHE1. These interactions are essential for the activation of invadopodia-associated proteins, facilitating extracellular matrix degradation and promoting cell invasion (Li2018The).
