# MPZL3

## Overview
The MPZL3 gene encodes the myelin protein zero like 3, a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including epidermal differentiation and mitochondrial function. This protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like V-type domain, which is involved in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins, such as ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) and HER3, influencing reactive oxygen species production and cell proliferation (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially; Stern2022Met–HER3). MPZL3 is integral to lipid metabolism and energy expenditure, impacting sebaceous gland function and hair follicle cycling (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially). Mutations in MPZL3 have been linked to skin disorders and metabolic conditions, and its expression levels are associated with cancer prognosis, particularly in breast cancer (Racz2009The; Huang2022A). The protein's functions are conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in skin physiology and cellular signaling pathways (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially).

## Structure
The MPZL3 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a signal peptide at the amino terminus, an immunoglobulin-like V-type domain, and a transmembrane domain (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially). The Ig-like V-type domain is extracellular and contains conserved cysteines that form a disulfide bond, stabilizing the domain structure (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially; Cao2007Mutation). The protein also has a low complexity domain at the carboxyl terminus (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially).

A notable mutation in the MPZL3 protein is the Arg100-to-Gln substitution, which occurs at a conserved residue within the Ig-like domain and affects the protein's function (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially; Cao2007Mutation). This mutation is linked to various physiological abnormalities, including skin and hair issues in mice (Cao2007Mutation).

The MPZL3 protein is involved in cell adhesion, similar to other proteins with Ig-like domains, and interacts with mitochondrial proteins, playing a role in mitochondrial localization and function (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially). The protein's structure and function are conserved across vertebrate species, including humans and mice (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially).

## Function
MPZL3 is a critical regulator of epidermal differentiation and mitochondrial function in healthy human cells. It is essential for the induction of differentiation genes in human epidermal tissue, acting as both a necessary and sufficient factor for this process. MPZL3 influences the expression of numerous genes, with a significant number related to epidermal differentiation (Bhaduri2015Network). The protein is localized predominantly in mitochondria, where it interacts with ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, a crucial factor for epidermal differentiation (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially; Bhaduri2015Network).

MPZL3's role extends to lipid metabolism and energy expenditure, impacting processes such as sebaceous gland function and hair follicle cycling. It is involved in maintaining epidermal permeability and sebaceous gland function, with its absence leading to reduced adipose tissue and altered hair follicle cycling (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially). The protein's activity is regulated by transcription factors like KLF4, p63, ZNF750, and RCOR1, which bind upstream of the MPZL3 transcription start site, highlighting its integration into broader regulatory networks (Bhaduri2015Network). MPZL3's function is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in skin physiology (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MPZL3 gene have been implicated in various skin disorders and other health conditions. In mice, a mutation in the Mpzl3 gene leads to severe skin abnormalities and progressive hair loss, suggesting that similar mutations in humans could result in immune-mediated hereditary disorders with hair loss (Racz2009The). MPZL3 is also involved in sebaceous gland functions and sebum production, with implications for conditions like acne vulgaris, cicatricial alopecia, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and sebaceous gland tumors (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially). 

In cancer research, MPZL3 has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker, particularly in breast cancer. High expression of MPZL3 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer, and influences drug sensitivity, making certain cancer cells less responsive to specific treatments (Huang2022A). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and may affect the response to immunotherapy in breast cancer (Huang2022A). 

MPZL3's role in obesity is also noted, as it is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its significance in metabolic regulation (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially).

## Interactions
MPZL3 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) within the mitochondria, a partnership essential for promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is necessary for epidermal differentiation. This interaction is disrupted by mutations such as R99Q, which affect MPZL3's ability to bind FDXR and subsequently impair its function (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially; Bhaduri2015Network).

In MET-amplified cancer cells, MPZL3 interacts with HER3, a member of the EGFR family, playing a role in cell proliferation. This interaction is mediated by the extracellular Ig-like domain of MPZL3 and is influenced by Met kinase activity. The interaction between MPZL3 and HER3 is significant for oncogenic proliferation, and MPZL3 can partially rescue proliferation defects caused by HER3 knockdown (Stern2022Met–HER3).

MPZL3 also interacts with non-mitochondrial proteins such as MPZL2 and FLOT2, and is involved in lipid transport processes through its interaction with apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) (Wikramanayake2021Mitochondrially). These interactions suggest that MPZL3 has roles beyond mitochondrial functions, potentially impacting lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways.
