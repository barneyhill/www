# CFHR1

## Overview
The CFHR1 gene encodes the protein complement factor H-related 1 (CFHR1), which is a crucial regulator of the complement system, particularly the alternative pathway. CFHR1 is categorized as a complement regulatory protein and is composed of five short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which are essential for its function in plasma. The protein plays a significant role in inhibiting the C5 convertase, thereby preventing excessive inflammation and the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Heinen2009Factor). CFHR1's ability to bind to complement components such as C3b, C3d, and C5, as well as its interaction with heparin and host cells, allows it to modulate complement activity and maintain immune homeostasis (Heinen2009Factor). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where mutations or deletions can lead to dysregulation of the complement system (SánchezCorral2018SelfDamage; Zipfel2007Deletion).

## Structure
The CFHR1 protein is composed of five short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, also known as complement control protein modules or sushi domains, each containing approximately 60 amino acid residues (Heinen2009Factor; Barnum2018Factor). The primary structure of CFHR1 includes two N-glycosylation sites at positions 126 and 194, contributing to its molecular weight of 37-42 kDa in its glycosylated form (Hannan2016Mapping). 

The secondary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the X-ray crystal structure of the first two SCR domains reveals a head-to-tail dimer formation, stabilized by key residues such as Tyr34, Ser36, and Tyr39 (Goicoechea2013Dimerization). The tertiary structure involves the mapping of sequence variations onto the molecular surface, confirming the conservation of the dimerization interface among CFHR1, CFHR2, and CFHR5 (Goicoechea2013Dimerization).

In terms of quaternary structure, CFHR1 forms homodimers and heterodimers with CFHR2 and CFHR5, facilitated by conserved N-terminal domains (Skerka2020Factor; Goicoechea2013Dimerization). CFHR1 exists in two isoforms, acidic (CFHR1*A) and basic (CFHR1*B), differing in specific amino acids within the SCR3 domain (Skerka2020Factor; AbarrateguiGarrido2009Characterization). These structural features are crucial for CFHR1's role in complement regulation.

## Function
The CFHR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the complement system, particularly the alternative pathway. CFHR1 is composed of five short consensus repeat (SCR) domains and functions primarily in the plasma. It is involved in inhibiting the C5 convertase, which prevents the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b, thereby reducing inflammation and the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Heinen2009Factor). This regulation is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and protecting host cells from complement-mediated damage (Heinen2009Factor).

CFHR1 binds to complement components such as C3b, C3d, and C5, as well as heparin and host cells, allowing it to modulate complement activity by discriminating between self and foreign surfaces (Heinen2009Factor). It competes with complement factor H (CFH) for binding sites, potentially replacing CFH at certain sites to modulate complement activity (Heinen2009Factor). CFHR1 is also associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL), suggesting a role in lipid metabolism (Skerka2013Complement). Deficiency in CFHR1 is linked to diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Heinen2009Factor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CFHR1 gene are associated with several diseases due to its role in complement system regulation. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is strongly linked to the deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3, which occurs due to nonallelic homologous recombination. This deletion is found in a significant proportion of aHUS patients and affects complement activation regulation, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Zipfel2007Deletion). The CFHR1*B allele is also associated with an increased risk of aHUS (SánchezCorral2018SelfDamage; Cserhalmi2019Regulation).

In contrast, the ΔCFHR3-CFHR1 variant is protective against age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) but predisposes individuals to aHUS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) due to its association with anti-FH autoantibodies (SánchezCorral2018SelfDamage; Cserhalmi2019Regulation). 

C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is linked to mutations in CFHR1 that lead to abnormal oligomerization of the FHR1 protein, resulting in excessive competition with factor H for binding to complement components. This competition impairs complement regulation, contributing to the disease (Tortajada2013C3). Hybrid genes involving CFHR1, such as CFH::CFHR1, are also associated with aHUS, leading to altered protein interactions and complement deregulation (SánchezCorral2018SelfDamage; Valoti2015A).

## Interactions
CFHR1 interacts with several components of the complement system, playing a role in its regulation. It competes with complement factor H (CFH) for binding to C3b, a key component of the complement system, by utilizing its C-terminal domains, which are almost identical to those of CFH (Heinen2009Factor; Hannan2016Mapping). CFHR1 also binds to C3d, sharing a binding interface with CFH, and requires dimerization for effective binding to C3b and C3d (Hannan2016Mapping).

CFHR1 inhibits the C5 convertase of the alternative complement pathway by binding to C5 and its activation product C5b6, primarily through its N-terminal region (Heinen2009Factor). This interaction is distinct from CFH, which does not bind to C5 (Heinen2009Factor).

CFHR1 forms complexes with other CFHR proteins, such as FHR2 and FHR5, through its N-terminal domains, which facilitate the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes (Skerka2013Complement; Tortajada2013C3). These interactions are crucial for its regulatory functions in the complement system, influencing processes like complement activation and inflammation (Heinen2009Factor).
