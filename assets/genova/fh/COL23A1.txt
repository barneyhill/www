# COL23A1

## Overview
The COL23A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXIII alpha 1 chain, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and migration. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and three extracellular collagenous domains, which facilitate its function as a ligand for integrin α2β1 (Chopra2024Identification). Expressed in various tissues such as the skin, brain, lung, and kidney, collagen type XXIII alpha 1 chain is involved in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular signaling, crucial for processes like wound healing and tissue remodeling (Monavarfeshani2017Region; Chopra2024Identification). The protein's expression is notably selective in certain neural regions, suggesting a role in neural circuit formation (Monavarfeshani2017Region). Additionally, alterations in COL23A1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including various cancers and skin conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Banyard2007Collagen; Xu2017The).

## Structure


## Function
COL23A1 encodes the collagen type XXIII alpha 1 chain, a type II transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and migration. It is characterized by an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and three extracellular collagenous domains. This protein is a ligand for integrin α2β1 and is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, brain, lung, cornea, tendon, and kidney (Chopra2024Identification). In its full-length form, COL23A1 is located in the lipid rafts of the cell membrane, but it can also be cleaved by proteases like furin, resulting in a secreted ectodomain. The shedding of COL23A1 is influenced by tissue type and cholesterol content in the plasma membrane (Chopra2024Identification).

In the brain, COL23A1 is selectively expressed by excitatory neurons in the mitral/tufted cell layer of the accessory olfactory bulb and by cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, suggesting a role in neural circuit formation and function (Monavarfeshani2017Region). The protein's expression patterns indicate its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and facilitating cellular signaling processes, which are crucial for wound healing and tissue remodeling (Chopra2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COL23A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and skin conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), elevated expression of COL23A1 is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Knockdown of COL23A1 in ccRCC cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion, suggesting its role as an oncogene in this cancer type (Xu2017The).

In prostate cancer, COL23A1 expression is significantly increased, especially in cases with distant metastases. High levels of COL23A1 are linked to a higher risk of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure and recurrence, indicating its potential as a biomarker for prostate cancer progression (Banyard2007Collagen). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), COL23A1 serves as a biomarker for recurrence and metastasis, with its expression correlating with shorter recurrence-free survival (Spivey2010Collagen).

COL23A1 is also associated with eczema herpeticum (EH), a severe skin infection in patients with atopic dermatitis. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in COL23A1, rs2973744, leads to increased susceptibility to herpes simplex virus infections by elevating COL23A1 expression, which dampens the immune response in keratinocytes (Chopra2024Identification).
