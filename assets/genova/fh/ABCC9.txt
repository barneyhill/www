# ABCC9

## Overview
The ABCC9 gene encodes the ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 9 (SUR2), a regulatory protein that is integral to the function of ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channels. These channels are crucial for linking cellular metabolism to membrane potential, primarily in cardiac and smooth muscle cells, where they regulate membrane excitability and protect cells during metabolic stress (Bryan2006ABCC8; Nelson2015ABCC9SUR2). The SUR2 protein, a transmembrane protein, forms part of a hetero-octameric complex with Kir6.x subunits, modulating the channel's activity in response to ATP and ADP levels (McClenaghan2018Cantu). The gene produces two major isoforms, SUR2A and SUR2B, through alternative splicing, which have distinct roles in various tissues, including the heart and brain (Tinker2018ATP‐Sensitive). Mutations in ABCC9 are associated with several clinical conditions, including Cantú syndrome and cardiac channelopathies, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular health and disease (van2012Cantú; Hu2014ABCC9).

## Structure
The ABCC9 gene encodes the SUR2 protein, a regulatory subunit of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. These channels are hetero-octamers composed of four pore-forming Kir6.x subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SURx) subunits, including SUR2, which has two main splice variants: SUR2A and SUR2B (McClenaghan2018Cantu). The primary structure of SUR2 includes nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and transmembrane domains (TMDs), which are crucial for its function (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9). 

The secondary structure of SUR2 features specific amino acid sequences that form alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, particularly in the C-terminal region, which is important for channel trafficking and ATPase activity (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9). 

In terms of quaternary structure, SUR2 forms a complex with Kir6.x subunits, which is essential for the functional KATP channel (Smeland2019ABCC9related). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the channel's regulatory properties (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9). The structural integrity of the channel is maintained despite certain mutations, although these can lead to altered ATP-induced gating (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9).

## Function
The ABCC9 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2), a regulatory subunit of ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channels. These channels are crucial for linking cellular metabolism to membrane potential by responding to changes in ATP/ADP levels. In healthy human cells, K_ATP channels are primarily active in cardiac and smooth muscle cells, where they help regulate membrane excitability and protect cells during metabolic stress (Bryan2006ABCC8; Nelson2015ABCC9SUR2).

The K_ATP channels are hetero-octamers composed of four Kir6.x subunits forming the channel pore and four SUR subunits, including SUR2, which modulate the channel's activity. SUR2 interacts with ATP and ADP, and its activity is influenced by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation (Nelson2015ABCC9SUR2). The ABCC9 gene produces two major isoforms, SUR2A and SUR2B, through alternative splicing, which have distinct expression patterns and functions in various tissues, including the heart and brain (Bryan2006ABCC8; Tinker2018ATP‐Sensitive).

In the heart, ABCC9 is essential for the transition from fetal glycolytic metabolism to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in newborns, playing a critical role in energy regulation and cardiac function (Fahrenbach2014Abcc9is). The gene's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions highlights its importance in cardiovascular health (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCC9 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Cantú syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations in ABCC9, specifically affecting the Arg1154 residue in exon 27. This syndrome is characterized by structural cardiac anomalies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and other skeletal and skin abnormalities (van2012Cantú; Jang2016Three). 

ABCC9 mutations are also linked to cardiac channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome. The Val734Ile mutation in exon 17 is associated with these conditions, leading to altered cardiac electrical activity and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (Hu2014ABCC9). 

In the context of myocardial infarction, the Val734Ile variant is a significant risk factor for precocious myocardial infarction, with carriers having a higher risk compared to non-carriers (Minoretti2006A). 

ABCC9 is also implicated in hippocampal sclerosis of aging, with specific single nucleotide variants like rs704178 showing significant associations with this pathology (Nelson2014ABCC9). 

Loss-of-function mutations in ABCC9 can lead to Abcc9-related intellectual disability myopathy syndrome, characterized by muscle weakness, intellectual disability, and cardiac dysfunction (Smeland2019ABCC9related).

## Interactions
The ABCC9 gene encodes the SUR2A protein, which is a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channel complex. This complex includes the Kir6.2 potassium channel, forming a heteromultimeric structure that is sensitive to ATP. The interaction between SUR2A and Kir6.2 is crucial for the channel's function, as it allows the channel to respond to cellular energetic states by modulating membrane excitability (Bienengraeber2004ABCC9; Park2008Interaction).

SUR2A contains nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) that interact with each other, forming heterodomain complexes. This interaction is essential for the catalytic activity of the SUR2A protein, as it enhances ATPase activity, which is necessary for the channel's function (Park2008Interaction). The NBD1 and NBD2 domains exhibit a 'head to tail' orientation, creating a favorable environment for ATP hydrolysis (Park2008Interaction).

Mutations in the ABCC9 gene, such as V734I in NBD1 and A1513T in NBD2, can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired channel function and associated cardiac diseases (Park2010Quaternary; Hu2014ABCC9). These mutations affect the structural integrity and metabolic sensing properties of the K_ATP channel complex (Hu2014ABCC9).
