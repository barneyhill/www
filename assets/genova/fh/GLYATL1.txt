# GLYATL1

## Overview
The GLYATL1 gene encodes the enzyme glycine-N-acyltransferase like 1, which is a member of the glycine-N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the detoxification processes within the body, facilitating the conjugation of acyl groups to amino acids, such as glutamine, to form more soluble compounds that can be excreted. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Glycine_acyl_tr domain, which is indicative of its role as an aralkyl acyl-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase. It is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, with significant expression in the liver and kidney, underscoring its importance in metabolic homeostasis and detoxification pathways (Zhang2007Molecular; Matsuo2012Designation; Eich2019Characterization). The expression and activity of GLYATL1 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including its potential role as a biomarker in certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Eich2019Characterization; Guan2020The).

## Structure
The GLYATL1 gene encodes a protein with an open reading frame of 909 nucleotides, resulting in a polypeptide of 302 amino acids (Zhang2007Molecular). The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 35.1 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.44 (Zhang2007Molecular). It contains a single Glycine_acyl_tr domain, characteristic of the GLYAT family, indicating its role as an aralkyl acyl-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase (Zhang2007Molecular). This domain suggests that GLYATL1 is a novel member of the GLYAT family, involved in the conjugation of acyl groups to glycine (Zhang2007Molecular).

The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with strong localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic areas, displaying a punctuated appearance in the cytoplasm (Zhang2007Molecular). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of GLYATL1 are not provided, the presence of the Glycine_acyl_tr domain implies a conserved structure within the GLYAT family (Zhang2007Molecular). The protein's enzymatic activity includes catalyzing the glutamine-N-acyltransfer reaction with phenylacetyl-CoA, functioning as an arylacetyl transferase (Matsuo2012Designation).

## Function
The GLYATL1 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a significant role in the detoxification of endogenous and xenobiotic acyl-CoA compounds. This enzyme is a member of the glycine-N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) family and is involved in the conjugation of acyl groups to amino acids, primarily glutamine, forming compounds such as phenylacetylglutamine and indoleacetylglutamine (Matsuo2012Designation; Badenhorst2013Glycine). The GLYATL1 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it catalyzes arylacetyl transfer reactions, facilitating the excretion of acyl groups and maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Zhang2007Molecular; Guan2020The).

In healthy human cells, GLYATL1 is highly expressed in the liver and kidney, with lower expression levels in the pancreas, testis, ovary, and stomach, indicating its involvement in detoxification processes in these tissues (Eich2019Characterization). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the conjugation of carboxylic acids with amino acids, enhancing their solubility and excretion, which is an essential part of the body's detoxification pathway (Matsuo2012Designation). The evolutionary conservation of GLYATL1 across species underscores its functional importance in cellular metabolism (Zhang2007Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GLYATL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, GLYATL1 is overexpressed, particularly in lower-grade tumors, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis (Eich2019Characterization). This overexpression is unique to GLYATL1 among glycine N-acyltransferases, as other related genes do not show similar patterns (Eich2019Characterization).

In contrast, GLYATL1 expression is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its low expression is associated with poor survival rates. This suggests that GLYATL1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in HCC, with decreased expression linked to poor overall survival, particularly in early-stage and poorly differentiated tumors (Guan2020The). The downregulation in HCC is partly attributed to higher promoter methylation levels, which may suppress its expression (Guan2020The).

In breast cancer, lower GLYATL1 expression is associated with shorter relapse-free survival in estrogen-receptor-positive cases and is linked to positive lymph node status, a critical factor in prognosis (Siddig2023Comparing). These findings indicate that GLYATL1 expression alterations may have clinical significance in terms of tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis across different cancer types.
