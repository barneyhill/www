# TMEM106C

## Overview
TMEM106C is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 106C, which is part of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular processes that involve membrane-spanning domains, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including signaling and transport. TMEM106C has been implicated in the progression of several diseases, most notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it acts as an oncogene by promoting cell growth, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis (Luo2020Transmembrane). The expression of TMEM106C is regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC00238, which serves as a tumor suppressor by reducing TMEM106C levels and thereby decreasing the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells (Jiang2021LINC00238). Additionally, TMEM106C has been associated with other conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Jiang2021LINC00238).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM106C is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its expression is significantly elevated in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels of TMEM106C are associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis in patients. Overexpression of TMEM106C in HCC cells enhances cell growth, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene in HCC. Conversely, knockdown of TMEM106C suppresses these oncogenic behaviors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Luo2020Transmembrane).

TMEM106C expression is negatively regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC00238, which acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Overexpression of LINC00238 reduces TMEM106C levels, leading to decreased proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. This interaction highlights the significance of TMEM106C in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker (Jiang2021LINC00238).

TMEM106C is also associated with other conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis, although its role in these diseases is less well-defined. The gene's involvement in various diseases underscores its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Jiang2021LINC00238).
