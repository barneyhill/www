# BCAN

## Overview
The BCAN gene encodes brevican, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Brevican is a significant component of the extracellular matrix, particularly within perineuronal nets that envelop parvalbumin-positive interneurons. As a proteoglycan, brevican is involved in synaptic plasticity and neural circuit regulation, influencing the distribution and function of AMPA receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is characterized by its core protein structure, which includes glycosaminoglycan chains and domains such as C-type lectin and EGF-like domains, facilitating interactions with other cellular components (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). Brevican's expression is modulated by neural activity, impacting synaptic modifications and cognitive functions like memory (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). Additionally, brevican exists in multiple isoforms, including secreted and GPI-anchored variants, each playing distinct roles in synaptic maturation and function (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent).

## Structure
Brevican (BCAN) is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan primarily found in the central nervous system. Its primary structure includes a core protein with glycosaminoglycan chains, a signal peptide, and a C-terminal domain (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). The secondary and tertiary structures of brevican involve a C-type lectin domain and an EGF-like domain, which are common in proteins that interact with other cellular components (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). 

Brevican undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is significant for its function and interaction with other molecules. The fully glycosylated form of brevican contains chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, as well as N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides (von2021Targeting). There are splice variant isoforms of brevican, such as BCAN1, which is secreted, and BCAN2, which is GPI-anchored. These isoforms have distinct roles in the maturation of excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). The deglycosylated isoform, dg-Bcan, is specifically expressed in glioblastoma tissues and lacks these glycosylations, exposing specific epitopes that are masked in the glycosylated form (von2021Targeting).

## Function
The BCAN gene encodes brevican, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is a key component of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in the central nervous system. Brevican plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and the regulation of neural circuits by influencing the localization and levels of AMPA receptors, particularly GluA1 subunits, at excitatory synapses on PV+ cells (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). It also interacts with voltage-gated potassium channels, such as Kv1.1 and Kv3.1b, affecting the electrophysiological properties of these interneurons, including action potential waveform and frequency (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent).

Brevican expression is dynamically regulated by neural activity, with increased activity leading to decreased brevican levels, which in turn affects synaptic modifications in PV+ interneurons (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). This regulation is crucial for the maturation and function of excitatory synapses, contributing to cognitive functions such as spatial working memory and short-term memory (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). Brevican's role in maintaining excitatory synaptic density and influencing interneuron excitability underscores its importance in the adaptability and plasticity of neural circuits (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Brevican (BCAN) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and synaptic regulation. In the cochlea, brevican forms basket-like ECM complexes with HAPLN1 and HAPLN4, which are essential for the structural integrity of synaptic environments around inner hair cells (IHCs) (Sonntag2018Synaptic). These interactions help maintain the spatial coupling of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, such as the alignment of presynaptic Ca v 1.3 channels and postsynaptic density proteins like PSD-95, which is vital for effective synaptic transmission (Sonntag2018Synaptic).

In the central nervous system, brevican interacts with AMPA receptor subunits, including GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4, influencing synaptic plasticity and receptor trafficking (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent; Sonntag2018Synaptic). It also forms complexes with voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically Kv1.1 and Kv3.1b, affecting the electrophysiological properties of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent). These interactions are crucial for the modulation of synaptic inputs and the intrinsic properties of PV+ cells, impacting their role in neural network stability and memory processes (Favuzzi2017Activity-Dependent).
