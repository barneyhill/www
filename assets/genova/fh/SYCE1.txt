# SYCE1

## Overview
SYCE1 is a gene that encodes the synaptonemal complex central element protein 1, a crucial component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) involved in meiosis. The protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the SC, which is essential for the proper pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes. SYCE1, along with other central element proteins such as SYCE2, SYCE3, and SIX6OS1, contributes to the formation of the tripartite structure of the SC by facilitating the assembly of SYCP1 molecules into a zipper-like configuration (Dunne2019Molecular; Llano2023Synaptonemal). The structural integrity and function of SYCE1 are vital for successful meiosis and fertility, as mutations in this gene have been linked to reproductive disorders such as non-obstructive azoospermia and primary ovarian insufficiency (MaorSagie2015Deleterious; HernándezLópez2020Familial).

## Structure
The SYCE1 protein is characterized by an α-helical antiparallel homodimer structure, forming a coiled-coil configuration. Its N-terminal region, comprising amino acids 25-179, provides a stable structural core that is crucial for dimerization and structural stability (Dunne2019Molecular; SánchezSáez2020Meiotic). This core region is largely α-helical, with a helical content of 65% (Dunne2019Molecular). The C-terminal region, extending from amino acids 177-305, is more flexible and does not self-associate, contributing to the overall length of the protein, which is at least 50 nm (Dunne2019Molecular).

SYCE1 has a unique curved rod-like shape, possibly due to a hinge or interrupted coiled-coil segments, which may allow it to stabilize short stretches of synapsis by providing vertical or transverse links between SYCP1 molecules (Dunne2019Molecular). The protein interacts with other synaptonemal complex proteins such as SYCE3 and SIX6OS1, which are essential for its function in meiotic chromosome synapsis (SánchezSáez2020Meiotic). Mutations in SYCE1, particularly in the C-terminal region, have been linked to infertility, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity (Dunne2019Molecular).

## Function
The human gene SYCE1 encodes a protein that is a critical component of the synaptonemal complex (SC), which is essential for meiosis. SYCE1 is part of the central element of the SC, along with other proteins such as SYCE3, SIX6OS1, SYCE2, and TEX12. These proteins support the assembly of SYCP1 molecules, which form a zipper-like structure that binds homologous chromosomes together (Dunne2019Molecular). SYCE1 acts as a synapsis initiation factor, stabilizing initial synapsis by providing vertical and transverse links between SYCP1 molecules, which is crucial for the formation of the SC's tripartite structure (Dunne2019Molecular). 

In healthy cells, SYCE1 plays a critical role in the formation and function of the synaptonemal complex, ensuring successful meiosis and subsequent fertility (MaorSagie2015Deleterious). The SC facilitates the pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, processes vital for genetic diversity and stability (Llano2023Synaptonemal). SYCE1's interactions with other central element proteins are essential for maintaining the SC's structural integrity, which is necessary for proper chromosome segregation and fertility (Llano2023Synaptonemal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYCE1 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders, primarily affecting fertility. In males, SYCE1 mutations can lead to non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen. This is often due to meiotic arrest, where spermatogenesis is halted during meiosis, resulting in infertility (MaorSagie2015Deleterious; Tang2022Identification). Specific mutations, such as the homozygous frameshift variant c.689_690del, have been identified in patients with NOA, indicating a disruption in the normal meiotic process (Tang2022Identification).

In females, mutations in SYCE1 are linked to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition where ovarian activity ceases prematurely, leading to infertility. The c.613C˃T mutation in SYCE1 has been associated with defective meiosis, resulting in infertility in both male and female patients who are homozygous for the mutation (HernándezLópez2020Familial). Studies using humanized mouse models have shown that these mutations cause early meiotic arrest and severely affect homologous synapsis, leading to infertility (HernándezLópez2020Familial).

These findings highlight the critical role of SYCE1 in meiosis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in infertility (Pal2023Novel).

## Interactions
SYCE1 is a central element protein of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and interacts with several other proteins crucial for its assembly and function. SYCE1 interacts with SYCE3, which recruits SYCE1 to the filamentous structures formed by SYCP1, facilitating the assembly of the transverse-filament-central-element junction complex (HernándezHernández2016The). This interaction is essential for the stabilization of the synaptonemal complex, as SYCE3 acts as a molecular adapter, binding SYCE1 and other central element proteins like SIX6OS1 and SYCE2-TEX12, contributing to the structural maturation of the SC (Crichton2023Structural).

The interactions between SYCE1 and SYCE2 are also significant, as they are necessary for the proper binding of SYCP1 to the chromosome axes, which is crucial for synapsis initiation and extension (BolcunFilas2007SYCE2). SYCE1, along with SYCE2 and TEX12, localizes between the bilayered structures formed by SYCP1 and SYCE3, supporting vertical stability within the SC (HernándezHernández2016The). These protein-protein interactions are vital for the assembly and function of the synaptonemal complex, ensuring proper meiotic progression and fertility.
