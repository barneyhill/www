# TMF1

## Overview
TMF1, or TATA element modulatory factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus. The TMF1 protein is categorized as a golgin, a type of coiled-coil protein involved in vesicle tethering and Golgi organization. It plays a crucial role in cellular processes, particularly in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it facilitates the degradation of the transcription factor Stat3, thereby influencing cell growth and apoptosis. TMF1's interactions with Rab6 and its involvement in vesicle trafficking underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Additionally, TMF1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and reproductive health, where its expression levels and functional integrity are critical for normal cellular and organismal outcomes (Perry2004TMFARA160; Elkis2013Testosterone; FridmannSirkis2004TMF).

## Structure
The TMF1 protein, also known as TATA element modulatory factor 1, is a large protein composed of 1093 amino acid residues. It is predominantly structured with coiled-coil regions, which are characteristic of its role as a golgin associated with the Golgi apparatus (FridmannSirkis2004TMF). The protein features a significant coiled-coil domain flanked by shorter non-coil regions, with an additional short coiled-coil segment at the C-terminus (FridmannSirkis2004TMF). This structural arrangement is similar to the yeast protein Sgm1, particularly in the C-terminal region that binds to Rab6, a mammalian homologue of Ypt6 (FridmannSirkis2004TMF).

TMF1 is known to bind all three isoforms of Rab6, with a preference for the GTP-bound form, although this preference is modest and variable (FridmannSirkis2004TMF). The protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus and is excluded from the nucleus, even when overexpressed, indicating its specific Golgi localization (FridmannSirkis2004TMF). The study of TMF1 also involved expressing a His-tagged fragment in bacteria, which included the C-terminal 310 residues similar to Sgm1, to test its binding capabilities (FridmannSirkis2004TMF).

## Function
TMF1, also known as TATA element modulatory factor 1, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cellular processes through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. TMF1 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasm, where it facilitates the degradation of the transcription factor Stat3, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. This degradation process is mediated by the BC-box motif within TMF1, which is essential for its interaction with elongin C, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction directs Stat3 to proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Perry2004TMFARA160).

TMF1's activity is particularly noted under conditions of serum deprivation, where it associates with ubiquitinated proteins, highlighting its role in targeting proteins for degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Perry2004TMFARA160). The protein's function as a modulator of cell growth is underscored by its reduced levels in aggressive malignant brain tumors, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Perry2004TMFARA160). Through these molecular activities, TMF1 influences critical cellular processes, impacting organismal outcomes such as cell proliferation and survival.

## Clinical Significance
TMF1, also known as TMF/ARA160, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of cancer, TMF/ARA160 is downregulated in malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic meningiomas. This downregulation is associated with increased expression and activation of Stat3, a growth-promoting factor, suggesting that TMF/ARA160 may act as a tumor suppressor by facilitating the degradation of Stat3 (Perry2004TMFARA160). The reduced levels of TMF/ARA160 in these tumors indicate its potential role in tumor progression and aggressiveness (Perry2004TMFARA160).

In the realm of reproductive health, TMF/ARA160 is crucial for normal spermatogenesis and epididymal function. TMF/ARA160 knockout mice exhibit significant reproductive abnormalities, including testosterone deficiency, Leydig cell hyperplasia, and defects in spermatid development. These conditions lead to sterility, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining normal testosterone levels and preventing apoptosis in the epididymis (Elkis2013Testosterone). The absence of TMF/ARA160 disrupts the spatial orientation of the Golgi apparatus during sperm development, further contributing to male infertility (Elkis2015TMFARA160).

## Interactions
TMF1, also known as TATA element modulatory factor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. TMF1 is a golgin, a type of coiled-coil protein associated with the Golgi apparatus, and it binds to Rab6, a GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking. TMF1 can bind to all three known isoforms of Rab6, with a preference for the GTP-bound form, indicating its role in Golgi apparatus organization and vesicle tethering (FridmannSirkis2004TMF).

TMF1 also participates in capturing intra-Golgi vesicles, a process facilitated by its N-terminal and central coiled-coil regions. The N-terminal region contains a motif necessary for vesicle capture, which is distinct from other golgins that primarily use their N-terminal regions for this function (Wong2017The).

In addition to its role in the Golgi, TMF1 has been identified in various nuclear roles. It was found to bind a HIV1 TATA box DNA oligonucleotide and was identified as a substrate for the FER nuclear tyrosine kinase. TMF1 was also re-isolated as a binding partner for hSNF2, a component of a chromatin remodeling complex, although its primary function is considered to be in the Golgi (FridmannSirkis2004TMF).
