# ALDH3A1

## Overview
The ALDH3A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A1, a crucial component of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, which are reactive compounds that can cause cellular damage. ALDH3A1 is particularly significant in ocular health, where it serves as a major soluble protein in the cornea, contributing to UV protection and maintaining transparency. The enzyme's role extends beyond metabolism, as it also exhibits chaperone-like activity, preventing protein aggregation and supporting cellular stress responses. ALDH3A1's expression is notably high in corneal tissues, where it plays a protective role against oxidative stress and contributes to cellular homeostasis. Additionally, its involvement in various cancers and chemoresistance highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Black2012Molecular; Holmes2011Comparative; Voulgaridou2023Identification).

## Structure
The human ALDH3A1 protein is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family, primarily involved in aldehyde metabolism. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, with key residues such as Asn114, Glu209, Cys243, and Glu333 conserved across related sequences, essential for catalysis (Holmes2011Comparative). The secondary structure of ALDH3A1 includes α-helices and β-sheets, with specific residues and structural motifs identified, contributing to its stability and function (Holmes2011Comparative). 

The tertiary structure of ALDH3A1 features three major domains: the catalytic domain, the NAD binding domain, and an oligomerisation domain, which are crucial for forming dimers of the active enzyme (Holmes2011Comparative). This structure is highly conserved among vertebrates, indicating its evolutionary significance (Holmes2011Comparative). 

ALDH3A1 is a major soluble 'crystallin-like' protein in the cornea, acting as a UV-filtering agent, and is primarily located in the cytosol, with low probability regions for transmembrane sequences (Holmes2011Comparative). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The human gene ALDH3A1 encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1, which plays a crucial role in cellular protection against oxidative stress, particularly in the cornea. This enzyme is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation. ALDH3A1 catalyzes the oxidation of these aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids, thereby preventing cytotoxicity and maintaining cellular homeostasis (PAPPA2003Human; Black2012Molecular).

ALDH3A1 is highly expressed in corneal tissues, where it constitutes a significant portion of the total water-soluble protein. It is involved in maintaining cell viability by metabolizing 4-HNE and its glutathione conjugate, preventing 4-HNE-protein adduct formation, and preserving proteasome function (Black2012Molecular). The enzyme also plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and survival, particularly in human corneal epithelial cells, by inhibiting cell growth and enhancing cell survival after oxidative damage (Pappa2005Human).

In addition to its metabolic functions, ALDH3A1 exhibits chaperone-like activity, preventing protein aggregation and maintaining corneal transparency. It also influences cell cycle progression and DNA damage response, contributing to the protection of corneal epithelial cells from oxidative and genotoxic stress (Voulgaridou2023Investigating; Voulgaridou2020Aldehyde).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ALDH3A1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, ALDH3A1 is overexpressed in several tumor types, including lung, hepatocellular, gastric, and prostate cancers, and is associated with cancer stem cell phenotypes, which are known for their aggressiveness and resistance to treatment (Counihan2018ChemoproteomicsEnabled; Voulgaridou2023Identification). The enzyme's overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma is particularly linked to the activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors (Calderaro2013ALDH3A1).

ALDH3A1 also contributes to chemoresistance in cancer cells by metabolizing chemotherapeutic agents like cyclophosphamide into less toxic forms, thereby reducing their efficacy. Inhibition of ALDH3A1 has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to these drugs, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Parajuli2014Selective).

In ocular health, the absence of ALDH3A1 leads to increased oxidative damage and cataract formation, as evidenced by studies on mice with knock-outs of ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A1, which show increased lens opacification and oxidative stress (Lassen2007Multiple). This suggests that ALDH3A1 plays a protective role against cataracts by detoxifying aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation.

## Interactions
The human ALDH3A1 protein is involved in several protein-protein interactions, notably with Protein Kinase C Binding Protein 1 (PRKCBP1) and General Transcription Factor II-I (GTFII-I). These interactions were predicted using the GalaxyTongDock_A server, which identified docking sites on the ALDH3A1 surface. Both PRKCBP1 and GTFII-I share a similar P1-like sequence, which facilitates their binding to ALDH3A1. PRKCBP1 binds near the substrate binding site of ALDH3A1, potentially blocking it, involving 24 residues of ALDH3A1 and 26 of PRKCBP1, with a binding affinity of -10.4 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant of 46 nM (Voulgaridou2023Identification). Similarly, GTFII-I docks around the substrate binding site, involving 32 residues of GTFII-I and 115 of ALDH3A1, with a binding affinity of -11.7 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant of 5.2 nM (Voulgaridou2023Identification).

ALDH3A1 also exhibits chaperone-like functions, protecting proteins such as the restriction enzyme SmaI and citrate synthase from thermal inactivation, suggesting interactions that prevent protein aggregation under stress conditions (Voulgaridou2017Human). These interactions highlight ALDH3A1's role in cellular protection and stress response.
