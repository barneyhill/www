# LRRC7

## Overview
The LRRC7 gene encodes the protein Densin-180, a scaffold protein predominantly located in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses in the brain. Densin-180 is characterized by its leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a PDZ domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and synaptic signaling. As a scaffold protein, Densin-180 is integral to linking cytoskeletal elements with signaling proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. It is involved in the regulation of calcium signaling and the trafficking of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which are essential for synaptic plasticity and memory function. Variants in the LRRC7 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining synaptic structure and function (Willim2024Variants; Wang2017Densin180; Chong2019Lrrc7).

## Structure
The LRRC7 gene encodes the Densin-180 protein, which is characterized by leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a PDZ domain. The LRRs are involved in protein-protein interactions and form a solenoid structure with a concave surface, which is crucial for binding to interaction partners such as MACF1, Erbin, and PP1α (Willim2024Variants; Matsushima2019Leucine). The PDZ domain at the C-terminal end of Densin-180 binds to β- and δ-catenin, as well as actinin, playing a significant role in synaptic targeting and signaling (Willim2024Variants).

Missense variants in the LRR domain, such as p.N94S and p.L296P, can disrupt the structural integrity of the protein, affecting its folding and function (Willim2024Variants). The p.L1567Q variant in the PDZ domain alters the hydrophobic core, impacting binding to δ-catenin and synaptic targeting (Willim2024Variants). Densin-180 is enriched in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, where it functions as a scaffold protein linking cytoskeletal elements with signaling proteins (Willim2024Variants). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are important for its role in synaptic plasticity (Willim2024Variants).

## Function
The LRRC7 gene encodes the protein Densin-180, which plays a critical role in synaptic function and plasticity in the brain. Densin-180 is primarily located in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, where it acts as a scaffold protein, linking cytoskeletal elements with signaling proteins such as the α-subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) (Willim2024Variants). This interaction is crucial for synaptic targeting and the scaffolding of kinase/phosphatase signaling modules, contributing to synaptic plasticity, particularly long-term depression (LTD), and is associated with memory function (Willim2024Variants).

Densin-180 also regulates the trafficking and signaling of L-type voltage-gated Ca v 1.2 Ca2+ channels at excitatory synapses, influencing neuronal excitability and learning (Wang2017Densin180). It binds to the N-terminal domain of Ca v 1.2, increasing its currents and facilitating its forward trafficking, which enhances the clustering of Ca v 1.2 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Wang2017Densin180). In densin knockout mice, a reduction in Ca v 1.2 channel density and signaling is observed, leading to disrupted synaptic plasticity and increased anxiety-like behavior (Wang2017Densin180). These functions underscore the importance of Densin-180 in maintaining efficient synaptic signaling and neuronal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRRC7 gene, which encodes the Densin-180 protein, have been linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders. High-impact variants in LRRC7 are strongly associated with intellectual disability, ranking it 19th among genes linked to this condition. These variants include nonsense, splice site, and frameshift mutations, which are associated with phenotypes such as neurodevelopmental delay, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and atypical behaviors like aggression and hyperphagia (Willim2024Variants). The gene's role in synaptic plasticity and its interaction with proteins like PP1 is crucial, as disruptions can lead to intellectual disability and behavioral disorders (Willim2024Variants).

LRRC7 variants also affect dendritic branching and spine morphology, leading to less complex neuronal structures. This is linked to emotional dysregulation, anxiety, and social dysfunction, as observed in LRRC7 mutant mice (Chong2019Lrrc7). The gene's interaction with mGluR5 signaling is significant, with potential therapeutic implications for anxiety and social dysfunction (Chong2019Lrrc7). Additionally, circLRRC7, a circular RNA derived from LRRC7, is downregulated in glioblastoma, suggesting a tumor suppressor role and potential as a prognostic biomarker (Kong2021CircularLRRC7).

## Interactions
LRRC7, also known as Densin-180, is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic signaling and plasticity by interacting with various proteins at the postsynaptic density (PSD). It contains 16 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a PDZ domain, which facilitate its interactions with multiple proteins. LRRC7 directly interacts with Cnksr2 and SHANK proteins, and its PDZ domain specifically binds to delta-catenin and Cnksr2 (Wilkinson2020Molecular). It also associates with alpha-actinin, a cytoskeletal protein that binds to F-actin, linking LRRC7 to the cytoskeleton and Dlg4 (Wilkinson2020Molecular).

LRRC7 is involved in calcium signaling and synaptic plasticity through its interactions with Camk2a and L-type calcium channels, which recruit Camk2a to modulate neuronal excitability (Wilkinson2020Molecular). Although no direct molecular interaction between LRRC7 and mGluR5 has been established, deletion of LRRC7 in mice reduces postsynaptic mGluR5 levels and impairs mGluR-induced long-term depression (Chong2019Lrrc7). Variants in the LRR domain of Densin-180 disrupt its binding to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is crucial for synaptic signaling (Willim2024Variants). These interactions highlight the importance of LRRC7 in maintaining synaptic structure and function.
