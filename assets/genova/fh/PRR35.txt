# PRR35

## Overview
The PRR35 gene encodes the proline-rich protein 35, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. Proline-rich proteins often play roles in signaling pathways and protein-protein interactions due to their structural properties, which allow them to serve as scaffolds or adaptors in cellular signaling networks. The PRR35 protein may participate in such interactions, contributing to the regulation of cellular activities. Further research is needed to fully understand the biological roles and potential clinical significance of PRR35 (Qiu2020aarFDC).
