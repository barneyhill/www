# PLAC8L1

## Overview
PLAC8L1 is a gene that encodes the PLAC8 like 1 protein, which is part of the PLAC8 family. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its specific functions are not fully understood. The PLAC8 like 1 protein has been implicated in cellular pathways related to cancer progression and may serve as a biomarker for certain types of cancer, such as cervical cancer (Royse2014Differential). Additionally, PLAC8L1 has been identified as a gene under positive selection in both humans and domesticated animals, suggesting a role in evolutionary and domestication processes (Theofanopoulou2017Selfdomestication; Theofanopoulou2017Comparative). The gene is also predicted to interact with FAM172A, a gene associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Xu2020FAM172A). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise functions and clinical significance of PLAC8L1.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PLAC8L1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its precise role remains to be fully elucidated. In cervical pre-cancer lesions, PLAC8L1 is up-regulated during the progression from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL), suggesting a potential role in the progression of cervical pre-cancer lesions (Royse2014Differential). This up-regulation indicates that PLAC8L1 might serve as a biomarker for cervical cancer progression, although its clinical significance requires further investigation.

In the context of human evolution and domestication, PLAC8L1 has been identified as a gene under positive selection in anatomically modern humans and several domesticated species, such as cats and cattle. This suggests that PLAC8L1 may be involved in pathways common to domestication processes (Theofanopoulou2017Selfdomestication; Theofanopoulou2017Comparative). However, the functional implications of these findings are not yet clear.

Additionally, PLAC8L1 is noted as a predicted interaction partner of the FAM172A gene, which is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Although the study does not provide specific details on the clinical significance of PLAC8L1 in this context, it highlights the potential for interaction with other genes involved in cancer pathways (Xu2020FAM172A).
