# CEACAM8

## Overview
CEACAM8, also known as CD66b, is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 8, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein. This protein is predominantly expressed on human granulocytes, such as neutrophils and eosinophils, and is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family within the immunoglobulin superfamily (Zhao2004An). CEACAM8 plays a crucial role in intercellular adhesion and immune response modulation, particularly through its involvement in heterophilic interactions with other CEACAM family members like CEACAM6 (Kuroki2001Identification). The protein is characterized by extensive N-glycosylation, which is essential for its stability and function (Zhao2002Purification). CEACAM8 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neutrophil activation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and the regulation of inflammatory responses, making it a significant marker in immune response and potential target in cancer research (Huskey2021CEACAM; Singer2014Soluble).

## Structure
CEACAM8, also known as CD66b, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein expressed on human granulocytes, including neutrophils and eosinophils (Zhao2004An). The protein has a molecular weight of 95 kDa, which reduces to 40 kDa upon deglycosylation, indicating extensive N-glycosylation (Zhao2002Purification). CEACAM8 contains 11 N-glycosylation sites, contributing to its stability and function (Zhao2004An).

Structurally, CEACAM8 is part of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features an Ig V-like N-domain at the N-terminal end, followed by C2-set domains (Oikawa2000Extracellular). The N-domain is crucial for its heterophilic adhesion to CEACAM6, with specific residues such as N32 and R44 being essential for this interaction (Kuroki2001Identification). The N-domain alone is sufficient to mediate specific adhesion, suggesting that other domains are not required for this binding (Oikawa2000Extracellular).

CEACAM8 is anchored to the cell surface by a GPI lipid moiety, which is a common post-translational modification that facilitates its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Zhao2002Purification). The protein's quaternary structure may involve forming heterodimers with other CEACAM family members, such as CEACAM6 (Kuroki2001Identification).

## Function
CEACAM8, also known as CD66b, is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked glycoprotein expressed exclusively by human granulocytes. It is part of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family within the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in intercellular adhesion and cellular signaling. In healthy human cells, CEACAM8 is stored in specific vesicles of granulocytes and acts as a marker for exocytosis. It is released in response to bacterial DNA in a TLR9-dependent manner, contributing to the modulation of immune responses associated with pathogen binding, inflammation, and cell growth or differentiation (Singer2014Soluble).

CEACAM8 is involved in heterophilic adhesion, specifically binding to CEACAM6, which is crucial for cellular interactions and signaling. Specific amino acid residues in the N-domain of CEACAM8, such as N32 and R44, are essential for this adhesion activity (Kuroki2001Identification). The protein also plays a role in neutrophil activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), being up-regulated during cell activation (Kuroki2001Identification). Through these functions, CEACAM8 contributes to the regulation of immune responses and the resolution of inflammation, potentially preventing excessive tissue damage during bacterial infections (Singer2014Soluble).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM8, also known as CD66b, is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cell adhesion and immune response. Mutations and altered expression of CEACAM8 have been associated with cancer, particularly breast cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC). In breast cancer, rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in CEACAM8 are linked to increased risk among European Americans. These mutations may disrupt the tumor-suppressing relationship between CEACAM8 and other CEACAM family members, such as CEACAM6, which inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells when co-expressed (Huskey2021CEACAM).

In colorectal cancer, the variant CEACAM8:p.(T247A) has been associated with CRC risk in African Americans, although it is predicted to be likely benign. Despite this association, the overall impact of CEACAM8 mutations on CRC risk remains unclear, as significant results were not found in gene-specific aggregation analyses (Huskey2022An).

CEACAM8's role in cell adhesion is also significant in immune responses, particularly in interactions with bacterial proteins. Alterations in its adhesion properties, due to mutations in critical residues, can affect its ability to bind to other CEACAM antigens and bacterial proteins, potentially influencing susceptibility to infections (Kuroki2001Identification).

## Interactions
CEACAM8, also known as CD66b, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a role in immune response modulation. It is released by granulocytes in response to bacterial DNA in a TLR9-dependent manner and can bind to CEACAM1, a transmembrane molecule expressed on human airway epithelium. This interaction results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) of CEACAM1 and the recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-1, which negatively regulates the TLR2-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-Akt kinase pathway. This mechanism suggests that CEACAM8 can reduce pro-inflammatory responses in the airways (Singer2014Soluble).

CEACAM8 also participates in heterophilic adhesion with CEACAM6. The N-domain of CEACAM6 is sufficient for specific binding to CEACAM8, and specific residues in the N-domain of CEACAM8, such as N32 and R44, are crucial for this interaction. CEACAM8 does not exhibit homophilic adhesion activity, which is attributed to the hydrophilic nature of its 27th-29th residues (Oikawa2000Extracellular; Kuroki2001Identification). These interactions highlight the role of CEACAM8 in modulating immune responses and cell adhesion.
