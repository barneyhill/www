# UGT3A1

## Overview
UGT3A1 is a gene that encodes the protein UDP glycosyltransferase family 3 member A1, which is part of the UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the glycosylation of small lipophilic molecules, utilizing UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a sugar donor, a specificity that distinguishes it from other UGT family members (Meech2019The). UGT3A1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver and kidney, where it plays a crucial role in the metabolism and clearance of bile acids and other compounds (Mackenzie2008Identification; Meech2019The). The protein's unique structural features, such as its ability to bind UDP-GlcNAc, are critical for its function and suggest potential roles beyond detoxification, possibly involving the retention of metabolites within cells (Meech2019The). UGT3A1's activity in the lung and aerodigestive tract also indicates its involvement in local detoxification processes, which may influence cancer risk related to tobacco smoke exposure (Meech2019The).

## Structure
UGT3A1 is a member of the UDP glycosyltransferase superfamily, consisting of 523 amino acids. The protein features a putative signal peptide and a C-terminal hydrophobic region, which includes a 17-amino acid segment between an aspartate and a lysine residue (Mackenzie2008Identification). It contains a signature sequence characteristic of the UGT superfamily and a dilysine motif for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Mackenzie2008Identification). 

The primary structure of UGT3A1 includes several conserved residues important for substrate binding and catalysis, such as His-35, Glu-145, Ser-302, and His-369, which form hydrogen bonds with UDP (Mackenzie2008Identification). The enzyme is synthesized as a 53-kDa protein in HEK293T cells (Mackenzie2008Identification).

UGT3A1 exhibits unique sugar specificity, utilizing UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a sugar donor, unlike other UGT families that use UDP-glucuronic acid (Meech2019The). The Asn391 residue is critical for its ability to bind UDP-GlcNAc, forming hydrogen bonds with the sugar moiety (Meech2019The). The protein's structure allows for the binding of sugars with longer substituents due to longer C1 and C2 loops (Meech2019The).

## Function
UGT3A1 is a member of the UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily, primarily involved in the conjugation of small lipophilic molecules with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in healthy human cells. This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and kidney, where it plays a significant role in the metabolism and clearance of bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (Mackenzie2008Identification; Meech2019The). UGT3A1 catalyzes the N-acetylglucosaminidation of UDCA, converting it into UDCA-N-acetylglucosaminide, which is then excreted in urine. This process is particularly important in the context of therapeutic treatments for conditions like gallstones and primary biliary cholangitis (Meech2019The).

UGT3A1 also exhibits activity towards hydroxylated lipids, including cholesterol metabolites with a 7β-hydroxyl group, and is involved in the metabolism of bioflavones and certain tobacco smoke carcinogens (Meech2019The). The enzyme's unique sugar specificity and expression pattern suggest it may have roles beyond detoxification, potentially involving the retention of certain metabolites within cells for undefined physiological functions (Meech2019The). UGT3A1's activity in the lung and aerodigestive tract indicates a role in local detoxification processes, which may impact cancer risk related to tobacco smoke exposure (Meech2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The UGT3A1 gene has been implicated in various health conditions due to its role in metabolizing endogenous and exogenous compounds. Mutations in UGT3A1, such as the Cys121Gly variant, may lead to inactive enzyme forms, potentially affecting the metabolism of toxic compounds like 7β-OH cholesterol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This could alter the risk of atherosclerosis and increase cancer risk in smokers, although direct links between this SNP and specific diseases have not been published (Meech2019The).

In cancer, UGT3A1 mutations are prevalent, with approximately 53% resulting in amino acid substitutions, premature stop codons, or frame-shift truncated proteins. About 45% of these missense mutations are considered deleterious, significantly impacting protein function. These mutations are distributed randomly, but some hotspots have been identified, which may affect translation efficiency and protein function (Hu2022The).

Alterations in UGT3A1 expression or mutations may also influence drug metabolism pathways, potentially affecting therapeutic efficacy and cancer progression. However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with UGT3A1 mutations or expression changes are not detailed in the available literature (Meech2019The; Hu2022The).

## Interactions
UGT3A1, a member of the UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily, is involved in glycosylation processes and may interact with other proteins within metabolic pathways. Although specific protein-protein interactions involving UGT3A1 are not extensively detailed, it is known to utilize UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a substrate, similar to the protein O-glycosylation enzyme EOGT, which is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This suggests potential interactions or competition between UGT3A1 and EOGT, particularly in stem cells where both proteins are abundant (Meech2019The).

UGT3A1's unique sugar specificity is attributed to its structural features, such as the presence of an asparagine residue (Asn391) that allows hydrogen bonding with UDP-GlcNAc. This specificity is not observed in other UGTs due to the presence of a bulkier phenylalanine residue, which hinders similar interactions (nair2015insights). While direct studies on UGT3A1's interactions with other proteins are limited, its role in glycosylation and potential competition with other glycosylation enzymes suggest it may participate in regulatory interactions that influence its activity or stability (Meech2019The).
