# GNAI1

## Overview
GNAI1 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha i1, a critical component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in cellular signal transduction. The protein, categorized as a G-protein α-subunit, plays a pivotal role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways by acting as a molecular switch. In its inactive state, the Gαi1 protein binds GDP and associates with the Gβγ dimer. Upon activation by extracellular signals, GDP is replaced by GTP, leading to the dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer, thereby enabling the regulation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and modulation of cAMP levels (Muir2021Variants). GNAI1 is prominently expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in key signaling pathways, including Akt-mTORC1 and Erk-MAPK, as well as in the regulation of G protein-activated potassium channels (Muir2021Variants). The gene's critical role in cellular function is underscored by its intolerance to loss-of-function variants, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (Muir2021Variants).

## Structure
The GNAI1 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha i1, which is part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in signal transduction. The protein has a nucleotide-binding domain with GTPase activity and an α-helical domain (α-H domain) that partially occludes the bound nucleotide, requiring partial opening for nucleotide release (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The GNAI1 protein contains five highly conserved guanine nucleotide binding motifs that form a deep pocket for binding guanine nucleotides (Muir2021Variants).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including myristoylation at the N-terminus, which is essential for membrane association (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). It also undergoes S-acylation at Cys3, which is crucial for its function in signaling pathways (Nůsková2021Stearic). The GNAI1 protein has a long N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDPR) and numerous post-translational modification sites (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNAI1 has an alternatively spliced isoform-2 that lacks residues 1-52, corresponding to the long N-terminal IDPR of the canonical form (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The disorder profiles of GNAI1 are similar to other Gα i family members, with high sequence identities ranging from 54.29 to 94.35% (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
The GNAI1 gene encodes the Gαi1 protein, a member of the Gi/o inhibitory family of G-protein α-subunits, which plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, Gαi1 functions as part of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, acting as a molecular switch. In its inactive state, the GDP-bound Gα subunit binds to the Gβγ dimer. Upon activation by an extracellular signal, GDP is replaced by GTP, causing the Gα subunit to dissociate from the Gβγ dimer. This dissociation allows the Gα subunit and the Gβγ dimer to modulate downstream signaling pathways, such as the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, which affects cAMP levels (Muir2021Variants).

Gαi1 is prominently expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in major signaling pathways like Akt-mTORC1 and Erk-MAPK, as well as in the regulation of G protein-activated potassium channels (Muir2021Variants). The intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit eventually hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, returning the protein to its inactive state. GNAI1 is predicted to be intolerant to loss-of-function variants, indicating its critical role in cellular function (Muir2021Variants).

## Clinical Significance
The GNAI1 gene, encoding the G protein subunit alpha i1, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases. In the context of Ewing sarcoma, a common bone and soft tissue tumor in children and adolescents, the impaired function of GNAI1 in the spinal cord of Ews/Ewsr1 knockout mice suggests a potential link to the biological mechanisms underlying this cancer. The study highlights the down-regulation of GNAI1 and associated proteins, which may affect cellular signaling pathways critical for normal cellular function (Lee2016Integrated).

In gastric cancer, GNAI1 has been identified as a poor prognostic factor. Its expression is negatively correlated with DNA methylation levels, indicating that higher methylation is associated with lower gene expression. This relationship suggests that alterations in GNAI1 expression due to DNA methylation changes may contribute to cancer progression and impact patient prognosis (Chen2020A).

Overall, the dysregulation of GNAI1, whether through altered expression or interaction with other cellular components, is associated with significant clinical implications in cancer and potentially other diseases. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
GNAI1, or G protein subunit alpha i1, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in signal transduction. It interacts with the Gβγ dimer, forming a complex that modulates downstream signaling pathways. Upon activation by an extracellular signal, GNAI1 dissociates from the Gβγ dimer, allowing both components to regulate different signaling pathways, such as those involving cAMP levels (Muir2021Variants). GNAI1 specifically inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, impacting cAMP production (Nůsková2021Stearic).

GNAI1 also interacts with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, such as RGS19, which modulate its activity by interacting with the GTP-loaded form of GNAI1 (Solis2021Pediatric). Mutations in GNAI1, like Gln52Pro, can impair its ability to bind GTP and GDP, reducing its interaction with RGS19 and the Gβγ heterodimer (Solis2021Pediatric).

In the context of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, GNAI1 is involved in enhancing signaling through interactions with proteins like the GIV/Girdin guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates the GNAI complex and downstream PI3K signaling (Nůsková2021Stearic). These interactions are crucial for cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and migration.
