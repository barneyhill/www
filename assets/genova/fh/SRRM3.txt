# SRRM3

## Overview
The SRRM3 gene encodes the serine/arginine repetitive matrix 3 protein, which is a critical splicing factor involved in the regulation of RNA splicing, particularly in the inclusion of microexons. This protein plays a significant role in the specialization of the photoreceptor transcriptome, which is essential for the proper development and function of the photoreceptor outer segment, a modified cilium necessary for vision. SRRM3 is highly expressed in mature photoreceptors and is involved in the inclusion of retina-specific microexons (RetMICs), contributing to the unique proteome required for vesicle-mediated transport and cilium assembly. Beyond its role in the retina, SRRM3 also influences alternative splicing in other tissues, such as neurons and pancreatic endocrine cells, and is implicated in various diseases, including retinal degenerative diseases and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Potiri2024A; Ciampi2021Specialization).

## Function
The SRRM3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA splicing, particularly in the inclusion of microexons that are essential for the specialization of the photoreceptor transcriptome. This specialization is vital for maintaining the outer segment of photoreceptors, which is necessary for vision. SRRM3 is highly expressed in mature photoreceptors and is involved in the inclusion of retina-specific microexons (RetMICs), which are important for the transcriptomic specialization of photoreceptors. This process is necessary for the proper development and functioning of the outer segment, a modified cilium of photoreceptors (Ciampi2021Specialization).

SRRM3's role in microexon inclusion is critical for maintaining the unique proteome required for vesicle-mediated transport and cilium assembly in photoreceptors. The protein's activity is sufficient to promote the inclusion of the majority of RetMICs, which are important for maintaining photoreceptor function and vision (Ciampi2021Specialization). The presence of SRRM3-binding motifs upstream of RetMICs suggests a mechanism by which SRRM3 enhances exon inclusion, contributing to the proper functioning of photoreceptors and overall visual health (Ciampi2021Specialization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SRRM3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In zebrafish, mutations in SRRM3 lead to severe malformation of the photoreceptor outer segment, vesicle accumulation, photoreceptor degeneration, and impaired visual function, which are phenotypes similar to those observed in human Retinitis Pigmentosa. This suggests a potential link between SRRM3 mutations and retinal degenerative diseases (Ciampi2021Specialization). The depletion of SRRM3 affects the inclusion of retina-specific microexons, which are crucial for maintaining the outer segment of photoreceptors, leading to retinal degeneration and visual impairment (Ciampi2021Specialization).

In the context of neuronal development, SRRM3, along with SRRM4, regulates the alternative splicing of the REST gene, which is crucial for the switch of GABA's effect from excitatory to inhibitory. Defects in this regulation can lead to abnormal synaptic activity and conditions where GABA remains excitatory, potentially affecting neuronal synchronization and function (Nakano2019Overlapping). Additionally, SRRM3 downregulation in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cells impairs insulin secretion and alters Golgi morphology, indicating its role in cellular function and growth in cancer (Potiri2024A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SRRM3 in various diseases, particularly those affecting vision and neuronal function.

## Interactions
SRRM3 is involved in the regulation of microexons, which are crucial for the functioning of neurons and pancreatic endocrine cells. It interacts with other splicing factors, such as SRRM4, to promote the inclusion of retina-specific microexons (RetMICs) in photoreceptor transcripts. These interactions are essential for cilia biogenesis and vesicle-mediated transport, which are critical for photoreceptor function and vision (Ciampi2021Specialization).

SRRM3 also plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), where it is significantly upregulated. It influences the inclusion of microexons in pre-mRNAs, affecting proteins involved in secretory vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. This regulation is crucial for processes such as synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release (Potiri2024A).

The interaction of SRRM3 with specific sequence motifs, such as the UGC motif, is important for its splicing regulatory functions. This motif is enriched upstream of exons regulated by SRRM3, supporting its role in splicing regulation (Potiri2024A). The study of SRRM3's interactions with other splicing factors and its regulatory motifs provides insight into its role in gene expression and cellular function.
