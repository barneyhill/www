# ZNF587

## Overview
ZNF587 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 587, a member of the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, particularly those associated with transposable elements such as endogenous retroviruses and SINE-VNTR-Alu integrants. ZNF587 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through the recruitment of the methyltransferase SETDB1, which facilitates the deposition of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3, promoting heterochromatin formation and maintaining genomic stability. The protein's activity is significant in human embryonic stem cells and neurons, where it influences neuronal differentiation and protects against neurotoxicity. Additionally, ZNF587 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased genetic instability (Turelli2020Primate-restricted; Martins2023KRAB).

## Function
ZNF587 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. It functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by binding to specific DNA sequences, particularly those associated with transposable elements (TEs) such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) integrants. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and neurons, ZNF587, along with its paralog ZNF417, represses these TEs, thereby influencing gene expression and neuronal differentiation. This repression is crucial for preventing the induction of neurotoxic retroviral proteins and an interferon-like response, which can affect neuronal physiology (Turelli2020Primate-restricted).

ZNF587 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by recruiting the methyltransferase SETDB1, which deposits the repressive histone mark H3K9me3. This activity promotes heterochromatin formation at targeted loci, maintaining genomic stability and regulating the expression of other KRAB zinc finger proteins (Martins2023KRAB). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin structure and transcriptional networks, contributing to healthy neuronal function and potentially protecting against neurotoxicity (Turelli2020Primate-restricted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF587 gene have been associated with poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ZNF587 is part of a cluster of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) that are upregulated in certain cancers, including DLBCL, and are linked to increased genetic instability and immune evasion. The upregulation of ZNF587 is correlated with a high-risk molecular gene signature and a proliferative, genetically unstable phenotype in DLBCL, which is associated with reduced immune infiltration (Martins2023KRAB; Martins2024A).

Depletion of ZNF587 in cancer cells leads to increased replicative stress and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in an inflammatory response. This response enhances the susceptibility of cancer cells to immune-mediated destruction and alters the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that ZNF587 plays a role in protecting cancer cells from replicative stress-induced inflammation (Martins2024A). The depletion also results in increased DNA damage and changes in chromatin accessibility, which may contribute to the poor prognosis observed in DLBCL (Martins2023KRAB; Martins2024A). These findings suggest that targeting ZNF587 could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment (Martins2024A).

## Interactions
ZNF587 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that interacts with several other proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression and maintain genomic stability. It binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner through its zinc finger motifs and acts as a transcriptional repressor via the KRAB domain-mediated recruitment of KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1). This interaction facilitates the assembly of a heterochromatin-inducing complex, which includes the methyltransferase SETDB1. SETDB1 catalyzes the deposition of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3, promoting heterochromatin formation at targeted loci, particularly at primate-restricted transposable elements such as ERVK and SVA integrants (Martins2023KRAB; Martins2024A).

ZNF587 also interacts with the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway. Upon depletion of ZNF587, there is an accumulation of cytosolic DNA fragments, which are sensed by the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to an inflammatory response. This interaction results in the upregulation of interferon-responsive and inflammatory genes, indicating a role in modulating immune responses and maintaining chromatin stability (Martins2023KRAB; Martins2024A).

In human embryonic stem cells, ZNF587 binds to specific loci containing HERVK sequences, and its depletion leads to the upregulation of transposable elements and changes in gene expression, highlighting its role in controlling transposable element-embedded regulatory sequences (Turelli2020Primate-restricted).
