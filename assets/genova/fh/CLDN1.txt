# CLDN1

## Overview
The CLDN1 gene encodes claudin 1, a transmembrane protein that is a vital component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin 1 belongs to the claudin family, which is characterized by its tetra-span transmembrane structure, facilitating its role in forming tight junction strands that regulate paracellular permeability (Milatz2015Probing; Heinemann2019Structural). The protein is crucial for maintaining the integrity of barriers such as the epidermis, where it regulates the passage of ions and molecules, contributing to skin barrier function (Brandner2014Epidermal; Kirschner2010Tight). Beyond its structural role, claudin 1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and viral infections, where it influences processes such as tumor progression and viral entry (Bhat2020Claudin1; Krieger2009Inhibition). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by post-translational modifications, and its interactions with other proteins are critical for its diverse biological roles (Liu2016Systems; Milatz2015Probing).

## Structure
Claudin 1 (CLDN1) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its tetra-span transmembrane structure, which includes four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops (Milatz2015Probing; Heinemann2019Structural). The first extracellular loop (ECL1) is highly conserved and contains a tryptophan and two cysteine residues, suggesting the formation of a disulfide bond, which is crucial for the protein's structural integrity (Heinemann2019Structural). The second extracellular loop (ECL2) is involved in intermolecular interactions necessary for tight junction strand formation (Krause2015Assembly).

The protein's structure allows for both cis and trans interactions, facilitating the formation of tight junction strands through homophilic and heterophilic interactions (Milatz2015Probing). Claudin 1 is known to form multimers, ranging from dimers to hexamers, within these strands, although the exact number of molecules in a cis-oligomer is uncertain (Milatz2015Probing).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function of claudin proteins, although specific sites impacting claudin 1's trafficking or contact enrichment have not been identified (Milatz2015Probing). The structural model of claudin 1 suggests an antiparallel double-row cis-arrangement within tight junction strands, which is essential for its role in regulating paracellular permeability (Milatz2015Probing).

## Function
Claudin-1 (CLDN1) is a critical component of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cells, particularly in the epidermis. These junctions are essential for maintaining the barrier function of the skin by regulating the paracellular transport of ions and molecules. In healthy human cells, claudin-1 is prominently localized at the cell-cell borders of the stratum granulosum, where it forms a barrier to ions and larger molecules, contributing significantly to the epidermal barrier function (Brandner2014Epidermal; Kirschner2010Tight).

Claudin-1 is involved in forming tight junction strands, which are crucial for preventing the diffusion of materials through the paracellular pathway. This protein is indispensable for the barrier against larger molecules, although its role in the water barrier is complex and may involve interactions with other proteins and lipids in the stratum corneum (Brandner2014Epidermal; Kirschner2013Contribution).

In the epidermis, claudin-1's presence is vital for maintaining the integrity and function of the skin barrier. Its deficiency can lead to increased permeability and barrier dysfunction, as observed in conditions like atopic dermatitis, where claudin-1 expression is reduced (De2011Tight). Claudin-1 also plays a role in maintaining a calcium gradient in the epidermis, which is crucial for skin barrier function (Kirschner2013Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CLDN1 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CLDN1 is strongly expressed in a significant portion of tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, correlating with higher malignancy and invasiveness through the c-Abl-Ras-Raf-1-ERK signaling pathway (Suh2012Claudin1; Zeisel2018Tight). In colorectal cancer (CRC), increased CLDN1 expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, with its overexpression enhancing invasive and metastatic potential (Bhat2020Claudin1). 

In breast cancer, CLDN1 expression varies, acting as a tumor promoter in ER-negative subtypes and a suppressor in ER-positive subtypes (Bhat2020Claudin1). In thyroid cancer, high CLDN1 expression is associated with regional lymph node metastasis and increased cell proliferation (Bhat2020Claudin1). 

CLDN1 is also involved in liver diseases, with mutations linked to neonatal ichthyosis and sclerosing cholangitis syndrome, characterized by deficient expression leading to compromised tight junctions (Zeisel2018Tight). In craniopharyngiomas, low CLDN1 expression is associated with invasive tumor growth (Stache2013Tight). These findings highlight CLDN1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Claudin 1 (CLDN1) is a tight junction protein that participates in various interactions crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating viral entry. CLDN1 interacts with several proteins, including TJP1/ZO-1, TJP2/ZO-2, TJP3/ZO-3, MPDZ/MUPP1, INADL/PATJ, TACSTD2, SRC, KRT76, LNX1, CD81, CD9, OCL, MARVELD2, MARVELD3, CLDN3, CLDN7, MMP14, MMP2, and EFNB1. These interactions are categorized based on the domains of CLDN1, such as the cytosolic tail, transmembrane, and extracellular regions (Liu2016Systems).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, CLDN1 is essential for viral entry. It does not directly bind to the viral envelope glycoprotein E2 but interacts with CD81, forming a complex that facilitates HCV entry into host cells. Anti-CLDN1 antibodies can inhibit HCV infection by disrupting the association between CLDN1 and CD81, thereby blocking the E2-CD81-CLDN1 interaction necessary for viral entry (Krieger2009Inhibition).

CLDN1 also forms cis-interactions with other claudins, such as claudin-3, within tight junction strands. These interactions are crucial for the structural arrangement and function of tight junctions, as demonstrated by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) studies (Milatz2015Probing).
