# MAP4K1

## Overview
MAP4K1, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the STE20 kinase family. The protein product of MAP4K1 is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hippo and JNK pathways, where it plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. As a kinase, MAP4K1 facilitates the transfer of phosphate groups to specific serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, a fundamental process in signal transduction. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and functional outcomes. MAP4K1 is also implicated in several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and gastric cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ling2021MAP4K1; Bai2019Prognostic; Meng2015MAP4K).

## Structure
MAP4K1, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1, is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the STE20 kinase family. The protein contains a kinase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling cascade. This domain is responsible for the transfer of phosphate groups to serine/threonine residues on substrate proteins, a critical step in signal transduction pathways.

The molecular structure of MAP4K1 includes specific domains that facilitate its function in cellular signaling. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are known to regulate the activity of MAP4K1, influencing its interactions and functional outcomes. These modifications can alter the protein's conformation and activity, thereby modulating its role in various signaling pathways.

Alternative splicing of the MAP4K1 gene may result in different isoforms of the protein. These isoforms can have variations in their structure, potentially affecting their enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins. The presence of multiple isoforms allows for a diverse range of functional roles within the cell, adapting to different cellular contexts and requirements.

## Function
MAP4K1, also known as hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, MAP4K1 is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it acts in parallel to MST1/2 kinases to activate LATS1/2. This activation regulates the activity of YAP/TAZ transcription co-activators, which are crucial for controlling gene expression related to cell proliferation and survival (Meng2015MAP4K). MAP4K1 can phosphorylate the LATS-HM motif, thereby activating LATS independently of MST1/2, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially under conditions like serum deprivation (Meng2015MAP4K).

MAP4K1 is also involved in the JNK signaling pathway, where it activates JNK through a cascade involving TAK1 and MKK4. This pathway is important for apoptosis, growth inhibition, and cell cycle regulation (Bai2019Prognostic). In the immune system, MAP4K1 regulates neutrophil adhesion and is involved in the NF-kB signaling pathway, where it inhibits NF-kB activation (Bai2019Prognostic). These functions underscore MAP4K1's role in modulating immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
MAP4K1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cell signaling pathways. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MAP4K1 functions as a tumor promoter and is associated with drug resistance. High expression levels of MAP4K1 are linked to poor prognosis in AML patients, with increased risks for overall survival, event-free survival, and relapse-free survival. MAP4K1 expression is significantly higher in AML patients compared to normal donors, and its overexpression is associated with resistance to the drug homoharringtonine (HHT). Knockdown of MAP4K1 increases sensitivity to HHT, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ling2021MAP4K1).

In gastric cancer, MAP4K1 is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its expression is positively regulated by the long non-coding RNA DLX6-AS1, which stabilizes MAP4K1 through interaction with the RNA-binding protein FUS. Knockdown of MAP4K1 in gastric cancer cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation and migration, indicating its role in cancer progression (Wu2019DLX6AS1).

In cerebral infarction, MAP4K1 expression is regulated by the long noncoding RNA CDKN2B-AS1 through its interaction with the transcription factor BCL11A. Silencing CDKN2B-AS1 leads to increased MAP4K1 expression and reduced proliferation of T regulatory cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for cerebral infarction by modulating MAP4K1 expression (Lei2019Long).

## Interactions
MAP4K1, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several adaptor proteins, including CRK, CRKL, NCK2, and GRB2, which are involved in signal transduction processes (Seo2020MAP4K). These interactions suggest MAP4K1's involvement in signaling pathways related to ribosome biogenesis and adaptor-mediated signaling transduction (Seo2020MAP4K).

MAP4K1 is also part of the STRIPAK complex, interacting with STRN4, a key component that regulates the Hippo pathway. This interaction positions MAP4K1 upstream of MST1/2 in the Hippo pathway, influencing their activities through SLMAP and STRN4 (Seo2020MAP4K). The STRIPAK complex is crucial for protein phosphorylation events and acts as a positive regulator of YAP, a potential oncogene (Seo2020MAP4K).

In the context of Pdcd4 knockdown, MAP4K1 expression is upregulated, leading to the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. This process involves increased levels of phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun, indicating MAP4K1's role in activating downstream signaling components (Wang2012Pdcd4). These interactions highlight MAP4K1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential implications in various biological processes.
