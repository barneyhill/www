# LCN1

## Overview
Lipocalin 1 (LCN1) is a gene that encodes the lipocalin 1 protein, a member of the lipocalin family known for its ability to bind small hydrophobic molecules. The protein is predominantly found in human tears, where it plays a vital role in ocular health by maintaining the lipid layer of the tear film and exhibiting antimicrobial properties. Lipocalin 1 is characterized by a conserved lipocalin fold, which includes a capacious internal cavity that facilitates ligand binding. This structural feature allows the protein to transport various molecules, such as fatty acids and vitamins, across the tear film, contributing to its protective functions. Additionally, LCN1 is involved in interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, displaying endonuclease activity and binding to a novel cell membrane receptor. Clinically, alterations in LCN1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including breast cancer and ocular conditions, highlighting its potential as a biomarker (Glasgow2021Tear; Yang2019Identification; Wojnar2001Molecular).

## Structure
Lipocalin 1 (LCN1) is a member of the lipocalin protein family, characterized by its ability to bind small hydrophobic molecules. The primary structure of LCN1 includes a conserved sequence motif, LEDFXR, which is crucial for its endonuclease activity (Glasgow2021Tear). The secondary structure of LCN1 is defined by a highly conserved lipocalin fold, consisting of eight antiparallel β-strands that form a flattened pita bread shape. This structure is stabilized by continuous hydrogen bonding and includes conserved 310 and α-helices (Glasgow2021Tear).

The tertiary structure of LCN1 features a capacious and flexible internal cavity lined with hydrophobic residues, including a highly conserved tryptophan, which facilitates the binding of various ligands (Glasgow2021Tear). The protein's structure allows for significant flexibility, particularly in the loops, which are crucial for ligand interactions and receptor binding (Glasgow2021Tear).

LCN1 is predominantly monomeric in solution, although delipidation can lead to the formation of dimers and hexamers, indicating some quaternary structural dynamics (Gasymov2007Oligomeric). Common post-translational modifications of LCN1 include glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function. The protein's structural features enable it to perform various roles, including antimicrobial activities and lipid scavenging (Glasgow2021Tear).

## Function
Lipocalin 1 (LCN1) is a multifunctional protein primarily found in human tears, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining ocular health. It acts as a lipid-binding protein, transporting small hydrophobic molecules such as fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and vitamins E and A across the tear film. This transport is essential for maintaining the lipid layer of the tear film, which protects the ocular surface and prevents conditions like dry eye disease (Glasgow2021Tear; Charkoftaki2019Update).

LCN1 exhibits antimicrobial properties by transporting antimicrobial lipids and interacting with lysozyme, contributing to its bacteriostatic and antifungal activities. It also binds fungal siderophores, inhibiting microbial access to iron, a critical nutrient for their growth (Glasgow2021Tear). LCN1 acts as a scavenger of harmful lipid peroxidation products, such as F2-isoprostanes, protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining the integrity of the tear film (LECHNER2001Human).

The protein is primarily active in extracellular spaces, particularly in the eyes, where it helps maintain tissue homeostasis and contributes to immune defense by sequestering potentially harmful substances (Gasymov2007Oligomeric).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCN1 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, LCN1 expression is significantly increased in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with the highest expression observed in stage 4 breast cancer. This upregulation is noted across different breast cancer subtypes, including luminal, HER2 positive, and triple-negative breast cancer. Low LCN1 mRNA expression is linked to poor overall survival and relapse-free survival in luminal B and HER2 positive breast cancer, while high expression correlates with poor prognosis for post-progression survival in HER2-positive breast cancer (Yang2019Identification).

LCN1 is also implicated in ocular conditions. Decreased levels of LCN1 are associated with Sjogren's syndrome, LASIK-induced dry eye, and diabetic retinopathy, suggesting its role in maintaining ocular health (Chandrasekaran2024Structure; Charkoftaki2019Update). Conversely, increased expression of LCN1 is observed in cystic fibrosis, indicating its involvement in respiratory conditions (Chandrasekaran2024Structure). These findings highlight the potential of LCN1 as a biomarker for various diseases, although further studies are needed to fully understand its clinical significance (Chandrasekaran2024Structure).

## Interactions
Lipocalin 1 (LCN1) is known to participate in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It exhibits endonuclease activity, interacting with DNA to hydrolyze it, similar to DNase I, although with significantly lower activity. This interaction is facilitated by specific motifs in its sequence, such as LEDFXR, and is dependent on bivalent cations like Mg2+ and Mn2+ (YUSIFOV2000Endonuclease). 

LCN1 also interacts with other tear proteins, including lysozyme and lactoferrin, through weak electrostatic interactions, which may influence its function in the tear film (Glasgow2021Tear). It binds to a variety of ligands, including retinol and vitamin E, and acts as a scavenger for lipid peroxidation products, interacting with thioredoxin to promote disulfide oxidation (Glasgow2021Tear).

Additionally, LCN1 interacts with a novel cell membrane receptor, the lipocalin-1 interacting membrane receptor (LIMR), which was identified using phage display techniques. LIMR is a 55-kDa protein with nine transmembrane domains, and its interaction with LCN1 suggests a role in the clearance or detoxification of lipophilic molecules (Wojnar2001Molecular).
