# STK38L

## Overview
STK38L is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine kinase 38 like protein, a member of the NDR kinase family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and proliferation. As a serine/threonine kinase, STK38L plays a pivotal role in the G1/S cell cycle transition and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing centrosome duplication and cell cycle progression (Chen2019Two; Fukasawa2023The). The protein's structure includes a conserved N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain, with a hydrophobic motif at the C-terminus essential for its kinase activity (Martin2020The). STK38L's interactions with other proteins, such as RAF1, and its involvement in signaling pathways like the Hippo pathway, underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and retinal degeneration (Kondelin2018Comprehensive; Kleemann2018Induction).

## Structure
STK38L, also known as serine/threonine kinase 38 like, is a member of the NDR kinase family, characterized by a conserved N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The protein structure includes a hydrophobic motif at the C-terminus, which contains a phosphorylation site necessary for its kinase activity (Martin2020The). The N-terminal regulatory domain is essential for binding the regulatory MOB1A protein, which is necessary for STK38L activation (Martin2020The). 

In the context of mutations, the R105W mutant of STK38L shows a shift from a positively charged arginine to a non-polar and bulky tryptophan, potentially inhibiting ATP-binding and kinase activity (Kondelin2018Comprehensive). This mutation also affects the protein's interaction with other proteins, increasing binding with some interactors while decreasing with others (Kondelin2018Comprehensive).

STK38L undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. For instance, it phosphorylates RAF1 at Ser621, a key step in stabilizing the kinase by binding to 14-3-3 proteins and preventing proteasomal degradation (Kleemann2018Induction). The protein may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, affecting its functional and structural properties (Kleemann2018Induction).

## Function
STK38L, also known as NDR2, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation in healthy human cells. It is part of the NDR kinase family and is involved in the G1/S cell cycle transition, with its depletion leading to G1 arrest and decreased cellular proliferation (Chen2019Two; Fukasawa2023The). STK38L is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including centrosome duplication and cell cycle progression (LópezMateo2016HEY1).

STK38L interacts with RAF1, phosphorylating it at Ser621, which is crucial for stabilizing RAF1 by binding to 14-3-3 proteins and preventing its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is important for maintaining cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis (Kleemann2018Induction). Additionally, STK38L is involved in the regulation of the proto-oncogene C-Myc, promoting cell cycle progression by decreasing the stability of the cyclin-Cdk inhibitor protein p21 through phosphorylation (LópezMateo2016HEY1).

In the context of glioma, STK38L expression is increased, suggesting its role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation, which are critical functions in healthy cells (Chen2019Two).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STK38L gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In dogs, a mutation in STK38L is associated with early retinal degeneration (erd), an autosomal recessive disorder. This mutation disrupts the N-terminal regulatory region of the gene, leading to impaired photoreceptor development, cell death, and proliferation, ultimately resulting in retinal degeneration and potential blindness (Berta2011Photoreceptor).

In humans, STK38L mutations have been linked to cancer progression. In microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer (MSI CRC), the R105W mutation in STK38L affects its interaction with other proteins, potentially altering its kinase activity and impacting cell proliferation (Kondelin2018Comprehensive). Additionally, STK38L expression is downregulated by miR-493-3p in ovarian cancer cells, promoting apoptosis and suggesting a role in cancer cell survival (Kleemann2018Induction).

In glioma, a SNP in the STK38L gene is associated with increased risk, potentially affecting gene splicing and expression levels. STK38L expression is elevated in glioma samples, indicating its possible involvement in glioma development (Chen2019Two). These findings highlight the clinical significance of STK38L in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
STK38L, also known as serine/threonine kinase 38 like, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It is known to interact with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, including MOB1B and MOB2, as well as Importin-11 (IPO1). These interactions were confirmed in studies comparing the wild type and the R105W mutant of STK38L, although no changes were observed in these specific interactions between the two forms (Kondelin2018Comprehensive).

The R105W mutant of STK38L, however, displayed differential binding with 16 high-confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs), showing increased interaction with 11 HCIPs and decreased interaction with five others. This mutation involves a shift from a positively charged arginine to a non-polar tryptophan, potentially affecting ATP-binding and kinase activity (Kondelin2018Comprehensive).

STK38L also interacts with RAF1, a key player in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. It phosphorylates RAF1 at Ser621, which is crucial for stabilizing RAF1 by binding to 14-3-3 proteins and preventing its degradation. This interaction is significant in the context of apoptosis and cancer cell proliferation (Kleemann2018Induction). Additionally, STK38L is targeted by miR-493-3p, which downregulates its expression, leading to apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells (Kleemann2018Induction).
