# CDK18

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 18 (CDK18) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 18, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, specifically within the PCTAIRE subfamily of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDK18 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking in renal cells, genome stability, and replication stress signaling. It interacts with several key proteins, such as RAD9, RAD17, and TopBP1, to facilitate ATR-mediated replication stress signaling, which is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity. CDK18 is also implicated in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the central nervous system, suggesting a role in myelination and neural repair. Clinically, CDK18 has been associated with various cancers, including breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with patient prognosis and response to chemotherapy. Additionally, CDK18 has been linked to ischemic stroke risk in individuals with sickle cell disease, highlighting its potential significance in both oncological and cerebrovascular conditions (Earley2022Genomewide; Barone2016Human; Dema2020CyclinDependent).

## Structure
CDK18, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 18, is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the PCTAIRE subfamily of CDKs. The protein is approximately 500 amino acids long and shares significant sequence homology with other CDKs, particularly in its kinase domain, which includes conserved motifs such as HRD and DFG that are crucial for kinase activation (Karimbayli2024Insights). The kinase domain of CDK18 is highly conserved and shares significant sequence homology with CDK2, although the crystal structure of CDK18 has not been determined (Matsuda2014PCTAIRE).

CDK18 contains a PCTAIRE sequence in its kinase N-lobe, distinguishing it from canonical CDKs that have a PSTAIRE sequence (Matsuda2014PCTAIRE). It is activated through association with cyclin A2 and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), with phosphorylation at Ser12 being particularly important for its activity (Matsuda2014PCTAIRE). CDK18 interacts with proteins such as RAD9, RAD17, and TOPBP1, playing a role in replication stress signaling and genome stability (Barone2016Human). Despite its functional importance, detailed structural information, including primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms, is not extensively documented in the available literature.

## Function
Cyclin-dependent kinase 18 (CDK18) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) trafficking and abundance in renal cells. CDK18 is involved in a complex regulatory network that includes protein kinase A (PKA) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1, which functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP). This network is crucial for the cAMP-dependent regulation of AQP2, affecting water reabsorption and body water homeostasis (Dema2020CyclinDependent).

CDK18 also plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability and promoting replication stress signaling. It interacts with proteins such as RAD9, RAD17, and TopBP1, facilitating ATR-mediated replication stress signaling. This interaction is essential for the chromatin retention of these proteins, which are key regulators of the replication stress response. CDK18's kinase activity is necessary for efficient S-phase transit and preventing DNA damage, as its depletion leads to increased DNA breaks and chromosomal abnormalities (Barone2016Human).

In the central nervous system, CDK18 is involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelination, indicating its role in myelin repair and maintenance (Pan2019Cyclindependent).

## Clinical Significance
CDK18 (cyclin-dependent kinase 18) has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where its gene locus is often amplified, leading to increased mRNA and protein expression levels. This overexpression is associated with poor patient survival, especially in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer cases, and may predict a poorer response to certain chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate (Barone2018The). High cytoplasmic expression of CDK18 is linked to triple-negative and basal-like breast cancer phenotypes, while low expression correlates with HER2 overexpression. These expression patterns suggest that CDK18 could serve as a biomarker for chemotherapy response and influence breast cancer biology (Barone2018The).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CDK18 expression is downregulated in blood samples compared to healthy controls, indicating a potential role in disease progression. The gene's involvement in cell proliferation and migration suggests it could be a target for therapeutic interventions in ccRCC (simonovic2021role).

CDK18 has also been associated with ischemic stroke risk in individuals with sickle cell disease, as identified in a genome-wide association study. Variants near the CDK18 gene were linked to an increased risk of early-onset ischemic stroke, highlighting its potential role in cerebrovascular conditions (Earley2022Genomewide).

## Interactions
CDK18, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 18, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in replication stress signaling and genome stability. CDK18 interacts with key components of the replication stress response, including RAD9, RAD17, and TopBP1, forming part of the RAD9-RAD17-TopBP1 complex. These interactions are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that CDK18 is a component of this complex and plays a role in promoting ATR-mediated replication stress signaling (Barone2016Human).

CDK18 also interacts with ATR, a central protein in the DNA damage response pathway, and promotes the phosphorylation of Chk1, a marker of ATR activity. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of PARP inhibitors, suggesting that CDK18 is involved in the full activation of ATR by regulating interactions with other components such as Rad9 and ETAA1 (Ning2019Myc).

Additionally, CDK18 interacts with cyclin A2, which is important for its activation. This interaction suggests that CDK18, like other PCTAIRE kinases, might be activated through non-canonical pathways (Karimbayli2024Insights). CDK18's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in maintaining genome stability and responding to DNA damage.
