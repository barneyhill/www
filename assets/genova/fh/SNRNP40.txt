# SNRNP40

## Overview
SNRNP40 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U5 subunit 40, a protein integral to the spliceosome complex, specifically the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) component. The spliceosome is a critical cellular machinery responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA, a process that removes non-coding introns and joins coding exons to produce mature messenger RNA (mRNA) (Riabov2024Structural). The protein encoded by SNRNP40 is categorized as a spliceosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the spliceosome, ensuring accurate mRNA processing and regulation of gene expression (Wood2021The). SNRNP40 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its essential function in cellular processes (Wood2021The). Its interactions with other spliceosomal components, such as PRPF8 and SNRNP200, highlight its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome (Zhang2019Syndromic).

## Function
SNRNP40 encodes a protein that is a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is part of the spliceosome. The spliceosome is essential for pre-mRNA splicing, a process that removes introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, facilitating accurate mRNA processing and gene expression regulation (Riabov2024Structural). SNRNP40 is involved in the assembly and stability of the spliceosome, playing a critical role in aligning exons during splicing (Wood2021The). 

In healthy human cells, SNRNP40 is part of the U5 snRNP core, which includes several subunits such as U5 snRNA, PRP8, BRR2, SNU114, and a seven-subunit Sm ring. These components are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome (Riabov2024Structural). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes across different tissues (Wood2021The). 

While specific functions of SNRNP40 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in the spliceosome suggests it plays a significant role in maintaining proper splicing and gene expression, which are essential for normal cellular and organismal function (Wood2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SNRNP40 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. SNRNP40 is a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, which is part of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. In cancer, particularly breast cancer, variability in SNRNP40 expression has been associated with increased metastatic potential. Low expression levels of SNRNP40 correlate with enhanced metastasis and higher levels of unspliced pre-mRNAs, suggesting that deregulation of splicing factors like SNRNP40 may contribute to cancer progression by altering gene regulatory networks (Nguyen2016Highly; Wood2021The).

In mice, mutations in the Snrnp40 gene, which is homologous to human SNRNP40, lead to a syndromic immune disorder characterized by increased susceptibility to infections, particularly by mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). These mutations result in impaired splicing, leading to intron retention and reduced expression of proteins essential for immune function. This causes defects in lymphoid development and function, highlighting the gene's role in immune system regulation (Zhang2019Syndromic). The high conservation of SNRNP40 between humans and mice suggests that similar mutations could potentially lead to immune dysfunction in humans (Zhang2019Syndromic).

## Interactions
SNRNP40 is a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is part of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several proteins within the spliceosome, playing a crucial role in the assembly and stability of the U5 snRNP. SNRNP40 is tightly bound to other proteins such as PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200, suggesting its involvement in facilitating the splicing process (Zhang2019Syndromic). 

Mass spectrometry analysis has identified proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with SNRNP40 from T cell and NK cell lines, indicating its interactions with various splicing factors and regulators (Zhang2019Syndromic). The assembly of the U5 snRNP component PRPF8 involves interactions with SNRNP40, and defects in these interactions can lead to reduced snRNP formation (Malinová2017Assembly). 

SNRNP40 also interacts with the TSSC4 protein, which is crucial for the formation of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. Deletion of specific amino acid regions in TSSC4 significantly reduces its interaction with SNRNP40 (Klimešová2021TSSC4). These interactions highlight the importance of SNRNP40 in the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome.
