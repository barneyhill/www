# DHRS9

## Overview
The DHRS9 gene encodes the enzyme dehydrogenase/reductase 9, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in retinoid metabolism, facilitating the conversion of retinol to all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a critical process for cellular differentiation and proliferation (Ebert2016Transcriptional; Napoli2012Physiological). DHRS9 is expressed in various tissues, including the colon and epidermis, and plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions by modulating retinoic acid levels (Ebert2016Transcriptional). The gene's expression and activity have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Hu2015Downregulation; Vetri2024Whole; Chen2022Overexpression).

## Function
DHRS9 (dehydrogenase/reductase 9) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in retinoid metabolism, particularly in the conversion of retinol to all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a process crucial for cell differentiation and proliferation. This enzyme exhibits dual substrate specificity, recognizing both free and CRBP1-bound retinol, and is involved in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid from retinol (Ebert2016Transcriptional; Napoli2012Physiological). DHRS9 is expressed in various tissues, including the colon and epidermis, where it is particularly active in atRA-dependent strata (Napoli2012Physiological).

In healthy human cells, DHRS9 contributes to the regulation of cellular processes by modulating retinoic acid levels, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions such as differentiation and proliferation (Ebert2016Transcriptional). The enzyme's activity in hair follicles suggests a role in promoting differentiation within these structures, indicating its broader involvement in retinoid metabolism (Ebert2016Transcriptional). DHRS9's enzymatic activity has been characterized in airway epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression is primarily found in the colon, with lower levels in other tissues such as the heart, spleen, placenta, and lung (Hu2015Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DHRS9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DHRS9 expression is frequently downregulated, which is significantly correlated with increased lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, increased disease recurrence, and poor survival outcomes. This downregulation serves as an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator for CRC, suggesting that reduced DHRS9 expression is associated with more aggressive disease features (Hu2015Downregulation).

In rectal cancer, DHRS9 is often overexpressed, particularly in patients resistant to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). High DHRS9 expression is linked to poor prognosis, advanced tumor status, and resistance to treatment, indicating its potential role as a predictive marker for CCRT efficacy and patient survival (Chen2022Overexpression).

In developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), mutations in the DHRS9 gene have been identified. A case study reported a girl with early onset epilepsy who had a compound heterozygote for two novel missense mutations in DHRS9, likely disrupting protein function and affecting inhibitory GABAergic neurons (Vetri2024Whole). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of DHRS9 in different pathological contexts.
