# STAB1

## Overview
The STAB1 gene encodes the protein stabilin-1, a large transmembrane scavenger receptor involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, cell adhesion, and immune regulation. Stabilin-1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple fasciclin and epidermal growth factor-like domains, contributing to its role in ligand clearance and tissue homeostasis (Schledzewski2012Deficiency; Olsavszky2021Exploring). It is primarily expressed in lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells and type 2 macrophages, where it mediates the uptake of specific ligands and supports leukocyte adhesion and transmigration (Palani2011Stabilin‐1CLEVER‐1). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as the adaptor protein GULP and growth differentiation factor 15, underscore its involvement in phagocytosis and immune response modulation (Park2010Adaptor; Schledzewski2012Deficiency). Clinically, alterations in STAB1 expression and function have been linked to conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and hereditary hyperferritinemia, highlighting its significance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Monfrini2022BiallelicSTAB1pathogenic; Lin2019Identification).

## Structure
Stabilin-1 (STAB1) is a large transmembrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes multiple domains. The extracellular region of Stabilin-1 contains seven fasciclin domains, several epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and one hyaluronic acid (HA)-binding X-link domain, although this domain is non-functional in Stabilin-1 (Schledzewski2012Deficiency; Olsavszky2021Exploring). These domains contribute to its role as a scavenger receptor involved in endocytosis and cell adhesion.

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and localization. Stabilin-1 also has splice variant isoforms, which can affect its functional properties and cellular distribution.

Stabilin-1 shares a high degree of structural similarity with Stabilin-2, particularly in the extracellular ligand-interacting domains, although they differ in their ligand-binding capabilities (Schledzewski2012Deficiency). Despite the presence of an HA-binding domain, Stabilin-1 does not bind hyaluronic acid due to the non-functional nature of this domain (Weigel2019Discovery). The protein's structure supports its role in the clearance of various ligands, including acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL), SPARC, and placental lactogen (Olsavszky2021Exploring).

## Function
Stabilin-1 (STAB1) is a multifunctional scavenger receptor protein involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a scavenging receptor and adhesion molecule, playing a crucial role in the clearance of extracellular ligands and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Stabilin-1 is expressed on lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells and type 2 immunosuppressive macrophages, where it mediates the uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) and model antigens like ovalbumin (OVA) (Palani2011Stabilin‐1CLEVER‐1).

In macrophages, stabilin-1 is involved in intracellular processes and is localized to cytoplasmic granular structures, potentially shuttling to the plasma membrane under certain conditions (POLITZ2002Stabilin1). It is implicated in cell adhesion and interaction with the extracellular matrix, suggesting a role in integrating extracellular events with intracellular signal transduction (POLITZ2002Stabilin1).

Stabilin-1 also supports leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, modulating angiogenesis and immune regulation. It is constitutively present on lymphatic endothelium and inducible on vascular endothelium under inflammatory conditions (Palani2011Stabilin‐1CLEVER‐1). Its expression is regulated by cytokines, with IL-4 and dexamethasone increasing its expression, while IFNγ suppresses it (POLITZ2002Stabilin1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STAB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), STAB1 expression levels serve as a prognostic factor. Lower STAB1 expression is associated with better survival outcomes, including longer event-free survival and overall survival. This suggests that STAB1 expression could influence the effectiveness of treatments, such as venetoclax, a BCL2-targeting drug (Lin2019Identification).

Biallelic pathogenic variants in STAB1 are linked to hereditary hyperferritinemia, a condition characterized by elevated serum ferritin levels without iron overload. These variants lead to a complete loss of stabilin-1 protein expression, affecting ferritin metabolism and clearance (Monfrini2022BiallelicSTAB1pathogenic).

In the context of cancer, STAB1 expression on macrophages contributes to immunosuppression in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) induced by the BRAF V600E mutation. Blocking STAB1 can reactivate CD8+ T cells within tumors, indicating its role in immune modulation (Spourquet2022BRAFV600E). These findings highlight the clinical significance of STAB1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Stabilin-1 (STAB1) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with a novel chitinase-like protein (SI-CLP), which is upregulated in alternatively activated macrophages and secreted via the lysosomal pathway. This interaction is mediated by the fasciclin domain 7 of stabilin-1, and it is crucial for the intracellular sorting of SI-CLP into lysosomes (Kzhyshkowska2006Novel).

Stabilin-1 also interacts with the adaptor protein GULP, which is involved in stabilin-1-mediated phagocytosis. GULP binds to the NPxF motif in the cytoplasmic region of stabilin-1 through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. This interaction is essential for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, as demonstrated by decreased phagocytosis upon GULP knockdown (Park2010Adaptor).

Additionally, stabilin-1 binds to growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) through its fasciclin domain 7, a feature shared with stabilin-2. This interaction is part of the endocytic pathway for GDF-15 clearance (Schledzewski2012Deficiency). Stabilin-1's interactions highlight its role in immune response modulation and cellular clearance mechanisms.
