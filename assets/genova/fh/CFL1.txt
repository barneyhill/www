# CFL1

## Overview
CFL1 is a gene that encodes the protein cofilin 1, a member of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Cofilin 1 is a small, actin-binding protein that facilitates the severing and depolymerization of actin filaments, thereby contributing to the turnover and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Kanellos2016Cellular; Xing2024The). This protein is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell motility, chemotaxis, and contractility, and is involved in both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions, such as nuclear transport of actin and transcriptional regulation (Kanellos2016Cellular; Xing2024The). The activity of cofilin 1 is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications, which modulate its interaction with actin and its role in cellular dynamics (Weng2023Nterminal; Xing2024The). Given its significant involvement in actin dynamics, cofilin 1 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it influences cell migration and invasion (Werle2021Unraveling; KARP2020Cofilin1).

## Structure
Cofilin 1 (CFL1) is a small actin-binding protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa, consisting of about 166 amino acids. Its primary structure includes an actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain, which is crucial for its function in actin binding and severing (Shishkin2016Cofilin1; Xing2024The). The secondary structure of CFL1 features two pairs of α-helices sandwiched by a mixed β-fold, forming a compact, globular tertiary structure essential for its interaction with actin filaments (Shishkin2016Cofilin1; Xing2024The). CFL1 functions as a monomer and does not have a quaternary structure (Weng2023Nterminal).

CFL1 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity by inhibiting or activating its binding to actin. Phosphorylation at serine 3 by LIM kinases inactivates CFL1, while dephosphorylation reactivates it (Weng2023Nterminal; Xing2024The). Another significant modification is N-terminal α-amino SUMOylation, which enhances CFL1's binding to F-actin and promotes actin depolymerization (Weng2023Nterminal). These modifications are crucial for CFL1's role in actin dynamics and cellular processes.

## Function
Cofilin 1 (CFL1) is a critical regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in healthy human cells. It binds to actin filaments, promoting their severing and depolymerization, which is essential for actin filament turnover and reorganization (Kanellos2016Cellular; Xing2024The). CFL1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, chemotaxis, and contractility, by facilitating actin filament dynamics (Kanellos2016Cellular). It plays a significant role in cell locomotion and invasion by generating free actin filament ends necessary for actin polymerization and depolymerization (Bravo-Cordero2013Functions).

CFL1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it is involved in nuclear transport of actin, essential for transcriptional activity and maintaining nuclear architecture (Kanellos2016Cellular; Xing2024The). It interacts with RNA polymerase II, contributing to transcriptional elongation and gene expression regulation (Kanellos2016Cellular). CFL1 also influences lipid metabolism and cell proliferation by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton in response to mechanical signals (Kanellos2016Cellular).

The activity of CFL1 is regulated by phosphorylation, with LIM kinases inhibiting its interaction with actin through phosphorylation, and phosphatases like slingshot and chronophin activating it through dephosphorylation (Kanellos2016Cellular; Xing2024The). This regulation is crucial for processes such as cell migration, wound healing, and maintaining epithelial and endothelial barrier functions (Xing2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Cofilin-1 (CFL1) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in actin filament dynamics, which affects cell motility and invasion. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CFL1 is overexpressed, contributing to leukemogenesis by maintaining prosurvival signaling and affecting cell migration, chemotaxis, and apoptosis (KARP2020Cofilin1). In pancreatic cancer, CFL1 overexpression is linked to enhanced cell migration and resistance to apoptosis, with its silencing leading to decreased levels of key cell cycle proteins such as STAT3, MYC, and CCND1 (Werle2021Unraveling). 

CFL1 is also implicated in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, where its upregulation correlates with advanced disease stages and lymphatic metastasis. Knockdown of CFL1 in these cancer cells results in reduced growth, increased apoptosis, and decreased invasion (WU2016The). In glioma, CFL1 contributes to radioresistance, with its downregulation enhancing radiosensitivity and reducing cell migration and invasion (DU2014Increasing). 

In gallbladder cancers, high CFL1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yang2013CFL1). These findings highlight CFL1's clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
Cofilin 1 (CFL1) is a key regulator of actin dynamics, interacting with various proteins and complexes to modulate actin filament turnover. CFL1 binds to actin monomers and filaments, promoting their depolymerization and severing, which is crucial for cell motility and structure (Shishkin2016Cofilin1; Xing2024The). It interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to facilitate actin nucleation and branching, essential for cell movement and the formation of lamellipodia (Shishkin2016Cofilin1).

CFL1's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, primarily at serine residue 3, by LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2), which inactivates its actin-binding ability (Hamill2016Structural; Xing2024The). This phosphorylation is a critical regulatory mechanism, as LIMK1 specifically recognizes and phosphorylates CFL1, affecting its interaction with actin (Hamill2016Structural).

CFL1 also interacts with proteins such as cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) and actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1), which promote actin filament disassembly (Xing2024The). Additionally, CFL1 is involved in nuclear processes, where it transports actin into the nucleus, influencing gene transcription and chromatin remodeling (Xing2024The). These interactions highlight CFL1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its regulation by various signaling pathways.
