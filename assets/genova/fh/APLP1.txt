# APLP1

## Overview
APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein, which is a member of the amyloid precursor protein family. The protein, also referred to as APLP1, is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and functions as a synaptic cell adhesion molecule. It plays a critical role in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and the maintenance of dendritic spines and basal synaptic transmission in neurons (Dunsing2017Direct; Schilling2017APLP1). APLP1 is characterized by its large extracellular domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and its involvement in neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, through interactions with proteins like α-synuclein (Mao2024Aplp1). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its importance in synaptic maintenance and function, particularly in the context of aging and neurodegeneration (Schilling2017APLP1).

## Structure
APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1) is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the amyloid precursor protein family, which includes APP and APLP2. The protein features a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain contains E1 and E2 domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Dahms2015Interaction).

The E2 domain of APLP1 is highly conserved and plays a significant role in binding to heparan sulfate (HS), involving two distinct binding modes. This domain is composed of five alpha-helices, forming a coiled-coil-like fold and a four-helix bundle. The E2 domain can form an antiparallel dimeric assembly, which is functionally connected to heparin binding (Dahms2015Interaction). The interaction with HS is facilitated by a positively charged surface patch on the E2 domain, which allows for specific recognition and binding of heparin chains (Dahms2015Interaction).

APLP1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization. The gene also has several splice variants, potentially affecting its structural and functional properties. The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in synaptic maturation during cortical development (Lenkkeri1998Structure).

## Function
APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1) is a synaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in maintaining dendritic spines and basal synaptic transmission in neurons. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons, and is involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Dunsing2017Direct; Schilling2017APLP1). APLP1 supports the maintenance of dendritic spines and basal synaptic transmission by promoting presynaptic differentiation through transcellular interactions, potentially involving both homotypic and heterotypic interactions with other APP family members (Schilling2017APLP1). 

APLP1 exhibits strong trans-dimerization properties and prominent cell surface localization, which contribute to its role as a synaptic adhesion molecule (Schilling2017APLP1). It forms homotypic trans complexes at cell-cell contacts, and its synaptogenic activity is enhanced by zinc, which induces the formation of large adhesion platforms (Dunsing2017Direct). APLP1's slower endocytosis rate compared to other APP family members results in higher cell surface levels, which may enhance its synaptic functions (Schilling2017APLP1). These molecular activities are essential for synaptic maintenance and function, particularly in the context of aging (Schilling2017APLP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interaction of the APLP1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. APLP1 is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it is found in dystrophic neurites and senile plaques. Its expression is upregulated in response to genotoxic stress, potentially enhancing neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration, which aligns with observations in Alzheimer's disease brains (Guilarte2008Increased; Tang2007Amyloidβ).

In the context of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, APLP1 plays a critical role in the transmission and pathogenesis of pathologic α-synuclein. APLP1 interacts with the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3) to facilitate the binding, internalization, and transmission of α-synuclein, contributing to neurodegeneration. Disruption of the APLP1-Lag3 interaction can prevent the spread of α-synuclein and associated neurodegenerative processes, suggesting that targeting this interaction could be a therapeutic strategy (Mao2024Aplp1).

Increased expression of APLP1 has also been observed in the frontal cortex of manganese-exposed non-human primates, indicating cellular stress and potential dysregulation of amyloid precursor protein processing, which may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions (Guilarte2008Increased).

## Interactions
APLP1, a member of the amyloid precursor protein family, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in synaptic adhesion and neurodegenerative processes. APLP1 interacts with Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3) to facilitate the binding, internalization, and transmission of pathologic α-synuclein, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. This interaction is mediated through the E1 domain of APLP1 and the D2 and D3 domains of Lag3, enhancing the uptake of α-synuclein and contributing to its spread and neurodegeneration (Mao2024Aplp1).

APLP1 also forms homotypic trans complexes at cell-cell contacts, which are essential for its role as a zinc-dependent cell-cell adhesion receptor. This interaction is facilitated by the cellular cytoskeleton and is crucial for APLP1-mediated cell-cell adhesion (Dunsing2017Direct).

Additionally, APLP1 interacts with matriptase, a serine protease, which binds to the ectodomain of APLP1 and cleaves it, affecting its homodimerization. This interaction is specific to matriptase and does not occur with matriptase-2, indicating a selective binding process (Lanchec2020Matriptase).
