# NSL1

## Overview
The NSL1 gene encodes the NSL1 protein, a vital component of the MIS12 kinetochore complex, which is integral to the process of chromosome segregation during cell division. The NSL1 protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a crucial role in the assembly and stability of the kinetochore, a key structure for the attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. This attachment is essential for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, thereby preventing aneuploidy and ensuring genomic stability (Scharfenberger2003Nsl1p). The NSL1 protein is active at the centromere during mitosis, contributing to the establishment of bipolar spindle-kinetochore interactions, which are necessary for the proper segregation of sister chromatids (Scharfenberger2003Nsl1p). Through its interactions with other kinetochore components, NSL1 is pivotal in maintaining the integrity and function of the kinetochore, underscoring its importance in cell division and genomic maintenance (Petrovic2010The; Richter2016Network).

## Function
The NSL1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the MIS12 kinetochore complex, which plays a vital role in chromosome segregation during cell division. In healthy human cells, NSL1 is involved in the assembly and stability of the kinetochore, a structure essential for the proper attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. This attachment ensures accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, preventing aneuploidy and maintaining genomic stability (Scharfenberger2003Nsl1p).

NSL1 is active at the centromere region of chromosomes during mitosis, where it contributes to the establishment of bipolar spindle-kinetochore interactions. These interactions are crucial for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell, a process necessary for successful cell division (Scharfenberger2003Nsl1p). The protein's role in maintaining kinetochore integrity is underscored by its involvement in the docking of the Dam-Duo complex onto the kinetochore, which is important for kinetochore-microtubule interactions (Scharfenberger2003Nsl1p).

In summary, NSL1 is essential for the proper function of the kinetochore, ensuring the fidelity of chromosome segregation and contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability in dividing cells.

## Interactions
NSL1 is a critical component of the MIS12 complex, which plays a significant role in kinetochore assembly and function. NSL1 interacts with other subunits of the MIS12 complex, including NNF1, MIS12, and DSN1, forming a stable complex essential for kinetochore assembly (Petrovic2010The). The C-terminal region of NSL1 is crucial for its interactions with the NDC80 complex (NDC80C) and KNL1, both of which are key components of the KMN network, a major structural and functional unit of the kinetochore (Petrovic2010The).

NSL1's interaction with NDC80C is mediated by its PVIHL motif, which is essential for binding, although this motif is not conserved across all species (Petrovic2010The). NSL1 also interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), although this interaction is competitive with NDC80C, as both proteins bind to overlapping sites on NSL1 (Petrovic2010The).

In Drosophila, NSL1 interacts with the Mis12-Nnf1a heterodimer, forming a complex that is crucial for binding centromeric CENP-C, a key component in kinetochore assembly (Richter2016Network). These interactions highlight NSL1's central role in maintaining kinetochore integrity and function.
