# SEC22B

## Overview
SEC22B is a gene that encodes the SEC22 homolog B, a vesicle trafficking protein that is part of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) family. This protein is integral to intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. As a member of the longin SNARE family, SEC22B is characterized by a conserved N-terminal longin domain and a C-terminal SNARE domain, which are crucial for its role in vesicle fusion and trafficking (Daste2015Structure). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including antigen cross-presentation, secretory autophagy, and the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells (Ellie2020Sec22b; Sun2020The). SEC22B's interactions with other SNARE proteins and its involvement in ER-plasma membrane contact sites underscore its importance in maintaining cellular organization and function (Petkovic2014The). Additionally, alterations in SEC22B have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Sun2020The).

## Structure
The SEC22B protein is a member of the longin SNARE family, characterized by a conserved N-terminal longin domain and a C-terminal SNARE domain. The longin domain, approximately 120-140 amino acids in length, features an α-β-α sandwich architecture and serves as a regulatory module in membrane trafficking (Daste2015Structure). This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins and regulates the assembly of the trans-SNARE complex, acting as an 'on/off' switch for fusogenic activity (Daste2015Structure).

The N-terminal domain of SEC22B, specifically in the mouse homolog mSec22b, has been crystallized, revealing a mixed α-helical/β-sheet fold. This structure is similar to the actin/polyproline binding protein profilin, suggesting potential functional similarities (Gonzalez2001A). The N-terminal domain is independently stable and does not interact with its own SNARE domain, unlike other SNARE proteins such as syntaxin 1A (Gonzalez2001A).

SEC22B also contains a transmembrane domain, which distinguishes it from other longin SNAREs like Ykt6 that are membrane-targeted through lipid anchors (Daste2015Structure). The protein is involved in forming quaternary complexes with other SNAREs, such as rbet1, membrin, and syntaxin 5, facilitating vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Gonzalez2001A).

## Function
The SEC22B gene encodes a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein is involved in both anterograde and retrograde vesicular transport, facilitating the fusion of ER-derived COPII vesicles with Golgi membranes and retrograde-directed COPI vesicles with the Golgi membranes (Sun2020The). SEC22B is part of a quaternary SNARE complex with other proteins such as rbet1, membrin, and syntaxin 5, which are essential for maintaining cellular organization and function (Gonzalez2001A).

In endothelial cells, SEC22B is crucial for the biogenesis and morphology of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), which are storage organelles containing von Willebrand factor (VWF), a key protein in hemostasis. The protein influences the elongation of WPBs by controlling the rate of anterograde transport between the ER and Golgi. Depletion of SEC22B results in shorter WPBs, Golgi disintegration, and retention of VWF in the ER, leading to reduced VWF secretion (Ellie2020Sec22b).

SEC22B is also involved in the immune system, particularly in antigen cross-presentation and secretory autophagy, where it facilitates the fusion of autophagosomes with the plasma membrane (Sun2020The). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining plasma cell numbers and function, as its absence leads to a significant reduction in plasma cells and circulating antibodies (Bonaud2022Plasma).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEC22B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, SEC22B mutations have been frequently detected, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Sun2020The). In neurodegenerative diseases, SEC22B is associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In Alzheimer's, SEC22B may influence disease progression through autophagy, affecting β-amyloid accumulation. In Parkinson's, overexpression of SEC22B can reduce α-synuclein-dependent toxicities (Sun2020The).

SEC22B also plays a role in infectious diseases. It is involved in the intracellular replication of Legionella pneumophila and the pathological processes of parasitic infections like Leishmania by mediating vesicle fusion events (Sun2020The). In metabolic conditions, SEC22B is crucial for lipid and amino acid metabolism in response to glucagon signaling. Alterations in SEC22B expression can lead to changes in liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels, potentially impacting conditions like atherosclerosis (Wu2024Phosphoproteomicsdirected).

Furthermore, SEC22B is essential for embryonic development, with its deletion resulting in embryonic lethality, highlighting its critical role in development and potential implications in developmental disorders (Wu2019SNARE).

## Interactions
SEC22B is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in vesicle trafficking. It is a component of the SNARE complex, interacting with proteins such as STX5, GOSR2/BOS1, and BET1, or alternatively with STX18, BNIP1/SEC20L, and USE1L, to facilitate vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (Sun2020The). SEC22B can also be replaced by YKT6 in some SNARE complexes, indicating its flexible role in vesicle fusion processes (Sun2020The).

In the context of ER-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites, SEC22B interacts with the PM Q-SNARE Stx1, forming a trans-SNARE bridge that brings the ER and PM into close proximity without causing fusion. This interaction is important for non-vesicular lipid regulation and transfer, contributing to plasma membrane expansion during neurite growth (Petkovic2014The). SEC22B also co-immunoprecipitates with lipid transfer proteins Osh2 and Osh3, which are enriched at ER-PM contact sites, suggesting a role in lipid modulation and signaling (Petkovic2014The).

Additionally, SEC22B interacts with ORP8 at ER-phagosome contact sites, facilitating lipid exchange crucial for phagosome maturation. This interaction is specific, as SEC22B co-immunoprecipitates with ORP8 but not ORP5 in certain cellular contexts (Criado2023Sec22b). These interactions highlight SEC22B's multifaceted role in cellular processes involving membrane contact sites and vesicle trafficking.
