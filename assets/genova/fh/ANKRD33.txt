# ANKRD33

## Overview
ANKRD33 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 33 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the retina, particularly in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, where it is implicated in visual acuity and color discrimination. ANKRD33 is associated with photoreceptor membranes and interacts with proteins such as HPCAL-1, suggesting its involvement in calcium-dependent processes and photoreceptor cell signaling. Although the specific functions of ANKRD33 in human cells are not fully understood, its expression pattern and interactions indicate a significant role in retinal biology and potentially in transcriptional regulation (rostamirad2010identification; ochocinska2012neurod1).

## Structure
ANKRD33 is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These ankyrin repeats are conserved motifs of 33 residues that form a helix-turn-helix conformation, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (rostamirad2010identification). The bovine ANKRD33 protein contains five ankyrin repeats located at the N-terminus, with no additional domains identified at the C-terminus (rostamirad2010identification). Each ankyrin repeat consists of two alpha helices separated by beta hairpin loops, forming a helix-turn-helix structure (rostamirad2010identification).

Despite lacking transmembrane domains, ANKRD33 is associated with membranes, likely through interactions with transmembrane proteins or membrane phospholipids. This association was demonstrated by solubilization experiments using Triton X-100 (rostamirad2010identification). The protein appears as a double band in solubilized form, suggesting possible post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (rostamirad2010identification).

The human ANKRD33 gene has a high degree of homology with its mouse and bovine counterparts, with the mouse homolog, ANKRD33B, having three isoforms due to alternative splicing (rostamirad2010identification). However, specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structure of ANKRD33 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ANKRD33 is a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. In the retina, ANKRD33 is predominantly expressed in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, with a stronger signal in cone cells, suggesting a role in visual acuity and color discrimination (rostamirad2010identification). The protein is associated with photoreceptor membranes, indicating potential interactions with transmembrane proteins or membrane phospholipids (rostamirad2010identification). ANKRD33 interacts with HPCAL-1, a neuronal calcium sensor protein, suggesting involvement in calcium-dependent processes in photoreceptor cells (rostamirad2010identification).

ANKRD33 may function as a transcriptional cofactor, as it is involved in transcriptional regulation processes in the retina (rostamirad2010identification). It is also implicated in the modulation of photoreceptor gene expression, potentially influencing photoreceptor biology through its interaction with transcription factors like NeuroD1 (ochocinska2012neurod1). Although the specific function of ANKRD33 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression pattern and interactions suggest a significant role in retinal cell signaling and structural organization.

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD33 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its precise role in disease remains under investigation. Alterations in DNA methylation patterns of ANKRD33 have been associated with excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), which can influence fetal and neonatal body composition. This includes increased neonatal weight and fat mass, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism by which maternal weight gain affects offspring health (Argentato2023Excessive).

In the context of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), ANKRD33 is among the genes whose expression is dysregulated following the silencing of HHT-related genes. The drug Brivanib has been shown to inhibit ANKRD33 expression in vitro, although this effect was not observed in ex vivo human lung tissue, indicating a complex interaction with the disease's molecular pathways (Ali2022Identifying).

Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near ANKRD33 that are associated with increased energy intake, suggesting a genetic contribution to energy balance and potentially obesity-related traits (Jiang2018A). However, specific diseases directly linked to ANKRD33 mutations remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
ANKRD33, a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, is involved in several protein-protein interactions within the retina. It has been identified in the outer segments of photoreceptor cells, specifically in rods and cones, with a stronger expression in cones (rostamirad2010identification). ANKRD33 interacts with hippocalcin-like protein 1 (HPCAL-1), a member of the neuronal calcium sensor family, which is involved in calcium modulation in neuronal and retinal cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct and physical interaction between ANKRD33 and HPCAL-1 (rostamirad2010identification).

Mass spectrometry analysis also identified potential interacting partners of ANKRD33, including the α1 subunit of transducin and peripherin, although further in vitro studies did not confirm an interaction with peripherin (rostamirad2010identification). The presence of ANKRD33 in the membrane fraction of retinal cells, despite lacking transmembrane domains, suggests it may interact with membrane-associated proteins or phospholipids (rostamirad2010identification). These interactions highlight ANKRD33's potential role in calcium-dependent pathways and phototransduction processes in the retina.
