# PCTP

## Overview
The PCTP gene encodes the phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP), a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism, specifically facilitating the transfer of phosphatidylcholine between cellular membranes, which is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and membrane integrity. Structurally, PC-TP is characterized by a helix-grip fold that forms a hydrophobic pocket, allowing it to bind phosphatidylcholine with high specificity. Functionally, PC-TP operates predominantly in the cytosol and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including gene transcription regulation and interaction with other proteins such as THEM2 and Pax3, which suggests a broader role in cellular signaling pathways (Kanno2007Interacting; Kanno2007Structure). The gene's expression and regulation have clinical significance, particularly in cardiovascular health, where alterations in PCTP expression are linked to increased risks of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events (Mao2017Transcription).

## Structure
The phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP), also known as StarD2, is characterized by a structure centered on an antiparallel β-sheet of nine strands surrounded by four α-helices. A notable feature is the long C-terminal α-helix that overlays a tunnel accommodating a single phosphatidylcholine molecule. This lipid-binding tunnel is formed by the β-sheet, three α-helices, and omega loops, accommodating approximately 89% of the phosphatidylcholine molecule (Kanno2007Structure). The choline headgroup of the lipid engages in cation-π interactions within an aromatic cage formed by Trp 101, Tyr 114, and Tyr 155, which explains the specificity of PCTP for phosphatidylcholine (Kanno2007Structure).

PCTP belongs to the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain superfamily and exhibits a helix-grip fold configuration that forms a unique hydrophobic pocket. This pocket is created by the central β-sheet and the C-terminal α-helix, distinguishing it from other lipid-binding proteins (Kanno2007Structure). The C-terminus of PCTP contains a membrane-binding domain, with the α4 helix subdivided into a membrane-spanning helix (α4a) and an amphipathic helix (α4b), facilitating the extraction of phosphatidylcholine when α4a penetrates the membrane (Kanno2007Structure). The protein functions as a monomer and does not typically form quaternary structures.

## Function
Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP), encoded by the PCTP gene, is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related transfer (START) domain superfamily. It plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the transfer of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) between cellular membranes. This process is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and membrane composition in healthy human cells (Roderick2002Structure; Kanno2007Structure).

PC-TP is primarily active in the cytosol, with some presence in the nucleus, suggesting potential involvement in gene transcription regulation (Kanno2007Structure). The protein binds phosphatidylcholine in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex, with a preference for specific acyl chain compositions, and facilitates the exchange of phosphatidylcholine between membranes (Roderick2002Structure; Kanno2007Structure). This exchange is regulated by membrane charge and curvature, which influence PC-TP's association and dissociation with membranes (Kanno2007Structure).

PC-TP also interacts with other proteins, such as Them2, enhancing its acyl-CoA thioesterase activity, and potentially coactivates transcription factors like Pax3, indicating a broader role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation (Kanno2007Interacting). These interactions suggest that PC-TP functions as a phosphatidylcholine-sensing molecule, engaging in various regulatory activities depending on the cellular context (Kanno2007Interacting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCTP gene have been associated with various cardiovascular events. Increased expression of PCTP in platelets is linked to enhanced platelet responses and a higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and death in patients with cardiovascular disease (Mao2017Transcription). The transcription factor RUNX1 regulates PCTP expression, and its haplodeficiency leads to decreased PCTP expression, contributing to platelet dysfunction (Songdej2019Inherited; Mao2017Transcription). RUNX1 mutations, which affect PCTP expression, are also associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (Songdej2017Hematopoietic).

Racial differences in PCTP expression have been observed, with higher expression linked to increased platelet aggregation and calcium mobilization in black subjects compared to white subjects, potentially influencing cardiovascular risk (Mao2017Transcription). The regulation of PCTP by RUNX1 and its variants may play a role in the pathogenesis of platelet-mediated cardiovascular events, suggesting that PCTP could serve as a novel biomarker or therapeutic target for preventing myocardial infarction (Mao2017Transcription).

## Interactions
Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP) interacts with several proteins, influencing various biological processes. One significant interaction is with thioesterase superfamily member 2 (THEM2). PCTP modulates the acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of THEM2, particularly in the liver, where a specific molar ratio of PCTP to THEM2 (1:2) is optimal for activity. This interaction may help organize THEM2 monomers into active dimers (Kanno2007Interacting). PCTP also enhances the phosphatidylcholine transfer activity of THEM2, with the effect leveling off at a THEM2:PCTP molar ratio of approximately 2:1 (Kanno2007Interacting).

PCTP interacts with the transcription factor Pax3, suggesting a potential coactivation role in transcriptional activity (Kanno2007Interacting). The interaction between PCTP and Pax3 was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid assays and GST pulldown assays (Kanno2007Interacting).

In the context of insulin signaling, PCTP forms a complex with THEM2, which suppresses the activation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). This interaction stabilizes the TSC1-TSC2 complex, inhibiting mTOR signaling and affecting glucose homeostasis (Ersoy2013Phosphatidylcholine).
