# TRIP11

## Overview
The TRIP11 gene encodes the protein thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11, also known as Golgi-associated microtubule-binding protein 210 (GMAP-210), which is a member of the golgin family of proteins. GMAP-210 is characterized by its large coiled-coil regions that facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus. This protein is involved in vesicular trafficking within the endomembrane system, particularly in tethering vesicles to the cis-Golgi membrane and facilitating the transport of proteins to the ciliary membrane. GMAP-210's interactions with small GTPases and its role in ciliogenesis underscore its importance in cellular processes such as polarized secretion and signaling pathways. Mutations in the TRIP11 gene can lead to severe skeletal disorders, highlighting its critical role in skeletal development and cellular function (Lowe2019The; Upadhyai2021Biallelic; Follit2008The).

## Structure
The TRIP11 gene encodes the Golgi-associated microtubule-binding protein 210 (GMAP-210), which is a member of the golgin family of proteins. GMAP-210 is characterized by large coiled-coil regions that facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in maintaining the Golgi complex structure and function (Follit2008The). The protein contains GRIP and GRAB domains at the C-terminus, which bind to small GTPases in the ARF and ARL subfamilies, and an ALPS domain at the N-terminus that preferentially binds to curved membranes (Follit2008The). This structural organization suggests that GMAP-210 may function to hold small vesicles at the end of a long tether, playing a significant role in vesicular trafficking within the endomembrane system (Follit2008The).

The IFT20 binding domain is located within a 163 amino acid region of the GMAP-210 coiled-coil domain, which is conserved in vertebrates (Follit2008The). This domain is essential for anchoring IFT20 to the Golgi complex, facilitating the transport of proteins to the ciliary membrane (Follit2008The). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in polarized secretion and ciliary protein localization (Follit2008The).

## Function
The TRIP11 gene encodes the protein GMAP-210, which is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus in healthy human cells. GMAP-210 is involved in tethering vesicles to the cis-Golgi membrane, interacting with the small GTPase Arf1, and facilitating the trafficking of cargo proteins from the Golgi to the cilium (Lowe2019The). It plays a role in both ER-derived and retrograde intra-Golgi transport vesicles, essential for the proper secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, which is critical for skeletal development and bone morphogenesis (Lowe2019The).

GMAP-210 is also involved in ciliogenesis through its interaction with IFT20, necessary for the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are important for various cellular functions, including signaling pathways (Upadhyai2021Biallelic). The protein's interaction with Rab2 is crucial for its functionality, linking tethering with processes vital for Golgi integrity (Sato2015Coupling). Mutations in TRIP11 can lead to severe skeletal disorders, such as achondrogenesis type 1A, due to impaired vesicle tethering and ciliary function (Lowe2019The; Costantini2021Oligogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIP11 gene are associated with a spectrum of skeletal dysplasia conditions, most notably achondrogenesis type 1A (ACG1A) and odontochondrodysplasia (ODCD). ACG1A is a lethal chondrodysplasia characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities, including micromelia, short trunk, narrow chest, and craniofacial malformations. This condition is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TRIP11, leading to a complete loss of the Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP-210) function, which is crucial for normal skeletal development (Upadhyai2021Biallelic; Medina2020Pathogenic).

ODCD, a milder form of skeletal dysplasia, results from hypomorphic mutations in TRIP11, leading to partial loss of GMAP-210 function. Patients with ODCD exhibit features such as short stature, joint laxity, and dental anomalies like dentinogenesis imperfecta (Medina2020Pathogenic; Costantini2021Oligogenic). The presence of alternative normal transcripts in some cases may account for the less severe phenotype observed in ODCD compared to ACG1A (Medina2020Pathogenic).

Mutations in TRIP11 can also lead to disruptions in the Golgi apparatus and primary cilia, affecting protein trafficking and ciliary function, which are essential for skeletal development (Upadhyai2021Biallelic). These disruptions highlight the gene's critical role in maintaining cellular structures necessary for normal development.

## Interactions
TRIP11, also known as GMAP210, is involved in several critical protein interactions. It anchors the IFT20 subunit of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) particle to the Golgi complex, which is essential for the proper localization of IFT20 and the trafficking of proteins to the ciliary membrane (Follit2008The). This interaction is crucial for maintaining ciliary function and structure, as evidenced by the shorter cilia and reduced polycystin-2 levels observed in GMAP210-deficient cells (Follit2008The).

TRIP11 also interacts with Rab2, a Golgi-localized Rab protein, through its coiled-coil region. This interaction is specific to the active, GTP-locked form of Rab2, indicating TRIP11's role as an effector protein in vesicle tethering and Golgi-derived vesicle accumulation (Sato2015Coupling).

In the context of renal cancer, TRIP11 acts as a coactivator of transcription mediated by the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). It enhances THR-dependent transcription in the presence of triiodothyronine (T3) and binds to ARNT (HIF-1β), contributing to the activation of HIF-1α-regulated genes (Popławski2015The).
