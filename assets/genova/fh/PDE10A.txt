# PDE10A

## Overview
PDE10A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphodiesterase 10A, a member of the phosphodiesterase family of enzymes. This enzyme is categorized as a dual-specific phosphodiesterase due to its ability to hydrolyze both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which are pivotal secondary messengers in cellular signaling pathways. PDE10A is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within the striatum, where it plays a critical role in modulating basal ganglia circuitry and dopamine signaling pathways. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining the balance of cyclic nucleotide levels, thereby influencing neuronal excitability and function. Alterations in the PDE10A gene have been associated with various neurological disorders, including childhood-onset chorea and bipolar disorder, as well as oncological conditions such as ovarian cancer (Borneman2022Phosphodiesterase; Esposito2017A; Schülke2017Current).

## Structure
The PDE10A protein is composed of 779 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 88,411 Da (Fujishige1999Cloning). Its primary structure includes a putative cGMP binding sequence and a catalytic domain, which shows 40-47% identity with other phosphodiesterases such as PDE2A, PDE5A, PDE6A, and PDE6B (Fujishige1999Cloning). The secondary structure of the PDE10A catalytic domain consists of 15 α-helices and lacks β-strands, sharing topological similarities with other PDE family members (Wang2007Structural).

The GAF-B domain of PDE10A forms a dimer in both crystal and solution, primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions between helical bundles (Handa2008Crystal). This domain contains a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet sandwiched by a three-helix bundle and three short helices on each side (Handa2008Crystal). The GAF-B domain binds cAMP tightly within a cNMP-binding pocket, with specific residues involved in the recognition of cAMP (Handa2008Crystal).

PDE10A is known to have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, and common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation. The enzyme is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons, playing a role in regulating striatal output (Handa2008Crystal).

## Function
PDE10A (phosphodiesterase 10A) is a dual-specific phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP, which are critical secondary messengers in cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, PDE10A is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the striatum, where it plays a crucial role in modulating basal ganglia circuitry. This enzyme is involved in the regulation of dopamine signaling pathways by affecting the phosphorylation of DARPP-32, a key protein in dopamine signaling. Phosphorylated DARPP-32 acts as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1), thereby influencing downstream signaling cascades (Schülke2017Current).

PDE10A is primarily active in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum, where it regulates postsynaptic cyclic nucleotide signaling. Its activity ensures proper neuronal excitability and function by degrading cAMP and cGMP, thus maintaining the balance of cyclic nucleotide levels (Xie2006Cellular; Schülke2017Current). The enzyme's role in cyclic nucleotide metabolism is essential for various physiological processes, including motor control and cognitive functions (Fujishige1999Cloning). PDE10A's modulation of these pathways is critical for maintaining proper neuronal activity and behavior (Schülke2017Current).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDE10A gene have been implicated in several neurological and oncological conditions. In neurological disorders, dominant mutations in PDE10A, such as p.F300L and p.F334L, are associated with childhood-onset chorea, characterized by involuntary movements and bilateral striatal lesions on MRI. These mutations often arise de novo and lead to non-progressive movement disorders with diurnal fluctuations (Mencacci2016De; Esposito2017A). Recessive mutations, like p.Y107C and p.A116P, result in a more severe phenotype, including delayed motor and language milestones and mild intellectual disability (Esposito2017A).

In the context of cancer, PDE10A expression is altered in ovarian cancer, where high mRNA levels correlate with poor prognosis. PDE10A is involved in oncogenic pathways such as MAPK and Wnt signaling, and its inhibition has shown potential in reducing tumor growth and progression (Borneman2022Phosphodiesterase). In bipolar disorder, rare variants in PDE10A have been linked to the disease, particularly affecting cAMP signaling in the brain (MacMullen2016Novel). These findings highlight PDE10A as a significant factor in both neurological and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) interacts with various proteins, influencing its localization and function. The PDE10A2 isoform undergoes palmitoylation at cysteine 11 (Cys-11), which is crucial for its association with the plasma membrane. This process is mediated by the protein acyltransferases ZDHHC-7 and ZDHHC-19, which facilitate the incorporation of palmitate into PDE10A2 (Charych2010Interplay). Phosphorylation at threonine 16 (Thr-16) by protein kinase A (PKA) interferes with this palmitoylation, preventing membrane association and affecting the protein's trafficking to distal dendrites (Charych2010Interplay).

PDE10A also interacts with its isoforms, such as PDE10A19, which can influence the localization of PDE10A2. When co-expressed, PDE10A19 can sequester PDE10A2 in the cytosol, preventing its membrane association. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical interaction between these isoforms (MacMullen2016Novel). The interaction between PDE10A19 and PDE10A2 suggests a regulatory mechanism that could impact cAMP signaling and medium spiny neuron excitability, with potential implications for neuropsychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder (MacMullen2016Novel).
