# GBP4

## Overview
GBP4 (guanylate binding protein 4) is a gene that encodes a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which is involved in the immune response. The protein product, guanylate binding protein 4, is characterized by its GTPase activity, which is essential for its role in binding and hydrolyzing GTP, a common feature among guanylate-binding proteins (Tripal2007Unique). GBP4 is primarily involved in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of viral infections, by interacting with key regulatory proteins such as interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) (Zhang2021When). It acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon production, thereby influencing the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation (Zhang2021When). Additionally, GBP4 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in shaping the tumor microenvironment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it correlates with immune checkpoint genes and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (Zhou2024Guanylate). The gene's expression is induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and it is distributed throughout both the nucleus and cytoplasm, allowing it to participate in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and pathogen clearance (Tripal2007Unique; Zhang2021When).

## Structure
GBP4 (guanylate binding protein 4) is a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, characterized by its involvement in the immune response. The protein structure of GBP4 includes a GTPase domain, which is crucial for its function in binding and hydrolyzing GTP. This domain is a common feature among guanylate-binding proteins and plays a significant role in their biological activity.

The primary structure of GBP4 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its unique properties and functions. In terms of secondary structure, GBP4 is composed of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of GBP4 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its role in the immune response.

GBP4 may also undergo post-translational modifications, which can influence its function and localization within the cell. These modifications are critical for the regulation of its activity and its ability to respond to various cellular signals. Additionally, splice variants of GBP4 can exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functional properties. These structural features and modifications are integral to the protein's role in the immune system.

## Function
GBP4 (guanylate binding protein 4) is a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in the context of viral infections. GBP4 is involved in the regulation of the immune response by interacting with the IFN-I regulator factor 7 (IRF7), a crucial component in the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I) in response to viral infections. GBP4 disrupts the interaction between TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IRF7, leading to reduced TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination and transactivation of IRF7. This results in a decrease in the production of IFN-I triggered by virus infection, indicating that GBP4 acts as a negative regulator of IFN-I production. The knockdown of GBP4 leads to increased production of IFN-I, suggesting that in healthy cells, GBP4 may help to modulate the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation or autoimmunity (Zhang2021When).

GBP4 is distributed throughout both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, allowing it to participate in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and pathogen clearance (Zhang2021When). Its expression is prominently induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Tripal2007Unique).

## Clinical Significance
Guanylate binding protein 4 (GBP4) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in immune response and tumor microenvironment modulation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high GBP4 expression is associated with an inflamed tumor microenvironment, characterized by increased immune cell infiltration and upregulation of immune checkpoint genes such as PD-1/PD-L1. This suggests that GBP4 may serve as a biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC patients (Zhou2024Guanylate). GBP4 is also linked to the regulation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) networks, which are associated with antitumor immunity, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Zhou2024Guanylate).

In cattle, GBP4 has been identified as a positional candidate gene for adult stature, with copy number variations (CNVs) in GBP4 negatively correlated with cattle stature. These CNVs affect the expression of GBP4 and nearby genes, suggesting that structural mutations in GBP4 may influence phenotypic variations such as body weight and withers height (Cao2018Integrating). While the study primarily focuses on cattle, it highlights the potential impact of GBP4 CNVs on gene expression and phenotype, which may have implications for understanding similar mechanisms in humans.

## Interactions
GBP4 (guanylate binding protein 4) is involved in several interactions that influence its function in immune response and cellular processes. GBP4 can form heterodimers with other guanylate-binding proteins, such as GBP-3, which affects its localization within the cell. When GBP4 forms heterodimers with prenylated GBPs like GBP-1, GBP-2, and GBP-5, its localization is directed by these prenylated partners, indicating a hierarchical influence on its intracellular distribution (Britzen-Laurent2010Intracellular).

In the context of viral infections, GBP4 interacts with the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) through its N-terminal domain. This interaction disrupts the connection between IRF7 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to reduced TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination and transactivation of IRF7. This mechanism suggests that GBP4 negatively regulates the production of type I interferons (IFN-I) during viral infections (Zhang2021When).

GBP4 is also associated with immune regulation in cancer, particularly in shaping the tumor microenvironment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It correlates with immune checkpoint genes and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses within tumors (Zhou2024Guanylate). However, specific physical interactions of GBP4 with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature.
