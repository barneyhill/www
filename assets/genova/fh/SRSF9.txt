# SRSF9

## Overview
SRSF9, or serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 9, is a gene that encodes a member of the SR protein family, which is integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. The protein product of SRSF9, also known as serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 9, functions primarily within the nucleus, where it plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the spliceosome, a complex essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor due to its involvement in alternative splicing, a process that allows for the generation of multiple mRNA variants from a single gene, thereby contributing to protein diversity and the regulation of gene expression (Yoshino2012Tumor; Luo2024SRSF9). SRSF9's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Zhang2022High; Wang2022SRSF9).

## Function
SRSF9 (serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 9) is a member of the SR protein family, which plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, SRSF9 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to RNA and facilitates the assembly of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. This activity influences gene expression and protein diversity by regulating alternative splicing, allowing individual genes to produce multiple mRNA variants and, consequently, different protein isoforms (Yoshino2012Tumor).

SRSF9's involvement in alternative splicing impacts various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development. By modulating the splicing of pre-mRNA, SRSF9 contributes to the precise control of gene expression patterns necessary for normal cellular function and organismal development. The protein's activity in the nucleus underscores its role in ensuring the fidelity and efficiency of mRNA processing, which is essential for the proper translation of genetic information into functional proteins (Luo2024SRSF9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF9 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of SRSF9 is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. This overexpression is linked to the Wnt signaling and cell cycle pathways, contributing to tumor progression. SRSF9 expression is regulated by DNA methylation, with hypomethylation correlating with higher expression and worse outcomes (Zhang2022High).

In glioblastoma (GBM), SRSF9 promotes cell proliferation and migration by enhancing CDK1 expression, a key cell cycle regulator. This upregulation is associated with poor survival in GBM patients, suggesting SRSF9 as a potential prognostic marker (Luo2024SRSF9).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SRSF9 is overexpressed and linked to tumor progression, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. It acts as an m6A-binding protein, stabilizing DSN1 mRNA, which is crucial for chromosome segregation and centromere stability. This stabilization promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting SRSF9's role as a proto-oncogene in CRC (Wang2022SRSF9).

## Interactions
SRSF9, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor, is involved in various interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, playing a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing regulation. SRSF9 interacts with specific RNA sequences to influence alternative splicing. For instance, it targets the AAGAC sequence downstream of the CD44 v10 exon, inhibiting its inclusion in the splicing process (Oh2020Opposite). In the context of Caspase-2 pre-mRNA, SRSF9 binds to the AGGAG sequence in exon 10, regulating the alternative splicing of this gene (Ha2021SRSF9).

SRSF9 also participates in interactions with DNA. In glioblastoma, SRSF9 binds to the promoter region of the CDK1 gene, enhancing its transcription and promoting cell proliferation and migration (Luo2024SRSF9). This interaction was confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, which demonstrated a direct association between SRSF9 and the CDK1 promoter (Luo2024SRSF9).

In colorectal cancer, SRSF9 acts as an m6A-binding protein, stabilizing DSN1 mRNA by binding to m6A-modified sites, which enhances mRNA stability and promotes cancer progression (Wang2022SRSF9). These interactions highlight SRSF9's role in regulating gene expression through both RNA and DNA binding.
