# CLK4

## Overview
CLK4, or CDC-like kinase 4, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase belonging to the Cdc2-like kinase family. The protein product, CDC-like kinase 4, is characterized by its kinase activity, which plays a pivotal role in regulating pre-mRNA splicing and other cellular processes. As a member of the CMGC kinase group, CLK4 is distinguished by its conserved structural motifs, including the 'EHLAMMERILG' motif, which is typical of the LAMMER family of kinases. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it phosphorylates serine/arginine-rich domains of splicing factors, thereby influencing spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing. Beyond its role in RNA processing, CLK4 is involved in maintaining genomic stability during cell division and has been implicated in cardiac function through its interaction with proteins such as Aurora B kinase and nexilin. The dual role of CLK4 in various diseases, including cancer and cardiac pathophysiology, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Song2023Cdc2like; Petsalaki2016Clks; Huang2022CDClike).

## Structure
CLK4, a member of the Cdc2-like kinase family, exhibits a highly conserved structural topology shared among its family members. The protein consists of a flexible, unstructured N-terminal region and a conserved kinase domain. The N-terminal region resembles RS domains found in its target SR protein substrates, facilitating interactions and phosphorylation (Song2023Cdc2like). The catalytic domain of CLK4 displays a typical kinase fold with an N-lobe and a C-lobe connected by a hinge region, forming a conserved ATP binding pocket. The N-lobe includes three β-strands and an α-helix, while the C-lobe contains three conserved structural insertions: a β-hairpin insertion, a LAMMER domain, and a MAPK-like insertion. These motifs are crucial for substrate recognition and binding specificity (Song2023Cdc2like).

CLK4 is part of the CMGC kinase group and contains an 'EHLAMMERILG' motif located at the C-terminus, which is characteristic of the LAMMER family (Song2023Cdc2like). The protein primarily functions in the nuclear compartment, phosphorylating the serine/arginine-rich domain of splicing factors, which is essential for regulating pre-mRNA splicing (Song2023Cdc2like). The DFG sequence motif in the C-lobe is essential for inhibitor and substrate binding (Song2023Cdc2like).

## Function
CLK4 (CDC-like kinase 4) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in RNA splicing and phosphorylation activities. CLK4 is active in the nucleus, where it phosphorylates serine/arginine-rich proteins, influencing spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing, which are crucial for gene expression regulation and impact cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation (Song2023Cdc2like).

In addition to its role in splicing, CLK4 is involved in maintaining genomic stability during cell division. It regulates the aurora B-dependent abscission checkpoint, preventing chromatin breakage during cytokinesis. CLK4, along with CLK1 and CLK2, localizes to the midbody and is necessary for the phosphorylation of Aurora B at serine 331, which is crucial for the proper timing of midbody resolution and preventing DNA damage (Petsalaki2016Clks).

CLK4 also plays a role in cardiac function by phosphorylating nexilin (NEXN) at serine 437, which is important for regulating cardiac function and preventing pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac health and function (Song2023Cdc2like; Huang2022CDClike).

## Clinical Significance
CLK4 (CDC like kinase 4) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in cellular processes such as phosphorylation and splicing. In cardiac pathophysiology, CLK4 deficiency is linked to pathological myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. This is primarily due to its role in modulating the phosphorylation of Nexilin (NEXN), a protein crucial for cardiac function. Reduced phosphorylation of NEXN in CLK4-deficient conditions leads to cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that CLK4 is a potential therapeutic target for heart failure (Huang2022CDClike).

In cancer, CLK4 exhibits dual roles depending on the cancer type. In mesenchymal triple-negative breast cancer (MES-TNBC), CLK4 is upregulated and acts as an oncogene, promoting cell invasion and metastasis through modulation of TGF-β signaling. Conversely, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CLK4 is downregulated and functions as a tumor suppressor, with its activity linked to the methylation status of its promoter (Song2023Cdc2like). These findings highlight the complex role of CLK4 in cancer, where its expression and activity can either promote or suppress tumor development depending on the context. The potential for CLK4 inhibitors as therapeutic agents in cancer treatment is also being explored (ElHady2017Development).

## Interactions
CLK4 (CDC-like kinase 4) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. CLK4 interacts with Aurora B kinase, a key player in the regulation of the abscission checkpoint during cytokinesis. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of Aurora B at serine 331, which is necessary for the proper localization and function of the abscission protein Chmp4c. The phosphorylation of Aurora B by CLK4 helps prevent chromatin breakage by delaying abscission in cells with chromatin bridges (Petsalaki2016Clks).

CLK4 also interacts with nexilin (NEXN), an F-actin-binding protein, and phosphorylates it at serine 437. This phosphorylation is essential for regulating cardiac function and preventing pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The interaction between CLK4 and NEXN has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and the phosphorylation of NEXN by CLK4 is a key mechanism in maintaining cardiac health (Song2023Cdc2like; Huang2022CDClike).

These interactions highlight CLK4's role in both cell division and cardiac function, demonstrating its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cardiac health through specific protein interactions.
