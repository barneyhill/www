# ATP13A2

## Overview
ATP13A2 is a gene that encodes the ATPase cation transporting 13A2 protein, a member of the P5B subfamily of P-type ATPases. This protein is primarily localized in the lysosomal membranes and is involved in the transport of polyamines and cations, such as manganese, across these membranes. The ATPase cation transporting 13A2 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of polyamines and protecting against metal-induced cytotoxicity. Structurally, it features several key domains, including nucleotide-binding, phosphorylation, and actuator domains, and contains ten transmembrane segments that facilitate its function as a transporter. Mutations in the ATP13A2 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Kufor-Rakeb syndrome and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, highlighting its importance in neuroprotection and cellular health (Ramirez2006Hereditary; van2020ATP13A2; Demirsoy2017ATP13A2PARK9).

## Structure
The ATP13A2 protein, encoded by the ATP13A2 gene, is a member of the P5B subfamily of P-type ATPases. It features a canonical architecture with several key domains: the nucleotide-binding (N) domain, the phosphorylation (P) domain, and the actuator (A) domain, which are crucial for ATP binding, cleavage, and phosphorylation (Sim2021Structural; Mateeva2021Structural). The protein includes ten transmembrane segments (TMs 1-10), which are typical for eukaryotic P-type ATPases, and these segments form a substrate-binding pocket with a negative electrostatic potential, suitable for attracting positively charged polyamines (Sim2021Structural).

The N-terminal domain (NTD) contains three short hydrophobic α-helices embedded in the cytosolic leaflet of the lipid bilayer, while the C-terminal extension (CTE) is crucial for ATPase activity and structural stability (Chen2021CryoEM; Sim2021Structural). The protein's structure alternates between E1 and E2 conformations, with the E1 state associated with ATP binding and cleavage, leading to autophosphorylation of Asp513 (Mateeva2021Structural). The CTE interacts with the P domain through hydrogen bonds, and its truncation impairs protein stability (Chen2021CryoEM). ATP13A2 is involved in polyamine transport within lysosomes and is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (Chen2021CryoEM).

## Function
The ATP13A2 gene encodes a P5-type ATPase that is primarily localized in the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments of cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the transport of polyamines and cations, particularly manganese (Mn2+), across lysosomal membranes (van2014Cellular; Tan2011Regulation). In healthy human cells, ATP13A2 functions as a lysosomal polyamine exporter, transporting polyamines such as spermidine and spermine from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol. This activity is essential for preventing polyamine accumulation, which can lead to lysosomal dysfunction and cell death (van2020ATP13A2).

ATP13A2 also plays a protective role against manganese-induced cytotoxicity by reducing intracellular manganese concentrations and preventing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, a key step in apoptosis (Tan2011Regulation). The protein's activity is ATP-dependent and is crucial for maintaining metal ion balance, particularly in the brain, where it is highly expressed (Tan2011Regulation). Additionally, ATP13A2 is involved in the regulation of endo-/lysosomal cargo sorting and proteostasis, contributing to cellular protection against mitochondrial stress and metal toxicity (Demirsoy2017ATP13A2PARK9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP13A2 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). KRS is an autosomal recessive form of juvenile-onset parkinsonism characterized by symptoms such as spasticity, supranuclear gaze palsy, and dementia. Mutations in ATP13A2 lead to loss of function, resulting in impaired lysosomal function and protein dysfunction, which are central to the pathogenesis of KRS (Ramirez2006Hereditary; Park2015The). 

The gene is also implicated in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), where single heterozygous mutations and altered expression levels have been observed. These mutations may act as risk factors or modifiers of disease onset, potentially through mechanisms involving zinc dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction (Park2015The). 

In addition to KRS and PD, ATP13A2 mutations are associated with NCLs, a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of lipopigment in the brain and retina. This overlap suggests a shared pathological pathway involving lysosomal dysfunction (Yang2014Mutations; Bras2012Mutation). The ATP13A2 gene's role in these conditions highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegeneration.

## Interactions
ATP13A2, a lysosomal P-type ATPase, interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as vesicular trafficking and lysosomal function. Using the split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system, 43 novel interactors of ATP13A2 were identified, including proteins like HSPA8, AAK1, and VAMP2, which are involved in clathrin-mediated vesicular trafficking and SNARE-dependent membrane fusion (Usenovic2012Identification). The interaction with HDAC6 suggests ATP13A2's involvement in lysosomal degradation pathways, which is crucial for protein clearance and mediating α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity (Usenovic2012Identification).

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interactions with several proteins, including FLAG-HDAC6, FLAG-NIX, EGFP-SYT11, EGFP-GAK, EGFP-AAK1, HA-YIF1A, and EGFP-HSPA8, in HEK293FT cells (Usenovic2012Identification). These interactions were further analyzed using bioinformatics tools to extract a network of interacting proteins, visualized using NAViGaTOR software, and categorized based on GO annotations (Usenovic2012Identification).

The study also highlights the role of ATP13A2 interactors in modulating α-synuclein misfolding and toxicity, particularly in dopamine neurons, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases (Usenovic2012Identification).
