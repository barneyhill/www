# GPA33

## Overview
GPA33 is a gene that encodes the glycoprotein A33, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is predominantly expressed in the intestinal epithelium, where it plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion and maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier. Glycoprotein A33 is characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling processes. The protein's expression is notably high in colorectal and gastric cancers, making it a significant target for cancer immunotherapy. Its interactions with tight junction proteins and the cytoskeleton underscore its importance in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Moore2018Development; Ackerman2008A33; Williams2015Glycoprotein).

## Structure
Glycoprotein A33 (GPA33) is a cell surface antigen that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein is characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains, which are integral to its function in cell adhesion and signaling. These domains contribute to the protein's tertiary structure, facilitating interactions with other cellular components. GPA33 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably glycosylation, which can affect its stability, localization, and function. The presence of potential splice variant isoforms suggests a level of functional diversity, allowing GPA33 to participate in various cellular processes within the gastrointestinal tract. The specific structural configuration of GPA33, including its immunoglobulin-like domains and glycosylation patterns, underscores its role in mediating cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways.

## Function
Glycoprotein A33 (GPA33) is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the intestinal epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier. It is involved in cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions between epithelial cells. This function is vital for preserving the selective permeability of the intestinal barrier, allowing nutrient absorption while preventing the entry of harmful substances (Williams2015Glycoprotein).

GPA33 is enriched at cell-cell junctions along the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells throughout the intestine, from the crypts to the villi tips, indicating its role in cell adhesion and signaling within the gastrointestinal tract (Williams2015Glycoprotein). The protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and features two immunoglobulin-like domains, suggesting a role in cell-cell recognition processes (Heath1997The).

In healthy cells, GPA33 contributes to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by supporting the structural integrity of the epithelial layer. Its expression is crucial for normal intestinal function, and its deficiency can lead to increased intestinal permeability and susceptibility to inflammation (Williams2015Glycoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
GPA33, or glycoprotein A33, is a cell surface antigen prominently expressed in colorectal and gastric cancers. In colorectal cancer, GPA33 is universally expressed across primary and metastatic tumors, including cancer stem cell populations, making it a significant target for immunotherapy. The bispecific DART protein MGD007 has been developed to target GPA33, facilitating T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against GPA33-expressing colorectal cancer cells. This approach has shown promise in preclinical models, demonstrating significant tumor growth inhibition and T-cell activation (Moore2018Development).

In gastric cancer, GPA33 is part of a panel of intestinal differentiation markers, including CDX2 and LI-cadherin, which are associated with favorable prognosis. High expression of GPA33 correlates with better overall survival in gastric cancer patients. The expression of GPA33 is regulated by transcription factors such as CDX2, and its presence is linked to tumor-free resection margins, while its absence is associated with lymph-node metastasis (Lopes2020A). These findings suggest that alterations in GPA33 expression can impact cancer progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance in gastrointestinal cancers.

## Interactions
The glycoprotein A33 (GPA33) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. GPA33 is known to be expressed on the surface of colon tumor cell lines and is associated with tight junctions (TJs) in these cells. It partially colocalizes with tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1, suggesting potential interactions with these proteins (Ackerman2008A33). The intracellular domain of GPA33 shows high homology to occludin, indicating possible interactions with the cytoskeleton and ZO-1, a TJ linking protein (Ackerman2008A33). 

GPA33's persistence on the cell surface is linked to the cytoskeleton, as disrupting actin or microtubules leads to its internalization, implying stabilization through cytoskeletal interactions (Ackerman2008A33). The antigen's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is further supported by its potential tethering to the membrane or incorporation into large protein complexes, such as tight junctions (Ackerman2008A33). 

In the context of immunotherapy, GPA33 is targeted by bispecific DART proteins like MGD007, which facilitate T-cell-mediated cytolysis of cancer cells by binding to both GPA33 and CD3 on T cells (Moore2018Development). This interaction leads to T-cell activation and cytokine production, highlighting GPA33's role in immune response modulation (Moore2018Development).
