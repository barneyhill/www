# SERPING1

## Overview
The SERPING1 gene encodes the serpin family G member 1 protein, commonly known as C1 inhibitor (C1INH), which is a critical regulator of the complement and contact systems. As a member of the serpin superfamily, C1INH functions as a serine protease inhibitor, playing a vital role in controlling inflammation and maintaining vascular permeability. The protein is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma, where it inhibits proteases such as C1r, C1s, and kallikrein, thereby preventing excessive activation of the complement system. Mutations in the SERPING1 gene can lead to hereditary angioedema (HAE), a genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling due to uncontrolled bradykinin production. The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in both dominant and recessive forms of HAE, with a wide array of mutations contributing to the disease's genetic heterogeneity (Szabó2022Overview; Drouet2022SERPING1; Haslund2018Dominantnegative).

## Structure
The SERPING1 gene encodes the C1 inhibitor (C1INH) protein, a member of the serpin superfamily. The primary structure of C1INH consists of a single polypeptide chain that is highly glycosylated, contributing to its stability and function (Ponard2019SERPING1). The secondary structure includes three β-sheets (A-C) and nine α-helices, which are characteristic of the serpin fold (Ponard2019SERPING1; Haslund2018Dominantnegative). 

The tertiary structure of C1INH is defined by its serpin fold, which is crucial for its inhibitory function. This structure includes a reactive center loop (RCL) that acts as a bait for target proteases. Upon cleavage by a protease, the RCL inserts into the central β-sheet A, stabilizing the protein in a thermodynamically stable conformation (Drouet2022SERPING1). 

C1INH's quaternary structure involves interactions with target proteases, forming complexes that are cleared by the liver (Drouet2022SERPING1). The protein can also form aggregates due to certain mutations, which can lead to intracellular retention and reduced secretion, a phenomenon observed in hereditary angioedema (Haslund2018Dominantnegative). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the protein's stability and function (Ponard2019SERPING1). The SERPING1 gene is known to have splice variants, which may result in different isoforms with potential functional differences (Ponard2019SERPING1).

## Function
The SERPING1 gene encodes the C1 inhibitor (C1INH), a crucial protein in regulating the complement and contact systems, which are integral to the immune response and inflammation control. C1INH is a member of the serpin superfamily and functions primarily by inhibiting serine proteases such as C1r, C1s, and kallikrein. This inhibition prevents excessive activation of the complement system, thereby avoiding unnecessary inflammation and tissue damage (Ponard2019SERPING1; Lubbers2020Expression).

In healthy individuals, C1INH is predominantly produced by hepatocytes and is present in the plasma at concentrations of 0.21-0.39 g/l. It is also synthesized by other cell types, including monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (Haslund2018Dominantnegative). C1INH acts as a suicide inhibitor, binding irreversibly to its target proteases and undergoing a conformational change upon enzymatic cleavage, which allows it to function only once (Lubbers2020Expression).

The protein's regulatory role is essential for maintaining vascular permeability and preventing excessive vasodilation, which can lead to edema. It is also involved in the regulation of the fibrinolytic and contact systems, further contributing to its role in controlling inflammation and coagulation (Haslund2018Dominantnegative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPING1 gene are primarily associated with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling. This condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although rare recessive variants have also been identified. HAE is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) protein, which is encoded by SERPING1. This deficiency leads to uncontrolled activation of the kallikrein-kinin system, resulting in excessive production of bradykinin, a peptide that increases vascular permeability and causes angioedema (Maia2023Recessive; Szabó2022Overview; Haslund2018Dominantnegative).

There are two main types of HAE associated with SERPING1 mutations: type I, characterized by reduced levels of C1-INH, and type II, where a dysfunctional C1-INH is produced. In some cases, mutations lead to intracellular retention of C1-INH, reducing its secretion and contributing to the disease's severity (Xu2020Hereditary; Haslund2018Dominantnegative). The genetic heterogeneity of SERPING1 mutations is significant, with numerous variants identified, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, as well as large deletions and duplications (Szabó2022Overview; Drouet2022SERPING1).

## Interactions
The SERPING1 gene encodes the C1 inhibitor (C1INH) protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating the complement and contact systems. C1INH interacts with several proteins, including C1r, C1s, kallikrein, and factor XIIa, inhibiting their protease activity to control inflammation and prevent excessive activation of the complement system. These interactions are essential for maintaining vascular permeability and preventing angioedema (Drouet2022SERPING1).

Mutations in the SERPING1 gene can lead to dominant-negative effects, where mutant C1INH proteins interact with wild-type C1INH, resulting in intracellular retention and aggregation. This is particularly evident in hereditary angioedema (HAE) type I, where certain SERPING1 variants, such as c.551_685del, cause the formation of aggregates due to protein-protein interactions between normal and mutated C1INH proteins. These aggregates are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing the secretion of functional C1INH (Haslund2018Dominantnegative).

The p.S150F mutation in SERPING1 also demonstrates a dominant-negative effect by forming strong interactions with wild-type C1INH, leading to reduced secretion and increased polymerization of the protein. This interaction is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HAE (Yasuno2021Evidence).
