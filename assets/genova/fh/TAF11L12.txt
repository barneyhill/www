# TAF11L12

## Overview
TAF11L12 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 12, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The TAF11L12 protein interacts with other transcription factors and coactivators to facilitate the transcription of specific genes, thereby influencing various cellular processes. Its function and interactions are critical for maintaining normal cellular activities and may have implications in understanding certain diseases and developmental processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
