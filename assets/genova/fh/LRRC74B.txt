# LRRC74B

## Overview
The LRRC74B gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 74B, which is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for various cellular processes. Although the specific function of LRRC74B is not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are often implicated in signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response. The LRRC74B protein is thought to play a role in these processes, potentially influencing cellular communication and structural integrity. Further research is needed to fully understand the biological pathways and interactions involving LRRC74B.
