# TPRG1L

## Overview
TPRG1L, or tumor protein p63 regulated 1 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This protein is implicated in cell-cycle regulation and inflammatory responses, playing a significant role in both normal cellular function and disease states. TPRG1L is notably upregulated in certain conditions, such as human cytomegalovirus infection, where it contributes to the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Additionally, it is a target of regulatory RNA molecules, such as the tRNA-derived fragment tRF-3013b, which can modulate its expression and impact cellular proliferation, particularly in cancer contexts like gallbladder cancer. The gene's interactions and regulatory mechanisms make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by dysregulated NF-κB signaling and inflammation (Lau2020Human; Liu2019TERC; Zou2022tRF3013b).

## Clinical Significance
The TPRG1L gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In gallbladder cancer (GBC), TPRG1L is a significant factor in tumor proliferation. The tRNA-derived fragment tRF-3013b targets TPRG1L, leading to its downregulation and subsequent inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell-cycle regulation. This interaction suggests that TPRG1L overexpression can promote GBC cell proliferation, and its downregulation by tRF-3013b can inhibit tumor growth, indicating a potential therapeutic target for GBC (Zou2022tRF3013b).

In the context of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, TPRG1L is upregulated, which activates the NF-κB pathway and increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6. The HCMV long non-coding RNA1.2 suppresses this cytokine release by blocking NF-κB activation, suggesting that TPRG1L plays a role in inflammatory responses during viral infections (Lau2020Human).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TPRG1L in cancer proliferation and immune response modulation, suggesting that alterations in its expression or interactions can have profound effects on disease progression and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
TPRG1L is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. It is a direct target of the tRNA-derived fragment tRF-3013b, which binds to the 3′-UTR of TPRG1L mRNA, leading to its degradation. This interaction is facilitated by the argonaute protein AGO3, which is known to bind tRFs and participate in gene expression regulation (Zou2022tRF3013b). TPRG1L also plays a role in activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in cell-cycle regulation and inflammatory responses (Lau2020Human; Zou2022tRF3013b).

In the context of human cytomegalovirus infection, TPRG1L is upregulated and contributes to the activation of NF-κB, leading to increased IL-6 production. This suggests that TPRG1L can trigger NF-κB activation independently of the TNF pathway (Lau2020Human). Additionally, TPRG1L is one of the genes regulated by TERC, a long non-coding RNA, which binds to its promoter region and enhances its transcription. This interaction is part of TERC's role in promoting cellular inflammatory responses by stimulating the NF-κB pathway (Liu2019TERC).
