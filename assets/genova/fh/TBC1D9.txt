# TBC1D9

## Overview
TBC1D9 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 9, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and autophagy. The protein is characterized by the presence of GRAM domains, a TBC domain, and an EF-hand motif, which contribute to its role in membrane-associated processes, GTPase-activating functions, and calcium signaling, respectively (Nozawa2020TBC1D9; Nakamura2015Expression). TBC1 domain family member 9 is implicated in the activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) during selective autophagy, such as xenophagy and mitophagy, through calcium-dependent mechanisms (Nozawa2020TBC1D9). Additionally, the protein's interaction with Rab GTPases and ubiquitin suggests its involvement in membrane trafficking and ubiquitin recognition (Nozawa2020TBC1D9; Nakamura2015Expression). In the context of cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, TBC1D9 is associated with improved survival outcomes, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Kothari2020Machine).

## Structure
TBC1D9 is a protein that contains several distinct domains contributing to its function. The primary structure of TBC1D9 includes two GRAM domains located at amino acids 146-213 and 293-361, a TBC domain spanning amino acids 515-702, and an EF-hand motif at amino acids 886-921 (Nozawa2020TBC1D9). The GRAM domains are involved in membrane-associated processes, while the TBC domain is characteristic of proteins that regulate Rab GTPases, suggesting a role in GTPase-activating functions (Nakamura2015Expression). The EF-hand motif is a calcium-binding domain, which is crucial for the protein's role in calcium signaling during autophagy (Nozawa2020TBC1D9).

TBC1D9 also has a region hypothesized to bind ubiquitin, spanning amino acids 926 to 1100, which is important for its interaction with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains during xenophagy (Nozawa2020TBC1D9). The protein exists in at least two isoforms: isoform 1 contains both GRAM domains and the TBC domain, while isoform 2 is shorter and includes only the TBC domain (Nakamura2015Expression). These structural features enable TBC1D9 to interact with various proteins and participate in autophagic processes.

## Function
TBC1D9 is a protein involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and cellular signaling pathways. It plays a significant role in the activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) during selective autophagy processes such as xenophagy and mitophagy. TBC1D9 is recruited to intracellular pathogens and damaged mitochondria, where it facilitates TBK1 activation through calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This process is crucial for the recruitment of autophagy adaptors like NDP52 and the ULK1 complex, which are essential for autophagosome formation and cellular defense mechanisms (Nozawa2020TBC1D9).

TBC1D9 contains a Ca2+-binding motif and interacts with ubiquitin-positive bacteria, indicating its role in Ca2+-dependent ubiquitin recognition. It is involved in the recruitment of TBK1 to ubiquitinated targets, a process dependent on Ca2+ signaling mediated by the IP3R pathway. TBC1D9's interaction with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin suggests it may function as an autophagy receptor, although it is not a master regulator of autophagy (Nozawa2020TBC1D9).

In the context of cancer, TBC1D9 is associated with better survival outcomes in breast cancer patients, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Its expression is linked to maintaining cellular integrity and regulating processes like cell migration and membrane repair (Kothari2020Machine).

## Interactions
TBC1D9 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab7 and Rab9, suggesting its involvement in regulating membrane trafficking pathways associated with these proteins. TBC1D9 shows strong co-localization with constitutively active mutants of Rab9 (Q66L) and weaker co-localization with Rab7 (Q67L), indicating a preference for binding to GTP-bound Rab proteins (Nakamura2015Expression).

In the context of autophagy, TBC1D9 interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), specifically binding to its phosphorylated form (p-TBK1) but not to a nonphosphorylated mutant. This interaction is crucial for TBK1 activation during xenophagy and mitophagy, processes that involve the recruitment of autophagy adaptors like NDP52 and the ULK1 complex (Nozawa2020TBC1D9). TBC1D9 also interacts with ubiquitin, particularly Lys63-linked polyubiquitin, which is essential for its recruitment to ubiquitinated targets such as damaged mitochondria and intracellular bacteria (Nozawa2020TBC1D9).

In triple-negative breast cancer, TBC1D9 interacts with ARL8A, a GTPase involved in lysosome trafficking, and PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1), which plays a role in mitosis. These interactions suggest that TBC1D9 may regulate processes like cell migration and mitosis by modulating the activity of these proteins (Kothari2020Machine).
