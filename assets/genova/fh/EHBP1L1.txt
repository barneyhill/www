# EHBP1L1

## Overview
EHBP1L1 (EH domain binding protein 1 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in endocytic trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. The protein, characterized by the presence of EH (Eps15 homology) domains, plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions, particularly in binding to NPF motifs. EHBP1L1 is integral to cellular processes such as the regulation of lysosomal accumulation of membrane proteins and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. It interacts with various proteins, including Rab8, kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), and components of the BIN1-dynamin complex, facilitating intracellular transport and membrane dynamics. The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular structure and function. Mutations in the EHBP1L1 gene have been linked to several human and canine diseases, highlighting its clinical importance (Østergård2022EHBP1L1; Shamseldin2021Lethal).

## Structure
EHBP1L1 encodes a protein involved in endocytic trafficking, characterized by the presence of EH (Eps15 homology) domains. These domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions, typically binding to NPF motifs in other proteins. The protein's structure includes various secondary structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall tertiary structure. The presence of EH domains suggests a role in facilitating interactions necessary for endocytic processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in EHBP1L1, potentially influencing its function and interactions. These modifications can alter the protein's activity, stability, and interaction with other cellular components. The existence of splice variant isoforms of EHBP1L1 adds to its functional diversity, allowing the protein to participate in a range of cellular processes by altering its structure and interaction capabilities.

The tertiary structure of EHBP1L1, shaped by its secondary structural elements, supports its role in cellular trafficking. While specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, the presence of EH domains implies potential multimeric interactions, which are common in proteins involved in endocytic pathways. The structural features of EHBP1L1 underscore its importance in cellular trafficking and protein interaction networks.

## Function
EHBP1L1 (EH domain binding protein 1 like 1) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to endocytic trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. It functions as a binding protein for Rab8, a Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) essential for exocytosis toward the polarized plasma membrane. EHBP1L1 plays a significant role in the regulation of lysosomal accumulation of membrane proteins, particularly affecting the distribution of apical membrane proteins in polarized epithelial cells (Shamseldin2021Lethal).

The protein is also crucial for actin cytoskeletal organization and apical-directed transport, interacting with the BIN1-dynamin complex to generate membrane vesicles in the endocytic recycling compartment (Shelton2022An). EHBP1L1 is involved in the formation of tubular recycling endosomes and regulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in myocytes, which is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Østergård2022EHBP1L1).

EHBP1L1 interacts specifically with kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), suggesting a role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the context of membrane dynamics and vesicle trafficking (Jang2016The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, especially near the cell membrane, where it helps maintain cellular structure and facilitates intracellular transport (Hook2020TBC1D1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EHBP1L1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In humans, EHBP1L1 mutations are associated with non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) and recurrent fetal loss. These mutations include a homozygous deletion-insertion mutation and a splice variant leading to exon skipping, which disrupts cellular processes critical for development (Shamseldin2021Lethal). In dogs, particularly Labrador Retrievers and English Springer Spaniels, mutations in EHBP1L1 are linked to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and polymyopathy, as well as dyserythropoietic anemia and myopathy syndrome (DAMS). These conditions are characterized by anemia, muscle atrophy, and specific histopathological changes in muscle tissue (Shelton2022An; Østergård2022EHBP1L1).

Alterations in EHBP1L1 expression levels have also been implicated in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Hypomethylation at a specific DNA methylation site associated with EHBP1L1 is linked to increased expression levels in leukocytes and atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting a role in promoting atherosclerosis and increasing ACS risk (Long2024Genomewide). Additionally, EHBP1L1 expression is significantly increased in acute kidney injury (AKI), indicating its involvement in the disease's onset and progression (Li2022Machine).

## Interactions
EHBP1L1 interacts with kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, specifically binding to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of KLC1. This interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid screening and GST pull-down assays, demonstrating that EHBP1L1 binds to both full-length KLC1 and its coiled-coil domain. EHBP1L1 does not interact with other kinesin heavy chains like KIF5B and KIF3A, indicating a specific interaction with KLC1 (Jang2016The).

EHBP1L1 is also involved in the regulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in muscle cells through its interaction with TBC1D1, a Rab-GTPase-Activating Protein. This interaction was identified using a quantitative proteomics approach and validated by western blotting. EHBP1L1, along with other proteins, stably associates with TBC1D1 in C2C12 myotubes, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics (Hook2020TBC1D1).

In addition, EHBP1L1 is part of the RAB8 and BIN1-dynamin complex, which is significant for its role in myopathy and vesicle transport. This complex is involved in generating membrane curvature and excising vesicles at the endocytic recycling compartment (Østergård2022EHBP1L1).
