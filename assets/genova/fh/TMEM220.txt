# TMEM220

## Overview
TMEM220 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 220, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. TMEM220 has been shown to interact with multiple proteins, influencing key signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM220 plays a crucial role by modulating the localization and activity of transcription factors such as β-catenin and FOXO3, thereby affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell cycle progression (Li2021Downregulation). The gene's expression levels have been linked to clinical outcomes in cancer, with its downregulation associated with poor prognosis in HCC and gastric cancer (Li2021Downregulation). These characteristics highlight TMEM220's potential as a tumor suppressor and its relevance as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The TMEM220 gene has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its downregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Studies have shown that TMEM220 expression is significantly decreased in HCC tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, with a notable decrease in gene copy number and an increase in methylation levels in HCC tissues. This downregulation is linked to poor prognosis, as patients with higher TMEM220 expression exhibit better overall survival rates (Li2021Downregulation). Overexpression of TMEM220 in HCC cells has been shown to slow cell proliferation, reduce migratory and invasive capacities, and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Li2021Downregulation).

In addition to its role in HCC, TMEM220 expression is also downregulated in gastric cancer, indicating its potential involvement in other types of cancer (Li2021Downregulation). The gene's influence on key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt and FOXO pathways, further underscores its significance in cancer progression, affecting processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell growth (Li2021Downregulation). These findings suggest that TMEM220 could serve as a potential clinical biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
TMEM220, a transmembrane protein, has been identified to interact with several other proteins. Through affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), TMEM220 has shown interaction entries with seven different proteins. These interactions are significant given the challenges associated with studying membrane proteins like TMEM220 due to their hydrophobic nature, which complicates solubilization for proteomic assays (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM220 has been implicated in influencing key signaling pathways. Overexpression of TMEM220 affects the subcellular localization of β-catenin and FOXO3, two critical transcription factors. Specifically, β-catenin is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, reducing its transcriptional activity and inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conversely, FOXO3 is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to the p21 promoter, increasing its expression and arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase. These interactions suggest that TMEM220 negatively regulates β-catenin-mediated EMT through the AKT-GSK3β cascade and promotes FOXO3 nuclear accumulation to inhibit HCC cell growth (Li2021Downregulation). These findings highlight the potential role of TMEM220 in modulating cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins.
