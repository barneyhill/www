# KRTAP13-2

## Overview
KRTAP13-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 13-2, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is known for its involvement in the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of keratinized tissues. Keratin associated protein 13-2 is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the rigidity and strength of hair fibers. Variations in the KRTAP13-2 gene have been studied in relation to hair texture and other phenotypic traits, highlighting its significance in dermatological and genetic research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
