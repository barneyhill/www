# BANK1

## Overview
BANK1, or B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein predominantly expressed in B cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and is involved in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by CD40 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). BANK1 interacts with key signaling molecules such as Src family kinases, phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), and components of the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby influencing calcium mobilization, immune activation, and B cell differentiation (Dam2016The; Gómez2021The). The protein's involvement in these pathways is crucial for maintaining proper immune function and preventing the expansion of autoreactive B cells. BANK1's interactions with MyD88 and TRAF6 further highlight its role in innate immune signaling, impacting cytokine production and immune responses (Georg2019BANK1). Variants of the BANK1 gene have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis, underscoring its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Kozyrev2011The; Guo2009Replication).

## Structure


## Function
The BANK1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in B cell signaling by acting as a scaffold for the assembly of signaling complexes. In healthy human cells, BANK1 is primarily expressed in B cells and is involved in B cell receptor (BCR) and CD40 signaling pathways. It interacts with Src family kinases LYN and BLK, as well as phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), which are essential for BCR signaling (Dam2016The; Gómez2021The). BANK1 modulates BCR signaling through its interactions, influencing processes such as calcium mobilization and immune activation (Yokoyama2002BANK; BernalQuirós2013BANK1).

BANK1 also plays a role in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, affecting the levels of transcription factors like FOXO1, which are associated with B cell differentiation and memory B cell expansion (Dam2016The). Additionally, BANK1 is involved in innate immune signaling, particularly within the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, where it interacts with MyD88 and TRAF6, influencing cytokine production and immune responses (Georg2019BANK1). These interactions and signaling pathways are crucial for maintaining proper B cell function and preventing the expansion of autoreactive memory B cells (Dam2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BANK1 gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases, most notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Variants such as rs10516487 and rs17266594 have been linked to increased susceptibility to SLE by affecting mRNA splicing and protein isoform production, which can lead to enhanced B-cell receptor signaling and immune system dysregulation (Kozyrev2011The; Guo2009Replication). The BANK1 gene is also implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with certain polymorphisms like rs3733197 showing significant associations in specific populations (Orozco2009Study). 

In addition to SLE and RA, BANK1 variants have been associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), particularly diffuse systemic sclerosis, suggesting a broader role in autoimmune pathogenesis (Rueda2009BANK1). The gene's involvement in B-cell signaling pathways, including interactions with proteins like TRAF6 and MyD88, further underscores its role in immune regulation and the development of autoimmune conditions (Georg2019BANK1). Alterations in BANK1 expression or function can disrupt normal immune responses, contributing to the pathophysiology of these diseases (BernalQuirós2013BANK1).

## Interactions
BANK1 interacts with several key proteins involved in innate immune signaling, particularly in B cells. It interacts with TRAF6 and MyD88, which are crucial components of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. The interaction with MyD88 is facilitated by a putative conformational TIR domain encoded by exon 2. The BANK1-D2 isoform, lacking this TIR domain, shows reduced binding to MyD88 compared to the full-length BANK1 (BANK1-FL) (Georg2019BANK1). BANK1 also contains TRAF6 binding motifs, with the BANK1-FL isoform having four such motifs. The BANK1-D2 isoform, despite having an additional motif, shows decreased binding to TRAF6 (Georg2019BANK1).

BANK1 forms aggregate-like structures with TRAF6 in U2OS cells, indicating its role in the MyD88-TRAF6 signaling complex. This interaction is significant for modulating immune responses, particularly in the production of IFNalpha following TLR stimulation (Georg2019BANK1). The BANK1-40C variant, resulting from a single nucleotide polymorphism, shows increased interaction with MyD88 and is associated with higher IL-8 production (Georg2019BANK1). These interactions suggest BANK1's involvement in the regulation of B-cell signaling and its potential link to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Georg2019BANK1).
