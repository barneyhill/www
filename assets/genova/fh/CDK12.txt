# CDK12

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 12, a member of the kinase family involved in regulating transcription and RNA processing. The CDK12 protein forms a complex with cyclin K, which is essential for its kinase activity and function. As a kinase, CDK12 plays a pivotal role in transcription elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, facilitating the expression of genes critical for DNA repair and genomic stability (Bartkowiak2010CDK12; Blazek2011The). Additionally, CDK12 is involved in alternative splicing and the cellular response to DNA damage, making it crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (Chen2006Identification; Blazek2011The). Mutations in the CDK12 gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Popova2016Ovarian; Liu2021Targeting).

## Structure
CDK12 is a large cyclin-dependent kinase that forms a complex with cyclin K (CycK), which is crucial for its function. The primary structure of CDK12 includes a central kinase domain flanked by arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains, which are involved in RNA processing and splicing (DixonClarke2015Structures). The secondary structure features a unique C-terminal extension that includes an α K helix, which is important for ATP binding and kinase activity (Bösken2014The; DixonClarke2015Structures). This C-terminal extension is flexible and can adopt multiple conformations, contributing to the enzyme's catalytic activity (DixonClarke2015Structures).

The tertiary structure of CDK12 is characterized by a typical kinase fold with an N-terminal lobe and a C-terminal lobe, similar to other CDKs like CDK9 and CDK2 (Bösken2014The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a complex with CycK, which stabilizes the active conformation of CDK12 and enhances its substrate binding (DixonClarke2015Structures). CDK12 is subject to phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that stabilizes its active configuration (DixonClarke2015Structures). The kinase also contains a polybasic cluster in its C-terminal positions, which is involved in substrate interactions (DixonClarke2015Structures).

## Function
CDK12 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that plays a critical role in transcription elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, particularly at the Ser2 position. This phosphorylation is essential for overcoming early elongation blocks and ensuring the processivity of transcribing polymerases, which is crucial for the expression of genes involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (Bartkowiak2010CDK12; Blazek2011The). CDK12 is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation by recruiting specific phosphoCTD-associating proteins to the transcription elongation complex, which is vital for cell proliferation and RNA processing (Greenleaf2018Human).

In healthy human cells, CDK12 is also implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing. It interacts with cyclin L1 to phosphorylate splicing factors, influencing splicing site selection and modulating the splicing pattern of specific genes (Chen2006Identification). CDK12's activity is primarily nuclear, where it maintains genomic stability by regulating the expression of DNA damage response genes, such as BRCA1 and FANCI, and is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage (Blazek2011The). Its role in suppressing intronic polyadenylation is crucial for the production of full-length gene products, particularly those involved in homologous recombination repair (Dubbury2018CDK12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDK12 gene are associated with various cancers, including breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancers. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), CDK12 mutations lead to defects in DNA repair pathways, resulting in genomic instability characterized by large tandem duplications (Ekumi2015Ovarian; Popova2016Ovarian). These mutations impair the Cdk12/CycK complex, crucial for the expression of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair genes, making tumors more susceptible to PARP inhibitors (Ekumi2015Ovarian).

In breast cancer, CDK12 is often co-amplified with HER2, particularly in HER2-positive cases, and its overexpression can drive tumorigenesis by interacting with oncogenic pathways like WNT and IRS1-ErbB-PI3K (Liu2021Targeting; Filippone2022CDK12). CDK12 mutations in prostate cancer are linked to poor outcomes, fast metastasis, and progression of castration-resistant disease (Liu2021Targeting).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a specific CDK12 mutation (G879V) is associated with genomic instability and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy (Liu2021Targeting). CDK12 alterations are being explored as potential biomarkers for cancer therapy, particularly in response to immune checkpoint blockade (Liu2021Targeting).

## Interactions
CDK12 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function. It primarily associates with cyclin K, forming a complex essential for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is vital for transcription regulation and RNA processing (Lui2018CDK12:; Cheng2012Interaction). This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, highlighting cyclin K as the primary cyclin partner of CDK12 (Greenleaf2018Human).

CDK12 also interacts with cyclins L1 and L2, with both CDK12 S and CDK12 L isoforms associating with cyclin L1α and L2α. These interactions are involved in alternative splicing regulation, as demonstrated by co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments (Chen2006Identification). The kinase domain and carboxyl-terminal domain of CDK12 S are sufficient for binding to cyclin L1α, indicating a specific interaction domain (Chen2006Identification).

In addition to its interactions with cyclins, CDK12 is associated with RNA processing factors, including splicing factors like SF2/ASF and SC35, which can modulate its effects on splicing (Chen2006Identification). These interactions underscore CDK12's role in transcription regulation and RNA processing.
