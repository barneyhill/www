# KCTD9

## Overview
KCTD9 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 9, which is a member of the KCTD family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is essential for protein oligomerization and interaction with other proteins, such as Cullin 3, to form high-affinity complexes (Pinkas2017Structural). KCTD9 is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions, and plays a significant role in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and natural killer (NK) cell development (Zhang2019Kctd9; Yao2022KCTD9). The protein's structural uniqueness, including its noncanonical classification within the KCTD family, is highlighted by its oligomeric assemblies modeled using AlphaFold (Esposito2022Alphafold). KCTD9's involvement in cancer biology, particularly as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Yao2022KCTD9).

## Structure
The KCTD9 protein is a member of the KCTD family, characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is crucial for protein oligomerization. This domain in KCTD9 shows a strong propensity to form pentamers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Balasco2019The; Esposito2022Alphafold). The protein also contains a ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminus and a pentapeptide repeat domain of the β-solenoid class at the C-terminus (Esposito2022Alphafold). The BTB domain, when combined with a significant portion of the pentapeptide repeat domain, forms a stable pentameric structure, although the ubiquitin-like domain does not contribute to pentamer formation (Esposito2022Alphafold).

KCTD9 is noted for its structural uniqueness within the KCTD family, being classified as a noncanonical member due to the absence of the typical KCTD-CTD domain (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). The protein's structure has been modeled using AlphaFold, which provides insights into its oligomeric assemblies and highlights the stability of its BTB domain in both monomeric and pentameric forms (Balasco2019The; Esposito2022Alphafold). The protein's interaction with Cullin 3 is facilitated by its BTB domain, which is involved in forming high-affinity complexes (Pinkas2017Structural).

## Function
KCTD9 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, KCTD9 plays a role in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for development, tissue homeostasis, stem cell renewal, and organ regeneration. KCTD9 interacts with ZNT9, disrupting its association with β-catenin, leading to the inactivation of TCF/LEF-dependent gene transcription. This interaction suggests that KCTD9 helps maintain normal cellular functions by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway (Yao2022KCTD9).

KCTD9 is also involved in the development and function of natural killer (NK) cells, which are essential components of the immune system. It regulates NK cell lineage commitment, maturation, and effector function by influencing the expression of transcription factors such as Ets1, Nfil3, Eomes, and Id2. These factors are crucial for NK cell development and function, indicating that KCTD9 is vital for maintaining normal NK cell activity (Zhang2019Kctd9).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and may impact various physiological processes through its interactions, contributing to cellular organization and regulation (Yao2022KCTD9).

## Clinical Significance
The KCTD9 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KCTD9 is commonly downregulated, and its reduced expression is associated with advanced disease stages and poorer patient outcomes. KCTD9 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is frequently activated in CRC. Overexpression of KCTD9 decreases CRC cell proliferation and metastasis, while knockdown promotes these processes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic and therapeutic target in CRC (Yao2022KCTD9).

In the context of immune function, KCTD9 plays a critical role in natural killer (NK) cell development and function. KCTD9 deficiency impairs NK cell maturation and effector functions, such as IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity against tumor cells. This deficiency is associated with reduced liver damage in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus, suggesting a protective role against immune-mediated liver injury (Zhang2019Kctd9). In hepatitis B virus-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure, KCTD9 expression in NK cells correlates with liver injury, indicating its involvement in liver disease pathogenesis (Chen2013KCTD9).

## Interactions
KCTD9 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, in colorectal cancer cells. KCTD9 overexpression leads to decreased β-catenin levels, suggesting that KCTD9 promotes β-catenin ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Yao2022KCTD9). KCTD9 also interacts with ZNT9, a zinc transporter protein, which competes with β-catenin for binding. This interaction disrupts the association between ZNT9 and β-catenin, leading to decreased β-catenin levels and inhibition of Wnt signaling (Yao2022KCTD9).

In lung adenocarcinoma, KCTD9 is involved in the ubiquitination of TOP2A, a protein associated with cancer cell proliferation and immune evasion. KCTD9 knockdown results in increased stability and decreased ubiquitination of TOP2A, indicating its role in modulating immune responses and tumor progression (Jiang2024Anticancer). KCTD9's interaction with TOP2A is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, highlighting its involvement in protein ubiquitination processes (Jiang2024Anticancer). These interactions suggest that KCTD9 functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating key signaling pathways and protein stability in cancer cells.
