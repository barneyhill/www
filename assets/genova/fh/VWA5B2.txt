# VWA5B2

## Overview
The VWA5B2 gene encodes the protein von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5B2, which is part of the von Willebrand factor A (VWFA) domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of VWFA domains, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions. The VWA5B2 protein is implicated in several biological pathways and may play a role in cellular signaling and structural integrity. Although the precise functions of VWA5B2 are still being elucidated, its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway suggests a potential regulatory role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and potential therapeutic applications of targeting VWA5B2 in disease contexts.
