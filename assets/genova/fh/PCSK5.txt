# PCSK5

## Overview
PCSK5, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing of precursor proteins. The PCSK5 protein is a member of the proprotein convertase family, which plays a crucial role in the activation of various proteins by cleaving them at specific sites. This enzyme is essential for the maturation of prohormones, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, impacting numerous physiological processes, including development and cellular signaling (Essalmani2006Deletion; Essalmani2008In). PCSK5 is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing it to function in different cellular compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus and secretory pathways (Seidah2011The). The protein's activity is vital for normal embryonic development, and its dysfunction is associated with several congenital disorders, highlighting its significance in developmental biology (Szumska2017Pcsk5; Szumska2008VACTERLcaudal).

## Structure
PCSK5 is a serine protease with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein is initially synthesized with a signal peptide, which is cleaved to produce the mature enzyme. The mature form of PCSK5 consists of 799 amino acids following the removal of an 82-amino acid prosegment (Lusson1993cDNA). The catalytic domain of PCSK5 shares significant sequence identity with other proprotein convertases, such as PACE4 and furin, and includes the active site residues Asp, His, and Ser, along with a catalytically important Asn (Lusson1993cDNA).

PCSK5 contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that functions as a cell surface anchor and interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Nour2005The). This CRD is characterized by 44 cysteine residues arranged in five tandem repeats of a specific consensus motif (Seidah2011The). The CRD is crucial for the protein's localization and function at the cell surface, interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Nour2005The).

PCSK5 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. The soluble form, PC5/6A, consists of 915 amino acids, while the membrane-bound form, PC5/6B, includes 1877 amino acids and features a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic tail (Seidah2011The). These isoforms allow PCSK5 to function in various cellular compartments and processes.

## Function
PCSK5, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the activation of precursor proteins by cleaving them at specific basic amino acid sites. This process is essential for the maturation and activation of various proteins, including prohormones, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, which are crucial for normal cellular function and development (Essalmani2006Deletion). PCSK5 is active in the Golgi apparatus and secretory pathways, where it influences cell signaling and development by processing proteins as they transit through these cellular compartments or at the cell surface (Essalmani2006Deletion).

In the context of organismal development, PCSK5 is involved in the activation of TGFβ/BMP-family members, which are important for various developmental processes, including heart development and axial patterning (Szumska2017Pcsk5; Essalmani2008In). The enzyme's activity is crucial for early embryonic development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in mouse models lacking PCSK5 (Essalmani2006Deletion). PCSK5 also plays a role in the processing of growth differentiation factor 11 (Gdf11), which is important for proper axial skeleton patterning and organogenesis (Essalmani2008In). The enzyme's function is vital for normal development, and its absence or mutation can lead to severe developmental defects (Szumska2008VACTERLcaudal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCSK5 gene have been implicated in several congenital syndromes and developmental disorders. Notably, mutations in PCSK5 are associated with VACTERL association, caudal regression syndrome (CRS), and Currarino syndrome (CS). These conditions are characterized by a range of malformations, including vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb anomalies (Szumska2008VACTERLcaudal). Specific mutations, such as the C470R mutation, disrupt the proprotein convertase activity of PCSK5, leading to defects in cardiac, tracheoesophageal, anorectal, and skeletal development (Szumska2008VACTERLcaudal).

PCSK5 is also involved in the regulation of caudal Hox gene expression, which is crucial for anteroposterior patterning and organogenesis. Mutations in PCSK5 can lead to abnormal expression of these genes, contributing to the developmental anomalies observed in VACTERL and related syndromes (Szumska2008VACTERLcaudal). Additionally, PCSK5 mutations have been identified in patients with congenital heart defects, suggesting a role in heart development (Szumska2017Pcsk5).

The clinical significance of PCSK5 mutations is further supported by the identification of novel frameshift and missense mutations in patients with VACTERL association, indicating their potential pathogenicity (Nakamura2015PCSK5). These findings highlight the importance of PCSK5 in normal embryonic development and its potential involvement in various congenital malformations.

## Interactions
PCSK5 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. It is part of a functional network with other proprotein convertases, including FURIN, PCSK7, MBTPS1, and PCSK9, through direct or indirect interactions (Suur2022Therapeutic). PCSK5 interacts with several members of the SMAD family (SMAD1-3) and CDK1-2, indicating its role in signaling pathways related to cytokine biosynthesis and fat cell transdifferentiation (Suur2022Therapeutic).

PCSK5 is also involved in the processing of critical enzymes in triglyceride metabolism, such as endothelial and lipoprotein lipase. It activates the αv integrin along with FURIN, which is important for smooth muscle cell proliferation (Suur2022Therapeutic). PCSK5 participates in the cleavage of several members of the TGF-beta superfamily, including GDF11, GDF15, and BMPs, as well as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are essential in cardiovascular disease development (Suur2022Therapeutic).

In the context of bone development, PCSK5 interacts with microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p), which targets PCSK5 to regulate osteoblastic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells. This interaction is significant in the regulation of age-associated osteoporosis (Tong2020MicroRNA‑338‑3p).
