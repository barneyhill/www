# EIF4G2

## Overview
EIF4G2 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 (eIF4G2), a non-canonical translation initiation factor involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF4G2 protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including three HEAT domains, which facilitate interactions with various initiation factors and proteins involved in translation. Unlike its homolog eIF4G1, eIF4G2 does not bind the cap-binding protein eIF4E, which allows it to function under conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised. This protein plays a critical role in processes such as leaky scanning and the translation of mRNAs with complex 5' UTRs, contributing to cellular responses to stress and differentiation signals. EIF4G2 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and differentiation, and has been associated with cancer progression and prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Meril2023Lossoffunction; Smirnova2022Ribosomal; Shestakova2022Specific).

## Structure
The eIF4G2 protein in humans is composed of 907 amino acids and contains three HEAT domains: MIF4G, MA3, and W2. These domains are involved in binding initiation factors and MNK1/2 (Shestakova2022Specific). The MIF4G domain interacts with eIF4A and shows high structural similarity to that of eIF4G1, although eIF4G2 has a higher dissociation constant for eIF4A binding. The MA3 domain does not bind eIF4A, unlike eIF4G1, and the W2 domain interacts with eIF2β, a feature not shared by eIF4G1 due to differences in a key residue (Shestakova2022Specific). 

eIF4G2 is known to be cleaved by the picornaviral 3C protease, producing a p86 fragment (Shestakova2022Specific). The protein is translated from a non-AUG start codon (GUG) and is regulated by factors such as eIF5 and 5MP (Shestakova2022Specific). eIF4G2 lacks binding sites for eIF4E and PABP, which are typical in other translation initiation factors, suggesting a unique structural feature that may contribute to its specialized function in translation initiation (Smirnova2019eIF4G2). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
EIF4G2, also known as DAP5, Nat1, or p97, is a crucial component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, playing a significant role in translation initiation in higher eukaryotes. Unlike its homolog EIF4G1, EIF4G2 does not interact with the cap-binding protein EIF4E, yet it facilitates translation under both normal and stress conditions. It is particularly involved in cap-dependent translation, acting downstream of cap recognition and mRNA accommodation by 43S ribosomal complexes (Smirnova2022Ribosomal; Shestakova2022Specific).

EIF4G2 is essential for leaky scanning, a process where ribosomes bypass upstream open reading frames (uORFs) to initiate translation at downstream start codons. This function is vital for mRNAs with long and structured 5' UTRs, which are common in higher eukaryotes (Smirnova2022Ribosomal; Shestakova2022Specific). EIF4G2 also plays a role in cell fate decisions, such as apoptosis and differentiation, by regulating the translation of specific mRNAs involved in these processes (Shestakova2022Specific).

In cellular differentiation, EIF4G2 is crucial for mesoderm formation and the differentiation of naïve T lymphocytes into regulatory T cells. Its absence can lead to differentiation failures and impaired embryonic development (Shestakova2022Specific). Overall, EIF4G2 acts as a multifunctional scanning guardian, facilitating ribosome movement during translation initiation and ensuring efficient protein synthesis under various cellular conditions (Shestakova2023The).

## Clinical Significance
EIF4G2, a non-canonical translation initiation factor, plays a significant role in cancer development and progression. Mutations and alterations in the expression of EIF4G2 have been linked to various cancer types. In gastric and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, high EIF4G2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, promoting metastasis and cell survival (Meril2023Lossoffunction). Conversely, reduced EIF4G2 expression in bladder cancer correlates with tumor dedifferentiation and invasiveness, suggesting a context-dependent role as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor (Meril2023Lossoffunction).

In endometrial cancer, low EIF4G2 expression is linked to poor overall and recurrence-free survival, particularly in Grade 2 tumors. This reduced expression is associated with increased resistance to conventional therapies and a higher prevalence of aggressive cell markers, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Meril2024Loss). EIF4G2 mutations, such as R178Q, can lead to a loss of function by affecting protein-protein interactions and translation initiation capabilities, which may contribute to cancer progression (Meril2023Lossoffunction).

In non-small cell lung cancer, EIF4G2 is a target of miR-379, and its suppression enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin, suggesting a role in chemoresistance (Hao2017Suppression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EIF4G2 in cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker.

## Interactions
EIF4G2, also known as DAP5, Nat1, or p97, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in translation initiation. EIF4G2 interacts with eIF4A, although this interaction is weaker compared to its homolog eIF4G1 (Shestakova2022Specific). It also binds to eIF3 and eIF2, with the eIF4G2-eIF2β interaction being particularly significant for its function (Shestakova2022Specific). EIF4G2 does not interact with the cap-binding protein eIF4E, distinguishing its function from eIF4G1 (Smirnova2022Ribosomal).

EIF4G2 is part of a miRNA-protein complex with FXR1 and AGO2, where it interacts with the deadenylase PARN, which binds the m7G-cap (Shestakova2022Specific). It also interacts with eIF3d, which is involved in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the m7G-cap, facilitating translation initiation when eIF4E-dependent translation is inhibited (Shestakova2022Specific). Mutations in EIF4G2, such as R178Q, significantly reduce its ability to bind interacting partners, affecting its role in translation initiation (Meril2023Lossoffunction). These interactions highlight EIF4G2's involvement in both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation mechanisms.
