# LAMTOR3

## Overview
LAMTOR3, also known as late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 3, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein integral to cellular signaling pathways. The protein product of LAMTOR3 is a component of the Ragulator complex, which is crucial for the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) on lysosomal membranes. This protein is characterized by its role as a scaffold, facilitating interactions within the MAPK signaling pathway by serving as a docking platform for MEK1 and ERK1, thereby enhancing their interactions (Chaeyklinthes2018Proteomics). LAMTOR3 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism, responding to nutrient availability through its role in mTORC1 activation (De2013Polymorphisms). Additionally, LAMTOR3 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression and interaction with other signaling molecules can influence tumor progression and cellular proliferation (Jun2013PAFMediated; Zhang2020Circ0075829).

## Structure
LAMTOR3, also known as MP1, is a subunit of the Ragulator complex, which plays a crucial role in mTORC1 activation on lysosomal membranes. The primary structure of LAMTOR3 includes specific residues that engage in hydrophobic interactions with Lamtor1, such as A2, L5, F8, V30, P31, V32, I33, L113, L117, V120, and V121. These interactions are essential for the stability of the Ragulator complex (Mu2017Structural).

In terms of secondary structure, LAMTOR3 contains three α-helices, which are a characteristic feature of its interaction with other subunits in the Ragulator complex. This structural arrangement is distinct from the Lamtor4 and Lamtor5 subunits, which have only two α-helices (Mu2017Structural).

The tertiary structure of LAMTOR3 is not detailed in the provided context, but its role within the Ragulator complex suggests a stable conformation that facilitates its function as a scaffold protein. The quaternary structure involves its interaction with Lamtor2 to form a semi-independent subcomplex within the Ragulator, indicating a close association between these two proteins (Mu2017Structural).

LAMTOR3 is also involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, serving as a docking platform for MEK1 and ERK1, which enhances their interactions and contributes to its role in cellular signaling (Chaeyklinthes2018Proteomics).

## Function
LAMTOR3, also known as late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 3, is a critical component of the LAMTOR complex, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, LAMTOR3 functions as a scaffold protein that facilitates the activation of the ERK and mTORC1 signaling pathways. It is specifically involved in the recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes, a process essential for amino acid signaling and subsequent mTORC1 activation. This activation is crucial for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism in response to nutrient availability (De2013Polymorphisms).

LAMTOR3 forms a stable heterodimeric complex with LAMTOR2, which is necessary for ERK activation on endosomes. This complex is involved in regulating late endosomal traffic, EGFR degradation, and cellular proliferation, all of which are vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis and early embryogenesis (De2013Polymorphisms). The LAMTOR complex, including LAMTOR3, serves as a convergence point for the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling and homeostasis (De2013Polymorphisms).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LAMTOR3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11944405 in the LAMTOR3 gene is associated with a decreased risk of the disease. This protective effect is particularly significant in subgroups such as older individuals, females, and those with advanced tumor stages (Song2015A).

In pancreatic cancer, LAMTOR3 is involved in the hyperactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis. The overexpression of LAMTOR3, induced by the proliferation-associated factor (PAF), leads to increased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, promoting cancer cell proliferation (Jun2013PAFMediated). Additionally, LAMTOR3 is implicated in the progression of pancreatic carcinoma through its interaction with circ_0075829 and miR-1287-5p, affecting the MAPK signaling pathway (Zhang2020Circ0075829).

In breast cancer, polymorphisms in the LAMTOR3 gene have been studied for their potential association with cancer risk. However, findings regarding their impact on hormone receptor status and cancer characteristics have been inconsistent, indicating a need for further research (De2013Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
LAMTOR3, also known as MP1, is a component of the Ragulator complex, which plays a crucial role in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Within this complex, LAMTOR3 interacts with other subunits, including LAMTOR1, LAMTOR2, LAMTOR4, and LAMTOR5, to facilitate the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 on lysosomal membranes (Mu2017Structural; Seibert2021Amino). LAMTOR3 forms a semi-independent subcomplex with LAMTOR2, indicating a specific interaction between these two subunits (Mu2017Structural).

LAMTOR3 also serves as a scaffold protein in the MAPK signaling pathway, where it acts as a docking platform for MEK1 and ERK1, enhancing their interactions and the efficiency of the MAP kinase pathway (Chaeyklinthes2018Proteomics). This interaction is significant in various cellular processes, including cancer progression, as LAMTOR3 is involved in pathways related to tumor formation and VEGF signaling (Chaeyklinthes2018Proteomics).

In breast cancer, LAMTOR3 is identified as a specific binding partner of MEK1, recruited to late endosomes by LAMTOR2, forming a stable heterodimeric complex essential for ERK activation (De2013Polymorphisms). This interaction is critical for regulating endosomal traffic and cellular proliferation, highlighting LAMTOR3's role in cancer-related signaling pathways (De2013Polymorphisms).
