# UBE3C

## Overview
UBE3C is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin protein ligase E3C, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and homeostasis in human cells. The protein plays a critical role in tagging proteins for degradation, particularly under stress conditions, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis. UBE3C is known for assembling K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, marking proteins for proteasomal degradation, and forming non-canonical ubiquitin chains. It is also implicated in neurodevelopment and associated with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its diverse biological functions and clinical significance (Kuo2017Ubiquitinated; Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular; Singh2020Crystal).

## Structure
The UBE3C protein is characterized by a HECT domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain adopts an open L-shaped bilobed conformation, consisting of an N-lobe and a C-lobe connected by a flexible hinge region. The N-lobe is divided into a large subdomain with eight α-helices and three β-strands, and a small subdomain that interacts with E2 enzymes. The C-lobe contains four α-helices and four β-strands, with the catalytic cysteine located here (Singh2020Crystal).

The N-terminal extended region (amino acids 693-743) is essential for the stability and activity of the HECT domain, interacting with the N-lobe to maintain structural integrity (Singh2020Crystal). The UBE3C HECT domain is involved in forming K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are markers for proteasomal degradation (Singh2020Crystal).

Mutations in specific residues, such as Gln961 and Ser1049, significantly affect the autoubiquitination activity of UBE3C, highlighting their importance in the E2-E3 transthiolation process (Singh2020Crystal). The protein's structure was resolved to a resolution of 2.7 Å, providing detailed insights into its conformation and function (Singh2020Crystal).

## Function
UBE3C, also known as ubiquitin protein ligase E3C, is a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for tagging proteins for degradation. In healthy human cells, UBE3C is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by enhancing the processive degradation of difficult-to-degrade substrates, particularly under stress conditions such as heat shock (Kuo2017Ubiquitinated). It functions on the proteasome as an 'E4' enzyme, elongating ubiquitin chains on substrates bound to the 26S proteasome, thereby increasing their chances of degradation (Kuo2017Ubiquitinated).

UBE3C is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It is known to assemble K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which mark proteins for proteasomal degradation, and also forms non-canonical K11- and K29-linked ubiquitin chains (Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular; Singh2020Crystal). The protein's activity is regulated through autoubiquitination, particularly at lysine residue K903, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Singh2020Crystal).

UBE3C also plays a role in neurodevelopment, particularly in the assembly of cortical circuits and higher cognitive functions of the neocortex, and is associated with autism spectrum disorder (Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
UBE3C (ubiquitin protein ligase E3C) has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), specific UBE3C gene variants are associated with reduced kidney function and increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). These variants influence gene expression levels, contributing to the pathogenesis of DKD (Chen2020Association).

In cancer, UBE3C is overexpressed in several types, including gliomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. In gliomas, high UBE3C expression correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor features, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Pan2015Ubiquitinprotein). In RCC, UBE3C promotes tumor growth and metastasis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wen2015UBE3C). Similarly, in breast and gastric cancers, UBE3C facilitates cancer progression by enhancing β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Zhang2020UBE3C; Hang2021Oncogenic).

UBE3C is also linked to neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where mutations in the gene are associated with the condition (Ambrozkiewicz2020Molecular). These findings highlight UBE3C's significant role in disease pathogenesis across various conditions.

## Interactions
UBE3C, a ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It forms a complex with ANXA7, a tumor suppressor gene, in glioma cells. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ANXA7, contributing to glioma progression (Pan2015Ubiquitinprotein). UBE3C also interacts with the proteasome, where it plays a role in enhancing proteasome processivity by ubiquitinating partially proteolyzed substrates. This interaction is crucial for the complete degradation of stable proteins, preventing the accumulation of truncated products (Chu2013The).

UBE3C is associated with the proteasome subunit RPN13, where it mediates the multiubiquitylation of RPN13 in response to acute protein unfolding. This interaction is part of the proteasome's response to stress conditions, facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins (Gottlieb2019Acute). UBE3C also interacts with RPN10 and RPN13, proteasomal ubiquitin receptors, during the cellular response to protein misfolding (Gottlieb2019Acute). These interactions highlight UBE3C's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
