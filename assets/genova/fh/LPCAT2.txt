# LPCAT2

## Overview
LPCAT2, or lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the remodeling of phospholipids, particularly in the biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC). This enzyme plays a critical role in maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity, which are essential for various cellular functions, including lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses (Abate2020Lysophosphatidylcholine; Shindou2013Generation). LPCAT2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the surface of lipid droplets, where it participates in the Lands' cycle, contributing to membrane diversity and asymmetry (Shindou2013Generation). The enzyme's activity is modulated by extracellular stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharides, which induce its expression in inflammatory cells, highlighting its involvement in inflammation (Abate2020Lysophosphatidylcholine). Additionally, LPCAT2 has been implicated in the progression of aggressive prostate cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease severity (Williams2014A). These multifaceted roles underscore LPCAT2's significance in both physiological and pathological processes.

## Structure
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2) is an enzyme involved in the remodeling of phospholipids, specifically in the biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). The molecular structure of LPCAT2 includes transmembrane domains that facilitate its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the surface of lipid droplets (Shindou2013Generation). Although the crystal structure of LPCAT2 has not been determined, homology modeling based on the structure of Thermotoga maritima PlsC suggests the presence of two N-terminal α-helices that anchor the enzyme to the membrane (Hamano2020Mutagenesis).

LPCAT2 is subject to post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at serine 34, which enhances its catalytic activity and is mediated by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) (Morimoto2010Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation is crucial for its role in inflammatory responses, particularly in the production of PAF in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages (Morimoto2010Phosphorylation). The enzyme's activity is also regulated by its interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which facilitates its translocation to membrane lipid raft domains upon stimulation (Abate2020Lysophosphatidylcholine). These structural and functional characteristics highlight LPCAT2's role in lipid metabolism and inflammation.

## Function
LPCAT2 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in phospholipid metabolism, specifically in the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC). This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity, which are essential for various cellular functions (Shindou2013Generation). LPCAT2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is also found on the surface of lipid droplets, indicating its involvement in lipid metabolism and storage (Shindou2013Generation).

In healthy human cells, LPCAT2 is involved in the remodeling pathway of phospholipid synthesis, known as the Lands' cycle. This pathway contributes to the diversity and asymmetry of cellular membranes, which are important for membrane fluidity, curvature, and signaling (Shindou2013Generation). LPCAT2 also exhibits lyso-PAF acyltransferase activity, with a preference for arachidonoyl-CoA, highlighting its role in membrane homeostasis and the production of lipid mediators (Shindou2013Generation).

LPCAT2's activity is regulated by extracellular stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharides, which induce its expression in inflammatory cells like macrophages. This regulation suggests that LPCAT2 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses, although its specific functions in non-inflammatory conditions in healthy cells require further investigation (Abate2020Lysophosphatidylcholine).

## Clinical Significance
LPCAT2 has been implicated in the progression of aggressive prostate cancer. Studies have shown that higher expression levels of LPCAT2 are associated with more aggressive forms of prostate cancer, characterized by poor disease-free survival and higher pathological stages (Williams2014A). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LPCAT2, such as rs3764263 and rs289707, have been linked to clinical characteristics of aggressive prostate cancer, including primary tumor stage and Gleason score (Williams2014A). These findings suggest that alterations in LPCAT2 expression or mutations may contribute to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.

In addition to its role in prostate cancer, LPCAT2 is involved in inflammatory responses. It plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a pro-inflammatory mediator, and is inducible under inflammatory conditions (Hamano2020Mutagenesis). LPCAT2's activity in lipid droplet formation also contributes to chemoresistance in cancer cells by sequestering lipophilic anticancer drugs, thereby reducing their efficacy (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). These roles highlight LPCAT2's significance in both cancer progression and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in inflammatory responses. LPCAT2 physically associates with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. This interaction is rapid and transient, occurring within 15 minutes of LPS exposure, and is essential for activating TLR4 signaling pathways and subsequent inflammatory gene expression (Abate2020Lysophosphatidylcholine). Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed this association, highlighting LPCAT2's specific role in the inflammatory response, distinct from LPCAT1, which does not associate with TLR4 under similar conditions (Abate2020Lysophosphatidylcholine).

LPCAT2 is also phosphorylated at serine 34 by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) in response to LPS, a modification that enhances its catalytic activity. This phosphorylation is part of the MyD88, TAK1, p38 MAPK, and MK2 signaling pathway, indicating LPCAT2's involvement in a complex network of protein interactions that regulate its function in inflammation (Morimoto2010Phosphorylation). These interactions underscore LPCAT2's role in modulating inflammatory responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory disorders.
