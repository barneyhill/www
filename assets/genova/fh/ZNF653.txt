# ZNF653

## Overview
ZNF653 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 653, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities facilitated by zinc ion coordination. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and protein-protein interactions, particularly within the context of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. Zinc finger protein 653 is implicated in the modulation of tau phosphorylation and amyloid production, processes that are critical in AD. Additionally, it serves as a neosubstrate for the CRL4 CRBN complex, indicating its potential role in thalidomide-based therapies. The gene is also part of KRAB-ZNF gene clusters, which exhibit genetic variation and positive selection across human populations, suggesting its involvement in local adaptation and disease susceptibility (Baek2024Unveiling; Yamamoto2022Discovery; Povala2022Serinethreonine; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Structure
ZNF653 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its involvement in phosphorylation processes, with 52 predicted phosphorylation sites, nine of which are confirmed in humans (Povala2022Serinethreonine). This protein is part of the C2H2 zinc finger family, which typically features domains that facilitate DNA binding through coordination with zinc ions. These domains are rich in cysteine and histidine residues, contributing to the protein's primary structure. The secondary structure of zinc finger proteins often includes alpha helices and beta sheets, stabilized by zinc ion coordination, although specific details for ZNF653 are not provided in the context.

ZNF653 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression related to Alzheimer's Disease, particularly in processes like tau phosphorylation and amyloid production (Povala2022Serinethreonine). It is also noted as a binding partner of RNF166, suggesting its involvement in protein-protein interactions within the interactome of CRBN molecular glues (Baek2024Unveiling). The protein's role in glucose metabolism changes in the brain has been observed through [18F]FDG-PET imaging, highlighting its potential significance in Alzheimer's pathology (Povala2022Serinethreonine). Specific details on splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure are not provided in the context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF653 has been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through its association with changes in brain glucose metabolism. The gene is identified as a regulatory unit linked to cerebral glucose metabolism, with its activity potentially influencing the production of hyperphosphorylated tau, a hallmark of AD pathology. ZNF653 has numerous predicted phosphorylation sites, suggesting its involvement in AD-related pathological changes (Povala2022Serinethreonine).

In the context of thalidomide-based therapies, ZNF653 is recognized as a neosubstrate for the CRL4 CRBN complex, which is involved in the degradation of zinc finger proteins. This interaction highlights the potential role of ZNF653 in the mechanisms of thalidomide-based treatments and their species-specific effects, although the clinical significance of this interaction remains to be fully elucidated (Yamamoto2022Discovery).

Genetic studies have identified ZNF653 within KRAB-ZNF gene clusters, which show patterns of genetic variation and positive selection in different human populations. These variations may influence the gene's regulatory roles and have been associated with local adaptation and disease, although specific clinical conditions directly linked to ZNF653 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).
