# ZNF638

## Overview
ZNF638 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 638, a transcriptional co-regulator involved in various cellular processes, including adipogenesis and alternative splicing. The protein is characterized by its multiple domains, such as RS domains, RNA recognition motifs, and zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with splicing factors (Meruvu2011Regulation; Du2014The). ZNF638 is particularly significant in the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, where it interacts with CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins to regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key factor in adipogenesis (Wei2013Emerging; Meruvu2011Regulation). Additionally, ZNF638 is involved in the thermogenic response of brown and beige adipocytes, indicating its role in energy expenditure and metabolic regulation (Perie2019Transcriptional). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), further underscore its importance in lipid metabolism and potential implications in diseases such as glioblastoma and hepatic conditions (Ni2020USP7; Seetharam2024Targeting).

## Structure
ZNF638 is a multidomain protein involved in transcriptional regulation and adipocyte differentiation. It contains several distinct domains, including RS domains, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a matrin 3 homology region (MH1), two C2H2 zinc finger motifs (ZF1 and ZF2), a putative DNA binding domain (DBD), and a region with acidic repeats (ARs) (Meruvu2011Regulation; Du2014The). The RS domain is crucial for its localization in nuclear speckles, which are enriched with splicing factors (Meruvu2011Regulation; Du2014The). The C-terminal zinc finger domain is essential for its function in adipocyte differentiation and regulation of alternatively spliced isoforms (Du2014The).

ZNF638 interacts with splicing regulatory proteins and influences alternative splicing, suggesting a role in splice site selection (Du2014The). It can multimerize through interactions with other ZNF638 proteins, indicating a potential quaternary structure (Du2014The). Post-translational modifications, such as stabilization by USP7 through deubiquitination, affect its function and stability (Ni2020USP7). The protein is involved in the regulation of PPARγ expression and interacts with CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) (Meruvu2011Regulation).

## Function
ZNF638 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional co-regulator involved in adipogenesis, the process by which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes. It plays a crucial role in the early stages of adipocyte differentiation by interacting with CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) β and δ, which leads to the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis (Wei2013Emerging; Meruvu2011Regulation). ZNF638 is localized in the nucleus, particularly in nuclear speckles enriched with splicing factors, and it interacts with splicing regulators, suggesting a role in both transcriptional regulation and alternative splicing (Du2014The).

In thermogenic cells, ZNF638 is selectively expressed in mature brown and beige adipocytes and is upregulated by cAMP modulators, cold exposure, and β-adrenergic signaling. This indicates its involvement in the thermogenic response and energy expenditure in these tissues (Perie2019Transcriptional). The protein's activity in these processes highlights its importance in regulating adipose tissue biology and its potential impact on metabolic processes in the organism.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF638 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly glioblastoma (GBM) and hepatic conditions. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures and poor immune cell infiltration. Knockdown of ZNF638 in GBM cell lines leads to increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins like PD-L1 and activation of antiviral immune responses, suggesting that ZNF638 suppression could enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies (Seetharam2024Targeting). Clinical data indicate that lower ZNF638 expression correlates with better responses to ICI and improved survival in GBM and melanoma patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting ICI response (Seetharam2024Targeting).

In hepatic conditions, the USP7/ZNF638 axis plays a significant role in hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and is implicated in hepatic steatosis and carcinogenesis. USP7 stabilizes ZNF638, promoting the transcription of lipogenic enzymes, which contributes to liver steatosis and potentially to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Ni2020USP7). Targeting this axis may offer therapeutic potential for conditions related to aberrant lipid metabolism (Ni2020USP7).

## Interactions
ZNF638 is known to interact with various proteins and participate in multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), which deubiquitinates and stabilizes ZNF638, thereby enhancing its protein levels. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, as USP7 stabilizes ZNF638 and promotes the transcription of lipogenic enzymes (Ni2020USP7).

ZNF638 also interacts with splicing regulators and is localized in nuclear bodies enriched with splicing factors. It forms complexes with proteins involved in early prespliceosomal assembly, such as U2SURP, SRSF7, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs), including HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPLL. These interactions suggest a role in alternative splicing and splice site selection (Du2014The).

In adipogenesis, ZNF638 interacts with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, cooperating to regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a key transcription factor in adipocyte differentiation. This interaction positions ZNF638 as a transcriptional cofactor in the early stages of adipogenesis (Wei2013Emerging; Du2014The).
