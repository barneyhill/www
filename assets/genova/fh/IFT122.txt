# IFT122

## Overview
IFT122 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 122 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) complex. This protein is integral to the assembly and function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that play vital roles in cell signaling and movement. The IFT122 protein is characterized by its WD40 and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate its interactions within the IFT-A complex and with other proteins involved in ciliary transport (Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal; McCafferty2022Integrative). Functionally, IFT122 is involved in retrograde transport within cilia, essential for maintaining ciliary structure and function, and it plays a role in regulating the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is critical for developmental processes (Qin2011Intraflagellar; Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated). Mutations in the IFT122 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, including cranioectodermal dysplasia and retinal degenerative diseases, underscoring its importance in human health and development (Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal; Boubakri2016Loss).

## Structure
The IFT122 protein is a component of the intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) complex, essential for ciliary transport. It is approximately 140 kDa and contains seven WD40 domains, which form beta-propeller structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal). The protein also features tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are crucial for the stable formation of the IFT-A complex (McCafferty2022Integrative). The WD40 domains are positioned under the membrane, playing a significant role in interacting with membrane protein cargoes (McCafferty2022Integrative).

IFT122 is part of the core subcomplex of the IFT-A structure, interacting with other subunits like IFT140 and IFT144 to form a trimeric core (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated). The C-terminal region of IFT122, containing TPR domains, interacts with IFT144, while the N-terminal region, containing WD40 domains, interacts with the IFT43-IFT121 dimer (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated). These interactions are essential for the assembly and stability of the IFT-A complex (Jiang2023Human).

IFT122 has multiple splice variant isoforms, with at least four identified, including isoform 3 and isoform 4, which have specific exon compositions (Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal). Mutations in the IFT122 gene, particularly in the WD40 domains, can disrupt its interactions and are associated with ciliopathies such as cranioectodermal dysplasia (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated).

## Function
IFT122 is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-A complex, which is essential for the proper assembly and function of cilia in human cells. It plays a pivotal role in the bidirectional trafficking of proteins within cilia, necessary for their assembly and maintenance (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated). IFT122 acts as a hub within the IFT-A complex, connecting core and peripheral subcomplexes, and is involved in retrograde transport, which returns proteins from the ciliary tip to the cell body (Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal).

In healthy cells, IFT122 is necessary for proper ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and for the trafficking of proteins within cilia. Knockout studies have shown that the absence of IFT122 leads to severe defects in ciliogenesis, with virtually no cilia formation (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated). IFT122 is also involved in the transport of tubulins, essential for constructing the microtubule-based axoneme of cilia (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated).

IFT122 is implicated in the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway by controlling the localization of pathway components within the cilium. It affects the balance between the full-length and repressor forms of Gli3, a transcription factor in the Shh pathway, and influences the ciliary localization of Gli2 and Gli3 proteins (Qin2011Intraflagellar).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT122 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED), also known as Sensenbrenner syndrome. This condition is characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and ectodermal abnormalities, such as limb shortening, brachydactyly, and renal insufficiency (Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal). IFT122 mutations disrupt ciliary function, leading to defects in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for skeletal development (Qin2011Intraflagellar; Walczak-Sztulpa2010Cranioectodermal).

In addition to CED, IFT122 mutations are linked to retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). These conditions result from inefficient opsin transport in photoreceptor cells, leading to progressive photoreceptor degeneration (Boubakri2016Loss; Kaukonen2021A). In canine models, a missense variant in IFT122 has been identified as a candidate causal variant for a novel form of RP, highlighting its role in photoreceptor maintenance (Kaukonen2021A).

IFT122 mutations can also cause other developmental defects, including exencephaly, neural tube defects, and polydactyly, as observed in mouse models (Boubakri2016Loss). These findings underscore the critical role of IFT122 in ciliary function and its impact on various developmental and degenerative disorders.

## Interactions
IFT122 is a core component of the intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) complex, which is essential for ciliary protein trafficking. It interacts with several other IFT-A subunits, forming a stable core subcomplex with IFT140 and IFT144 through its C-terminal region, which contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated; Zhu2017Functional). IFT122 also interacts with the IFT43-IFT121 dimer via its N-terminal region, which contains the WD40 domain (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated).

IFT122 forms a dimer with IFT144, which is crucial for the interaction between the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. This interaction is particularly significant with the IFT88 and IFT52 subunits of the IFT-B complex, contributing to the interface necessary for retrograde trafficking and the import of ciliary GPCRs (Kobayashi2021Cooperation).

Mutations in IFT122, such as those associated with cranioectodermal dysplasia, can disrupt its interactions with other IFT-A subunits, affecting ciliary protein trafficking. These mutations impair the incorporation of IFT139 into the IFT-A complex, although ciliogenesis can still occur (Takahara2017Ciliopathy-associated). IFT122 also plays a role in regulating the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway by controlling the ciliary localization of pathway components (Qin2011Intraflagellar).
