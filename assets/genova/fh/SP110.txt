# SP110

## Overview
SP110 is a gene that encodes the SP110 nuclear body protein, which is a member of the SP100/SP140 protein family. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and the immune response. The SP110 nuclear body protein contains several functional domains, including a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), a SAND domain, a plant homeodomain (PHD), and a bromodomain (BRD), which facilitate its role in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation and DNA binding (Leu2018Functional; Fraschilla2020The; Aird2024SP110). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, such as SP110a, SP110b, and SP110c, due to alternative mRNA splicing, which contributes to its functional diversity (Leu2018Functional). SP110 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the modulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, and plays a significant role in immune and inflammatory responses (Leu2018Functional). Mutations in the SP110 gene are associated with veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI) and have been linked to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis and other conditions (Marquardsen2017Detection; Cliffe2012Clinical).

## Structure
The SP110 nuclear body protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several functional domains. It contains an N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which is crucial for protein-protein oligomerization and plays a protective role against interferon-induced cell death (Aird2024SP110). The protein also features a chromatin-associating SAND domain, a plant homeodomain (PHD), and a bromodomain (BRD), which are involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation and DNA binding (Leu2018Functional; Fraschilla2020The). 

SP110 has multiple isoforms, including SP110a, SP110b, and SP110c, resulting from alternative mRNA splicing, which contribute to its functional diversity (Leu2018Functional). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various proteins and localize to different cellular compartments, including the nucleolus, where it may perform distinct functions (Leu2018Functional). 

The presence of a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within SP110 facilitates its targeting to specific nuclear regions (Leu2018Functional). The protein's ability to form nuclear speckles and localize to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies is integral to its function as a nuclear body protein (Leu2018Functional).

## Function
The SP110 nuclear body protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and plays a significant role in the immune response. It is a member of the SP100/SP140 protein family and is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences processes such as chromatin remodeling and the regulation of inflammatory responses (Leu2018Functional). SP110 is known to modulate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, which is crucial for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Different isoforms of SP110, such as SP110a, SP110b, and SP110c, have distinct effects on NF-κB-mediated transcription, with SP110b acting as a transcriptional corepressor and SP110a as a co-activator (Leu2018Functional).

SP110 contains several functional domains, including a chromatin-associating SAND domain and an LXXLL nuclear receptor binding motif, which suggest its role as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor (Leu2018Functional). The protein is also involved in the formation of nuclear bodies, which are important for regulating gene expression and cellular stress responses (Sengupta2017Host). In healthy human cells, SP110 contributes to the regulation of transcription and protein localization, which are essential for maintaining cellular functions (Leu2018Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SP110 gene are associated with veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI), a severe autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder. VODI is characterized by severe hypogammaglobulinemia, T-cell dysfunction, and hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Patients with VODI exhibit reduced numbers of circulating T and B cells, particularly memory B cells, due to impaired generation and class-switching, which affects their ability to differentiate into immunoglobulin-secreting cells (Cliffe2012Clinical). This results in compromised B cell responses to T cell-dependent stimuli and reduced proliferation and survival of naive B cells, leading to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections (Cliffe2012Clinical).

SP110 mutations often result in frameshift mutations or protein instability, leading to reduced functional protein levels and an inability to switch from IgM to IgG or IgA (Cliffe2012Clinical). The disease is primarily diagnosed in individuals of Lebanese descent, but mutations have also been identified in Italian, Arabic, and Hispanic patients (Cliffe2012Clinical). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered a potential cure for VODI, although it carries a high risk of transplant-related mortality (Marquardsen2017Detection). Additionally, SP110 polymorphisms have been linked to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis and canine degenerative myelopathy (Marquardsen2017Detection).

## Interactions
SP110, a nuclear body protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and immune response. SP110 interacts with the NF-κB p50 protein, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear complex formation, which down-regulates transcription of the TNFα promoter (Leu2018Functional). This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal region of SP110, which is sufficient to down-regulate p50 dimer-driven transcriptional activity (Leu2018Functional).

SP110 also forms a heteromeric CARD-CARD interaction with SP100, which is crucial for its protective role against cell death during interferon signaling. This interaction prevents the toxic effects of SP100, highlighting a functional divergence between SP110 and SP100 despite sequence homology (Aird2024SP110).

In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, SP110 is hijacked by the viral protein X (HBx). HBx interacts with SP110, driving it out of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and facilitating viral persistence. This interaction involves the chromatin-binding properties of SP110, which HBx exploits to alter host gene expression in favor of the virus (Sengupta2017Host).
