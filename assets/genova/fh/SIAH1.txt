# SIAH1

## Overview
SIAH1 is a gene that encodes the siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, a member of the SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins within the cell. Characterized by a RING finger domain, siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin molecules to specific substrates, marking them for proteasomal degradation. This process is vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The protein's structure includes zinc finger motifs and a substrate-binding domain, which are essential for its interaction with other proteins and its function in protein degradation. SIAH1 is involved in several cellular pathways, including the regulation of β-catenin levels and the p53 pathway, and has been implicated in various diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Zhang2021Siah1; Matsuzawa1998p53inducible; Hu1999Siah1).

## Structure
The SIAH1 protein is a member of the SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a RING finger domain essential for its ligase activity. This domain facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to target substrates, marking them for degradation (Matsuzawa2003Structural). SIAH1 also contains two zinc finger motifs and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD), which is structurally similar to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domains (Matsuzawa2003Structural; House2006Elucidation).

The protein forms a dimer, with its dimerization domain contributing to its quaternary structure. The dimer interface features a large concave surface, predominantly electronegative, which is crucial for interactions with the Siah-interacting protein (SIP) (Matsuzawa2003Structural). The SBD of SIAH1 includes a groove formed by zinc fingers and beta strands, which is important for substrate recognition and binding (House2006Elucidation).

SIAH1 is involved in the regulation of β-catenin levels through its interaction with SIP, Skp1, and the F-box protein Ebi, forming a multiprotein E3 ligase complex (Santelli2005Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. Splice variants of SIAH1 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions.

## Function
The SIAH1 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is crucial for protein degradation in healthy human cells. SIAH1 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is essential for regulating protein stability and activity within the cell (Hu1999Siah1).

SIAH1 contains a RING domain that is critical for its proteolytic function, facilitating interactions with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. This domain is necessary for the degradation of target proteins, such as the DCC protein, and for the self-regulation of SIAH1 through its own degradation (Hu1999Siah1). The C-terminal sequences of SIAH1 are involved in oligomerization and binding to target proteins, which is important for its function in protein degradation (Hu1999Siah1).

SIAH1 is also implicated in cell cycle regulation and growth arrest, particularly through its interaction with the p53 pathway. It is induced by p53 and can inhibit cell growth by causing growth arrest without inducing apoptosis, suggesting a role in cell-cycle inhibition (Matsuzawa1998p53inducible).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIAH1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In developmental disorders, de novo variants in SIAH1 are associated with developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. These variants affect highly conserved amino acids and are predicted to be damaging, underscoring their potential impact on normal development (Buratti2020De).

In cancer, SIAH1 exhibits a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncoprotein depending on the context. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SIAH1 is downregulated, leading to advanced disease stages. It functions as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of β-catenin, thus inhibiting abnormal cell growth (Zhang2021Siah1; Yoshibayashi2007SIAH1). Conversely, in glioblastoma, SIAH1 acts as an oncoprotein by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, promoting tumor progression (Zhang2021Siah1).

SIAH1 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease, where it ubiquitinates proteins like α-synuclein, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Zhang2021Siah1). These diverse roles in disease contexts make SIAH1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SIAH1, a human E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in protein degradation. It is a central component of a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets β-catenin for degradation in response to p53 activation. This complex includes SIAH1, Siah-interacting protein (SIP), the adaptor protein Skp1, and the F-box protein Ebi. SIP interacts with SIAH1 through a PXAXVXP motif, which is crucial for β-catenin regulation (Santelli2005Structural).

SIAH1 also interacts with HPH2, a subunit of the Polycomb Group complex 1, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction requires the cysteine-rich region of SIAH1 and the PxVxAxP motif of HPH2 (Wu2010SIAH1). Additionally, SIAH1 binds to CacyBP/SIP, a protein involved in various cellular processes, through a specific motif (PAAVVAP) in the N-terminal region of CacyBP/SIP (Schneider2010S100A6).

These interactions highlight SIAH1's role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it serves as a specific recognition factor for E2 and target proteins, influencing processes like cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Matsuzawa2001Siah1).
