# HDAC10

## Overview
HDAC10 is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 10, which belongs to the class IIb family of histone deacetylases. This protein functions primarily as a polyamine deacetylase, playing a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular polyamine metabolism, which is essential for various cellular processes, including autophagy and cellular survival (Hai2017Histone). HDAC10 is characterized by a unique structure that includes an active catalytic domain and a pseudo-deacetylase domain, which contributes to its specificity for polyamine substrates (Shinsky2018Polyamine). The protein is highly expressed in tissues such as the liver, spleen, and kidney, and is involved in transcriptional regulation and protein interactions that influence cell survival and proliferation pathways (Yang2016HDAC10; Guardiola2002Molecular). Clinically, alterations in HDAC10 have been linked to diseases such as ovarian cancer and asthma, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhong2023The; Islam2017HDAC10).

## Structure
HDAC10 is a zinc-dependent polyamine deacetylase characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a catalytic domain and a pseudo-deacetylase domain (ΨDAC). The active catalytic domain functions as a polyamine deacetylase (PDAC), while the ΨDAC lacks the necessary residues for metal binding and catalysis, rendering it inactive (Shinsky2018Polyamine). The enzyme adopts a butterfly-like architecture with a central 4-helix bundle, similar to the CD1 and CD2 domains of HDAC6, suggesting an evolutionary relationship with other histone deacetylases (Shinsky2018Polyamine).

The active site of HDAC10 is sterically constricted by a 310-helix defined by the P(E,A)CE motif, which enforces specificity for long, slender polyamine substrates and excludes bulkier acetyl-L-lysine peptides (Shinsky2018Polyamine). This structural feature is crucial for its function as a polyamine deacetylase, with the gatekeeper residue E274 playing a significant role in substrate specificity (Hai2017Histone).

HDAC10 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Shinsky2018Polyamine). These structural and functional characteristics make HDAC10 a potential target for cancer therapy, particularly in neuroblastoma, where its expression is associated with poor survival outcomes (Shinsky2018Polyamine).

## Function
HDAC10 is a class II histone deacetylase that functions primarily as a polyamine deacetylase (PDAC) in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular polyamine metabolism, which is crucial for cellular functions such as stabilizing and regulating biological macromolecules. HDAC10 specifically deacetylates N8-acetylspermidine, maintaining the balance of polyamine metabolism, which is essential for cellular survival and autophagy (Hai2017Histone).

HDAC10 is highly expressed in the liver, spleen, and kidney, and is enriched in the cytoplasm. Its crystal structure reveals a glutamate gatekeeper and a sterically constricted active site, which confer specificity for N8-acetylspermidine hydrolysis while disfavoring acetyllysine hydrolysis (Hai2017Histone). This specificity is crucial for its role in polyamine metabolism and is associated with cellular survival and autophagy (Hai2017Histone).

In addition to its role in polyamine metabolism, HDAC10 is involved in transcriptional regulation. It can repress transcription independently of its deacetylase activity, suggesting it has a distinct transcriptional repressor domain. This indicates that HDAC10 may play roles in transcriptional regulation in the nucleus and potentially other unidentified roles in the cytoplasm (Guardiola2002Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the HDAC10 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably ovarian cancer and asthma. In ovarian cancer, particularly serous ovarian cancer, the HDAC10 gene is frequently deleted, with a 10% deep deletion rate observed in tumor samples. This deletion is associated with increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, suggesting that loss of HDAC10 may enhance the effectiveness of these treatments. Lower HDAC10 mRNA levels are also found in cisplatin-sensitive tumors compared to resistant ones, indicating a potential role in chemotherapy sensitivity (Islam2017HDAC10).

In asthma, HDAC10 expression is elevated in patients and is particularly prominent in M2 macrophages. HDAC10 promotes macrophage M2 polarization via the deacetylation of STAT3, contributing to airway inflammation. Mice with macrophage-specific HDAC10 deficiency exhibit reduced airway inflammation, highlighting its role in asthma pathogenesis. The use of HDAC10 inhibitors, such as Salvianolic acid B, has been shown to suppress airway inflammation, suggesting HDAC10 as a potential therapeutic target for asthma (Zhong2023The).

## Interactions
HDAC10, a class IIb histone deacetylase, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function. It has been shown to interact with HDAC3, a class I histone deacetylase, through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is specific, as HDAC10 does not interact with other class II HDACs or 14-3-3 proteins. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HDAC10 can independently bind to HDAC3, suggesting a robust interaction mechanism (Tong2002Identification).

In the context of cancer biology, HDAC10 interacts with the AKT protein, a key player in cell survival and proliferation pathways. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation and activation of AKT, promoting lung cancer cell growth. HDAC10 knockdown results in reduced AKT phosphorylation, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. The interaction between HDAC10 and AKT is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and it is suggested that HDAC10 may regulate AKT activity by deacetylation (Yang2016HDAC10).

HDAC10 also interacts with the transcription factor Foxp3 in T-regulatory cells, potentially influencing their suppressive function. However, the exact nature of this interaction and its mechanistic implications remain unclear (Dahiya2020HDAC10).
