# AR

## Overview
The AR gene encodes the androgen receptor, a type of nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor. This receptor is pivotal in mediating the biological effects of androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, which are essential for male sexual development and various physiological processes. The androgen receptor protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, which facilitate its role in gene regulation. Upon binding with androgens, the receptor undergoes a conformational change, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences and modulate the transcription of target genes. The AR gene is located on the X chromosome and is subject to various post-translational modifications that influence its activity. Mutations in the AR gene can lead to conditions such as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and are implicated in the progression of prostate cancer and other disorders (Quigley1998The; Claessens2008Diverse; Mooney2003A).

## Structure
The androgen receptor (AR) protein is composed of several key domains, each with distinct structural features. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) spans residues 556-623 and is characterized by two zinc fingers, each coordinating a zinc ion through four cysteine residues. This domain is crucial for binding to DNA response elements, with the P-box (amino acids 577-581) playing a role in specific DNA recognition. The DBD also facilitates dimerization through the D-box (amino acids 596-600) (Tan2014Androgen). The ligand-binding domain (LBD), covering residues 666-919, features a three-layer antiparallel α-helical sandwich fold and includes 11 α-helices and two small β-sheets. The LBD's H12 forms the core of the activation function 2 domain, acting as a lid for the ligand-binding pocket (Tan2014Androgen).

The AR protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as acetylation, ubiquitylation, and methylation, particularly affecting the 629-RKLKKL-634 motif in the hinge region (Tan2014Androgen). The AR gene is located on the X chromosome and encodes a protein of 919 amino acids, although this can vary due to poly-glutamine and poly-glycine stretches of variable lengths (Claessens2008Diverse). The AR's structure is similar to other nuclear receptors, with hormone binding inducing an 'active' conformation (Tan2014Androgen).

## Function
The androgen receptor (AR) gene encodes a protein that is a member of the steroid receptor family of nuclear transcription factors. In healthy human cells, its primary function is to mediate the effects of androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which are crucial for male sexual development and function (Quigley1998The). The AR protein undergoes a conformational change upon binding with androgens, which activates it to bind to DNA at specific hormone response elements in the promoter regions of target genes. This binding, in the presence of appropriate co-factors, alters the transcription rate of these genes, thereby mediating the physiological effects of androgens (Quigley1998The).

The AR is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues and is involved in various sexually dimorphic processes, including immune function modulation and neural tissue development (Quigley1998The). It is composed of several functional domains, including the amino-terminal domain, DNA-binding domain, hinge region, and ligand-binding domain, each contributing to its role as a transcription factor (Heinlein2002Androgen; Quigley1998The). The AR's activation is ligand-specific, with higher affinity ligands resulting in greater transcriptional activity (Quigley1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene can lead to a variety of conditions, most notably Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), which manifests in different forms such as Complete AIS (CAIS), Partial AIS (PAIS), and Mild AIS (MAIS). These conditions result from the body's inability to respond to androgens, leading to a spectrum of phenotypes from female external genitalia in CAIS to sterility in MAIS (Holterhus2005Molecular; Mooney2003A). Mutations in the AR gene can include premature termination codons, single amino acid substitutions, and alterations in the DNA-binding domain, affecting the receptor's function and leading to varying degrees of androgen resistance (McPhaul2002Androgen).

In prostate cancer, somatic mutations in the AR gene, particularly in the ligand-binding domain, can lead to the conversion of prostate tissue from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent, contributing to treatment resistance (Culig1997Androgen; Mooney2003A). Specific mutations, such as T877A, alter ligand specificity, allowing the AR to bind other steroid hormones, which can affect the regulation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene expression (Culig2001Androgen).

Kennedy's disease, or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is another condition linked to the AR gene, caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat in exon 1, leading to a toxic gain-of-function mutation affecting motor neurons (Gottlieb2012The).

## Interactions
The androgen receptor (AR) interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. The AR N/C interaction involves the NH2-terminal FXXLF motif binding to the AF2 site in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is androgen-dependent and essential for AR transcriptional activity (Wilson2011Analysis). MAGE-11, an AR coregulator, enhances AR activity by interacting with the AR FXXLF motif, relieving inhibition of p160 coactivator LXXLL motif binding at AF2 (Wilson2011Analysis). 

AR also forms complexes with actin and actin-binding proteins like supervillin, gelsolin, and filamin, which enhance AR-mediated transcription (Heemers2007Androgen). The AR interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) components Ku70 and Ku80, enhancing AR activity (Heemers2007Androgen). 

The AR's ligand-binding domain (LBD) interacts with coactivators through a surface composed of helices 3, 4, 5, and 12, known as activation function (AF)-2, preferring FXXLF motifs over LXXLL motifs (Hur2004Recognition). The AR also interacts with various proteins involved in the general transcriptional machinery, such as TFIIF and TFIIH, facilitating transcription initiation and elongation (Heemers2007Androgen).
