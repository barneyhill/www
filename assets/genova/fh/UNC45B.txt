# UNC45B

## Overview
The UNC45B gene encodes the unc-45 myosin chaperone B protein, a crucial molecular chaperone involved in the proper folding and assembly of myosin, a motor protein essential for muscle contraction. This protein is categorized as a myosin-specific chaperone and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm of muscle cells, where it interacts with heat shock proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 to facilitate the assembly of myosin into thick filaments, integral components of the sarcomere (Hellerschmied2019Molecular; Lee2014The). The UNC45B protein is characterized by a three-domain structure, including a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a central UNC-45/CRO1/She4p (UCS) domain, and a C-terminal domain, which collectively contribute to its chaperoning function (Hellerschmied2019Molecular). Mutations in the UNC45B gene have been linked to various muscle and eye-related disorders, highlighting its significance in both muscle integrity and eye development (Hansen2014The; Dafsari2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The UNC45B protein is characterized by a three-domain architecture, which includes an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a central UNC-45/CRO1/She4p (UCS) domain, and a C-terminal domain. The TPR domain is involved in interactions with other chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Hellerschmied2019Molecular). The UCS domain is crucial for binding myosin, playing a significant role in the folding and assembly of myosin into muscle thick filaments (Hellerschmied2019Molecular; Gaziova2020Mutational).

The secondary structure of UNC45B is predominantly alpha-helical, as indicated by circular dichroism spectra showing minima at 208 and 222 nm, consistent with its armadillo repeat composition (Gaziova2020Mutational). The protein can form dimers, with the wild-type (WT) protein dimerizing through interactions between the first armadillo repeat (Gaziova2020Mutational).

Mutational studies have shown that specific residues and structural features within the UCS domain are critical for its chaperoning activity. For instance, mutations in the client-binding groove and the flexible loop within the UCS domain can significantly impact myosin binding and chaperoning function (Gaziova2020Mutational). The R805W mutation, although distant from the myosin-interacting regions, has been shown to impair chaperoning activity and affect sarcomere structure (Gaziova2020Mutational).

## Function
The UNC45B gene encodes a myosin-specific chaperone that plays a crucial role in the folding and assembly of myosin, a motor protein essential for muscle contraction. In healthy human cells, UNC45B is primarily active in the cytoplasm of muscle cells, where it ensures the proper folding and function of myosin, contributing to muscle integrity and function (Gaziova2020Mutational; Lee2014The).

UNC45B interacts with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to facilitate the assembly of myosin into thick filaments, which are critical components of the sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of muscle fibers (Lee2014The; Barral2002Role). The protein is essential for myofibrillogenesis, particularly in striated muscles, and is involved in the dynamic association with Z-disks and A-bands in muscle fibers (Lee2014The).

In addition to its role in muscle cells, UNC45B is involved in the proper functioning of non-muscle myosin II, which is crucial for normal lens maturation in the eye. Mutations in UNC45B have been linked to developmental cataracts, highlighting its importance in eye development (Hansen2014The; Lee2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNC45B gene are associated with several muscle and eye-related diseases. Bi-allelic mutations in UNC45B have been identified as a cause of congenital myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness and myopathic changes. These mutations impair the interaction between UNC45B and the myosin heavy chain, disrupting myofibrillogenesis and leading to muscle dysfunction (Dafsari2019Biallelic). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg754Gln and p.Arg778Trp, have been linked to a novel form of progressive myopathy, which presents with childhood-onset muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency. These mutations result in a severe reduction of UNC45B protein and abnormal relocalization within the sarcomere, causing focal disruption of the myofibrillar apparatus (Yoon2019NEW).

UNC45B mutations are also implicated in eye development disorders. The p.Arg805Trp mutation in the UNC45B gene is associated with autosomal dominant juvenile cataract, affecting lens development and leading to vision impairment. This mutation disrupts non-muscle myosin assembly during lens fiber cell maturation, contributing to cataract formation (Hansen2014The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UNC45B in both muscle and eye development, with mutations leading to significant health implications.

## Interactions
UNC45B interacts with the myosin motor domain, forming a complex with the heat shock protein Hsp90. This interaction is crucial for the folding and stabilization of the myosin motor domain during muscle development. UNC45B specifically binds to myosin subfragments containing the motor domain but does not bind to the S2 region of the myosin rod or myosin light chains. The UNC45B/Hsp90 complex forms a trimeric structure with the myosin motor domain, and this binding is independent of Hsp90's ATPase activity (Srikakulam2008Unc45b).

UNC45B forms a stable complex with Hsp90 in both muscle and non-muscle cells, indicating a high affinity and selectivity for this interaction. This binding does not require ATP or ADP, suggesting that the interaction is independent of these molecules. UNC45B can rebind Hsp90 in vitro, further supporting the specificity of this interaction (Srikakulam2008Unc45b).

The interaction between UNC45B and myosin is also significant in the context of cardiomyopathy development. The UNC45B-myosin complex is primarily stabilized by electrostatic interactions, with a contact surface area similar to the myosin-actin complex. This interaction is essential for myosin folding, thick filament assembly, and muscle function (Fratev2013Structural).
