# GNPDA1

## Overview
GNPDA1, or glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in amino sugar metabolism, specifically within the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate and ammonia, linking the hexosamine system with glycolysis and playing a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis (Lin2019Glucosamine; Minchenko2017Expression). As a cytoplasmic enzyme, GNPDA1 is integral to maintaining levels of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a key metabolite for glycoconjugate synthesis and cellular signaling (p&gt; Glucosamine6Phosphate; Li2020&lt). The protein's activity is significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, where its expression is often altered, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Xia2021Prognostic; Zhao2021Identification). Additionally, GNPDA1 has been implicated in pregnancy-related disorders such as preeclampsia, underscoring its importance in both metabolic regulation and disease (Vennou2020Metaanalysis).

## Structure
GNPDA1 (glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in amino sugar metabolism. The primary structure of GNPDA1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interactions. The secondary structure of the protein includes both alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of GNPDA1 is characterized by the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. In terms of quaternary structure, GNPDA1 may involve the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details on the number and arrangement of these subunits are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications of GNPDA1 can include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may affect the enzyme's activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules. These modifications are common in proteins involved in metabolic pathways and can play a role in regulating the enzyme's function. The context does not provide information on specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms of GNPDA1. Overall, the structural features of GNPDA1 are integral to its role in amino sugar metabolism.

## Function
GNPDA1 (glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate and ammonia, a process essential for amino sugar metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis (Lin2019Glucosamine; Minchenko2017Expression). This conversion links the hexosamine system with the glycolytic pathway, thereby integrating carbohydrate metabolism with cellular signaling and metabolic regulation (p&gt; Glucosamine6Phosphate; Li2020&lt).

GNPDA1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the maintenance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a metabolite important for the synthesis of glycoconjugates such as hyaluronan. This metabolite also functions as a metabolic sensor, influencing cell functions through the modification of intracellular proteins (Minchenko2017Expression). The enzyme's activity is significant for energy metabolism, as it facilitates the catabolism of hexosamines into phosphate sugars, which serve as energy sources (p&gt; Glucosamine6Phosphate; Li2020&lt).

In healthy human cells, GNPDA1's role in these metabolic pathways is vital for maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting various biosynthetic processes necessary for normal cell function and growth.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNPDA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and preeclampsia. In cancer, GNPDA1 is associated with the progression of gastrointestinal cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. Elevated expression levels of GNPDA1 are linked to poor prognosis in these cancers, as it enhances glycolysis by converting glucosamine 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, thus providing more raw materials for cancer cell metabolism (Xia2021Prognostic). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, GNPDA1 is part of a glycolysis-related gene signature that predicts poor survival outcomes, indicating its role as a risk factor in cancer prognosis (Qin2021A).

In preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy, GNPDA1 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene. Its deletion in knockout mouse models leads to embryonic lethality and abnormal uterus morphology, suggesting a critical role in developmental processes and the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Vennou2020Metaanalysis). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GNPDA1 in both cancer progression and pregnancy-related disorders.

## Interactions
GNPDA1, or glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer. In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), GNPDA1 has been identified as a novel interactor within the MPM interactome. It forms a protein-protein interaction with HSP90AB1, both of which are derived from exosomes. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that facilitate intercellular communication and play roles in immunoregulation and metastasis (Karunakaran2021Malignant).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GNPDA1 is upregulated and associated with tumor proliferation and migration, correlating with poor prognosis. Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in HCC are not detailed, the gene's role in amino acid metabolism suggests potential interactions within metabolic pathways (Zhao2021Identification).

In colorectal cancer, GNPDA1 is upregulated following treatment with caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), indicating its involvement in the cellular response to this compound. However, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided (He2014Identification). Overall, GNPDA1's interactions appear to be significant in cancer-related pathways, although detailed interaction partners are not extensively documented.
