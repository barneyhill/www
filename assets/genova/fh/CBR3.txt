# CBR3

## Overview
Carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbonyl reductase 3, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, playing a significant role in the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous substrates, including the reductive metabolism of anthracyclines, which are chemotherapeutic agents (Zhang2009Identification; Cheng2012A). CBR3 is characterized by its cytosolic localization and monomeric structure, and it exhibits a unique secondary structure compared to its homolog, carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) (Miura2008Different). The gene is regulated by the Nrf2/ARE pathway, suggesting a role in oxidative stress response (Cheng2012A). Clinically, CBR3 has been associated with various conditions, including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and breast cancer, where its genetic polymorphisms and expression levels influence disease susceptibility and drug resistance (GándaraMireles2021Genotype; Zhang2021LncRNA).

## Structure
Human carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3) is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. The enzyme consists of 277 amino acids and shares a high sequence similarity with carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), with 85% similarity and 72% identity (ElHawari2009Analysis). CBR3 features a Rossmann-fold consensus sequence, which is crucial for cofactor binding, a characteristic shared with CBR1 (Miura2008Different).

In terms of secondary structure, CBR3 has a unique 3_10 helix structure between the aF and bF regions, which is absent in CBR1. This structural element is located away from the substrate-binding cleft and is unlikely to impact catalytic activity (Miura2008Different). Additionally, CBR3 has an amino-terminal elongation of the aG helix due to a substitution of Pro-244 in CBR1 with Val-244 in CBR3, which may influence the conformational movement of the substrate-binding loop (Miura2008Different).

The tertiary structure of CBR3 is a single soluble domain without a hydrophobic cluster, consistent with its cytosolic localization (Miura2008Different). CBR3 functions as a monomeric enzyme, as implied by the context, although the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed (Miura2008Different).

## Function
Carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3) is a cytosolic enzyme that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. It plays a role in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, contributing to the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous substrates. CBR3 is involved in the reductive metabolism of anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, converting them into their less potent C-13 alcohol metabolites, doxorubicinol and daunorubicinol, which are associated with cardiotoxicity (Zhang2009Identification; Cheng2012A).

CBR3 exhibits lower catalytic activity compared to its homolog, carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), and has a narrower substrate spectrum. It shows significant activity towards certain quinones, such as 1,2-naphthoquinone, but lacks activity towards many endogenous substrates that CBR1 can process (Ebert2010Regulation). The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest mRNA levels in the ovary and pancreas (Ebert2010Regulation).

CBR3 is regulated by the Nrf2/ARE pathway, which is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. The presence of a conserved antioxidant response element (ARE) in its promoter suggests that CBR3 may play a role in antioxidant defense mechanisms (Cheng2012A). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific physiological role of CBR3 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Miura2008Different).

## Clinical Significance
The CBR3 gene, encoding carbonyl reductase 3, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its genetic polymorphisms and expression alterations. In the context of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the CBR3 rs1056892 polymorphism has been studied for its association with disease susceptibility. The heterozygous (HT) genotype of this polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of developing ALL, while the mutated genotype (HM) is associated with a protective effect against the disease (GándaraMireles2021Genotype).

In breast cancer, the long non-coding RNA CBR3-AS1, located in the antisense region of the CBR3 gene, plays a significant role in drug resistance. Overexpression of CBR3-AS1 is associated with increased resistance to Adriamycin (ADR), a chemotherapy drug, and is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. This resistance is mediated through the MAPK signaling pathway, where CBR3-AS1 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA, affecting the expression of proteins involved in drug resistance (Zhang2021LncRNA).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), CBR3-AS1 is also implicated in resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), particularly in cases independent of BCR::ABL1 kinase activity, suggesting its role in resistance-associated pathways (Lin2024LncRNA).

## Interactions
CBR3 (carbonyl reductase 3) is known to form a mitochondrial heterotetramer with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 8 (17β-HSD8), indicating a physical interaction between these proteins (Cheng2012A). This interaction suggests a potential role for CBR3 in mitochondrial functions or pathways involving steroid metabolism.

CBR3 is regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2, which binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. A specific conserved ARE in the CBR3 promoter mediates its induction by Nrf2, as evidenced by increased binding of protein complexes to this site in nuclear extracts from cells treated with Nrf2 activators (Cheng2012A). This interaction highlights the role of CBR3 in oxidative stress response pathways.

Despite its structural similarity to CBR1, CBR3 does not naturally reduce S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and does not participate in nitric oxide signaling through GSNO reduction, unlike CBR1 (Staab2011Studies). Attempts to modify CBR3 to mimic CBR1's activity through site-directed mutagenesis have shown that specific amino acid exchanges can enable CBR3 to reduce GSNO, although not to the same extent as CBR1 (Staab2011Studies).
