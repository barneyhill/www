# OPRL1

## Overview
The OPRL1 gene encodes the opioid-related nociceptin receptor 1 (NOP), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is distinct from classical opioid receptors as it does not bind traditional opioid ligands but instead interacts with the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ. NOP plays a crucial role in modulating pain perception, stress response, and various central nervous system functions, including neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability (Seo2018Curcumin; AlHashimi2016Evidence). The receptor's involvement extends to immune function and tumor immune microenvironment regulation, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Wang2024Expression). Variations in the OPRL1 gene have been linked to conditions such as opiate addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorders, underscoring its clinical relevance (Andero2013AmygdalaDependent; Briant2010Evidence; Ruggeri2017Methylation).

## Structure
The OPRL1 gene encodes the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP), a member of the opioid receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The primary structure of the NOP receptor consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, which is characterized by seven transmembrane (7TM) helices typical of GPCRs (Thompson2012Structure). The secondary structure includes these transmembrane helices, with proline-induced kinks affecting the shape of the ligand-binding pocket (Thompson2012Structure). 

The tertiary structure of NOP reveals a unique binding pocket that results in distinct ligand selectivity, influenced by specific residues such as Ala216, Gln280, and Thr305, which differ from those in classical opioid receptors (Thompson2012Structure). The extracellular loops (ECLs) and intracellular loops (ICLs) of NOP are structurally similar to those of other GPCRs, with ECL2 forming an elongated β-hairpin motif (Thompson2012Structure).

Alternative splicing of the OPRL1 gene results in multiple isoforms, including NOP-TV5 and NOP-TV11, which have unique structural features such as a 6TM-coding variant (Piltonen2020Alternative). These variants may have distinct signaling capabilities and are enriched among genes related to pain and psychiatric disorders (Piltonen2020Alternative).

## Function
The OPRL1 gene encodes the nociceptin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in modulating pain perception and nociception. This receptor is part of the opioid receptor family, which includes mu, kappa, delta, and NOP receptors, and is primarily active in the central nervous system (CNS) (Seo2018Curcumin). Unlike classical opioid receptors, the nociceptin receptor does not bind to traditional opioid ligands and is not activated by them. Instead, it binds to the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ, which acts as an anti-analgesic, increasing nociception and counteracting pain relievers in supraspinal pain pathways (Seo2018Curcumin).

In healthy human cells, the nociceptin receptor is involved in various molecular processes, including the modulation of neurotransmitter release and changes in neuronal excitability. It is expressed in pain-modulating pathways within the CNS, linking areas such as the locus coeruleus, medulla, and periaqueductal gray area (Seo2018Curcumin). The receptor's activation can lead to the attenuation of inhibitory neurotransmitter release, influencing processes like analgesia, learning, and memory. Additionally, the nociceptin receptor is expressed in immune cells, suggesting a potential role in immune function and response to inflammation (AlHashimi2016Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OPRL1 gene, which encodes the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP-R), have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the context of opiate addiction, specific variants of the OPRL1 gene, such as rs6090041 and rs6090043, have been linked to increased vulnerability in Caucasian populations. These variants may affect transcriptional regulation, potentially altering NOP-R expression and influencing addiction risk by modifying the rewarding properties of opiates (Briant2010Evidence).

The OPRL1 gene is also implicated in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The SNP rs6010719 has been associated with increased PTSD symptoms, particularly in individuals exposed to significant trauma. This SNP affects fear processing mechanisms, as evidenced by altered functional connectivity between the amygdala and insula in affected individuals (Andero2013AmygdalaDependent).

In the realm of alcohol use disorders, decreased methylation of the OPRL1 gene has been linked to increased binge drinking in adolescents, suggesting that epigenetic changes in OPRL1 may enhance reward sensitivity and contribute to alcohol-related behaviors (Ruggeri2017Methylation). These findings underscore the gene's role in modulating addiction and stress-related conditions.

## Interactions
The OPRL1 gene encodes the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including pain modulation and stress response. OPRL1 participates in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. The receptor interacts with G proteins to initiate intracellular signaling pathways, which are essential for its role in modulating nociceptive and analgesic mechanisms (Ma2022Anatomical).

In the context of fear and stress responses, OPRL1 has been implicated in the regulation of fear memory consolidation. The use of a selective NOP receptor agonist, SR-8993, demonstrated that activation of OPRL1 in the amygdala can impair fear memory consolidation, suggesting a functional interaction with other proteins involved in fear processing (Andero2013AmygdalaDependent).

OPRL1 is also involved in immune-related pathways and tumor immune microenvironment regulation. It has been found to correlate with immune cell infiltration in certain cancers, indicating its role in tumor immune response (Wang2024Expression). These interactions highlight the receptor's involvement in complex physiological networks beyond its traditional role in pain modulation.
