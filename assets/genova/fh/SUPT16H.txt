# SUPT16H

## Overview
SUPT16H is a gene that encodes the SPT16 protein, a pivotal component of the Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex, which is integral to chromatin remodeling processes. The SPT16 protein, categorized as a chromatin remodeling subunit, plays a crucial role in the dynamic regulation of nucleosome structure, thereby facilitating transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. This process involves the temporary disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes, which is essential for maintaining chromatin integrity and proper gene expression. SUPT16H is highly expressed in proliferating cells and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. It also plays a significant role in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency and neurodevelopment, with mutations in the gene being linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders (Mylonas2018Transcriptional; Shen2019Histone; Wang2023Supt16).

## Structure
The SUPT16H gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling. The protein consists of several domains, including the Spt16M domain, which plays a significant role in histone interaction. The Spt16M domain is characterized by its interaction with histone H2A-H2B dimers, facilitated by specific structural features such as the U-turn motif, which provides a unique contact surface for these histones (Hondele2013Structural).

The Spt16M domain exhibits distinct electrostatic surface potentials, with positively charged patches on the PHL-1 domain and an acidic surface on PHL-2. This configuration is well-suited for neutralizing the basic nature of histones. The interaction between Spt16M and histone H2A-H2B involves the H2B N-terminal tail, which is crucial for complex formation. The orientation of Spt16M and H2A-H2B dimers in the crystal lattice reveals a conserved acidic patch on PHL-2 that contacts basic residues in the N-terminal tail and α1-helix of H2A (Hondele2013Structural).

In terms of tertiary and quaternary structure, SUPT16H interacts with other proteins like SSRP1, forming a quaternary structure essential for its function in transcription regulation. The protein often undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Hondele2013Structural).

## Function
The SUPT16H gene encodes the SPT16 protein, a crucial component of the Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling. This complex is essential for the manipulation of nucleosomes, allowing RNA polymerase II to efficiently transcribe DNA by facilitating transcriptional elongation. The FACT complex achieves this by temporarily disassembling nucleosomes, removing one of the H2A-H2B dimers to form a transient hexasome structure, and then reassembling the nucleosome after transcription, thereby maintaining chromatin integrity and histone modification signatures (Mylonas2018Transcriptional; Shen2019Histone).

In healthy human cells, SUPT16H is involved in various chromatin-related processes, including DNA replication, damage repair, transcription initiation, and elongation. It is highly expressed in proliferating cells and minimally expressed in terminally differentiated cells, indicating its role in cell cycle regulation and proper cell growth and survival (Wang2023Supt16). SUPT16H also plays a role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway and, in conjunction with OCT4, promotes the expression of stemness genes in embryonic stem cells (Wang2023Supt16). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it supports the self-renewal of neural stem cells and is crucial for maintaining their stemness, which is vital for proper neurodevelopment (Wang2023Supt16).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUPT16H gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and physical abnormalities. De novo variants in SUPT16H have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviors, and craniofacial abnormalities. These mutations often result in corpus callosum abnormalities, such as partial agenesis and cerebral atrophy, as observed in several patients (Bina2020De). 

SUPT16H is also implicated in the regulation of neural stem cell function. Haploinsufficiency of SUPT16H disrupts the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/autophagy pathway, leading to increased autophagy, cell cycle arrest, impaired cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis in human neural stem cells. These disruptions are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that SUPT16H is crucial for neural development (Wang2023Supt16).

Additionally, deletions in the 14q11.2 region, which includes SUPT16H, are associated with developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. These deletions may result in a null mutation of SUPT16H, contributing to the observed clinical features (Lengyel2022Clinical; Zahir2007Novel).

## Interactions
SUPT16H, a subunit of the FACT complex, interacts extensively with nucleosomal DNA and histones, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling. The FACT complex, composed of SUPT16H and SSRP1, binds to nucleosomal DNA, contacting approximately 19 base pairs and covering a surface area of about 2300 Å². The SPT16 subunit, part of SUPT16H, interacts with the H2A-H2B dimer through its C-terminal domain, stabilizing the sub-nucleosome structure and preventing foreign DNA invasion during transcription (Liu2019FACT).

SUPT16H is also involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) by interacting with UVSSA, a protein necessary for this repair pathway. This interaction is mediated by the DUF2043 domain of UVSSA, and SPT16 is crucial for the recruitment of UVSSA to sites of DNA damage (Wienholz2019FACT).

Additionally, SUPT16H is acetylated by TIP60, and this modification is recognized by BRD4, which enhances SUPT16H stability by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is significant in the context of gene silencing, as it associates with histone modification enzymes like EZH2 and HDAC1, affecting histone marks and contributing to the suppression of antiviral interferon signaling (Zhou2021FACT).
