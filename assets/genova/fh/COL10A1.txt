# COL10A1

## Overview
The COL10A1 gene encodes the collagen type X alpha 1 chain, a non-fibrillar collagen protein primarily expressed in the growth plate cartilage. This protein plays a pivotal role in the extracellular matrix, particularly during the process of endochondral ossification, which is crucial for the development and growth of long bones. Collagen type X is categorized as a short-chain collagen and is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a triple helical domain flanked by non-collagenous regions. The NC1 domain is essential for the trimerization of the collagen X molecule, forming a stable homotrimer necessary for its biological function (Wu2021Characterization; Bogin2002Insight). Mutations in the COL10A1 gene are linked to skeletal disorders such as Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, while altered expression levels have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric cancer, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Chen2020Analysis; Bateman2005Mutations).

## Structure
The COL10A1 gene encodes the collagen type X alpha 1 chain, a crucial component of type X collagen, which is a short-chain, non-fibrillar collagen primarily expressed in the growth plate cartilage. The protein structure includes a signal peptide at the N-terminal, followed by a non-collagenous 2 (NC2) region, a triple helix-forming Gly-X-Y repeats region, and a non-collagenous 1 (NC1) region at the C-terminal (Wu2021Characterization). The NC1 domain is particularly significant as it facilitates the trimerization of the collagen X molecule, forming a stable homotrimer essential for its function (Bogin2002Insight; Bateman2005Mutations).

The NC1 domain is characterized by a ten-stranded β-sandwich with jellyroll topology, similar to the C-terminal C1q domain of ACRP30 (Bogin2002Insight; Bateman2005Mutations). This domain also contains a central hydrophobic channel that becomes more hydrophilic at the top, where calcium ions are present, contributing to the stability of the trimer (Bateman2005Mutations). The NC1 domain's external surface has hydrophobic patches that may be involved in higher-order structure formation (Bateman2005Mutations). Post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, which are typical for collagen proteins.

## Function
The COL10A1 gene encodes the collagen type X alpha 1 chain, a critical component of the extracellular matrix in cartilage, specifically expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. This process is essential for the development and growth of long bones (Wallis1996Mutations; Bateman2004Identification). Collagen X is a homotrimer, consisting of three identical alpha 1 chains, and is characterized by a short triple helical domain flanked by noncollagenous domains, NC2 and NC1. The NC1 domain is crucial for trimerization, forming a stable trimer that is essential for the assembly and function of collagen X (Bogin2002Insight; Bateman2005Mutations).

In healthy human cells, collagen X is thought to organize the extracellular matrix by forming supramolecular structures, potentially hexagonal lattice structures, within the cartilage pericellular matrix. These structures may influence processes such as vascular invasion, calcification, and remodeling during bone development (Bateman2005Mutations). The NC1 domain's role in trimerization and its structural integrity are vital for maintaining the stability and function of type X collagen, which plays a significant role in bone development and growth (Wu2021Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL10A1 gene are primarily associated with Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), a dominantly inherited skeletal disorder. This condition is characterized by short stature, bowed legs, and metaphyseal abnormalities, particularly affecting the distal femoral and proximal tibial metaphyses. Mutations often occur in the C-terminal NC1 domain of the collagen X protein, leading to impaired trimerization and secretion, resulting in intracellular degradation of the protein. These mutations can be missense or introduce premature termination signals, causing functional haploinsufficiency (Chan1998A; McIntosh1995Concentration; Bateman2005Mutations).

Altered expression of COL10A1 has also been linked to gastric cancer. The gene is overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with tumor differentiation, pathological stage, and lymph node metastasis. This overexpression correlates with poorer prognosis, suggesting that COL10A1 could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer (Chen2020Analysis). The dual role of COL10A1 in both skeletal disorders and cancer highlights its significance in human health and disease.

## Interactions
COL10A1, the gene encoding the alpha 1 chain of type X collagen, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cellular processes. In gastric cancer, COL10A1 is regulated by the transcription factor SOX9, which binds directly to its promoter. This interaction is enhanced by TGF-β1 stimulation, leading to increased expression of both SOX9 and COL10A1, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor aggressiveness (Li2018TGFβ1SOX9).

In colorectal cancer, COL10A1 interacts with proteins such as MMP13, SOX9, and RUNX2, which are associated with cancer stem cells and mesenchymal transformation. These interactions suggest a role for COL10A1 in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting tumor invasiveness (Kahlert2022COL10A1).

During chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation, COL10A1 is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors, including Runx2, which interacts with the COL10A1 promoter and enhancer regions. Cox-2 is another significant factor that interacts with the COL10A1 enhancer, suggesting a regulatory role in its expression (Gu2014Identification). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of COL10A1 in skeletal development and disease.
