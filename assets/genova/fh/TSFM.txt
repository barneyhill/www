# TSFM

## Overview
The TSFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts), a critical component in the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis. EF-Ts functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, specifically facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), thereby playing a pivotal role in the elongation phase of mitochondrial translation. This protein is essential for the synthesis of polypeptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA, which are integral to the oxidative phosphorylation system, the primary source of cellular energy. EF-Ts is particularly vital in energy-demanding cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons. Mutations in the TSFM gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, manifesting in various clinical phenotypes, including neurodegenerative disorders and cardiomyopathies, due to impaired mitochondrial translation and energy production (Smeitink2006Distinct; Emperador2016Moleculargenetic; Fetisova2024A).

## Structure
The TSFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the exchange of guanine nucleotides on the translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (Yang2022Case). The EF-Ts protein consists of 346 amino acids and is involved in the elongation step of mitochondrial translation (Yang2022Case).

The primary structure of EF-Ts includes a conserved N-terminal region (residues 1-161) shared across its four isoforms, while the C-terminal region varies among them (Perli2019Novel). The secondary structure of EF-Ts includes helices H5, H6, and H7, which are important for its interaction with EF-Tu (Perli2019Novel). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and other elements to form a functional protein capable of binding EF-Tu and promoting the formation of EF-Tu/GTP from EF-Tu/GDP (Perli2019Novel).

Mutations in the TSFM gene can affect the protein's structure and function. For instance, the p.(Leu137Glyfs*24) mutation results in chain truncation in the conserved N-terminal region, likely disrupting EF-Ts/EF-Tu interaction by reducing the binding surface area (Perli2019Novel). The p.(Leu169Phe) mutation in the variable C-terminal region causes unfavorable van der Waals contacts, potentially requiring structural adjustments in the helices crucial for EF-Ts/EF-Tu interaction (Perli2019Novel). These structural changes can destabilize the EF-Ts/EF-Tu complex, impacting mitochondrial translation and contributing to disease phenotypes (Perli2019Novel).

## Function
The TSFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. EF-Ts functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). This interaction facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on EF-Tu, enabling the binding of aminoacylated tRNAs to the A-site of mitochondrial ribosomes, a critical step in the elongation phase of protein synthesis (Smeitink2006Distinct; Scala2019Novel). 

In healthy human cells, EF-Ts is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial translation apparatus, which synthesizes the 13 polypeptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These polypeptides are integral components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which is the primary source of cellular energy (Smeitink2006Distinct). The activity of EF-Ts is particularly important in cells with high energy demands, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons, where it supports the production and consumption of energy through the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fetisova2024A). 

Mutations in the TSFM gene can disrupt this process, leading to deficiencies in OXPHOS complexes and associated clinical phenotypes, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cardiomyopathies (Emperador2016Moleculargenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSFM gene, which encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts, are associated with a range of mitochondrial diseases. These include combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency type 3 (COXPD3), Leigh syndrome, and various forms of cardiomyopathy. COXPD3 is characterized by neurological and cardiac symptoms, often presenting as concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle and neurological manifestations such as muscle hypotonia and choreo-like dyskinesis (Fetisova2024A). Leigh syndrome and Leigh-like syndromes, linked to TSFM mutations, are neurodegenerative disorders marked by mitochondrial energy generation issues, often presenting with ophthalmologic involvement and multisystemic symptoms (Scala2019Novel).

Cardiomyopathy associated with TSFM mutations can manifest as hypertrophic or dilated forms, often accompanied by neurological symptoms such as optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and encephalopathy (Perli2019Novel). Specific mutations, such as the frameshift mutation c.408_409delGT and the missense variant c.505C>T, have been linked to severe cardiac phenotypes, including infantile-onset mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (Perli2019Novel). Additionally, compound heterozygous variants like c.997C>T and c.355G>C have been identified in cases of juvenile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, further illustrating the gene's clinical significance (Yang2022Case). These mutations often lead to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory function, contributing to the disease phenotypes observed (Yang2022Case).

## Interactions
The TSFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor EF-Ts, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by interacting with the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). EF-Ts functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for EF-Tu, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is essential for the binding of aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosomal A site during translation elongation (Perli2019Novel; Smeitink2006Distinct).

The interaction between EF-Ts and EF-Tu is critical for the stability and function of the mitochondrial translation machinery. Mutations in the TSFM gene can disrupt this interaction, leading to decreased steady-state levels of both EF-Ts and EF-Tu, as observed in patient fibroblasts and affected myocardium (Perli2019Novel; Smeitink2006Distinct). Structural modeling suggests that certain mutations, such as Arg333Trp, alter the local structure of EF-Ts, affecting its interaction with EF-Tu and destabilizing the complex (Smeitink2006Distinct).

The TSFM protein's core domain, including the C-subdomain and N-subdomain, is involved in these interactions. Variants in these subdomains can impair the formation of the EF-Ts/EF-Tu complex, adversely affecting mitochondrial translation and contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Scala2019Novel).
