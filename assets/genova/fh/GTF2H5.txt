# GTF2H5

## Overview
GTF2H5 is a human gene that encodes the protein known as general transcription factor IIH subunit 5 (TTDA or p8), which is a critical component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in both transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER), processes essential for maintaining genomic stability. As a subunit of the TFIIH complex, TTDA is involved in stabilizing the complex and facilitating interactions between other subunits, such as XPB and p52, which are crucial for the complex's function in DNA repair and transcription (Michalska2019A; GigliaMari2004A). The protein's small size, consisting of 71 amino acids, belies its importance in cellular processes, as it acts to stabilize the TFIIH complex and enhance its activity, particularly in response to DNA damage (Kolesnikova2019TFIIH:). Mutations in GTF2H5 are linked to trichothiodystrophy group A (TTD-A), a disorder characterized by defects in DNA repair, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Moriwaki2014Trichothiodystrophy).

## Structure
The GTF2H5 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the TFIIH complex, known as TTDA or p8. This protein is small, consisting of 71 amino acids, and has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 8 kDa (Michalska2019A; GigliaMari2004A). The primary structure of TTDA is highly conserved across species, with significant sequence identity between humans and yeast (GigliaMari2004A).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, TTDA forms a stable complex with the C-terminal domain of the p52 subunit through β-strand addition and coiled coil interactions between terminal α-helices. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the TFIIH complex (Kolesnikova2019TFIIH:). The crystal structure of yeast Tfb2 in complex with Tfb5, the yeast homolog of TTDA, reveals a compact pseudo-symmetric heterodimer, indicating a similar structural organization in humans (Kolesnikova2019TFIIH:).

TTDA plays a critical role in the quaternary structure of TFIIH by bridging the C-terminal domain of p52 with XPB, which is essential for stimulating XPB ATPase activity necessary for nucleotide excision repair (Kolesnikova2019TFIIH:). The protein's interaction with other TFIIH subunits, such as XPD and p52, is vital for maintaining the stability and function of the entire complex (Michalska2019A).

## Function
The human gene GTF2H5 encodes a protein that is a subunit of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which plays a crucial role in both transcription and DNA repair processes. In healthy human cells, GTF2H5, also known as TFB5, is involved in regulating the levels of the TFIIH complex, which is essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II and for nucleotide excision repair (NER) (GigliaMari2004A). NER is responsible for removing a wide range of DNA helix-distorting injuries, including those induced by ultraviolet light, while transcription-coupled repair (TCR) eliminates both classical NER lesions and oxidative DNA injuries from the transcribed strand (GigliaMari2004A).

TFB5 is crucial for maintaining the stability and steady-state levels of the TFIIH complex, particularly in the context of DNA repair, where higher concentrations of TFIIH are required compared to transcription (GigliaMari2004A). The presence of TFB5 increases the levels of TFIIH components such as XPB and CDK7, suggesting a chaperone-like function in the assembly or maintenance of the TFIIH complex (GigliaMari2004A). TFB5 accumulates at sites of DNA damage and is necessary for the repair process, stabilizing the TFIIH complex and protecting it from degradation (GigliaMari2004A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GTF2H5 gene are associated with trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by brittle hair, intellectual disability, and photosensitivity. TTD is caused by defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a critical DNA repair process. Specifically, mutations in GTF2H5 lead to trichothiodystrophy group A (TTD-A), which is marked by photosensitivity, ichthyosis, cataracts, and developmental delays (Moriwaki2014Trichothiodystrophy; GigliaMari2004A). The GTF2H5 gene encodes a subunit of the TFIIH complex, which is essential for NER and transcription. Mutations in this gene can result in a non-functional TFIIH complex, impairing DNA repair and leading to the clinical manifestations of TTD (Cleaver2005Splitting; Michalska2019A).

In addition to its role in TTD, alterations in GTF2H5 expression levels have been studied in the context of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Low expression of GTF2H5 has been associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival in HGSOC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. This relationship highlights the gene's involvement in DNA repair processes and its impact on cancer prognosis (Gayarre2016The).

## Interactions
GTF2H5, also known as TTDA, is a subunit of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER). GTF2H5 interacts with other subunits of the TFIIH complex, specifically binding through its N-terminal region to the TFIIH subunits XPD and p52. The interaction between GTF2H5 and p52 is particularly important as it provides stability to the entire TFIIH complex (Michalska2019A).

GTF2H5, identified as the human ortholog of TFB5, is associated with TFIIH in mammalian cells. This association has been demonstrated through co-precipitation experiments with antibodies against TFIIH components such as XPB and p44. The presence of GTF2H5 is essential for maintaining steady-state levels of TFIIH, as its absence leads to reduced levels of TFIIH, affecting NER more than transcription (GigliaMari2004A).

GTF2H5 is implicated in the DNA repair syndrome trichothiodystrophy group A (TTD-A), and mutations in this gene can disrupt the function of the TFIIH complex, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of TFIIH, particularly in DNA repair processes (Michalska2019A; GigliaMari2004A).
