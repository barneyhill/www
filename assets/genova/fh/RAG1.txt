# RAG1

## Overview
The RAG1 gene encodes the recombination activating 1 protein, a critical component of the V(D)J recombination machinery, which is essential for the development of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. This protein functions as part of a complex with RAG2, facilitating the rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes by introducing double-strand breaks at specific DNA sequences. The RAG1 protein is characterized by several domains, including a nonamer-binding domain, dimerization and DNA-binding domain, and a zinc-binding domain, which are crucial for its role in DNA binding and recombination. Mutations in the RAG1 gene can lead to severe immunodeficiency disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Omenn syndrome, due to its pivotal role in lymphocyte development and immune function (Bosticardo2021RAG; Notarangelo2016Human; Oettinger1990RAG1).

## Structure
The RAG1 protein is essential for V(D)J recombination, a process critical for the development of T and B cells. It is composed of 1,043 amino acids and includes several key domains: the nonamer-binding domain (NBD), dimerization and DNA-binding domain (DDBD), pre-RNase H (preR), catalytic RNase H (RNH), and a zinc-binding domain. The zinc-binding domain contains two regions with cysteine and histidine residues, and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) is also important for its function (Notarangelo2016Human).

The RAG1 protein contains a C3HC4 zinc-binding motif, also known as a zinc ring finger, which binds two zinc ions. This motif is located in the N-terminal third of the RAG1 sequence. Additionally, two C2H2 zinc finger sequences have been identified, contributing to the protein's dimerization domain (Rodgers1996A). The R121 domain, located immediately N-terminal to the core RAG1 region, serves as the dimerization domain for the full-length protein (Rodgers1996A).

The non-core region of RAG1 includes a basic-zinc dimerization domain (bZDD) and a central non-core domain (CND), which are involved in nuclear localization and nucleic acid interactions (Arbuckle2011Elucidating). The full-length RAG1 protein coordinates at least nine zinc ions across various domains, which are crucial for the protein's folding, stability, and DNA binding functions (Arbuckle2011Elucidating).

## Function
The RAG1 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the V(D)J recombination process, which is essential for the development of the immune system in vertebrates. This process generates diverse antibody and T-cell receptor repertoires, which are critical for adaptive immunity (Oettinger1990RAG1). RAG1, along with RAG2, forms a complex that introduces double-strand breaks at specific DNA sequences, facilitating the rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. This activity primarily occurs in the nucleus of lymphoid cells (Oettinger1990RAG1).

The expression of RAG1 and RAG2 is tightly regulated and is primarily detectable in pre-B and pre-T cell lines, indicating their role in the early stages of lymphocyte development (Oettinger1990RAG1). RAG1 is thought to either encode a lymphoid-specific component of the recombination machinery or serve as a regulator of the pathway leading to the expression of the V(D)J recombinase (Oettinger1990RAG1). The RAG1 and RAG2 genes are adjacent in the genome and may encode functionally distinct subunits of a single recombinase complex or separate factors for different steps of the recombination reaction (Oettinger1990RAG1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAG1 gene are associated with a range of immunodeficiency disorders, primarily due to its critical role in V(D)J recombination, which is essential for the development of T and B lymphocytes. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is one of the most severe conditions resulting from RAG1 mutations, characterized by a profound lack of T and B cells, leading to life-threatening infections early in life (Bosticardo2021RAG; Notarangelo2016Human). Omenn syndrome (OS) is another severe condition linked to RAG1 mutations, marked by immune dysregulation, erythroderma, and elevated IgE levels (Bosticardo2021RAG; Delmonte2020Immune).

Hypomorphic mutations in RAG1 can lead to atypical SCID, which presents with partially preserved T-cell function, and combined immune deficiency (CID), which may manifest later in life with milder symptoms (Bosticardo2021RAG; Delmonte2018RAG). These mutations can also cause conditions like common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective antibody deficiency, often accompanied by autoimmune features and immune dysregulation (Bulkhi2019Approaches).

The clinical manifestations of RAG1 mutations are highly variable, influenced by the specific mutation and other genetic or environmental factors, leading to a spectrum of phenotypes from severe immunodeficiency to milder forms with autoimmune components (de2005A; Delmonte2018RAG).

## Interactions
The RAG1 protein interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in V(D)J recombination. RAG1 forms a complex with RAG2, creating a heterotetrameric structure essential for binding to recombination signal sequences (RSS) on DNA (Notarangelo2016Human). The RAG1 homeodomain (HD) specifically interacts with high-mobility group proteins HMG1 and HMG2. These interactions enhance the binding efficiency of the RAG1/2 complex to RSS, particularly the 12RSS and 23RSS, by stabilizing the RAG-RSS complex and increasing DNA-bending activity (Aidinis1999The).

RAG1 also contains a zinc-binding motif, C3HC4, and additional zinc finger sequences that facilitate homodimer formation, which is important for its function in recombination (Rodgers1996A). The interaction with HMG1 and HMG2 is facilitated by the RAG1 HD, which is necessary for the binding to these proteins, as demonstrated by experiments showing that truncated forms of RAG1 lacking the HD do not interact with HMG1 and HMG2 (Aidinis1999The). These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the RAG1/2 complex in the recombination process.
