# IDI2

## Overview
The IDI2 gene encodes the enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 2, which is a critical component of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme is classified as an isomerase and is involved in the conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), a pivotal reaction in the mevalonate pathway that leads to the synthesis of essential biomolecules such as cholesterol and steroid hormones (Clizbe2007IDI2). IDI2 is predominantly expressed in human skeletal muscle, suggesting a specialized role in muscle-specific metabolic processes, particularly in lipid metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis (Clizbe2007IDI2). The enzyme is localized in peroxisomes and requires manganese as a cofactor for its activity (Clizbe2007IDI2). Alterations in the IDI2 gene have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Lewy body diseases, indicating its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Kato2010Segmental; Nakamura2015Isopentenyl).

## Function
IDI2 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, specifically in the mevalonate pathway. It catalyzes the isomerization of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), a key step in the production of isoprenoids, which are essential for synthesizing cholesterol, steroid hormones, and other vital biomolecules (Clizbe2007IDI2).

IDI2 is expressed predominantly in human skeletal muscle, where it is believed to have a specialized function in isoprenoid metabolism. This tissue-specific expression suggests that IDI2 may play a significant role in muscle-specific metabolic processes, potentially influencing cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism (Clizbe2007IDI2).

The enzyme is localized to the peroxisomes within cells, facilitated by a peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1), and requires Mn2+ as a cofactor for optimal activity (Clizbe2007IDI2). IDI2's activity in the peroxisomes and its regulation, possibly involving PPARα, indicate its involvement in modulating cholesterol levels and other lipid-related processes in skeletal muscle (Clizbe2007IDI2).

## Clinical Significance
The IDI2 gene has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In the context of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS), a segmental copy-number gain in the IDI2 gene region on chromosome 10p15.3 has been identified. This genetic alteration was found in a significant proportion of SALS patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. The study indicated that 46 out of 83 SALS patients exhibited this copy-number gain, compared to 10 out of 99 controls, highlighting a strong association with SALS (Kato2010Segmental).

In Lewy body diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), IDI2 is involved in the formation of Lewy bodies, which are pathological structures associated with these conditions. IDI2 is found in the core of brainstem-type Lewy bodies and may contribute to the production of cholesterol metabolites that accelerate α-synuclein aggregation, a key process in Lewy body formation. This suggests that alterations in IDI2 expression or function could influence the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases (Nakamura2015Isopentenyl).
