# SNRPD1

## Overview
SNRPD1 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein D1 polypeptide, a critical component of the spliceosome complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. The protein plays a pivotal role in the removal of introns and the joining of exons to produce mature mRNA, a process essential for accurate gene expression and cellular function (Wang2022The). As a core component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), SNRPD1 interacts with various proteins and snRNAs to facilitate spliceosome assembly and function (Wang2022The). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and is implicated in several cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and differentiation (Wang2022The). Alterations in SNRPD1 expression have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG; Dai2023SNRPD1).

## Function
SNRPD1 is a core component of the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. This process involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA, which is crucial for proper gene expression and cellular function (Wang2022The). SNRPD1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly of the spliceosome and the regulation of mRNA maturation (Wang2022The). 

In healthy human cells, SNRPD1 is involved in several fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (Wang2022The). It plays a role in maintaining pluripotency by participating in the assembly of the pluripotency-specific spliceosome (Wang2022The). The gene's expression is regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-100, which can modulate its activity and influence cellular outcomes (Wang2022The).

SNRPD1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal homeostasis. Its activity in the nucleus and its role in RNA processing highlight its critical function in gene expression regulation and cellular health (Wang2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SNRPD1 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In breast cancer, SNRPD1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High SNRPD1 levels correlate with increased risk of metastasis and relapse, and its silencing can lead to resistance to doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug used in TNBC treatment (Dai2023SNRPD1). 

In HCC, SNRPD1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, and its high expression is linked to poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. SNRPD1 alterations, such as high mRNA expression, are associated with advanced tumor stages and poor clinical outcomes (Wang2022The). 

In LUAD, SNRPD1 overexpression is correlated with TP53 mutations and poor overall survival, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic factor. The gene's expression is linked to tumor grades and stages, indicating its potential as a biomarker for LUAD prognosis (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG). 

These findings highlight SNRPD1's potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in various cancers.

## Interactions
SNRPD1 is a component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with other proteins such as SmB, SmD2, and SmD3 to form the core snRNP complex. SNRPD1 also associates with U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs, facilitating spliceosome assembly and function. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SNRPD1 interacts with proteins like SNRPA, SNRPB, SNRPB2, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPG, POLR2H, and PRMT1, as confirmed by a high confidence score in the STRING database (Wang2022The). 

In breast cancer, SNRPD1 is co-expressed with PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed a physical interaction between SNRPD1 and PCNA in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting a role in cell cycle progression (Dai2021SNRPD1). 

In human pluripotent stem cells, SNRPD1 interacts with SNRPA1 and PNN, playing a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency-specific spliceosome assembly. It physically interacts with phosphorylated SF3b1 and CDC5L, a member of the PRPF19 complex involved in spliceosome activation (Kim2017The). These interactions highlight SNRPD1's involvement in various cellular processes through its participation in multiprotein complexes.
