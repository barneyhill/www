# JADE3

## Overview
JADE3 is a gene that encodes the protein jade family PHD finger 3, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its plant homeodomains (PHD), which are zinc finger domains that play a crucial role in recognizing histone modifications. Unlike its paralogues JADE1 and JADE2, JADE3 does not synergize with the histone acetyltransferase HBO1 to acetylate histone H4, indicating a unique function in histone modification processes (Foy2008Role). JADE3 is also recognized for its antiviral activity, particularly through the activation of the NF-kB pathway, which is essential for the immune response against viruses such as influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 (Munir2023Genomewide). The protein's involvement in various multiprotein complexes and its interactions with other proteins, such as the ciliary protein pVHL, further underscore its significance in cellular processes (Ebert2021JADE). Additionally, JADE3 has been implicated in cancer progression and may serve as a potential biomarker for sex-specific cancer prognosis (Hwang2024Sexspecific).

## Structure


## Function
JADE3 is a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, primarily through its interaction with the histone acetyltransferase HBO1 complex. Unlike its paralogues JADE1 and JADE2, JADE3 does not synergize with HBO1 to acetylate histone H4, indicating a distinct role in histone modification processes (Foy2008Role). JADE3 is identified as an antiviral activator of the NF-kB pathway, demonstrating significant antiviral activity against viruses such as influenza A virus, SARS-CoV-2, and murine norovirus. This activity is mediated through the activation of a TNF/NF-kB genetic program, leading to the upregulation of genes involved in inflammatory pathways (Munir2023Genomewide).

JADE3's antiviral function requires its plant homeodomains (PHD), which are zinc finger domains involved in recognizing histone modifications (Munir2023Genomewide). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it enhances NF-kB translocation and phosphorylation, boosting its transcriptional activity. This suggests that JADE3 plays a crucial role in the immune response and antiviral defense mechanisms, distinct from other members of the Jade family (Munir2023Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
JADE3, a member of the JADE family of proteins, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Alterations in JADE3 expression have been associated with cancer progression, particularly in colorectal cancer, where high JADE3 expression correlates with a shorter 5-year overall survival (Hwang2024Sexspecific). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), JADE3 exhibits sex-specific survival implications, being female-dependent in the TCGA-KIRC database and male-dependent in the RECA-EU and Korean-KIRC databases (Hwang2024Sexspecific). This suggests that JADE3 may serve as a potential biomarker for sex-specific cancer prognosis.

JADE3 is also involved in regulating proteasome abundance and activity. In JADE-deficient cell lines, increased proteasome activity and abundance have been observed, which could enhance sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. This may lead to increased proteotoxic stress and apoptotic cell death, potentially impacting renal diseases and cancer (Ebert2021JADE). The oncogenic properties of JADE3, particularly its induction by WNT/β-catenin signaling, further highlight its role in cancer, as seen in colon cancer (Ebert2021JADE). These findings underscore the clinical significance of JADE3 in cancer and renal disease contexts.

## Interactions
JADE3 is known to interact with several proteins and is involved in various multiprotein complexes. It physically associates with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) HBO1 complex, although it does not synergize with HBO1 to acetylate histone H4, unlike its homologs JADE1 and JADE1L (Foy2008Role). Despite this, JADE3 stabilizes HBO1, indicating a role in the complex's structural integrity (Foy2008Role).

JADE3 also interacts with the ciliary protein pVHL and the nephrocystin protein complex, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions suggest that JADE3, along with JADE1 and JADE2, may form homodimers or homomultimers and potentially hetero-multimeric complexes (Ebert2021JADE).

JADE3 is involved in the NF-kB signaling pathway, where it activates this pathway to exert antiviral effects against influenza A virus. This activation is crucial for its role in host-cellular defense mechanisms (Munir2023Genomewide). The protein's PHD zinc finger domains are essential for its antiviral activity, as their deletion abrogates this function (Munir2023Genomewide).
