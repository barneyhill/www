# VWA5A

## Overview
VWA5A is a gene that encodes the protein von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5A, which is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and migration. This protein is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular communication. Recent studies have identified VWA5A as a potential biomarker for breast cancer prognosis, particularly in hormone receptor-positive subtypes, where its expression is linked to favorable clinical outcomes (Koh2024Identification). The protein's involvement in inhibiting metastasis underscores its significance in cancer biology, although its precise mechanisms and interactions require further elucidation.

## Clinical Significance
VWA5A has been identified as a novel biomarker for inhibiting metastasis in breast cancer. Alterations in its expression levels are associated with various clinical outcomes. High expression of VWA5A is linked to favorable prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer, particularly in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtypes. However, this significance is not observed in HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroups (Koh2024Identification). 

In vitro studies have shown that knockdown of VWA5A in HR+ and TNBC cell lines leads to increased invasion and migration, suggesting a tumor suppressive role for VWA5A. Lower expression of VWA5A is associated with faster cell proliferation in luminal and TNBC cell lines, while higher expression correlates with faster proliferation in HER2 type (Koh2024Identification). 

The study also highlights that VWA5A expression decreases as breast cancer clinical features worsen, suggesting its potential use in initial screening to predict poor prognosis in breast cancer, regardless of subtype (Koh2024Identification). Despite these findings, the study notes limitations, such as the lack of significant survival association in certain subgroups, indicating the need for further research (Koh2024Identification).
