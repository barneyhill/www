# FMN1

## Overview
The FMN1 gene encodes the protein formin 1, which is a member of the formin family of proteins known for their role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Formin 1 is characterized by the presence of formin homology domains FH1 and FH2, which are essential for actin nucleation and elongation, facilitating the polymerization of actin filaments. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, membrane dynamics, and cytoskeletal organization, by contributing to the formation of cell protrusions and focal adhesions. Formin 1 is also implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating cell migration. The gene's expression and function are critical for normal limb development and have been associated with several developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; Dettenhofer2008Formin; Chesarone2009Unleashing).

## Structure
FMN1 (formin 1) is a protein involved in actin filament formation, characterized by the presence of the formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains. The FH2 domain is crucial for actin nucleation and elongation, functioning as a dimer to facilitate actin polymerization. It is approximately 400 amino acids long and includes several subdomains: the 'lasso', 'linker', 'knob', 'coiled coil', and 'post'. These subdomains form a structural 'hemidimer', with the FH2 domain dimerizing in a head-to-tail orientation, creating a 'doughnut' or torus form that accommodates actin molecules (Schönichen2010Fifteen; Higgs2005Phylogenetic).

FMN1 has multiple splice variants, including isoforms Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V, which are differentially expressed in mammalian tissues. Among these, Fmn1-IV is the most widely expressed variant and is involved in cell motility by contributing to cell protrusion and focal adhesion formation (Dettenhofer2008Formin). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Aspenström2010Forminbinding).

## Function
The FMN1 (formin 1) gene encodes a protein that is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a significant role in actin nucleation and elongation. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell locomotion, membrane ruffling, vesicle endocytosis, and stress fiber formation (Dettenhofer2008Formin). FMN1 is particularly important in cell motility, as it contributes to the protrusion of the cell's leading edge and the formation of focal adhesions, which are crucial for cell spreading and migration (Dettenhofer2008Formin).

In healthy human cells, FMN1 localizes within the cytoplasm and along microtubules, suggesting its involvement in the transport of factors necessary for focal adhesion formation (Dettenhofer2008Formin). It is also implicated in the regulation of actin and microtubule dynamics, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, movement, and division (Chesarone2009Unleashing). FMN1's activity is crucial for normal limb development and has been linked to various cellular functions, including the assembly of actin-rich adherens junctions and the stabilization of microtubules, aiding in cell migration (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; Chesarone2009Unleashing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FMN1 gene are associated with several developmental and neurological disorders. In humans, FMN1 mutations can lead to Cenani-Lenz syndrome, characterized by limb deformities such as oligosyndactyly and radioulnar synostosis. This condition is linked to disruptions in the GREM1 transcriptional global control region located within the FMN1 gene (Al‐Qattan2018Cenani–Lenz). In mice, deletion of Fmn1 results in similar limb deformities and renal defects, suggesting a conserved role across species (Al‐Qattan2018Cenani–Lenz).

FMN1 has also been implicated in mental disorders. Variants of FMN1 have been identified in families with high-risk autism spectrum disorder, early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. These conditions may be linked to FMN1's role in glutamatergic synaptic terminals (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

In the context of colorectal cancer, a genetic locus within the FMN1/GREM1 region interacts with body mass index to influence cancer risk. This interaction is particularly significant in individuals with certain genotypes, highlighting the gene's potential role in cancer development (Aglago2023A).

FMN1 is also involved in riboflavin metabolism, and its human ortholog, RFK, is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in FMN1 expression may affect neuroprotection by influencing oxidative stress and mitochondrial function (Chen2020FMN).
