# ARIH1

## Overview
The ARIH1 gene encodes the ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, a crucial enzyme in the ubiquitination pathway, which is responsible for tagging proteins for degradation and regulating various cellular processes. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the ARIH1 protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction by facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Tan2000Characterisation; Ardley2001Features). The protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with significant activity in subnuclear structures such as Cajal bodies and PML bodies (Elmehdawi2013Human). ARIH1 is involved in cellular proliferation and stress response, particularly in protecting cells from genotoxic stress through mechanisms independent of p53 and caspase-3 pathways (von2015The; Elmehdawi2013Human). Its interactions with various proteins, including hnRNP E1 and SQSTM1/p62, underscore its role in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and interferon signaling (Howley2022The; Wang2023ARIH1). Additionally, ARIH1 has clinical significance in cancer and vascular diseases, where its expression and mutations are linked to disease progression and therapeutic responses (Tan2018Ari1; Liu2023ARIH1).

## Function
The ARIH1 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical mechanism for protein degradation and regulation in cells. ARIH1 interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes such as UbcH7, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, marking them for proteasomal degradation (Ardley2001Features). This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating signal transduction pathways (Tan2000Characterisation).

In healthy human cells, ARIH1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with a notable presence in subnuclear bodies such as Cajal bodies and PML bodies (Elmehdawi2013Human). It plays a role in cellular proliferation, as knockdown of ARIH1 results in reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and altered cell cycle distribution, particularly an increase in the G2 phase (Elmehdawi2013Human). ARIH1 is also involved in protecting cells from genotoxic stress by initiating a 4EHP-mediated mRNA translation arrest, which helps maintain cell viability under DNA damage conditions (von2015The). This protective role is independent of p53 and caspase-3 pathways, highlighting its unique function in cellular stress responses (von2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARIH1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In cancer, ARIH1 plays a significant role in enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Overexpression of ARIH1 has been shown to increase the sensitivity of resistant tumors to PD-L1 blockade, suggesting its potential as a target for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes (Liu2023ARIH1). ARIH1 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers. Its upregulation is associated with increased cancer cell invasion and reduced survival rates in breast cancer patients (Howley2022The).

In vascular diseases, ARIH1 mutations are associated with aortic and cerebrovascular aneurysms. Specific variants, such as R171*, E15Q, and E44G, have been identified in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, suggesting a dominant disease phenotype linked to impaired mechanosensing in vascular smooth muscle cells (Tan2018Ari1). These mutations disrupt the nuclear envelope's structure, contributing to the development of these vascular conditions (Tan2018Ari1).

## Interactions
ARIH1, also known as ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with hnRNP E1, a protein involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for modulating hnRNP E1 levels and, consequently, EMT induction and cancer progression (Howley2022The).

ARIH1 also interacts with SQSTM1/p62, playing a role in regulating the expression of RIG-I, which is essential for interferon signaling activation. ARIH1 inhibits the degradation of RIG-I by affecting the function of SQSTM1/p62, thereby promoting interferon production (Wang2023ARIH1).

In the context of DNA damage response, ARIH1 interacts with 4EHP, a homologue of eIF4E, facilitating mRNA translation arrest. This interaction is crucial for cellular protection against genotoxic stress, as it leads to the suppression of protein synthesis and activation of stress response programs (von2015The).

ARIH1 also interacts with cGAS, mediating its mono-ISGylation and promoting oligomerization after HSV-1 infection. This interaction is specific to cGAS and is important for antiviral immunity (Xiong2022The).
