# ADGRG6

## Overview
ADGRG6, also known as GPR126, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G6, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a large extracellular region with multiple domains such as the Complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB) domain, and the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain. The protein plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including myelination in the peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular development, and skeletal formation. It interacts with extracellular matrix components like laminin-211 and collagen IV, facilitating signal transduction and mechanosensing. Mutations and altered expression of ADGRG6 are associated with several clinical conditions, including arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and cardiovascular defects (Folts2019Adhesion; Baxendale2021The; Dintzner2024The).

## Structure
The ADGRG6 protein, also known as GPR126, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) with a complex molecular structure. It features a large extracellular region (ECR) composed of several domains, including the Complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB) domain, Pentraxin (PTX), sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin (SEA), Hormone Receptor (HormR), and GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domains (Dintzner2024The; Mitgau2022The). The GAIN domain contains the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), which is crucial for receptor activation through autoproteolytic cleavage, resulting in an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) (Baxendale2021The; Mitgau2022The).

The CUB domain is particularly significant for maintaining a compact ECR conformation and regulating receptor signaling. It includes a conserved Ca2+ binding site, which is a putative ligand binding site (Dintzner2024The). Alternative splicing of ADGRG6 can lead to the deletion of the CUB domain, resulting in decreased signaling activity (Dintzner2024The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycosylation, contributing to its adhesive properties (Baxendale2021The). The structure of ADGRG6 is crucial for its function in various physiological processes, including myelination and mechanosensing (Mitgau2022The).

## Function
ADGRG6, also known as GPR126, is a crucial adhesion G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the peripheral nervous system by regulating myelination, the process of forming a myelin sheath around nerve fibers, which is essential for proper nerve signal transmission. This function is primarily mediated through its activity in Schwann cells, where it facilitates the transition from an immature to a mature state, promoting the ensheathment of peripheral axons (Folts2019Adhesion).

ADGRG6 is also involved in cardiovascular development, where its loss can lead to cardiac hypotrabeculation, affecting heart contraction and energy metabolism (Folts2019Adhesion). In skeletal development, ADGRG6 is expressed in chondrogenic lineages and is associated with conditions such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (Folts2019Adhesion; Baxendale2021The).

At the molecular level, ADGRG6 interacts with extracellular matrix components like laminin-211 and collagen IV, which are crucial for its function in mechanosensing and signal transduction. These interactions facilitate the generation of the second messenger cAMP, which is vital for the expression of myelinogenic transcriptional programs (Baxendale2021The; Musa2019Gpr126).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADGRG6 gene, also known as GPR126, are linked to several diseases and conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in ADGRG6 can cause a severe form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), which is perinatally lethal. These mutations impair the cleavage of the GAIN domain, crucial for the receptor's function, leading to myelination defects that may contribute to AMC (Folts2019Adhesion). Variants of ADGRG6 are also associated with adolescent-onset idiopathic scoliosis, likely due to its role in cartilage rather than peripheral nerves (Folts2019Adhesion; Karner2015Gpr126Adgrg6deletion).

In mice, deletion of Gpr126 in cartilage leads to conditions resembling idiopathic scoliosis and pectus excavatum, suggesting its role in spinal column development and chondrocyte survival (Karner2015Gpr126Adgrg6deletion). In humans, ADGRG6 variants are linked to lung function issues, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a specific missense mutation (S123G) is associated with adaptation to hypobaric hypoxia in Andean populations (Baxendale2021The). The gene is also implicated in cardiovascular development, with mutations leading to cardiac hypotrabeculation defects in mice (Baxendale2021The). Additionally, ADGRG6 is down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia and involved in periodontal ligament tissue homeostasis, with the R1057Q mutation being a candidate for severe periodontitis (Baxendale2021The).

## Interactions
The ADGRG6 protein, also known as GPR126, engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various biological processes. It interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, such as Collagen IV and Laminin-211. The binding of Collagen IV to ADGRG6 is facilitated through the CUB-PTX region of its extracellular domain, which leads to increased cAMP signaling levels (Dintzner2024The). Laminin-211, on the other hand, binds to the N-terminal fragment (NTF) of ADGRG6, playing a role in axonal sorting and Schwann cell function (Baxendale2021The).

The ADGRG6 protein also interacts with the Prion protein (PrP 23-50), which, like Collagen IV, can mediate cAMP accumulation. In contrast, Laminin-211 binding results in a decrease in cAMP accumulation, suggesting an inhibitory effect on basal signaling activity (Baxendale2021The). These interactions highlight the dual role of ADGRG6 in modulating signaling pathways through both activating and inhibitory mechanisms.

Mutations in the CUB domain of ADGRG6, such as C94Y and Y96A, can alter its interaction with other domains and affect receptor signaling activity. The C94Y mutation, for instance, results in a super active receptor, while Y96A decreases signaling (Dintzner2024The). These findings underscore the importance of the CUB domain in regulating ADGRG6's interactions and signaling functions.
