# PARP6

## Overview
PARP6 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 6, which is part of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. This protein is primarily involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a type of post-translational modification, and plays a significant role in neuronal development by promoting dendritic complexity in neurons (Huang2016PARP6). Structurally, PARP6 is characterized by a unique helical appendage to its ART domain and a putative C4-type zinc finger, which may be involved in protein interactions and regulatory functions (Suskiewicz2023Updated). Functionally, PARP6 is implicated in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity, regulating cell proliferation, and influencing cell signaling pathways, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development (VermehrenSchmaedick2021Characterization). Additionally, mutations in the PARP6 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Richard2022Beyond; VermehrenSchmaedick2021Characterization).

## Structure
PARP6 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family and exhibits a unique molecular structure. It contains a helical appendage (HE) to the ART domain, which is distinct from the HD found in other PARPs like PARP1. This HE does not obstruct the NAD+ binding site, suggesting a different regulatory or interaction function (Suskiewicz2023Updated). PARP6 lacks the C-terminal transmembrane helix found in PARP16 but has an extended N-terminal region with a putative C4-type zinc finger (ZnF) and a 'split' RWD domain. The C4-type ZnF is structurally distinct and is rigidly connected to the split RWD domain, indicating a potential functional relationship (Suskiewicz2023Updated).

The RWD domain in PARP6 is related to the ubiquitin-conjugating core domain of E2 enzymes, suggesting a possible link to ubiquitylation pathways (Suskiewicz2023Updated). The catalytic domain of PARP6 is involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification important for its function in promoting dendritic complexity in neurons (Huang2016PARP6). The presence of a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) near the catalytic domain, which may contain a zinc finger motif, is crucial for its activity (Huang2016PARP6).

## Function
PARP6 is a member of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family, specifically involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), a post-translational modification process. This enzyme is neuronally enriched and plays a critical role in dendrite morphogenesis, particularly in the developing nervous system. The catalytic activity of PARP6 is essential for its function, as it promotes dendritic complexity in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of PARP6 results in decreased dendritic complexity, branching, and length, highlighting its importance in dendritic growth and maintenance (Huang2016PARP6).

PARP6 is also involved in regulating multi-polar spindle (MPS) formation and centrosome homeostasis. Inhibition of PARP6 induces MPS formation and centrosome defects, suggesting a unique role in these processes compared to other PARPs. It acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation, leading to the accumulation of cells in the S-phase, likely due to its involvement in MPS induction and centrosome homeostasis (Richard2022Beyond).

In addition to its role in neuronal development, PARP6 is implicated in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and influencing cell signaling pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development (VermehrenSchmaedick2021Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PARP6 gene have been linked to significant neurodevelopmental disorders. Six patients with developmental delays and neurological issues were identified with mutations in this gene. Four of these patients had de novo mutations, while two siblings had congenital mutations with healthy parents as heterozygous carriers. Mutations in the catalytic domain of the PARP6 protein were associated with more severe symptoms, including global developmental delays, epilepsy, and learning disabilities. Specifically, the C563R mutation resulted in complete inactivity of auto-MARylation and significantly decreased dendritic complexity in neurons, highlighting its severe impact on neurodevelopment (VermehrenSchmaedick2021Characterization).

In cancer, PARP6 expression levels and interactions have been implicated in tumorigenesis. In colorectal cancer, PARP6 expression is lower, potentially due to hypermethylation of its promoter region, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Conversely, in gastric cancer, PARP6 positively regulates Survivin, correlating with increased carcinogenic properties. These roles appear to be tissue-specific, indicating that PARP6 may have dual functions in cancer progression. A PARP6 inhibitor, AZ0108, has shown potential in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells, suggesting that targeting PARP6 could be a viable cancer therapy strategy (Richard2022Beyond).

## Interactions
PARP6 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in regulating dendritic complexity in neurons. Using BioID proximity labeling, researchers identified the PARP6 interactome in neurons, revealing interactions with microtubule-associated proteins such as microtubule-associated proteins 2, 1B, protein tau, and RP/EB family member 2. These proteins are essential for regulating the microtubule cytoskeleton, suggesting that PARP6 may influence neuronal microtubule dynamics (VermehrenSchmaedick2021Characterization).

PARP6 also contains a helical appendage (HE) to the ART domain, which does not block the NAD+ binding site, indicating a potential regulatory or interaction function. The presence of a putative C4-type zinc finger (ZnF) and a 'split' RWD domain in its structure suggests possible links to ubiquitylation or SUMOylation pathways, although these interactions require further validation (Suskiewicz2023Updated).

Despite attempts to engage PARP6 using the photoaffinity-based probe PARPYnD, it was found that the NAD+ binding site of endogenous PARP6 might be inaccessible due to posttranslational modifications or complex formation with other biomolecules, indicating complex regulatory interactions that are not yet fully understood (Howard2020StructureGuided).
