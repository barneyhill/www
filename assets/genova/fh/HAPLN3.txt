# HAPLN3

## Overview
HAPLN3 is a gene that encodes the protein hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3, which is a member of the link protein family. This protein plays a critical role in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), thereby maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and facilitating cell signaling (Spicer2003A; Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3). The protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and two proteoglycan tandem repeats (PTRs), which are essential for its binding functions (Spicer2003A). HAPLN3 is predominantly active in the extracellular space, particularly in smooth muscle tissues, and is involved in processes such as cell proliferation and migration (Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3). The gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Armes2017Application; Sun2023The).

## Structure
HAPLN3, also known as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3, is a member of the link protein family involved in stabilizing the extracellular matrix by binding hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). The primary structure of HAPLN3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with a predicted molecular mass ranging from 38 to 43 kDa (Spicer2003A). The protein structure is characterized by an N-terminal signal sequence, an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and two consecutive link modules or proteoglycan tandem repeats (PTRs), which are crucial for its function in binding to HA and CSPGs (Spicer2003A).

The secondary structure of HAPLN3 includes two α-helices and two antiparallel β-sheets arranged around a hydrophobic core, similar to the C-type lectin domain (Spicer2003A). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, forming a globular structure that resembles the G1 regions of lecticans (Zimmermann2008Extracellular). HAPLN3 does not contain any consensus N-glycosylation sites, unlike some other members of the HAPLN family (Spicer2003A). There is no information available on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of HAPLN3.

## Function
HAPLN3, or hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3, is involved in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and facilitating cell signaling. In healthy human cells, HAPLN3 is predominantly active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to the formation and stabilization of the pericellular matrix, particularly in smooth muscle tissues of the vascular wall and gastrointestinal tract (Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3).

HAPLN3 co-localizes with versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, around smooth muscle cells, suggesting its involvement in the formation of the versican-hyaluronan matrix. This matrix is essential for the pericellular environment of vascular smooth muscle cells, playing a significant role in processes such as cell proliferation and migration (Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3). The protein is up-regulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in arterial smooth muscle cells, indicating its role in the expansion of the extracellular matrix necessary for tissue remodeling (Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3). Understanding the function of HAPLN3 in these processes is important for insights into its role in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular communication.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HAPLN3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of early infant deaths, a de novo missense variant in HAPLN3 was identified in a case exhibiting phenotypes consistent with limb-body wall complex and pentalogy of Cantrell. This variant was absent from population databases and altered a highly conserved amino acid, suggesting a potential role in abnormal angiogenesis pathways that could lead to vascular disruption early in gestation (Armes2017Application).

In cancer research, HAPLN3 has been associated with several types of cancer. It is identified as a low-risk differential gene in skin cutaneous melanoma, with higher expression levels linked to better prognosis in early-stage patients (Sun2023The). In prostate cancer, HAPLN3 is part of a three-gene DNA methylation biomarker that accurately classifies early-stage prostate cancer, indicating its potential as a diagnostic tool (Patel2019A). Additionally, HAPLN3 is overexpressed in breast cancer and suggested as a biomarker for its treatment (ÖZCAN2019Statistical). These findings highlight the gene's significance in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
HAPLN3, also known as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3, is involved in stabilizing the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronan and proteoglycans. The protein co-localizes with versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, in vascular smooth muscle cells and the digestive tract, suggesting a role in forming the versican-hyaluronan matrix. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of arterial smooth muscle cells, where HAPLN3 is up-regulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3).

In the context of cardiogenesis, the Xenopus ortholog of HAPLN3, known as XHAPLN3, interacts with proteoglycans of the aggrecan family through its immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and binds to hyaluronan via its proteoglycan tandem-repeat (PTR) domains. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the hyaluronan matrix around the heart anlage, indicating a role in heart development (Ito2008XHAPLN3).

While specific interactions of the human HAPLN3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix through interactions with hyaluronan and proteoglycans is well-supported by studies on its orthologs and related proteins (Ito2008XHAPLN3; Ogawa2004Lp3Hapln3).
