# FAM167A

## Overview
FAM167A is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 167 member A. While the precise biological function of the FAM167A protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in several critical cellular processes, particularly within the immune system. The gene is part of the FAM167A-BLK locus, which has been associated with various autoimmune diseases, suggesting a potential role in immune regulation (Chen2015Single; Sun2013Association). The FAM167A protein is involved in key signaling pathways, including the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, which influences both cancer progression and drug resistance, as well as autoimmune disease susceptibility (Yang2022FAM167A; Luo2022Exosomal). Its interactions with other proteins, such as desmoglein-1 and α1-integrin, further underscore its significance in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis (Yang2022FAM167A; Luo2022Exosomal).

## Function
The FAM167A gene, also known as C8orf13, encodes a protein whose specific function in healthy human cells remains unclear. However, it is part of the FAM167A-BLK locus, which has been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, suggesting a role in immune system regulation (Chen2015Single; Sun2013Association). The BLK gene, associated with FAM167A, encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the src family, primarily expressed in B cells. This kinase is involved in B-cell receptor signaling and B-cell development, processes crucial for the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions like primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) (Chen2015Single; Sun2013Association).

The FAM167A-BLK gene region has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, indicating potential shared genetic determinants among these conditions (Sun2013Association). While the specific molecular activities of the FAM167A protein are not detailed, its involvement in immune-related pathways suggests it may influence cell communication and response mechanisms, potentially impacting organismal outcomes related to immune function (Chen2015Single). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of FAM167A in cellular and molecular processes.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM167A gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in activating the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), FAM167A contributes to BCR-ABL-independent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. This resistance is mediated through the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, which is crucial for the survival of TKI-resistant CML cells. Neutralizing FAM167A in these cells reduces their viability and increases apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome TKI resistance (Yang2022FAM167A).

FAM167A is also associated with autoimmune diseases. It is located near the BLK gene, and polymorphisms in the FAM167A-BLK locus have been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). In SLE, haplotype-specific chromatin interactions at this locus affect gene expression, potentially influencing disease risk (Ribeiro2022909; Saint2022Haplotypespecific). In pSS, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FAM167A-BLK region have shown significant associations, suggesting a role in disease susceptibility (Sun2013Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FAM167A in both cancer and autoimmune disorders.

## Interactions
FAM167A is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It has been identified as a key molecule in inducing BCR-ABL-independent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by activating the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. FAM167A interacts with the cell adhesion protein desmoglein-1 (DSG1), which is crucial for its role in this pathway. This interaction prevents the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), allowing NIK to accumulate and activate the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, contributing to TKI resistance in CML cells (Yang2022FAM167A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FAM167A is part of the FAM167A-α1-integrin-NF-κB signaling axis, which is activated by exosomal miR-29a-3p. This interaction promotes cancer cell migration and invasion, highlighting FAM167A's role in cancer metastasis. The study suggests that miR-29a-3p targets FAM167A, affecting the expression of α1-integrin and activating the NF-κB pathway, which increases inflammatory cytokine levels and promotes metastasis (Luo2022Exosomal). These interactions underscore FAM167A's involvement in critical signaling pathways that influence cancer progression and drug resistance.
