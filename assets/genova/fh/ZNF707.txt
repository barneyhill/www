# ZNF707

## Overview
ZNF707 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 707, which is categorized as a transcription factor due to its involvement in DNA binding and regulation of gene expression. This protein is part of a larger protein cluster known as MMTAG2, which is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, protein localization, and signaling pathways such as the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and apoptosis. ZNF707's role as a transcription factor suggests its importance in modulating gene expression in response to cellular signals, and it has been associated with cancer-related pathways, particularly in ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma, where its expression is notably elevated (Khowal2021Molecular; Kim2020Identification).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF707 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions, primarily through its role as a transcription factor. It is part of a protein cluster known as MMTAG2, which includes proteins such as CRACR2B, GLI4, KIAA1875, and LRRC14. This cluster is involved in several molecular functions, including DNA binding, transcription factor activity, and sequence-specific DNA binding. The cluster also plays roles in cellular protein localization, regulation of store-operated calcium entry, the c-myc-dependent pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and apoptosis, indicating ZNF707's involvement in complex cellular processes and potential roles in cancer (Khowal2021Molecular).

In the context of cancer, ZNF707 has been identified as a cis-eQTL for the SNP rs4873815, with allele-specific transcription regulation observed. The T allele of this SNP is associated with higher transcriptional activity of ZNF707, particularly in ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (Ov-CCA), where its expression is significantly higher compared to normal ovarian tissues and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Kim2020Identification). However, specific protein interactions involving ZNF707 are not detailed in the available studies, focusing more on its expression levels and potential regulatory roles.
