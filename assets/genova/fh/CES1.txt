# CES1

## Overview
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is a gene that encodes the CES1 protein, a member of the serine hydrolase superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds. The CES1 protein is predominantly expressed in the liver and is integral to drug metabolism and detoxification processes, influencing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various therapeutic agents (Di2019The; Wang2019Functional). Structurally, CES1 is characterized by an α/β-hydrolase fold and a catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and glutamate, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Hosokawa2008Structure; Wang2018Human). The enzyme's broad substrate specificity allows it to metabolize both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds, contributing to lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis (Wang2018Human; Ross2007Human). CES1's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in the metabolism of several clinically important drugs and its potential impact on cancer progression, particularly in colorectal carcinoma (Zhu2012Carboxylesterase; Capece2021Enhanced).

## Structure
The human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) protein is characterized by a three-dimensional α/β-hydrolase fold, a common structural feature among lipases. This structure includes a central catalytic domain surrounded by α-β and regulatory domains (Hosokawa2008Structure; Wang2018Human). The catalytic triad of CES1 consists of serine, histidine, and a carboxylic acid, located at the bottom of a 25 Å deep active site cleft (Satoh2010Carboxylesterases:; Hosokawa2008Structure). The active site is composed of a large flexible pocket and a small rigid pocket, providing an ideal hydrophobic environment for the hydrolysis of various hydrophobic substrates (Hosokawa2008Structure; Imai2006Human).

CES1 is a glycoprotein with a glycosylation site at Asn79, which is modified by a carbohydrate chain that stabilizes the CES1A1 trimer (Hosokawa2008Structure; Imai2006Human). The protein can exist as a monomer, trimer, or hexamer, with substrate-dependent equilibrium of homooligomer formation (Wang2018Human). CES1 also features a side door secondary pore that allows small molecules to enter and exit the active site (Hosokawa2008Structure; Imai2006Human). The presence of a hydrophobic residue at position 425 is crucial for efficient hydrolysis of hydrophobic substrates (Satoh2010Carboxylesterases:).

## Function
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds. It is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. CES1 is located on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the hydrolysis of a wide range of substrates, including carboxylic acid esters, thioesters, amides, and carbamates (Di2019The; Wang2019Functional).

CES1 is a member of the serine hydrolase superfamily and features a catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and glutamate, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Di2019The; Wang2018Human). This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds, contributing to lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols, which are important for cholesterol homeostasis and lipid mobilization (Wang2018Human; Ross2007Human).

CES1 also participates in the bioactivation of prodrugs and the bioinactivation of soft drugs, influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Di2019The). Its activity is crucial for the metabolism of various clinically important drugs, including anticoagulants, antivirals, and chemotherapeutics (Di2019The). The enzyme's broad substrate specificity and significant role in drug metabolism highlight its importance in maintaining normal physiological processes and its potential impact on therapeutic outcomes (Wang2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CES1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in drug metabolism and cancer progression. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), CES1 is implicated in promoting aggressive cancer behavior, especially in the CMS4 and CMS2 subtypes. Elevated CES1 expression is associated with worse clinical outcomes, particularly in overweight or obese patients, as it enhances cancer cell survival under metabolic stress by increasing free fatty acid availability and preventing cytotoxicity from reactive oxygen species (Capece2021Enhanced). 

In the context of drug metabolism, CES1 is crucial for the hydrolysis of various medications, including clopidogrel and methylphenidate. Genetic variants such as G143E and D260fs can impair CES1 function, leading to altered drug metabolism and therapeutic outcomes. For instance, the G143E variant results in elevated blood concentrations of methylphenidate, necessitating dose adjustments (Zhu2012Carboxylesterase; Wang2015CES1). Additionally, CES1 variants can affect the activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, potentially leading to therapeutic failure in treating hypertension and related conditions (Wang2015CES1). These genetic variations underscore the importance of CES1 in precision pharmacotherapy and its potential impact on treatment efficacy and safety.

## Interactions
CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its function and localization. Within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), CES1 interacts with the retention protein receptor through its C-terminal HXEL sequence, which facilitates its retention within cells (Di2019The). CES1 also forms a complex with β-glucuronidase, an enzyme involved in the removal of glucuronic acid moieties, which helps retain CES1 in the ER (Di2019The; Wang2018Human). 

In addition to its role in the ER, CES1 is involved in protein trafficking, where it binds to C-reactive protein (CRP) and retains it before release into the plasma (Wang2018Human). This interaction involves a specific region of the CES1 amino acid sequence. Although CES1's interactions with nucleic acids are not extensively documented, its involvement in multiprotein complexes suggests a broader role in cellular processes.

CES1's interactions are not limited to the ER. In the context of liver cancer, CES1's glycosylation status, particularly at the N79 residue, affects its interactions and antiproliferative activity, influencing the expression of proteins involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Na2020Potential).
