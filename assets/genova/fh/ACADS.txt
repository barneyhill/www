# ACADS

## Overview
The ACADS gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, short chain, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the initial step in the breakdown of short-chain fatty acids, converting them into acetyl-CoA, a key molecule in energy production (Yang2021Histone). As a mitochondrial enzyme, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism and is involved in maintaining the balance of acyl-CoA intermediates, which are essential for histone modifications and the regulation of gene expression (Yang2021Histone). The activity of ACADS is influenced by dietary factors and stress, highlighting its role in metabolic adaptation and energy homeostasis (Yang2021Histone). Mutations in the ACADS gene can lead to short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD), a metabolic disorder with a range of clinical manifestations (Nochi2017Short‐chain).

## Function
The ACADS gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, short chain, which plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the initial step in the breakdown of short-chain fatty acids, converting them into acetyl-CoA, a key molecule in energy production (Yang2021Histone). The activity of ACADS influences the accumulation of butyryl-CoA, which affects histone butyrylation, a modification that can impact gene expression (Yang2021Histone). 

In healthy human cells, ACADS is involved in maintaining the balance of acyl-CoA intermediates, which are essential for histone modifications and the regulation of gene expression (Yang2021Histone). The enzyme is localized in both mitochondria and nuclei, indicating its role in cellular energy metabolism and potential involvement in nuclear processes (Yang2021Histone). 

ACADS activity is modulated by dietary fat and stress, with increased expression observed in response to a high-fat diet, which enhances the breakdown of butyryl-CoA and reduces histone H3K9 butyrylation levels (Yang2021Histone). This regulation suggests that ACADS is integral to metabolic adaptation and energy homeostasis in response to dietary and environmental changes (Yang2021Histone).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACADS gene are associated with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD), a metabolic disorder characterized by a range of clinical symptoms. These symptoms can include developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and myopathy, although many individuals identified through newborn screening remain asymptomatic (Lin2020Newborn; Nochi2017Short‐chain). The disorder is linked to various missense mutations in the ACADS gene, which often lead to protein misfolding and cellular toxicity (Pedersen2008The).

Common mutations such as c.511C > T (p.Arg171Trp) and c.625G > A (p.Gly209Ser) are frequently observed in SCADD patients and can result in significant processing defects in mitochondrial assays (Pedersen2008The). The presence of these mutations is associated with elevated levels of biochemical markers like ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and butyrylcarnitine (C4-C), which are used in the diagnosis of SCADD (van2006Clinical; Gallant2012Biochemical).

The clinical presentation of SCADD is heterogeneous, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms such as epilepsy and behavioral disturbances, while others remain asymptomatic (van2006Clinical; Nochi2017Short‐chain). The condition may also involve chronic oxidative stress and energy deficiency, contributing to cellular toxicity and neuromuscular pathology (Pedersen2008The; Nochi2017Short‐chain).

## Interactions
The ACADS gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain, which is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. ACADS interacts with several proteins and transcription factors within a functional gene network. It is directly associated with the genes HADHA, HADHB, ECHS1, and ACAT1, all of which play roles in lipid metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation (Chen2015Reveal). These interactions were validated using the HumanNet functional gene network and are supported by co-expression and co-localization data from curated databases like KEGG and Reactome (Chen2015Reveal).

ACADS also shows protein-protein interactions with transcription regulatory factors such as E2F3 and IRF7. These interactions were identified using the Cognoscente database and further analyzed with the IntAct database, which provides evidence of potential involvement of ACADS and IRF7 in liver disease (Chen2015Reveal). The STRING database, a resource for exploring protein-protein interaction networks, also supports the functional associations of ACADS with other proteins, although specific interactions are not detailed in the context provided (Kerrien2011The; Szklarczyk2010The).
