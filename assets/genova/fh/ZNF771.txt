# ZNF771

## Overview
ZNF771 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 771, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 771 is involved in various cellular functions, including gene expression regulation and alternative splicing, which are critical for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis. The gene's involvement in alternative splicing and its expression patterns have been linked to several cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy (Sun2023Systematic; Zhu2020Wholeexome). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which ZNF771 influences cancer progression and its potential therapeutic applications.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF771 has been implicated in various cancers through alterations in its expression and chromosomal amplifications. In colorectal cancer (COAD), alternative splicing (AS) events involving ZNF771 have been identified, with specific AS events showing significant differential expression between cancerous and normal tissues. These events are associated with overall survival, suggesting a potential role in cancer prognosis (Sun2023Systematic). 

In gastric cancer, the ZNF771 gene is part of the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, which is frequently amplified. This amplification is observed in 13.2% of gastric cancer patients and is linked to shorter overall survival. The amplification of this region, including ZNF771, may indicate disruptions in the TP53 signaling pathway, contributing to the disease's progression (Zhu2020Wholeexome).

In glioma, ZNF771 is part of the splicing signatures used to classify glioma subtypes, which have varying clinical outcomes. Although the specific role of ZNF771 in glioma is not detailed, its involvement in alternative splicing events suggests it may influence glioma prognosis (Li2019Classification). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ZNF771 in cancer, warranting further investigation into its role as a prognostic biomarker.
