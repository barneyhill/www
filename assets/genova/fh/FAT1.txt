# FAT1

## Overview
FAT1 is a gene that encodes the FAT atypical cadherin 1 protein, a large transmembrane protein belonging to the cadherin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its extensive extracellular region, which includes 34 cadherin repeats, a laminin G domain, and five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat domains, facilitating its role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling (Lahrouchi2019Homozygous; Gee2016FAT1). The FAT1 protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and polarity, and is involved in key signaling pathways such as the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways (Gee2016FAT1; Peng2021Role). It interacts with several proteins, including Ena/VASP and β-catenin, influencing actin polymerization and cell migration, and plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial junctional integrity and regulating cell proliferation (KATOH2012Function; Peng2021Role). The FAT1 gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, being associated with various diseases, including cancer and congenital disorders (Chen2022The; Peng2021Role).

## Structure
The FAT1 protein is a large transmembrane protein encoded by the FAT1 gene, which is part of the cadherin superfamily. It consists of 34 cadherin repeats, a laminin G domain, and five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat domains in its extracellular region (Lahrouchi2019Homozygous; Gee2016FAT1). The protein also includes a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain containing a PTB-like motif with a PDZ-binding motif (-HTEV) (Gee2016FAT1).

FAT1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage by Furin, resulting in a heterodimer composed of a larger extracellular subunit and a smaller subunit containing transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (KATOH2012Function). This cleavage is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, such as the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways (Gee2016FAT1; Peng2021Role).

The FAT1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and polarity. It interacts with several proteins, such as Ena/VASP, β-catenin, and Scribble, influencing actin polymerization and cell migration (KATOH2012Function; Peng2021Role). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its role in maintaining epithelial junctional integrity and regulating cell proliferation (Lahrouchi2019Homozygous; Peng2021Role).

## Function
FAT1 (FAT atypical cadherin 1) is a crucial protein in healthy human cells, primarily involved in regulating cell adhesion, migration, and polarity. It is a large transmembrane protein with an extracellular region containing cadherin repeats, which facilitate cell-cell adhesion, essential for maintaining tissue integrity (Peng2021Role). FAT1 interacts with proteins such as Ena/VASP, promoting actin polymerization and cell migration, and Scribble, which inhibits YAP1 signaling to suppress cell proliferation (KATOH2012Function). This interaction is vital for processes like morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis (Peng2021Role).

FAT1 also plays a role in several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo pathways. It binds to β-catenin, preventing its nuclear translocation and thus regulating gene expression involved in cell proliferation (Chen2022The; Peng2021Role). In the Hippo pathway, FAT1 helps inactivate YAP, a transcriptional coactivator, thereby controlling cell growth and preventing excessive proliferation (Peng2021Role).

In terms of cellular localization, FAT1 is found at lamellipodial edges or cell-cell boundaries, contributing to normal cell adhesion and migration (Miyazaki2011Human). Its expression is crucial in tissues like the brain and kidneys, where it supports neurogenesis and maintains kidney filtration structures (Peng2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FAT1 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. Homozygous frameshift mutations in FAT1 can lead to 4q-syndrome, which is characterized by facial deformities, cutaneous syndactyly, ocular abnormalities, and potentially nephropathy. These mutations disrupt epithelial cell adhesion and fusion, resulting in neural tube closure defects and kidney diseases such as hormone-resistant nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis (Peng2021Role). FAT1 mutations are also associated with glomerulotubular nephropathy, a kidney condition marked by steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, tubular ectasia, and hematuria. This condition is linked to impaired cell migration and adhesion due to disrupted RHO-like small GTPase signaling, particularly involving RAC1 and CDC42 (Gee2016FAT1).

In cancer, FAT1 can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context. It is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting tumor progression, while in other cancers like breast and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, FAT1 loss is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies (Chen2022The; Peng2021Role). FAT1 is also linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, where its downregulation affects muscle morphology (Peng2021Role).

## Interactions
FAT1 (FAT atypical cadherin 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration, adhesion, and signaling. FAT1 interacts with SoHo-family proteins, specifically CAP/ponsin (Sorbs1) and ArgBP2 (Sorbs2), through its PXXP motif and the SH3 domains of these proteins. This interaction is crucial for recruiting these proteins to sites of FAT1 expression, impacting cell-contact organization and migration dynamics (Braun2016Interaction).

FAT1 also interacts with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, including MST1, SAV1, NF2, AMOT, and PATJ, forming a multimeric complex that influences cell proliferation and migration. However, it does not interact with YAP1 and TAOK-1, and has only a weak interaction with TAZ (Martin2018Assembly).

In vascular smooth muscle cells, FAT1 interacts with Atrophin proteins, which are transcriptional corepressors, and Ena/VASP proteins, which are involved in actin polymerization. These interactions are significant for regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (RiascosBernal2023The).

FAT1 also binds to β-catenin, preventing its nuclear translocation and thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling, which is important for controlling cell proliferation and migration (Peng2021Role).
