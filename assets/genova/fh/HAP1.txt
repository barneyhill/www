# HAP1

## Overview
HAP1, or huntingtin-associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic protein primarily expressed in neurons. The protein, also referred to as HAP1, is characterized by its role as a scaffold protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the transport of vesicles along microtubules. It interacts with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynactin, facilitating both anterograde and retrograde transport within neuronal cells (Chen2023Huntingtinassociated; McGuire2006Interaction). HAP1 is crucial for the stabilization and recycling of membrane receptors, influencing processes like neurogenesis and receptor sorting (Rong2006Regulation; Xiang2013Huntingtinassociated). The protein's interactions with huntingtin and other proteins are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease, where it plays a role in modulating the effects of mutant huntingtin (Liu2020Loss; Li1998Interaction). Additionally, HAP1 has been implicated in metabolic and oncological conditions, highlighting its diverse functional significance in cellular physiology (Wu2024Research).

## Structure
Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a cytosolic protein primarily expressed in neurons. It lacks conserved transmembrane domains and nuclear localization signals, indicating its cytoplasmic localization (Chen2023Huntingtinassociated). HAP1 contains coiled-coil domains in its middle region, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as huntingtin (HTT) and kinesin light chain 2 (KLC2) (Wu2009Huntingtin; Chen2023Huntingtinassociated). 

HAP1 exists in two isoforms in rats, HAP1-A and HAP1-B, which differ in their C-terminal sequences. HAP1-A has a unique sequence of 21 amino acids, while HAP1-B has a different sequence of 51 amino acids (Wu2009Huntingtin). In humans, HAP1 is detected as a single major form similar to rat HAP1-A (Wu2009Huntingtin). 

The protein is involved in intracellular trafficking, forming complexes with motor proteins like dynactin and kinesin, which are crucial for retrograde and anterograde transport along microtubules (Chen2023Huntingtinassociated; Wu2009Huntingtin). HAP1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its interactions with other proteins (Chen2023Huntingtinassociated).

## Function
Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a cytosolic protein that plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking within neurons. It interacts with microtubule-dependent transport proteins such as kinesin light chain and dynactin p150Glued, facilitating both anterograde and retrograde transport along axons (Chen2023Huntingtinassociated; McGuire2006Interaction). HAP1 acts as a scaffold protein, mediating interactions between vesicles and motor proteins, which is crucial for the transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and GABA A receptor-containing vesicles (Wu2024Research; McGuire2006Interaction).

HAP1 is involved in the stabilization and recycling of membrane receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and GABA A receptor, by preventing their degradation in lysosomes (Rong2006Regulation; Chen2023Huntingtinassociated). It also plays a role in maintaining the levels of the tropomyosin-related kinase A receptor (TrkA), which is important for neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival (Rong2006Regulation).

HAP1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in microtubules and membranous organelles, and is essential for maintaining normal cellular processes, including vesicular transport and endocytotic trafficking of membrane receptors (Chen2023Huntingtinassociated; Wu2024Research). Its function is critical for neuronal health and development, influencing processes like neurogenesis and receptor sorting (Xiang2013Huntingtinassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in intracellular transport and interaction with various proteins. In Huntington's disease (HD), HAP1 binds more tightly to mutant huntingtin (mHtt) than to normal huntingtin, disrupting transport processes and contributing to neurodegeneration. The loss of HAP1 in HD models leads to selective neuronal loss in the striatum, exacerbated by the presence of mHtt. HAP1's interaction with Rhes, a GTPase enriched in the striatum, is crucial; when HAP1 is deficient, Rhes binds more to mHtt, increasing its sumoylation and toxicity (Liu2020Loss).

In diabetes, HAP1 is involved in insulin vesicle transport and secretion. Its knockdown in pancreatic β-cells results in impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin release, potentially contributing to diabetes development. HAP1's interaction with myosin Va and its role in GLUT4 translocation are critical for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Wu2024Research).

HAP1 is also linked to cancer, where its expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Overexpression of HAP1 in cancer cell lines inhibits tumor growth and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a tumor suppressor and diagnostic biomarker (Wu2024Research).

## Interactions
Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is known for its interactions with several proteins, playing a significant role in intracellular transport and cellular processes. HAP1 interacts with huntingtin, the protein associated with Huntington's disease, particularly when the polyglutamine repeat in huntingtin is expanded. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a protein complex that includes dynactin p150 Glued (P150), suggesting a role in dynein-dynactin-associated intracellular transport (Li1998Interaction).

HAP1 also binds to kinesin light chain (KLC), a component of the kinesin motor complex responsible for anterograde transport along microtubules. This interaction is significant for vesicle transport in neurons and axons (Wu2009Huntingtin; McGuire2006Interaction). HAP1's interaction with KLC is mediated by its C-terminal region, and it has been shown to preferentially bind to kinesin light chain-2 (KLC-2) (McGuire2006Interaction).

In addition to these interactions, HAP1 associates with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), forming cytoplasmic structures known as STLBs. This interaction does not depend on the polyglutamine length of TBP, suggesting a protective role against polyQ-mediated cytotoxicity (Prigge2007HAP1). HAP1 also interacts with proteins involved in endocytic trafficking, such as hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), influencing the trafficking of membrane receptors (Rong2007Regulation).
