# FRMD4A

## Overview
FRMD4A is a gene that encodes the protein FERM domain containing 4A, which is a member of the FERM superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as structure, transport, and signaling, with a significant role in regulating cell polarity. It functions as a scaffolding protein, particularly influencing neuronal development by interacting with ARF6, a small GTPase. This interaction is crucial for maintaining neuronal polarity, affecting dendritic branching and neurite outgrowth, and is implicated in intellectual development (Fine2014A; Pan2021Case). FRMD4A is also associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as it interacts with pathways involving amyloid-beta and tau proteins (Martiskainen2015Transcriptomics). Additionally, mutations in FRMD4A have been linked to various neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Fine2014A; Pan2021Case).

## Structure


## Function
The FRMD4A gene encodes a protein that is a member of the FERM superfamily, which is involved in cell structure, transport, and signaling. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating cell polarity by activating ARF6, a small GTPase that mediates interactions between Par3 and the ARF6 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This interaction is essential for maintaining cell polarity, particularly in neurons, where it influences dendritic branching and neurite outgrowth (Fine2014A). 

FRMD4A is active in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane, where it influences cellular communication and structural integrity. It acts as a scaffolding protein, crucial for the regulation of cell polarity in neurons, and is implicated in human intellectual development (Pan2021Case). The protein's role in cell polarity suggests its involvement in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neurons, which is vital for normal brain development and function (Pan2021Case).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, FRMD4A is linked to amyloid-beta and tau pathways, which are central to the disease's pathogenesis. It interacts with ARF6, influencing amyloid precursor protein processing and tau phosphorylation (Martiskainen2015Transcriptomics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FRMD4A gene have been linked to several neurological and developmental disorders. In a consanguineous Bedouin Israeli family, a homozygous frameshift mutation in FRMD4A was associated with a novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by congenital microcephaly, unique facial dysmorphisms, and brain abnormalities such as agenesis of the corpus callosum and hypoplasia of the vermis and cerebellum (Fine2014A). In a Chinese family, compound heterozygous mutations in FRMD4A were identified in a child with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, and corpus callosum anomaly, highlighting the gene's role in intellectual development (Pan2021Case).

FRMD4A is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that decreased expression of FRMD4A is associated with increased amyloid-beta production and altered tau phosphorylation, both of which are central to AD pathogenesis (Martiskainen2015Transcriptomics). Additionally, FRMD4A has been identified as a candidate gene in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 6 (ARVC6), although no pathogenic mutations were found in the coding regions (Matolweni2006Arrhythmogenic). The gene's potential role in Wilms tumor etiology has also been suggested, with predicted loss-of-function variants found in affected individuals (Stoltze2023Germline).
