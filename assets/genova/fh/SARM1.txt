# SARM1

## Overview
SARM1 (sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of axonal degeneration, a critical process in neuronal maintenance and response to injury. The SARM1 protein is categorized as a TIR adaptor protein, characterized by its distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal ARM domain, two SAM domains, and a C-terminal TIR domain. These domains facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions, oligomerization, and enzymatic activity, particularly in the cleavage of NAD+, which is pivotal for its function in axonal degeneration (Essuman2017The; Sporny2020Structural). SARM1 acts as a metabolic sensor, becoming activated in response to changes in cellular NAD+ levels, thereby promoting axon destruction when necessary (Figley2021SARM1). The protein's activity is tightly regulated to prevent unwarranted cellular damage, making it a significant focus in the study of neurodegenerative diseases and potential therapeutic interventions (Waller2022Multifaceted).

## Structure
The SARM1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its structure and function. It contains an N-terminal ARM (armadillo) domain, two SAM (sterile alpha motif) domains, and a C-terminal TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain. The ARM domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and helps maintain the protein in an auto-inhibited state under normal conditions (Sporny2020Structural). The SAM domains facilitate oligomerization, forming an octamer ring structure that is crucial for SARM1's function in axonal degeneration (Gerdts2013Sarm1Mediated; Sporny2020Structural). The TIR domain is essential for NAD+ cleavage activity, which is a key function of SARM1 in promoting axonal degeneration (Essuman2017The).

The tertiary structure of SARM1 includes a compact conformation stabilized by NAD+ binding at an allosteric site within the ARM domain, preventing premature activation (Sporny2020Structural). The quaternary structure is described as a homo-octamer, with the SAM domains forming the inner ring and the ARM and TIR domains contributing to the peripheral structure (Sporny2020Structural). This oligomeric assembly is necessary for its enzymatic activity and function in cellular processes (Gerdts2013Sarm1Mediated).

## Function
The SARM1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in axon degeneration, a process essential for maintaining neuronal health and responding to injury. In healthy human cells, SARM1 is typically inactive due to the presence of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2, which maintains a low NMN/NAD+ ratio. This balance prevents the activation of SARM1's NADase activity, which would otherwise lead to axon degeneration (Figley2021SARM1).

SARM1 functions as a metabolic sensor, becoming activated when there is an increase in the NMN/NAD+ ratio, such as when NMNAT2 is depleted. This activation involves NMN binding to an allosteric pocket in SARM1's N-terminal auto-regulatory ARM domain, inducing conformational changes that activate the NADase activity in the C-terminal TIR domain. This results in the degradation of NAD+ and subsequent axon destruction (Figley2021SARM1).

The protein's enzymatic activity is tightly regulated to prevent unwanted cellular degeneration. In healthy cells, SARM1's activity is restrained by its auto-inhibitory N-terminal region, which prevents the degenerative capabilities of the protein from being triggered unnecessarily (Figley2020The; Waller2022Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SARM1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A), SARM1 is activated by mitochondrial dysfunction, exacerbating axonal degeneration. Deletion of SARM1 in a rat model of CMT2A has been shown to rescue axonal, synaptic, and muscle defects, suggesting that SARM1 inhibition could be a therapeutic strategy for CMT2A and other neurodegenerative diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction (SatoYamada2022A).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), rare SARM1 variants with constitutive NADase activity have been identified, which are enriched in ALS patients. These variants promote axonal degeneration, indicating that SARM1 mutations may increase the risk of developing ALS (Bloom2022Constitutively). SARM1 has also been associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, where its deficiency in mice reduces diabetes-induced sensory nerve fiber dysfunction, suggesting a protective role against nerve damage (Cheng2019Sarm1).

In prion diseases, SARM1 deficiency leads to up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein XAF1, enhancing neuronal apoptosis and accelerating disease progression (Zhu2019SARM1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SARM1 in various neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
SARM1 (sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in axon degeneration and cellular signaling. SARM1 is a TIR adaptor protein that forms complexes through its SAM and TIR domains, which are essential for its function in promoting axon degeneration. The SAM domains facilitate SARM-SARM binding, indicating that self-association is necessary for its activity (Gerdts2013Sarm1Mediated). The TIR domain is involved in forming functional complexes, possibly through dimerization, to interact with other proteins (Gerdts2013Sarm1Mediated).

In the retina, SARM1 is part of a multiprotein complex involving retinoschisin and Na/K ATPase. It is suggested to bind to the cytoplasmic domains of the Na/K ATPase α3 and/or β2 subunits, potentially through its SAM and TIR domains, or interact with another adaptor protein associated with Na/K ATPase (Molday2007Retinoschisin). This complex is important for maintaining normal photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic structure and function.

SARM1 also interacts with metabolites such as NMN and NAD+, acting as a metabolic sensor. The ARM domain of SARM1 binds NMN and NAD+ competitively, with NMN binding more tightly, leading to conformational changes that activate SARM1 (Figley2021SARM1).
