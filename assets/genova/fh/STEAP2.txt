# STEAP2

## Overview
STEAP2 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 2) is a gene that encodes the STEAP2 metalloreductase, a transmembrane protein involved in metal ion homeostasis. This protein is part of the STEAP family, characterized by its six-transmembrane domain structure and its role as a metalloreductase, facilitating the reduction of metal ions such as iron and copper. The STEAP2 protein is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm, where it participates in the secretion and endocytosis pathways. It plays a critical role in cellular processes by reducing extracellular Fe3+/Cu2+ to Fe2+/Cu+, thus enabling cellular uptake of these essential metals. The protein's structure includes a domain-swapped homotrimer and contains cofactors such as heme and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are crucial for its electron transfer functions. STEAP2's expression and activity have significant implications in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor promoter or suppressor, depending on the cancer type (Chen2021Regulatory; Naveed2016Insilico; Chen2023Mechanism).

## Structure
The STEAP2 protein is a six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate, functioning as a metalloreductase. It is characterized by a domain-swapped homotrimer structure, similar to STEAP4, with each protomer interacting with the transmembrane domain (TMD) of a neighboring protomer (Chen2021Mechanism). The protein contains a transmembrane domain and an oxidoreductase domain (OxRD), which facilitates electron transfer involving heme, FAD, and NADP+ (Chen2023Mechanism). The structure of STEAP2 includes tightly bound lipid molecules, such as phospholipids and cholesterol, which may play structural and functional roles (Chen2021Mechanism).

The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of STEAP2 was determined at a resolution of 3.16 Å, revealing a domain-swapped homotrimer with a root mean squared distance of 0.8 Å (Cα) compared to STEAP4 (Chen2023Mechanism). The protein's structure is noted for its flexibility, with certain regions, such as the N-terminal residues 1-27, C-terminal residues 470-490, and residues 332-353, not resolved in the density map, likely due to their flexibility (Chen2023Mechanism). The presence of a bis-imidazole ligated low-spin heme in both ferric and ferrous states suggests its role in electron transfer (Chen2023Mechanism).

## Function
STEAP2 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 2) is a metalloreductase enzyme involved in the reduction of metal ions, such as iron and copper, within human cells. It plays a crucial role in cellular metal ion homeostasis, particularly in the reduction and absorption of metals like iron and copper, which are essential for various cellular processes (Chen2021Regulatory). STEAP2 is located in vesicle-tubular structures of the trans-Golgi network, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm, and it shuttles between the plasma membrane and Golgi body, participating in the secretion/endocytosis pathway (Chen2021Regulatory).

The protein structure of STEAP2 contains at least one heme group, which may be related to the absorption of iron and copper (Chen2021Regulatory). STEAP2 functions as a metalloreductase, facilitating the reduction of extracellular Fe3+/Cu2+ to Fe2+/Cu+, thereby enabling the cell uptake of these reduced metals through transferrin and copper transport proteins (Chen2021Regulatory). This function is important for maintaining intracellular oxidative stress and inflammation balance, as well as other cellular biological processes (Chen2021Regulatory). The protein is also involved in electron transfer processes, utilizing cofactors such as heme and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to facilitate these reactions (Chen2023Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STEAP2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In breast cancer, STEAP2 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal breast tissues. This reduced expression is associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes, including advanced clinical stages, higher histological grades, and lymph node metastasis. Higher STEAP2 expression correlates with longer survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yang2019STEAP2).

In prostate cancer, STEAP2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with increased invasive potential and higher Gleason scores. Knockdown studies in prostate cancer cell lines have shown that reducing STEAP2 expression decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in promoting aggressive cancer traits (Burnell2018STEAP2).

In glioma, high STEAP2 expression is associated with prolonged overall survival, particularly in lower-grade gliomas. Its expression decreases with increasing glioma grade, suggesting a potential role as a favorable prognostic marker (Wang2022The).

In papillary thyroid cancer, low STEAP2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased metastasis. Overexpression of STEAP2 in cell lines inhibits proliferation and invasion, indicating its function as a tumor suppressor (Zhu2022METTL3mediated).

## Interactions
STEAP2, a metalloreductase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in metal ion homeostasis. It interacts with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) during the endocytic pathway, facilitating iron uptake by reducing ferric iron to its divalent form, which is then transported into the cytosol (Naveed2016Insilico). This interaction is significant in the context of prostate cancer, where STEAP2 is highly expressed and contributes to cancer cell proliferation and survival (Naveed2016Insilico).

STEAP2 is also part of the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) protein family, which includes other members like STEAP1, STEAP3, and STEAP4. These proteins share structural similarities and are involved in similar pathways, such as metal ion metabolism and redox reactions (Naveed2016Insilico). The interaction between STEAP2 and other STEAP family members, particularly STEAP4, has been noted, with STEAP4 being identified as the most structurally similar protein to STEAP2 (Ongaba2022A).

In addition to its role in metal metabolism, STEAP2 may influence cellular signaling pathways, such as the ERK pathway, which is involved in the activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) that promote cancer growth and metastasis (Naveed2016Insilico).
