# CHRM4

## Overview
The CHRM4 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 4, a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in the central nervous system and various peripheral tissues. This receptor is involved in modulating neurotransmitter release and cognitive functions by interacting with inhibitory G proteins to regulate intracellular signaling pathways, such as the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Pozhidaev2020&lt; p&gt; Association). The muscarinic M4 receptor is predominantly expressed in the dorsal striatum and is crucial for regulating the excitatory direct extrapyramidal pathway, thereby influencing behavioral and cognitive processes (Pozhidaev2020&lt; p&gt; Association). Additionally, CHRM4 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including schizophrenia and prostate cancer, where it affects disease progression and therapeutic responses (Scarr2013Cholinergic; Wen2023CHRM4AKTMYCN).

## Structure


## Function
The CHRM4 gene encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular and molecular processes. In healthy human cells, CHRM4 is primarily active in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in modulating neurotransmitter release and cognitive functions. It interacts with inhibitory G proteins, such as Gi, Go, and Gn, to inhibit adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Pozhidaev2020&lt; p&gt; Association).

CHRM4 is highly expressed in the dorsal striatum and is involved in regulating the excitatory direct extrapyramidal pathway, influencing behavioral and cognitive outputs (Pozhidaev2020&lt; p&gt; Association). In erythroid progenitor cells, CHRM4 negatively regulates the self-renewal of burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells by modulating cAMP concentrations and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcriptional program. This regulation affects the expression of genes critical for erythroid progenitor expansion, such as GATA2 and ZFP36L2 (Trivedi2019Muscarinic).

The receptor's activity is also linked to the parasympathetic nervous system, suggesting a broader role in maintaining homeostasis and cellular responses across different tissues (Trivedi2019Muscarinic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CHRM4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably schizophrenia and prostate cancer. In schizophrenia, the CHRM4 gene is associated with the disorder's pathophysiology due to decreased expression in brain regions such as the hippocampus and caudate-putamen. Specific polymorphisms, particularly rs2067482, have been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. The C allele of rs2067482 is associated with a more severe clinical presentation, potentially requiring more intensive pharmacotherapy (Scarr2013Cholinergic). However, there are conflicting findings regarding the allelic association, with some studies suggesting the T allele is more prevalent in schizophrenia patients (Pozhidaev2020&lt; p&gt; Association).

In prostate cancer, CHRM4 expression is upregulated following androgen receptor (AR) inhibition, which is common in advanced prostate cancer treatments. This upregulation is linked to neuroendocrine differentiation and increased tumor aggressiveness. CHRM4 interacts with pathways such as AKT/MYCN, promoting neuroendocrine differentiation and contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These interactions suggest that CHRM4 may serve as a biomarker for advanced prostate cancer and a potential therapeutic target (Wen2023CHRM4AKTMYCN).

## Interactions
CHRM4, or cholinergic receptor muscarinic 4, is involved in several interactions that influence prostate cancer progression, particularly in the context of neuroendocrine differentiation and castration resistance. CHRM4 physically interacts with nerve growth factor (NGF), a relationship that is particularly significant following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This interaction has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses in both androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines. The interaction between NGF and CHRM4 is stable in ADT-treated LNCaP and C4-2 cells and is reduced when NGF is knocked down (Chen2021Nerve).

The NGF-CHRM4 interaction is part of a signaling pathway that includes the activation of the AKT-MYCN pathway, which enhances neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) reprogramming. This pathway is upregulated when AR signaling is inhibited, a common occurrence in ADT, and is associated with the development of NEPC (Chen2021Nerve). CHRM4 also interacts with the AKT/MYCN signaling pathway, influencing the expression of interferon alpha 17 (IFNA17) and promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Wen2023CHRM4AKTMYCN). These interactions suggest that CHRM4 plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and promoting NEPC differentiation.
