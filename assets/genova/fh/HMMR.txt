# HMMR

## Overview
The HMMR gene encodes the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes, particularly in cell division and motility. This protein is primarily recognized as a microtubule-associated protein rather than a traditional receptor, and it is involved in the regulation of mitosis and meiosis by acting as a spindle assembly factor. It facilitates the localization and activation of mitotic kinases such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and Aurora kinase A, which are essential for proper cell division (He2020Hyaluronan; Connell2017HMMR). Additionally, HMMR interacts with various proteins to modulate spindle positioning and chromosome segregation, underscoring its critical role in maintaining genomic stability (He2020Hyaluronan). Beyond its intracellular functions, HMMR also binds to hyaluronan fragments in the extracellular matrix, influencing processes like tissue inflammation and tumor progression (Esguerra2015Identification). Alterations in HMMR expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Jiang2022NcRNAMediated; Guo2023HMMR).

## Structure


## Function
The HMMR gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mitosis and meiosis in human cells. It is primarily recognized as a microtubule-associated protein involved in cell growth regulation rather than a traditional hyaluronan receptor (He2020Hyaluronan). HMMR functions as a spindle assembly factor, localizing protein complexes to enhance the activities of mitotic kinases such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and Aurora kinase A, which are crucial for cell division processes like mitosis and meiosis (He2020Hyaluronan; Connell2017HMMR). 

HMMR is involved in the orientation of the mitotic spindle, modulating spindle position through interactions with proteins like DYNLL1 and CHICA/FAM83D (He2020Hyaluronan). It is essential for processes such as chromosome segregation, kinetochore assembly, and nuclear pore complex assembly (He2020Hyaluronan). The protein is co-expressed with several cell cycle-related genes and peaks in abundance during the G2-phase and mitosis (He2020Hyaluronan). 

HMMR is also involved in the PLK1-dependent spindle positioning pathway, which is crucial for proper cell division and neural development (Connell2017HMMR). It interacts with Ran-GTP to localize TPX2, facilitating the activation of Aurora A kinase, which in turn phosphorylates PLK1, necessary for proper spindle positioning (Connell2017HMMR). HMMR's dysfunction can lead to developmental impairments, highlighting its essential role in healthy cell function (Connell2017HMMR).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMMR gene, also known as the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor, have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of HMMR is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), breast cancer, and prostate cancer. In LUAD, high HMMR expression correlates with adverse clinicopathological features and poor survival outcomes, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Jiang2022NcRNAMediated). In breast cancer, particularly in BRCA1-mutant contexts, HMMR overexpression increases the risk of tumorigenesis by promoting genomic instability and inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB pathway (Mateo2022Modification). 

In prostate cancer, HMMR interacts with AURKA to activate the mTORC2/AKT pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and metastasis. This interaction forms a positive feedback loop with E2F1, further exacerbating cancer progression (Guo2023HMMR). HMMR's role in cancer is also linked to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and spindle assembly, contributing to increased invasiveness and metastasis (Shabir2024Exploring). These findings suggest that targeting HMMR and its associated pathways could offer therapeutic potential in treating these cancers.

## Interactions
HMMR, also known as RHAMM, is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. Intracellularly, RHAMM interacts with microtubules and the mitotic spindle, playing a significant role in cell division. It binds directly to microtubules through its NH2-terminal domain and interacts with the mitotic spindle, localizing to the centrosome and mitotic spindle pole by interacting with the targeting protein for XKlp2 (TPX2). This interaction is essential for proper mitotic spindle assembly (Jiang2010Multifunctional).

RHAMM also interacts with ERK1 directly and with MEK1 and ERK2 indirectly, acting as an adaptor protein that anchors ERK1/2 to microtubules, which allows these kinases to modify microtubule dynamics (Tolg2010RHAMM). It binds to α- and β-tubulin proteins via a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper, which is necessary for its association with the mitotic spindle (Tolg2010RHAMM).

Extracellularly, RHAMM binds to hyaluronan (HA) fragments, which are components of the extracellular matrix that promote tissue inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor progression (Esguerra2015Identification). This binding involves anionic regions of HA interacting with basic amino acid-rich regions in RHAMM (Esguerra2015Identification).
