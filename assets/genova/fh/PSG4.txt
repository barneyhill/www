# PSG4

## Overview
PSG4, or pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, specifically categorized within the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroup. This protein is predominantly expressed in the placenta and plays a crucial role in modulating the maternal immune system during pregnancy. By promoting immune regulation, PSG4 contributes to maternal-fetal tolerance, which is essential for a successful pregnancy outcome (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific; Jeong2021Depletion). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling, which support placental development and function (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). PSG4's interactions with receptors such as tetraspanins, integrins, syndecans, and galectins highlight its involvement in complex cell signaling pathways (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). The expression of PSG4 increases as pregnancy progresses, indicating its significant role in the later stages of gestation (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

## Structure


## Function
PSG4, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, is primarily expressed in the placenta and plays a significant role in immune modulation during pregnancy. It contributes to maternal-fetal tolerance by promoting immune regulation, which is crucial for a successful pregnancy outcome (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific; Jeong2021Depletion). PSG4 is involved in the upregulation of TGF-β1 expression in immune cells, which is essential for establishing maternal tolerance (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). This protein is also implicated in cell adhesion and signaling processes, supporting placental development and function (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

In terms of molecular activity, PSG4 is known to bind to various receptors, including tetraspanins, integrins, syndecans, and galectins, which are involved in cell signaling pathways (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). The protein's expression increases as pregnancy progresses, with strong expression noted at term, indicating its role in the later stages of pregnancy (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). PSG4's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining a healthy pregnancy by facilitating immune tolerance and supporting the structural and functional integrity of the placenta.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of PSG4 (pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein 4) is primarily associated with its altered expression in certain conditions. In patients with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), PSG4 expression is notably increased, which may be linked to the elevated blood levels of alpha-fetoprotein observed in these patients. This suggests that PSG4 expression changes could be a result of mutations in the senataxin protein, affecting gene expression patterns related to neurogenesis (Fogel2014Mutation).

In the context of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), PSG4 expression is also altered, with increased levels observed in IUGR placentae. This change in expression may be a response to maternal vascular under-perfusion, potentially contributing to the perpetuation of growth restriction (McMinn2006Unbalanced).

While PSG4 is part of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, which is generally associated with immune regulation and maternal-fetal interactions, specific mutations or alterations in PSG4 have not been directly linked to other diseases or conditions in the provided context. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of PSG4 expression changes and potential mutations in various clinical settings.

## Interactions
PSG4, a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein family, is involved in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). PSG4 can activate latent TGF-β1 from complexes on the surface of T cells and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by binding to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1. This interaction has been characterized using surface plasmon resonance, which showed that PSG4 has an affinity for LAP in the micromolar range (Warren2018Activation).

PSG4 does not interact with or activate latent TGF-β1 in complex with glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) on the surface of T cells, indicating a specificity for soluble or ECM-bound latent TGF-β1 (Warren2018Activation).

There is also potential for PSG4 to interact with galectin-1 (Gal-1), as suggested by its glycosylation pattern, although this interaction has not been definitively confirmed. PSG4 has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which may facilitate binding to Gal-1, similar to other PSGs (Mendoza2020Glycan). However, specific interactions of PSG4 with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
