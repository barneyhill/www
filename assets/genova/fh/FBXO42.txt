# FBXO42

## Overview
FBXO42 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 42, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is pivotal in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, responsible for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and influencing critical cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42; Nagler2019A). The F-box protein 42 is characterized by its F-box domain, which facilitates interaction with SKP1, and a Kelch repeat domain, which is crucial for substrate binding (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42). This protein plays a significant role in maintaining mitotic function and has been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42; Gao2013Genetic). Its involvement in these diseases underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and its importance in cellular homeostasis.

## Structure
FBXO42 is an F-box protein that is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The molecular structure of FBXO42 includes an F-box domain, which is responsible for interacting with SKP1, and a Kelch repeat domain, which serves as the substrate-binding domain (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42). The F-box domain is approximately 40 amino acids long and is crucial for the protein's function within the SCF complex (Zhou2024Comprehensive).

The Kelch domain of FBXO42 is involved in binding to specific substrate proteins, and its deletion has been shown to impair the protein's function, indicating its importance in substrate recognition (Nagler2019A). The F-box domain deletion involves amino acids 39-93, and the Kelch domain deletion involves amino acids 107-354, highlighting the specific regions critical for its activity (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42).

FBXO42 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the available literature (Zhou2024Comprehensive). The protein's role in various cancers, including glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, underscores its functional significance in cellular processes (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42; Zhou2024Comprehensive).

## Function
FBXO42, a member of the F-box protein family, is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover, impacting cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathways (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42; Nagler2019A). 

In healthy human cells, FBXO42 is involved in maintaining proper mitotic function by preventing mitotic arrest and spindle assembly checkpoint activation. It ensures correct chromosome alignment and kinetochore-microtubule attachment, which are vital for successful cell division (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42). The protein is primarily located in the cell nucleus and is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal gland (Zhou2024Comprehensive).

FBXO42 interacts with several proteins, including CCDC6, a pro-apoptotic protein involved in the DNA damage response. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in cellular stress responses, although FBXO42 does not target CCDC6 for degradation (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42). The F-box and Kelch domains of FBXO42 are essential for its function within the SCF complex, highlighting its role in substrate recognition and interaction (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO42 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In glioblastoma, FBXO42 is crucial for preventing mitotic arrest and spindle assembly checkpoint activation, which are essential for tumor cell viability. Loss of FBXO42 leads to prolonged mitosis and cell death, indicating its role in maintaining tumor growth and survival (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42). In neuroblastoma, FBXO42 acts as a tumor-promoting factor. It is part of a prognostic model that correlates with poorer outcomes and immune therapeutic resistance. FBXO42 promotes neuroblastoma cell proliferation by downregulating TP53 protein levels, suggesting its oncogenic role depends on TP53 interaction (Zhou2024Comprehensive).

In NRAS-mutant melanoma, FBXO42 contributes to resistance against MEK inhibitors like trametinib. It is involved in the TAK1 signaling pathway, which enhances P38 activation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance (Nagler2019A). Additionally, FBXO42 has been studied in the context of Parkinson's disease, where certain genetic variants are associated with increased susceptibility, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Gao2013Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FBXO42 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
FBXO42 is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. It interacts with several proteins, including CUL1 and SKP1, which are core components of the SCF complex (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42). FBXO42 also interacts with RBPJ, a transcriptional regulator, and novel candidates such as CCDC6, PPP4C, and PPP4R1, which are implicated in various cellular processes (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42).

In neuroblastoma, FBXO42 has been shown to promote cell proliferation through the degradation of TP53, a tumor suppressor protein. This interaction suggests that FBXO42 may play an oncogenic role by modulating TP53 levels, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and proliferation (Zhou2024Comprehensive). However, in glioblastoma, FBXO42's role appears to be independent of TP53, as its knockout does not lead to increased TP53 levels, indicating that FBXO42 may interact with other, yet unidentified, substrates to exert its effects (Hoellerbauer2024FBXO42).

FBXO42 is also involved in the TAK1 signaling pathway, interacting with MAP3K7 (TAK1) and its regulators TAB1, TAB2, and ITCH, which are associated with the activation of NF-κB, P38, JNK, and ERK pathways (Nagler2019A). These interactions highlight FBXO42's role in various signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer cell survival and proliferation.
