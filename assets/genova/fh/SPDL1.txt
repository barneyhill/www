# SPDL1

## Overview
SPDL1, or spindle apparatus coiled-coil protein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein Spindly, which plays a crucial role in mitotic cell division. The Spindly protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and is integral to the proper functioning of the mitotic spindle apparatus. It is primarily involved in chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis by interacting with the Rod/ZW10/Zwilch (RZZ) complex and recruiting the motor protein dynein to kinetochores. This recruitment is essential for the poleward movement of chromosomes and the regulation of mitotic checkpoint signaling, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy (Gassmann2010Removal; Barisic2010SpindlyCCDC99). The SPDL1 gene's expression and function are tightly regulated through post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and farnesylation, which are critical for its localization and interaction with other proteins (Feng2024Emerging). Dysregulation of SPDL1 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where it contributes to genomic instability and tumorigenesis (Song2022Pancancer).

## Structure
The SPDL1 gene encodes the hSpindly protein, which is involved in cell cycle regulation during mitosis. The hSpindly protein consists of 605 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 70,172 Da (Feng2024Emerging). Structurally, hSpindly contains a coiled helix domain with two coiled-coil domains and a conserved 32-amino acid spindle sequence. It also features four repetitive motifs with a consensus sequence of TPX-KPQXKGTPVK (Feng2024Emerging). The N-terminal coiled-coil region includes conserved motifs critical for binding to the dynein light intermediate chain and the dynactin complex, which are essential for the recruitment of dynein to kinetochores (Gama2017Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of hSpindly include farnesylation at a cysteine residue in its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the RZZ complex and localization to kinetochores (Feng2024Emerging). Ubiquitination involves interaction with the ubiquitin-specific protease USP45, with potential lysine ubiquitination sites identified in its first coiled-coil domain (Feng2024Emerging). The protein's N-terminal residues (293-322) are involved in high-affinity binding to the kinetochore (Feng2024Emerging). The C-terminal domain functions as the cargo-binding region, directly binding to the ROD-1 β-propeller and Zwilch ZWL-1 (Gama2017Molecular).

## Function
The SPDL1 gene encodes the protein Spindly, which plays a critical role in mitosis, particularly in chromosome alignment and segregation. Spindly is a mitotic phosphoprotein that interacts with the Rod/ZW10/Zwilch (RZZ) complex and is essential for recruiting the motor protein dynein to kinetochores, facilitating the poleward movement of chromosomes and regulating mitotic checkpoint signaling (Gassmann2010Removal; Barisic2010SpindlyCCDC99). During mitosis, Spindly localizes to kinetochores, where it is involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy (Feng2024Emerging; Song2022Pancancer).

Spindly's function is regulated through post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and farnesylation, which are crucial for its interaction with the RZZ complex and its localization to kinetochores (Feng2024Emerging). The protein's activity is vital for the proper attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase and ensuring the even distribution of genetic material between daughter cells (Gassmann2010Removal; Dhindsa2021Identification). In healthy cells, SPDL1's role in these processes helps maintain genomic stability, preventing errors that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Feng2024Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SPDL1 gene, also known as spindle apparatus coiled-coil protein 1, have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In cancer, SPDL1 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to genomic instability (GIN) and tumorigenesis. High SPDL1 expression is linked to poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) but is associated with better outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (KlimaszewskaWiśniewska2022SPDL1; Song2022Pancancer). SPDL1's role in chromosome segregation during mitosis is crucial, and its dysregulation can lead to chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancer (Feng2024Emerging).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rare missense variant in SPDL1 is associated with increased disease risk, suggesting a distinct mechanism from telomerase-related pathways (Koskela2021Genetic; Dhindsa2021Identification). This variant is also linked to a reduced risk of various cancers, demonstrating antagonistic pleiotropy (Koskela2021Genetic).

SPDL1's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in tumors, influencing the tumor microenvironment and potentially affecting treatment responses (Song2022Pancancer). These findings underscore the gene's potential as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting in cancer and other diseases.

## Interactions
SPDL1, also known as spindle apparatus coiled-coil protein 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. SPDL1 interacts with the dynein-dynactin complex, forming a ternary complex that is crucial for recruiting these proteins to kinetochores. This interaction is mediated by Spindly's N-terminal coiled-coil region, which binds to the C-terminal region of dynein's light intermediate chain (LIC1) (Gama2017Molecular). The C-terminal domain of SPDL1 also interacts with the Rod-Zwilch-Zw10 (RZZ) complex, specifically binding to the ROD-1 β-propeller and Zwilch ZWL-1, which is essential for its recruitment to kinetochores (Gama2017Molecular).

Mutations in specific residues of Zwilch ZWL-1 can disrupt the localization of SPDL1 to kinetochores, affecting the recruitment of dynein, dynactin, and Mad2, and impairing spindle assembly checkpoint activation (Gama2017Molecular). SPDL1's interaction with the RZZ complex is crucial for its role in kinetochore-microtubule interactions and chromosome segregation, as it functions downstream of the RZZ complex to facilitate the recruitment of dynein/dynactin to kinetochores (Gassmann2008A). These interactions highlight SPDL1's pivotal role in ensuring proper kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during cell division.
