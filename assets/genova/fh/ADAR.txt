# ADAR

## Overview
The ADAR gene encodes a family of enzymes known as adenosine deaminases acting on RNA, which are crucial for the post-transcriptional modification process known as RNA editing. These enzymes, particularly ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3, catalyze the conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a modification that can alter RNA stability, splicing, and translation. The ADAR proteins are characterized by their modular structure, which includes double-stranded RNA-binding domains and a catalytic deaminase domain, essential for their enzymatic activity (Ashley2024ADAR). Functionally, ADAR1 plays a significant role in modulating the innate immune response by editing endogenous dsRNA to prevent inappropriate immune activation (Chung2018Human). Dysregulation or mutations in the ADAR gene have been linked to various human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Slotkin2013Adenosinetoinosine; Song2021The).

## Structure
The human ADAR gene encodes a protein with a modular structure, including double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and a catalytic deaminase domain (CDD). ADAR1 contains three dsRBDs, while ADAR2 and ADAR3 each have two (Ashley2024ADAR). The deaminase domain is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, facilitating the conversion of adenosine to inosine in RNA. This domain includes a zinc-coordinating center, which is essential for its function (Ashley2024ADAR).

The secondary structure of ADAR proteins involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with specific domains like the Zα domain in ADAR1p150 exhibiting a helix-turn-helix β-sheet fold (Ashley2024ADAR). The tertiary structure is characterized by the arrangement of these domains, which are crucial for RNA substrate binding and editing specificity (Ashley2024ADAR).

ADAR proteins can form dimers, a feature important for their quaternary structure and function. This dimerization is often RNA-dependent and involves specific protein-protein interactions (Thuy-Boun2020Asymmetric). ADAR1 has splice variant isoforms, such as ADAR1p150 and ADAR1p110, which differ in their domain composition and functional roles (Ashley2024ADAR).

## Function
The ADAR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA editing by converting adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a process known as A-to-I editing. This editing is essential for modulating the innate immune response and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, ADAR1 prevents the inappropriate activation of immune sensors such as protein kinase R (PKR) and MDA5 by editing endogenous dsRNA, thereby reducing its immunostimulatory potential (Samuel2019Adenosine; Chung2018Human). 

ADAR1 is involved in regulating the interferon (IFN) response, preventing translational shutdown and ensuring efficient protein synthesis during immune activation. It achieves this by inhibiting PKR activation, which is typically triggered by dsRNA and leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2a, a critical step in mRNA translation initiation (Chung2018Human). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with the p150 isoform being inducible by IFN and playing a significant role in cytoplasmic RNA editing (Samuel2019Adenosine). ADAR1's editing activity is crucial for distinguishing between self and non-self RNA, preventing autoimmune reactions and supporting normal cellular functions (Erdmann2020To).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the ADAR gene have been implicated in several human diseases. ADAR1 mutations are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare neurological disorder characterized by brain and skin inflammation. These mutations often lead to increased interferon production, contributing to the disease pathology (Slotkin2013Adenosinetoinosine; Song2021The). ADAR1 is also linked to Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), a pigmentary disorder. Mutations in ADAR1, such as the H216fs frameshift mutation, affect the synthesis of the p150 isoform, which is involved in antiapoptotic pathways (Maas2006AtoI).

In cancer, ADAR1 and ADAR2 play roles in tumorigenesis. ADAR1 mutations can lead to altered RNA editing, affecting oncogenes and tumor suppressors, which can influence cancer development and response to immunotherapy (Song2021The). In glioblastoma, reduced ADAR2 activity correlates with increased tumor proliferation (Gatsiou2018AdenosinetoInosine). ADAR2's role in editing the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors is crucial for neurological function, and its downregulation is linked to excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Slotkin2013Adenosinetoinosine). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ADAR gene mutations and expression alterations in various diseases.

## Interactions
ADAR1, a member of the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) family, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple RNA processing pathways. ADAR1 interacts with the microprocessor complex, which includes DROSHA and DGCR8, in a manner not mediated by single-stranded RNA. This interaction suggests a reciprocal relationship where ADAR1 competes with other proteins for binding to nascent RNAs, affecting 3' UTR formation and miRNA biogenesis (Bahn2015Genomic). ADAR1 is predominantly localized in the chromatin fraction, indicating its binding to nascent RNAs shortly after production (Bahn2015Genomic).

ADAR1 also forms stable homodimers, a process independent of RNA binding, which is crucial for its RNA editing activity (Cho2003Requirement). The dimerization of ADAR1 is mediated by protein-protein interactions between monomers, and this structural formation is necessary for its enzymatic function (Cho2003Requirement). Additionally, ADAR1 interacts with spliceosomal components and the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism, indicating its role in coordinating RNA editing with splicing and mRNA decay (Nishikura2010Functions). These interactions highlight ADAR1's broad functional roles beyond RNA editing, including alternative splicing and mRNA decay (Bahn2015Genomic).
