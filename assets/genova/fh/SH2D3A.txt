# SH2D3A

## Overview
SH2D3A is a gene that encodes the SH2 domain-containing protein 3A, also known as NSP1. This protein is characterized by the presence of an SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain, which is integral to its role in cellular signal transduction. The SH2 domain enables SH2D3A to bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins, facilitating its involvement in critical cellular processes such as migration and adhesion. SH2D3A interacts with key signaling proteins, including Abl, Crk, and p130Cas, which are pivotal in regulating these processes (Liu2006The). The gene's expression and regulation have been implicated in various pathological contexts, including cancer and infectious diseases, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Wang2020<p>Upregulation; Sharma2021Determining).

## Clinical Significance
SH2D3A, also known as NSP1, has been implicated in the context of COVID-19, where it is identified as a disease gene within specific modules of gene expression datasets. The study using GeneMania and other bioinformatics tools highlights SH2D3A's potential clinical significance in relation to COVID-19, suggesting that it may play a role in the disease mechanisms by sharing pathways with other disease genes (Sharma2021Determining).

While SH2D3A is not directly associated with specific diseases through mutations or alterations in the provided context, the broader category of SH2 domain-containing proteins, to which SH2D3A belongs, is involved in various human diseases. These include cancers, leukemias, and immune disorders, often due to dysregulation of signal transduction pathways such as RAS-MAPK, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT (Liu2006The; Diop2022SH2). The SH2 domain's role in binding phosphorylated tyrosine residues is crucial for these pathways, and alterations in SH2 domain proteins can lead to disorders (Diop2022SH2).

Although specific diseases directly linked to SH2D3A mutations are not detailed, its involvement in signaling pathways suggests potential implications in disease states when its expression or interactions are altered.

## Interactions
SH2D3A, also known as NSP1, is a protein that contains an SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain, which facilitates its involvement in signal transduction pathways through interactions with other proteins. The SH2 domain of SH2D3A allows it to bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins, enabling it to participate in various cellular processes such as migration and adhesion. SH2D3A is known to interact with proteins like Abl, Crk, and p130Cas, which are involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate these processes (Liu2006The).

In the context of ovarian cancer, SH2D3A expression is regulated by the hsa_circRNA_102958/miR-1205 axis. hsa_circRNA_102958 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-1205, inhibiting its activity and thereby promoting the expression of SH2D3A. This interaction enhances the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, highlighting the role of SH2D3A in cancer progression (Wang2020<p>Upregulation). The regulation of SH2D3A by this axis suggests its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer.
