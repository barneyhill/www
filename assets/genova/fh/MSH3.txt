# MSH3

## Overview
The MSH3 gene encodes the protein mutS homolog 3, a critical component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. This protein is categorized as a DNA repair protein and functions primarily in the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimer with MSH2, known as the MutSβ complex. The MutSβ complex is essential for recognizing and repairing insertion-deletion loops in DNA, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing microsatellite instability. MSH3 also plays a unique role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination, distinguishing it from other MMR proteins. Mutations in the MSH3 gene are associated with certain hereditary and sporadic cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, due to its role in maintaining genomic integrity (Campregher2012MSH3Deficiency; Palombo1996hMutSβ; Adam2016Exome).

## Structure
The MSH3 protein is a component of the DNA mismatch repair system, forming a heterodimer with MSH2 known as MutSβ. This complex is primarily responsible for recognizing insertion-deletion loops. MSH3 contains a mismatch-binding domain (MBD) that is crucial for its function in DNA repair. The MBD of MSH3 is structurally distinct from that of Msh6 and MutS, lacking the conserved -stacking phenylalanine residue found in these proteins, which affects its mechanism of mispair recognition (Shell2007Chimeric; Dowen2010Functional).

The primary structure of MSH3 consists of 1047 amino acids, as revealed by the sequencing of the yeast gene (New1993The). The protein also contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that facilitate its transport into the nucleus, with NLS1 being identified as a potent signal for nuclear import (TsengRogenski2020The).

In terms of tertiary structure, homology modeling has been used to predict the MBD of MSH3, highlighting specific residues like Y157, K158, K160, and S201 that play crucial roles in DNA binding and repair processes (Dowen2010Functional). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with MSH2 to form the MutSβ complex, essential for its function in mismatch repair (Dowen2010Functional).

## Function
The MSH3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, primarily functioning in the nucleus of healthy human cells. MSH3 forms a heterodimer with MSH2, known as the MutSβ complex, which is specifically involved in recognizing and repairing insertion-deletion loops in DNA. This complex is particularly effective at binding loops of two or more nucleotides, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing microsatellite instability and associated mutator phenotypes (TsengRogenski2020The; Palombo1996hMutSβ).

MSH3 also participates in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination, a function unique among MMR proteins. This role is linked to its interaction with the Mre11/RAD50/NBS1 complex, which is essential for repairing hairpin-capped DSBs and preventing chromosome rearrangements (Campregher2012MSH3Deficiency). Additionally, MSH3 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and human exonuclease I (hExoI), facilitating early steps in DNA mismatch repair and DNA recombination (Campregher2012MSH3Deficiency).

In healthy cells, MSH3 is not typically inactivated by methylation but can be affected by somatic frameshift mutations or inflammation-induced nuclear-to-cytosol shifts, which are associated with IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling and oxidative stress (TsengRogenski2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MSH3 gene are associated with a recessive subtype of colorectal adenomatous polyposis, characterized by multiple colorectal polyps and adenomas, and in some cases, colorectal cancer. These mutations lead to a loss of function at the RNA and protein levels, resulting in high microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumor tissues (Adam2016Exome). Biallelic MSH3 germline mutations have been identified in individuals with this condition, suggesting an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. Affected individuals often have siblings with similar conditions, but their parents typically do not have a history of malignant gastrointestinal disease (Adam2016Exome).

MSH3 deficiency is linked to elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST), which is observed in various sporadic malignancies, including colorectal cancer (Haugen2008Genetic). This deficiency contributes to genetic instability and tumorigenesis, with evidence from both human and animal models supporting its role as a primary mutator in colorectal cancer (Adam2016Exome). MSH3 dysfunction is also prevalent in ulcerative colitis and increases with neoplastic advancement, highlighting its potential role in the progression of this disease to colorectal cancer (Munakata2019InflammationAssociated).

## Interactions
MSH3 is a key component of the DNA mismatch repair system, primarily forming a heterodimer with MSH2, known as the MutSβ complex. This complex is crucial for recognizing insertion-deletion loops and certain base-base mismatches in DNA. MSH3 does not form homomultimer complexes and does not directly interact with MSH6, another mismatch repair protein (Acharya1996hMSH2).

The MSH2-MSH3 complex specifically recognizes insertion-deletion loop substrates and recruits the MLH1-PMS1 complex to these sites, facilitating repair. This recruitment is ATP-dependent and varies with the type of mispair (Srivatsan2014Mispair-specific). MSH3's interaction with MSH2 is essential for its function in mismatch repair, and it does not interact directly with MSH6 (Acharya1996hMSH2).

MSH3 also participates in interactions that influence genomic stability. Overexpression of MSH3 can lead to increased mutation rates and genomic instability, as it competes with MSH6 for binding to MSH2, resulting in a mutator phenotype (MedinaRivera2022Msh2Msh3). Additionally, MSH3 mutations can lead to a synthetic lethal interaction with PRKDC, making MSH3-deficient cells sensitive to DNA-PKcs inhibition, which is a potential therapeutic target in certain cancers (Dietlein2014A).
