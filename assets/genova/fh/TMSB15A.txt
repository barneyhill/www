# TMSB15A

## Overview
TMSB15A is a gene that encodes the protein thymosin beta 15A, which is categorized as an actin-binding protein. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a key component in cellular processes such as motility and migration. Thymosin beta 15A achieves this by sequestering G-actin monomers, thereby modulating actin polymerization and influencing cytoskeletal organization (mason2021role). The gene's expression is notably significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including tissue repair and cancer progression. In particular, alterations in TMSB15A expression have been linked to the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of several cancers, making it a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and therapeutic response (GU2008Elevated; DarbEsfahani2012Thymosin).

## Function
Thymosin beta 15A (TMSB15A) is a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for cell motility and migration. It functions by sequestering G-actin monomers, thereby regulating actin polymerization and influencing cytoskeletal organization (mason2021role). This activity is essential for processes such as cell migration and tissue repair, where dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton are required for cells to move and adapt to their environment (Banyard2009Differential).

In healthy human cells, TMSB15A is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with actin to maintain cellular structure and facilitate movement. Although specific functions in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its role in actin dynamics suggests it may contribute to maintaining normal cellular architecture and function (Banyard2009Differential). The protein's involvement in cell motility is highlighted by its ability to increase fibroblast migration and support anchorage-independent growth, indicating its potential role in cellular responses to environmental changes (Banyard2009Differential).

While the precise functions of TMSB15A in healthy tissues are not fully elucidated, its expression patterns in normal tissues such as the prostate suggest a role in maintaining tissue-specific cellular functions (Banyard2009Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMSB15A gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), elevated TMSB15A expression is associated with advanced cancer stages, poor differentiation, and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role in enhancing tumor aggressiveness (GU2008Elevated). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high TMSB15A expression is a significant predictor of pathological complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy, indicating its potential as a biomarker for therapy response (DarbEsfahani2012Thymosin). 

TMSB15A is also involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression, along with LINC01116, has prognostic significance. It is part of a predictive model for survival probabilities, highlighting its clinical relevance in HCC prognosis (Wang2023Comprehensive). The differential expression of TMSB15A and its isoform TMSB15B in various tumor types suggests distinct roles in cancer progression, with TMSB15A being more prevalent in prostate and colorectal cancers (Banyard2009Differential). These findings underscore the importance of TMSB15A in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
