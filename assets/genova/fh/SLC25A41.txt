# SLC25A41

## Overview
SLC25A41 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 41, also known as SCaMC-3-Like, which is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF). This protein functions as a calcium-independent mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier, facilitating the transport of ATP and ADP across the mitochondrial membrane. Unlike other members of the SCaMC subfamily, SCaMC-3-Like operates independently of calcium due to the absence of Ca2+-binding domains, which are typically present in other family members. The protein is primarily expressed in the testis and brain, indicating a specialized role in these tissues. SLC25A41 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial energy homeostasis and has been implicated in interactions with the GPR35 receptor, suggesting a role in cellular energy regulation and response to inflammatory conditions (Traba2009Characterization; Chen2023Kynurenic).

## Structure
The SLC25A41 protein, also known as SCaMC-3-Like, is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) and is characterized by its role as a calcium-independent mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier. The protein is composed of 312 amino acids in rodents and 370 in non-rodent mammals, with a high degree of conservation across species, sharing 92% similarity between murine and human versions (Traba2009Characterization). 

Structurally, SLC25A41 lacks the Ca2+-binding N-terminal extension found in other SCaMC subfamily members, which is due to the absence of certain exons that encode these domains (Traba2009Characterization). The protein is localized in the mitochondria and includes a mitochondrial carrier homology region, but it does not possess the EF-hand calcium-binding domains present in SCaMC-3 (Traba2009Characterization).

The primary structure of SLC25A41 includes conserved substrate contact points crucial for its function as an ATP-Mg/Pi exchanger, such as residues G188, I189, K95, K286, and R44, which are analogous to those in the yeast ATP-Mg/Pi carrier, Sal1p (Traba2009Characterization). The protein's secondary structure likely involves transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of the mitochondrial carrier family, although specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the context.

## Function
SLC25A41 encodes a mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier, known as SCaMC-3-Like, which is involved in the transport of ATP and ADP across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein facilitates the exchange of ATP-Mg and phosphate (Pi) in a calcium-independent manner, distinguishing it from other members of the SCaMC family that are regulated by calcium (Traba2009Characterization). The transport activity of SCaMC-3-Like is dependent on the presence of magnesium and phosphate, and it is capable of transporting free ADP, rather than ADP-Mg, across the mitochondrial membrane (Traba2009Characterization).

SLC25A41 plays a crucial role in maintaining the pool of adenine nucleotides within the mitochondrial matrix, which is essential for various metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis, urea synthesis, and mitochondrial DNA replication (Palmieri2013The). The protein is primarily expressed in the testis and, to a lesser extent, in the brain, suggesting a specialized role in these tissues (Traba2009Characterization). The unique mechanism of ATP-Mg/Pi exchange by SCaMC-3-Like supports mitochondrial energy metabolism and homeostasis, contributing to the overall cellular energy balance (Traba2009Characterization).

## Interactions
SLC25A41, also known as SCaMC-3-like, is a mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier that participates in specific protein interactions within the cell. It is involved in the transport of ATP-Mg and phosphate across the mitochondrial membrane, a process that is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis. Unlike other members of the SCaMC subfamily, SLC25A41 operates independently of calcium, as it lacks the Ca2+-binding N-extension found in other SCaMC proteins (Traba2009Characterization).

In the context of sepsis, SLC25A41 has been implicated in interactions with the GPR35 receptor. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) increases the expression of GPR35, which in turn affects the expression of SLC25A41 in endothelial cells. This interaction suggests a role for SLC25A41 in mitochondrial processes mediated by GPR35, potentially enhancing mitochondrial function and ATP content in endothelial cells (Chen2023Kynurenic).

While specific protein complexes involving SLC25A41 are not detailed, its role in ATP-Mg/Pi transport and interaction with GPR35 highlights its importance in cellular energy regulation and response to inflammatory conditions.
