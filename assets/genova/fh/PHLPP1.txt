# PHLPP1

## Overview
PHLPP1 (PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of critical cell signaling pathways. The protein product of PHLPP1 is characterized by its distinct domain structure, which includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a PP2C phosphatase domain, and a PDZ-binding motif. This phosphatase plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by dephosphorylating and inactivating Akt, a key kinase in pathways governing cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Through its regulatory functions, PHLPP1 acts as a tumor suppressor, influencing processes such as apoptosis and cell-cycle progression. The protein is involved in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, and interacts with multiple proteins to modulate its activity and stability. Alterations in PHLPP1 expression have been linked to several cancers, underscoring its clinical significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Warfel2012Pleckstrin; Brognard2007PHLPP; Grzechnik2016PHLPPing).

## Structure
PHLPP1 (PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase characterized by a distinct domain structure. It includes an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a PP2C phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (Warfel2012Pleckstrin). The PH domain is noted for its weak membrane-binding capability due to an incomplete RXRSF motif (Warfel2012Pleckstrin). PHLPP1 also contains type 1 PDZ ligands, specifically TPL, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins (Warfel2012Pleckstrin).

PHLPP1 exists in multiple isoforms, including PHLPP1α and PHLPP1β, which arise from alternative splicing (Warfel2012Pleckstrin). These isoforms share a similar domain structure but may differ in their specific functions and interactions. The phosphatase domain of PHLPP1 is part of the PP2C family, which typically requires divalent cations like Mn2+ or Mg2+ for activity, although PHLPP1 can remain active without these metal cofactors (Sierecki2014Biochemical).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating PHLPP1's activity and stability, impacting its function in cellular signaling pathways (Warfel2012Pleckstrin).

## Function
PHLPP1 (PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by dephosphorylating and inactivating Akt, a key protein involved in cell survival, growth, and proliferation pathways. By dephosphorylating Akt at the Ser473 site, PHLPP1 inhibits Akt kinase activity, promoting apoptosis and controlling cell-cycle progression (Brognard2007PHLPP).

PHLPP1 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the balance between cell survival and apoptosis. It modulates the phosphorylation of downstream targets such as HDM2 and GSK-3a through its interaction with Akt2, influencing processes like cell-cycle progression and glucose homeostasis (Brognard2007PHLPP). PHLPP1 also plays a role in the nucleus, where it affects chromatin structure and gene expression by regulating histone proteins, thereby influencing the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR (Grzechnik2016PHLPPing).

PHLPP1 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its activity is mediated by its PP2C phosphatase domain, which is conserved across PHLPP isoforms (Brognard2007PHLPP). This regulation is essential for preventing excessive cell growth and maintaining normal cellular functions, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Grzechnik2016PHLPPing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PHLPP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer, the loss of PHLPP1 expression is observed in a substantial percentage of tumor tissues, with 78% of cases showing decreased expression compared to normal mucosa. This reduction is associated with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, highlighting PHLPP1's role as a tumor suppressor (Liu2008Loss). In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PHLPP1 expression is linked to better survival outcomes and decreased tumor invasiveness. High levels of PHLPP1 correlate with longer resistance duration to EGFR-TKI treatments, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Xia2023Emerging).

In glioblastoma, the loss of PHLPP1, especially when combined with PTEN loss, leads to significant Akt activation and aggressive tumor growth. This suggests a synergistic effect that is crucial for cancer cell growth, underscoring the importance of the PTEN-NHERF1-PHLPP1 network in tumor suppression (Molina2011PTEN). The dysregulation of PHLPP1, both at the protein and mRNA levels, is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in high-grade glioblastomas (Warfel2012Pleckstrin).

## Interactions
PHLPP1 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in cell signaling. It is known to interact with scaffolding proteins such as FKBP51, Scribble, and NHERF1, which help localize PHLPP1 to Akt, enhancing its ability to dephosphorylate Akt isozymes (Warfel2012Pleckstrin). The interaction with Scribble is particularly important for membrane targeting, which is necessary for the dephosphorylation of Akt and inhibition of cell growth. This interaction is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat domain of Scribble and a specific C-terminal region of PHLPP1 (Li2011Scribble‐mediated).

PHLPP1 is also involved in a complex with WDR48 and USP12, which stabilizes PHLPP1 by promoting its deubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting Akt signaling and promoting apoptosis (Gangula2013WD). Additionally, PHLPP1 is targeted for degradation by the E3 ligase β-TrCP, which facilitates its ubiquitination. This process is regulated by phosphorylation, with CK1 and GSK-3β playing roles in phosphorylating PHLPP1 to enable β-TrCP binding (Li2009βTrCPMediated).
