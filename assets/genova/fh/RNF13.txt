# RNF13

## Overview
RNF13 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 13, a member of the PA-TM-RING family, which is characterized by a protease-associated domain, a transmembrane domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain. This protein functions primarily as a ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the endolysosomal system by facilitating protein ubiquitination, which is essential for protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cabana2021RNF13; Zhang2008RNF13:). RNF13 is involved in various cellular processes, including myogenesis, tumorigenesis, and the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (Edvardson2019Heterozygous; Cabana2021RNF13). The protein's interaction with the AP-3 complex is critical for its lysosomal localization, and mutations in RNF13 can lead to significant disruptions in cellular function, contributing to neurological disorders and cancer progression (Edvardson2019Heterozygous; Cabana2021RNF13).

## Structure
RNF13, or ring finger protein 13, is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of proteins, characterized by a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain (Nakamura2011The). The RING domain is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Cabana2021RNF13). The PA domain is proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions, which is a common feature among members of this protein family (Nakamura2011The).

RNF13 is a 381 amino acid protein that includes a highly conserved dileucine motif within the sequence 309-TPLLRPLASVS-319, which is important for its interaction with the AP-3 complex and lysosomal targeting (Edvardson2019Heterozygous; Cabana2021RNF13). This motif is located on the protein surface and forms a loop between the PEST and Ser-rich sequence motifs (Edvardson2019Heterozygous).

The protein is known to localize to endosomal membranes and is involved in various cellular processes, including myogenesis and tumorigenesis (Cabana2021RNF13). RNF13 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are essential for its function in protein degradation and signal transduction (Lin2023RING).

## Function
RNF13 is a ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the endolysosomal system. It is primarily localized in endosomes and lysosomes, where it is involved in protein ubiquitination, a process crucial for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Cabana2021RNF13; Zhang2008RNF13:). The protein contains a RING finger domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin molecules to target proteins (Zhang2008RNF13:).

RNF13 interacts with the AP-3 complex through a dileucine motif, which is critical for its proper lysosomal localization. This interaction is necessary for the transport of proteins from tubular endosomes to late endosomes and the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (Cabana2021RNF13). In healthy cells, RNF13 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It modulates signaling pathways related to ER stress, which can lead to apoptosis, and is upregulated during neurite outgrowth, indicating its role in neuronal development (Edvardson2019Heterozygous).

Mutations in RNF13, such as the L311S and L312P variants, disrupt its interaction with the AP-3 complex, affecting lysosomal targeting and vesicle morphology, which can impact cellular homeostasis and apoptotic signaling (Cabana2021RNF13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF13 gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. Specifically, heterozygous gain-of-function variants, such as c.932T>C (p.Leu311Ser) and c.935T>C (p.Leu312Pro), have been linked to congenital microcephaly, epileptic encephalopathy, blindness, and failure to thrive. These mutations enhance ER stress signaling and apoptosis, contributing to severe neurodegeneration (Edvardson2019Heterozygous).

In cancer, RNF13 expression is altered in various types. It is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it enhances invasiveness and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Zhang2008RNF13:). Conversely, RNF13 expression is downregulated in uveal melanoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where its low expression is associated with increased tumor proliferation and metastasis (Mo2021Circular; Cabana2022From).

RNF13 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, with its expression upregulated in atherosclerotic plaques. This upregulation is linked to ER stress-induced apoptosis, contributing to plaque instability (Cabana2022From). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of RNF13 in various diseases.

## Interactions
RNF13, a RING finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its cellular functions. It interacts with the adaptor protein complex AP-3, which is crucial for its lysosomal targeting. The dileucine motif (307-EHTPLL-312) in RNF13 is essential for binding to the AP-3 complex. Mutations in this motif, such as L311S and L312P, disrupt the interaction, leading to altered lysosomal localization and increased endolysosomal vesicle size (Cabana2021RNF13).

RNF13 also interacts with IRE1a, a critical sensor in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. This interaction is significant in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, as RNF13 variants can enhance IRE1a-mediated stress signaling and apoptosis (Edvardson2019Heterozygous).

In the context of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), RNF13 facilitates the degradation of the STING protein through ubiquitination-dependent pathways. Although RNF13 does not directly interact with STING, it enhances the stability of TRIM29, a downstream effector, through K63-linked ubiquitination. This primes TRIM29 to accelerate STING degradation, highlighting a complex interaction network involving RNF13, TRIM29, and STING (Lin2023RING).
