# DPP3

## Overview
DPP3 is a gene that encodes the protein dipeptidyl peptidase 3, a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase involved in the final stages of protein catabolism. The protein is characterized by its ability to cleave dipeptides from the N-terminus of substrates, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of oxidative stress and modulation of pain and blood pressure (Matovina2017New; Kaufmann2019A). Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 is primarily located in the cytosol but can associate with membranes, and it is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues (Kaufmann2019A; Matovina2023Identification). The protein's interactions, particularly with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), link it to the NRF2-KEAP1 signaling pathway, a key mechanism in the cellular response to oxidative stress (Matovina2023Identification). DPP3's involvement in disease contexts, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Choy2021Identification; Ye2022DPP3:).

## Structure
The human dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase characterized by its primary structure, which includes conserved sequence motifs crucial for its function. These motifs, HEXXGH and EE*XR(K)AE(D), are essential for zinc ion coordination and catalytic activity (Matovina2017New). The secondary structure of DPP3 features a mixed α and β fold, with a five-stranded β-barrel forming the core of the lower lobe (Kumar2016Substrate). 

In terms of tertiary structure, DPP3 contains a zinc-binding site coordinated by two histidine residues (His-450 and His-455) and a glutamate (Glu-508), with a water molecule completing the coordination (Kumar2016Substrate; Tomić2016Concerted). The enzyme undergoes significant conformational changes upon peptide binding, transitioning between open and closed forms, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kumar2016Substrate; Tomić2016Concerted).

DPP3 functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure (Matovina2017New). The enzyme is primarily cytosolic but can associate with membranes in certain contexts (Kumar2016Substrate). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase involved in the final stages of protein catabolism by cleaving dipeptides from the N-terminus of substrates with three or more amino acids (Matovina2017New; Kaufmann2019A). It is primarily a cytosolic enzyme but can also be membrane-associated and is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues (Kaufmann2019A; Matovina2023Identification). DPP3 plays a significant role in the regulation of oxidative stress through its interaction with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which prevents the degradation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a major regulator of the oxidative stress response (Matovina2023Identification). This interaction links DPP3 to the NRF2-KEAP1 signaling pathway, a key defense mechanism against environmental toxins and carcinogens (Matovina2017New).

DPP3 is also implicated in the modulation of pain and blood pressure, likely due to its ability to degrade peptide hormones such as angiotensin II and enkephalins (Kaufmann2019A; Matovina2023Identification). Despite its known roles, the full physiological functions of DPP3 in healthy human cells are not completely elucidated (Matovina2017New).

## Clinical Significance
Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, DPP3 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and high expression levels are associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting an oncogenic role in cancer progression (Choy2021Identification). DPP3 expression is also an independent determinant of survival in breast cancer patients, alongside treatment and tumor stage (Choy2021Identification).

In multiple myeloma, DPP3 expression is linked to disease progression. High levels of DPP3 correlate with a poorer prognosis, with patients exhibiting shorter overall survival times (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase). The enzyme's expression is differentially regulated between newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, indicating its potential role in disease advancement (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase).

DPP3 is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, where elevated circulating levels are associated with increased mortality risk in acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. The enzyme's interaction with the Renin-Angiotensin System, particularly its ability to hydrolyze Angiotensin II, suggests a role in blood pressure regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2022DPP3:).

## Interactions
Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) is known to interact with several proteins, although its interaction network is not fully characterized. The most well-established interaction is with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the KEAP1-NRF2 oxidative stress response pathway. This interaction prevents the ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2, thereby activating genes involved in oxidative stress response (Matovina2023Identification).

Recent studies have identified SH2 domain-containing protein 3C (SH2D3C) as a novel interactor of DPP3. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays, and it occurs independently of DPP3's enzymatic activity. SH2D3C binds to DPP3 through its C-terminal Ras GEF-like domain, and their colocalization has been observed in the cytosol and membrane ruffles of cells (Matovina2023Identification). The interaction between DPP3 and SH2D3C is suggested to be involved in cell migration control and may link the NRF2-KEAP1 oxidative stress response with the NSP-Cas network (Matovina2023Identification).

Additionally, DPP3 has been reported to interact with CDK1 in colorectal cancer cells, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Tong2021DPP3CDK1). These interactions highlight DPP3's potential role in various cellular processes and its significance in disease contexts.
