# SDHAF4

## Overview
The SDHAF4 gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 4, a mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of Complex II, also known as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is essential for the maturation of the SDHA subunit, a catalytic component of Complex II, by facilitating the proper binding and protection of key components during the assembly process. SDHAF4 is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, which undergoes a transition to a more ordered structure upon interaction with SDHA, a process crucial for the displacement of SDHAF2 and the subsequent assembly of Complex II (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). The functional integrity of SDHAF4 is vital for mitochondrial function and energy production, with its deficiency linked to cardiac pathologies such as dilated cardiomyopathy, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Wang2022Cardiac).

## Structure
The SDHAF4 protein is involved in the maturation of the SDHA subunit of Complex II in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Structurally, SDHAF4 is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature when isolated, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and NMR-based backbone assignments (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). However, upon binding with SDHA, the C-terminal 34 residues of SDHAF4 transition to a more ordered structure, which is crucial for its function in displacing SDHAF2 during the assembly of Complex II (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).

The ordered region of SDHAF4 contains only two short Î²-strands, and its C-terminal residues, particularly D107 and F108, form extensive interactions with SDHA, interacting with SDHA H407 and R451 at the active site (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). These interactions are essential for binding to SDHA and preventing substrate or inhibitor binding during assembly. The intrinsically disordered regions of SDHAF4 facilitate its binding to the SDHA-AF2 complex and support the displacement of SDHAF2 (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).

The protein undergoes a disordered-to-ordered transition, which is part of a multi-step process where SDHAF4 binds to SDHA-AF2, leading to further organization of its C-terminal region (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).

## Function
SDHAF4 is a mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as Complex II, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is involved in the maturation of the SDHA subunit, a catalytic component of Complex II, by forming a protein-protein complex with SDHA. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of Complex II, ensuring the correct binding and protection of key components during the maturation process (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).

SDHAF4 binds to SDHA only when it is flavinylated, meaning it has a covalently attached FAD cofactor. This binding displaces another assembly factor, SDHAF2, which initially binds to SDHA to enhance the covalent attachment of FAD. The sequential binding of these assembly factors is crucial for the proper assembly of SDHA into Complex II (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).

In cardiac cells, SDHAF4 is essential for the proper assembly of Complex II, which is vital for mitochondrial function and energy production. Its absence leads to disrupted complex assembly, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiac pathologies such as dilated cardiomyopathy (Wang2022Cardiac). SDHAF4's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and metabolic homeostasis is critical for cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the SDHAF4 gene have been implicated in several cardiac conditions, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocardial infarction (MI). SDHAF4 is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial complex II, and its deficiency leads to impaired complex II activity, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and excess mitochondrial protein oxidation. These changes occur before any significant structural alterations in the heart, suggesting that complex II dysfunction is an early event in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Wang2022Cardiac). In mice, the loss of SDHAF4 results in disrupted complex II assembly, metabolic dysfunction, and excessive mitophagy, ultimately leading to DCM and heart failure (Wang2022Cardiac). 

The deficiency of SDHAF4 also causes increased phosphorylation of Drp1 due to ERK pathway activation, which is induced by mitochondrial oxidative stress. This results in mitochondrial dysfunction and altered gene expression, potentially through epigenetic changes (Wang2022Cardiac). Interventions targeting mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics, such as fumarate supplementation, have shown improvements in cardiac function in Sdhaf4 mutant mice, although they do not completely reverse DCM progression (Wang2022Cardiac). These findings highlight the critical role of SDHAF4 in maintaining cardiac health and its potential involvement in cardiac pathologies.

## Interactions
SDHAF4 interacts with several proteins as part of its role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex II, also known as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). It forms a protein-protein complex with the SDHA subunit, which is crucial for the assembly and maturation of complex II. The interaction involves conserved residues, with the C-terminal residues of SDHAF4, D107 and F108, playing a significant role in binding to the active site of SDHA. These interactions prevent the binding of substrates or inhibitors to SDHA during assembly, protecting the FAD from solvent exposure and preventing catalysis and reactive oxygen species formation (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).

SDHAF4 also interacts with SDHAF2 during the maturation of SDHA. It displaces SDHAF2 from SDHA, forming a new intermediate complex, SDHA-AF4. This transition involves changes in the intrinsic disorder of the assembly factors, which are crucial for the transfer of SDHA between complexes (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered). The interactions between SDHAF4 and SDHA are further characterized by the binding of SDHAF4 to SDHA after the covalent attachment of FAD, indicating a specific sequence in the assembly process (Sharma2022Disorderedtoordered).
