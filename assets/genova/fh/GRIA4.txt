# GRIA4

## Overview
The GRIA4 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 4 (GluA4), a critical component of AMPA receptors, which are a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors. These receptors are pivotal in mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The GluA4 protein is a transmembrane receptor subunit that forms part of the tetrameric structure of AMPA receptors, facilitating the flow of ions such as sodium and calcium into neurons upon glutamate binding. This ion flow is essential for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory processes (Traynelis2010Glutamate). The expression of GluA4 is notably high in the brain regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in the development and function of excitatory synapses (Hansen2021Structure). The GRIA4 gene's involvement in neurological disorders, such as absence epilepsy, underscores its clinical significance, as alterations in this gene can lead to synaptic dysfunction and disease (Paz2011A).

## Structure
The GRIA4 gene encodes the GluA4 subunit of AMPA receptors, which are integral to synaptic communication in the central nervous system. The protein structure includes several domains: the amino-terminal domain (ATD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), transmembrane domain (TMD), and carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) (Wang2022Novel; Traynelis2010Glutamate). The TMD consists of three transmembrane helices (M1, M3, M4) and a re-entrant loop (M2), forming part of the ion channel pore (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

The primary structure of GRIA4 includes a sequence of 902 amino acids in its canonical isoform, with a shorter isoform of 433 amino acids that differs at the C-terminal sequence (VegaBenedetti2021Colorectal). The secondary structure features alpha helices, particularly in the transmembrane regions, such as the M3 segment, which contains a conserved SYTANLAAF motif crucial for gating (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

The quaternary structure of GRIA4 involves a tetrameric assembly with other AMPA receptor subunits, forming a dimer of dimers (Traynelis2010Glutamate). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate receptor function, and alternative splicing produces isoforms that may affect receptor properties and localization (Chen2001Identifications).

## Function
The GRIA4 gene encodes the GluA4 subunit of AMPA receptors, which are integral to fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. These receptors are tetrameric assemblies that mediate excitatory neurotransmission by allowing sodium and calcium ions to flow into neurons upon glutamate binding, influencing synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Traynelis2010Glutamate). GluA4 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, where it plays a critical role in excitatory synaptic transmission (Hansen2021Structure).

In the hippocampus, GluA4 is transiently expressed postnatally in pyramidal neurons, contributing significantly to the development of excitatory synapses and synaptic plasticity, although its expression decreases in adulthood (Hansen2021Structure). In the cerebellum, GluA4 forms part of heteromeric GluA2/4 receptors in granule cells, mediating excitatory postsynaptic currents at mossy-fiber synapses (Hansen2021Structure). The GluA4 subunit is also involved in corticothalamic transmission, particularly in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, where it maintains synaptic strength and kinetics, crucial for normal thalamic function and preventing hyperexcitability (Paz2011A). The phosphorylation of GluA4 influences receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity, highlighting its role in modulating receptor function (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRIA4 gene, which encodes the GluA4 subunit of AMPA receptors, have been implicated in several neurological disorders, most notably absence epilepsy. In Gria4-deficient mice, the absence of the GluA4 subunit leads to a specific reduction in corticothalamic to nucleus reticularis thalami (CT-nRT) synaptic strength, resulting in thalamic hyperexcitability and the occurrence of absence epileptic seizures. This synaptic alteration disrupts the normal shunting of direct corticothalamic to thalamocortical excitation, leading to robust activation of thalamocortical cells and initiating aberrant network oscillations characteristic of absence seizures (Paz2011A).

The genetic complexity of GRIA4-related absence epilepsy is further highlighted by the identification of genetic modifiers, such as Pcnxl2, which can influence the severity of spike-wave discharges (SWD) in Gria4 mutant mice. These modifiers can alter the disease phenotype, suggesting that the interaction between GRIA4 and other genetic factors plays a significant role in the manifestation of absence epilepsy (Frankel2014Unraveling).

In addition to its role in epilepsy, GRIA4 has been associated with colorectal cancer. The gene is frequently methylated in colorectal cancer samples, leading to its down-regulation, which may contribute to cancer pathogenesis (Hauptman2019Genes).
