# SEMA3C

## Overview
SEMA3C is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3C, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axon guidance and cell signaling. Semaphorin 3C is a secreted protein characterized by a sema domain, a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, which facilitate its interaction with neuropilin and plexin receptors (Valdembri2016Class; Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). This protein is involved in various biological processes, including endothelial cell function, adipose tissue biology, and lung development. It plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and migration, and is implicated in cancer progression through its interactions with receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (Hui2019Semaphorin; Banu2006Semaphorin). The clinical significance of semaphorin 3C is underscored by its association with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2022SEMA3C; Hui2019Semaphorin).

## Structure
SEMA3C, a member of the semaphorin family, is characterized by a conserved molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of SEMA3C features a sema domain, which is approximately 500 amino acids long and folds into a seven-blade β-propeller structure. This domain is crucial for the protein's function in axon guidance and cell signaling (Valdembri2016Class; Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). Following the sema domain, SEMA3C contains a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, which contribute to its interaction with receptors (Valdembri2016Class).

The tertiary structure of SEMA3C is defined by the folding of these domains, which facilitates its interaction with neuropilin and plexin receptors. The quaternary structure involves oligomerization, which is essential for its biological activity. SEMA3C can form stable disulfide-linked heterodimers with other semaphorins, such as SEMA3A (Rozbesky2019Diversity).

Post-translational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage, are important for SEMA3C's activation and function. The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor and becomes active upon cleavage, which is necessary for its role in repulsive axon guidance (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins).

## Function
Semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in endothelial cell function and adipose tissue biology. In endothelial cells, SEMA3C acts as a positive regulator by enhancing cell survival, proliferation, adhesion, migration, and tube formation. It achieves these effects by increasing integrin activity, especially β1 integrin, through phosphorylation, which is crucial for cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen I substrates. This activity is independent of VEGF-A, although SEMA3C induces VEGF 120 secretion, contributing to vascular development and maintenance (Banu2006Semaphorin).

In adipose tissue, SEMA3C is identified as a novel adipokine, with its expression regulated by body weight changes. It is predominantly expressed in adipocytes and is associated with insulin resistance and fat-cell morphology. SEMA3C influences the expression of extracellular matrix components and inflammatory genes, suggesting a role in ECM remodeling and inflammation in adipose tissue (Mejhert2013Semaphorin).

SEMA3C is also involved in lung development and repair, where it supports alveolar growth and protects against oxygen-induced toxicity. It maintains pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell network formation and reduces inflammation, highlighting its protective role in lung health (Vadivel2013The).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA3C (semaphorin 3C) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, SEMA3C promotes cancer recurrence and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy, contributing to tumor relapse and metastasis by enhancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell characteristics (Hui2019Semaphorin). High SEMA3C expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including glioma, breast, lung, liver, pancreatic, gastric, gynecological, and prostate cancers, due to its role in activating multiple receptor tyrosine kinase pathways that support angiogenesis, cell growth, survival, and metastasis (Hui2019Semaphorin).

In pancreatic cancer, SEMA3C is upregulated, particularly in cases with the KRAS G12D mutation, and is linked to decreased survival rates. It promotes tumor growth by inducing autophagy and modifying the tumor immune microenvironment, affecting PD-L1 expression and macrophage polarization (Zhang2022SEMA3C). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SEMA3C is involved in stromal remodeling and extracellular matrix regulation, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to treatments like sorafenib (Peng2024Semaphorin). These findings suggest that SEMA3C is a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types due to its significant role in tumorigenesis and progression.

## Interactions
SEMA3C interacts with several proteins, primarily through its binding to neuropilin (NRP) and plexin receptors. It binds to both NRP1 and NRP2, which are necessary for the functional transduction of its signal. This interaction is crucial for processes such as axonal guidance and cancer progression (Sharma2012Receptor). SEMA3C also forms complexes with plexin receptors, including PLXNA2, PLXNA4, PLXNB1, and PLXND1, which mediate its signaling pathways. These interactions are significant in cancer, as they are often overexpressed and associated with tumor invasion and metastasis (Hao2018Semaphorin; Hui2019Semaphorin).

In cancer cells, SEMA3C can transactivate multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways, such as EGFR, HER2, and MET, through its interaction with Plexin B1. This transactivation occurs in a ligand-independent manner, contributing to resistance against RTK-targeted therapies (Hui2019Semaphorin; Bhasin2023Dependency). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SEMA3C interacts with neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), activating hepatic stellate cells and promoting extracellular matrix remodeling (Peng2024Semaphorin). These interactions highlight SEMA3C's role in modulating various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
