# EGR3

## Overview
EGR3 (early growth response 3) is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is part of the Egr family. The EGR3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, which plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to various physiological stimuli. As a transcription factor, EGR3 is involved in critical cellular processes, including immune response modulation and neural development. It is particularly significant in the immune system, where it regulates T and B cell activation and helps prevent autoimmune diseases by promoting anergy and maintaining immune homeostasis (Collins2008Opposing; Morita2016Egr2). In the nervous system, EGR3 contributes to synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, with its expression being induced by neuronal activity (Poirier2008Distinct). Dysregulation of EGR3 has been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, as well as autoimmune conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2012The; Marballi2022Identification).

## Structure
The EGR3 protein is a member of the Egr family of transcription factors, characterized by its zinc finger DNA-binding domain. This domain consists of three tandem zinc finger motifs located near the carboxyl terminus, which are highly conserved and homologous to other Cys2His2 zinc finger transcription factors, such as zif268 and Egr2 (Yamagata1994Egr3Pilot; Beckmann1997Egr). Each zinc finger contains a beta-sheet domain in the amino-terminal region and an alpha-helical domain in the carboxyl half, with a zinc ion chelated by two histidines and two cysteines (Yamagata1994Egr3Pilot).

The primary structure of EGR3 includes an abundance of proline, serine, and alanine residues in the non-finger domain, which are typical of activator domains in transcription factors (Yamagata1994Egr3Pilot). The zinc finger region is crucial for DNA binding, recognizing the consensus DNA-binding motif GCG(G/T)GGGCG, known as the GSG motif or EBS (Beckmann1997Egr).

EGR3 is a nuclear phosphoprotein, indicating that phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification, which may regulate its activity and function (Yamagata1994Egr3Pilot). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
EGR3 (early growth response 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular and organismal processes. In the immune system, EGR3 is crucial for the regulation of T and B cell activation and the prevention of autoimmune diseases. It is involved in the induction of anergy, a state of T cell non-responsiveness, by promoting the expression of negative regulators like Cbl-b and inhibiting activators such as Egr-1 and NAB2 (Collins2008Opposing). EGR3 is also essential for the proper functioning of regulatory T cells, where it cooperates with Egr2 to control systemic autoimmunity through the production of TGF-β3, which is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis (Morita2016Egr2).

In the nervous system, EGR3 is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory processes. It is highly expressed in certain cortical layers and hippocampal pyramidal cells, where it is induced by neuronal stimulation, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) induction or exposure to novel environments (Poirier2008Distinct). EGR3 mutant mice exhibit motor abnormalities and memory deficits, highlighting its role in neural development and cognitive functions (Poirier2008Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EGR3 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. EGR3 is considered a master regulator in conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. In schizophrenia, EGR3 is not located at risk loci but interacts with other EGR family members that are. Studies have shown genetic associations of EGR3 with schizophrenia, including decreased expression in patients and its role as a central gene in networks associated with schizophrenia risk (Marballi2022Identification). EGR3 is also crucial for regulating genes involved in synaptic function, which is significant in Alzheimer's disease (Marballi2022Identification).

In the immune system, EGR3, along with EGR2, is essential for controlling inflammation and antigen-induced proliferation of B and T cells. Deficiencies in these transcription factors can lead to severe inflammatory autoimmune diseases, characterized by excessive proinflammatory cytokines and impaired immune cell proliferation (Li2012The). EGR3 is also involved in the regulation of TGF-β3 production, which is necessary for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing systemic autoimmunity (Morita2016Egr2).

Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in EGR3 have been associated with coronary artery disease in certain populations, suggesting a role in cardiovascular health (Li2014Association).

## Interactions
EGR3 (early growth response 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses. EGR3 interacts with NF-κB proteins, specifically p50 and p65, forming complexes that significantly enhance the transcriptional activity of inflammatory gene promoters such as IL-2, TNF-α, and ICAM-1. These interactions are more potent than those of p65 homodimers or p50-p65 heterodimers, highlighting the synergistic effect of EGR3-p65 complexes (Wieland2005Early).

The zinc-finger domain of EGR3 is essential for its interaction with NF-κB p65, facilitating nuclear translocation and DNA binding. This domain is localized to a 14 amino acid sequence within the third zinc-finger, which is crucial for its interaction with p65 (Wieland2005Early). EGR3 also interacts with NF-kB p65 in the context of allergic inflammation, where p65 binds to the promoter sequences of EGR3, suggesting a regulatory feedback loop (Kwon2021EGR3HDAC6IL27).

EGR3 is involved in the regulation of other proteins, such as HDAC6, by binding to its promoter sequences, which is crucial for mediating allergic inflammation (Kwon2021EGR3HDAC6IL27). These interactions underscore the role of EGR3 in modulating immune responses through complex protein interactions.
