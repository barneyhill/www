# KCNK18

## Overview
The KCNK18 gene encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 18, commonly known as the TRESK channel. This channel is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability by facilitating potassium ion flow across cell membranes. TRESK is predominantly expressed in primary sensory neurons, particularly within the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, where it contributes to neuronal signaling and muscle function. The channel is activated by cytoplasmic calcium signals through the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, and is modulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues. Mutations in KCNK18 have been linked to neurological disorders, including familial migraine with aura and neurodevelopmental conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Czirják2004The; Pavinato2021KCNK18; Rainero2014KCNK18; Lengyel2017Selective).

## Structure
The KCNK18 gene encodes the TRESK channel, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The TRESK channel is composed of 384 amino acids and features a typical K2P channel structure with four transmembrane helices and two pore-forming domains, with both N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Pavinato2021KCNK18; Enyedi2014Properties). A distinctive structural feature of TRESK is its long intracellular loop, over 120 amino acids, between the second and third transmembrane segments, which is longer than that of other K2P channels. This loop contains key modulatory sites, including phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and calcineurin binding motifs (Pavinato2021KCNK18). The C-terminal tail of TRESK is relatively short, consisting of only 30 amino acids, compared to the longer tails found in other K2P channels (Enyedi2014Properties).

The TRESK channel undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. Phosphorylation occurs at specific sites, including Ser252 and a serine cluster (Ser262, Ser264, and Ser267), which are crucial for the channel's activation and inhibition (Pavinato2021KCNK18). The channel can form functional dimers, a common feature among K2P channels, to facilitate its role in maintaining the resting membrane potential (Enyedi2014Properties).

## Function
The KCNK18 gene encodes the TRESK potassium channel, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. This channel is involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability by facilitating potassium ion flow across the cell membrane. TRESK is primarily expressed in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, where it contributes to the background potassium conductance, influencing neuronal signaling and muscle function (AndresEnguix2012Functional; Lengyel2017Selective).

TRESK channels are activated by cytoplasmic calcium signals through the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. This activation mechanism is crucial for the channel's role in cellular responses to calcium signaling, which is relevant to its function in healthy human cells (Czirják2004The). The channel's activity is modulated by specific serine residues, which are constitutively phosphorylated under resting conditions, leading to low channel activity. An increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration can activate TRESK, thereby stabilizing the resting membrane potential and regulating neuronal excitability (Lengyel2017Selective).

In the immune system, KCNK18 plays a critical role in the development of thymic regulatory T cells (tTregs) by facilitating sustained calcium influx necessary for the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and NFAT, which are essential for the induction and stabilization of FoxP3 expression, a key marker for tTreg development (Ruck2021K2P18.1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNK18 gene, which encodes the TRESK potassium channel, have been associated with several neurological disorders, most notably familial migraine with aura. Specific mutations, such as the frameshift mutation F139Wfsx24, result in a complete loss of TRESK channel function and have been linked to typical migraine with aura (Imbrici2020Altered; Rainero2014KCNK18). Other missense variants, including C110R, S178T, S231P, and F372L, have been identified in migraine patients and are suggested to potentially damage channel function, although their exact role in migraine predisposition remains complex and requires further investigation (AndresEnguix2012Functional; Rainero2014KCNK18).

Beyond migraine, KCNK18 mutations have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Biallelic missense variants such as p.Tyr163Asp and p.Ser252Leu have been found in individuals with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, indicating that impaired TRESK channel activity may contribute to these conditions (Pavinato2021KCNK18). The W101R variant has also been associated with both migraine and intellectual disability, suggesting a broader impact of KCNK18 mutations on neurological health (Imbrici2020Altered). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNK18 in various neurological and developmental disorders.
