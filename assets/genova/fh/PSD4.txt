# PSD4

## Overview
PSD4 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 4, which is a member of the EFA6 family and functions as an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This protein plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of ARF6, a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking. PSD4 is implicated in the modulation of the CDC42/PAK1 axis and the DDR1/PSD4/ARF6 signaling pathway, which are critical for the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Zhang2022DDR1; Shi2021TNF‐αNF‐κB). Additionally, the expression of PSD4 is subject to epigenetic regulation, with its transcription being repressed in certain cancer contexts, such as alcohol-related HCC, through mechanisms involving TNF-α/NF-κB signaling (Shi2021TNF‐αNF‐κB). The protein's involvement in cancer progression and its regulatory mechanisms make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSD4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer. In HCC, high levels of PSD4 expression are associated with poor prognosis, characterized by lower overall survival rates and increased recurrence. PSD4 promotes HCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis by enhancing ARF6 activation and MAPK signaling pathways, which include the phosphorylation of P38, ERK, and c-jun (Zhang2022DDR1). The interaction between DDR1 and PSD4 is crucial for ARF6 activation, forming a DDR1/PSD4/ARF6 signaling axis that regulates HCC progression (Zhang2022DDR1).

In breast cancer, PSD4, through its encoded protein EFA6B, is downregulated in invasive ductal carcinoma compared to ductal carcinoma in situ. This downregulation correlates with increased invasiveness and is linked to higher pathological grades and shorter disease-free survival (Racha2020EFA6B). The loss of EFA6B expression contributes to the transition from in-situ to invasive lesions, providing a pro-invasive advantage (Racha2020EFA6B).

In alcohol-related HCC, PSD4 is hypermethylated and repressed, which is associated with worse overall survival. This repression is mediated by TNF-α/NF-κB signaling, which increases promoter methylation, leading to PSD4 downregulation (Shi2021TNF‐αNF‐κB).

## Interactions
PSD4, a member of the EFA6 family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF6, playing a role in the regulation of the CDC42/PAK1 axis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Overexpression of PSD4 reduces the binding of CDC42 to PAK1's CDC42 binding domain, thereby decreasing PAK1 phosphorylation, while knockdown of PSD4 enhances these interactions (Shi2021TNF‐αNF‐κB).

PSD4 also interacts with Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) and ARF6, forming a complex that contributes to ARF6 activation. DDR1 recruits PSD4 to ARF6, facilitating sustained ARF6 and MAPK signaling activation, which enhances the migration, invasion, and metastasis of HCC cells (Zhang2022DDR1). This interaction highlights the role of PSD4 in the DDR1/PSD4/ARF6 signaling axis, which is crucial for HCC metastatic progression (Zhang2022DDR1).

In the context of alcohol-related HCC, PSD4 transcription is epigenetically repressed by TNF-α/NF-κB signaling. Phosphorylated p65 recruits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to the PSD4 promoter, enhancing DNA methylation and transcriptional repression (Shi2021TNF‐αNF‐κB).
