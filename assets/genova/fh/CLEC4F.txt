# CLEC4F

## Overview
CLEC4F is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 4 member F protein, a type II transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in the liver. This protein is part of the C-type lectin receptor family, characterized by its ability to bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner. The CLEC4F protein features a trimeric structure with a distinct orientation between its carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) and neck region, facilitating its role in glycan recognition and binding (Ouyang2019Trimeric). Functionally, CLEC4F is involved in the clearance of desialylated platelets, playing a significant role in immune responses and conditions such as sepsis and immune thrombocytopenia (Jiang2021Kupffer). Additionally, its expression is linked to immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma, although its expression is notably reduced in cancerous liver tissues compared to normal ones (Zhang2021CLEC4s). Despite its established roles in murine models, the functionality of CLEC4F in humans remains under investigation, with some evidence suggesting its presence in human liver tissue (Jiang2021Kupffer).

## Structure
The CLEC4F protein, a C-type lectin receptor, is characterized by a trimeric structure with a unique orientation between its carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) and neck region. This orientation results in a 45 Å distance between glycan-binding sites within the trimer (Ouyang2019Trimeric). The protein consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic signaling domain, a hydrophobic single transmembrane helix, a heptad repeat neck domain, and a CRD (Ouyang2019Trimeric). The heptad repeat neck domain is notably longer than that of related lectins like Langerin and features a polyglutamine stack interface, which forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, contributing to the stability of the trimeric structure (Ouyang2019Trimeric).

The CRD of CLEC4F recognizes glycans in a calcium-dependent manner, with two conserved calcium-binding sites identified in its structure (Ouyang2019Trimeric). The primary glycan-Ca2+ binding site is largely conserved, with a QPD sequence that favors binding to galactose and GalNAc (Ouyang2019Trimeric). The protein's structure provides insights into the evolution and diversity of type II C-type lectin families (Ouyang2019Trimeric).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC4F is implicated in the clearance of desialylated platelets, a process relevant in conditions such as sepsis and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In sepsis, bacterial neuraminidases increase platelet clearance in the liver, a process mediated by CLEC4F. In ITP, autoantibodies induce endogenous neuraminidase secretion, leading to desialylated platelet clearance via CLEC4F (Jiang2021Kupffer). The gene's role in these conditions suggests its involvement in thrombocytopenia-related disorders, where platelet clearance is altered (Jiang2021Kupffer).

CLEC4F expression is also associated with the immune response in the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its expression correlates with the infiltration of various immune cells, indicating a potential role in immune regulation within tumors (Zhang2021CLEC4s). However, CLEC4F expression is significantly lower in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues, suggesting a possible involvement in hepatocarcinogenesis (Zhang2021CLEC4s).

While CLEC4F is expressed in human liver samples, mutations may render it non-functional in humans, although some evidence suggests its presence in human liver tissue (Jiang2021Kupffer). Further research is needed to explore its functions and potential compensatory mechanisms in humans.
