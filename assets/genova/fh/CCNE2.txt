# CCNE2

## Overview
The CCNE2 gene encodes cyclin E2, a regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle progression, particularly during the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Cyclin E2 is a member of the cyclin family, which is characterized by periodic fluctuations in protein levels throughout the cell cycle. It functions primarily by forming a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), thereby facilitating the phosphorylation of key substrates involved in cell cycle regulation. This interaction is crucial for the initiation of DNA replication and centrosome duplication. Cyclin E2 is expressed in various tissues and is notably involved in liver regeneration and other physiological processes. Beyond its role in normal cell cycle regulation, cyclin E2 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to certain therapies (Milioli2020Cyclin; Fagundes2021Cyclin; Caldon2010Distinct).

## Function
Cyclin E2, encoded by the CCNE2 gene, is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, particularly during the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. It forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), which phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to the release of E2F transcription factors. This release promotes the expression of genes necessary for DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Caldon2010Distinct; Fagundes2021Cyclin). Cyclin E2 is involved in the formation of pre-replication complexes and the activation of CDK2, which are essential for DNA synthesis and centrosome duplication (Caldon2010Distinct).

Cyclin E2 is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the testes and moderate levels in the brain, intestine, muscle, and thymus. It plays a role in liver regeneration, where its expression is associated with increased hepatocyte polyploidy (Caldon2010Distinct). Cyclin E2 also has roles independent of CDK2, such as facilitating the loading of MCM replicative helicases in cells exiting quiescence (Milioli2020Cyclin). Its activity is regulated through phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, although the specifics of its degradation are less understood compared to cyclin E1 (Fagundes2021Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Cyclin E2 (CCNE2) plays a significant role in breast cancer, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and genomic instability. High levels of CCNE2 are associated with genome doubling, a process contributing to aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in cancer cells (Lee2020Cyclin). In breast cancer, CCNE2 is more prognostically significant than cyclin E1, being part of gene signatures that predict disease progression, particularly in metastatic cases (Lee2020Cyclin). 

CCNE2 is also implicated in endocrine resistance in ER-positive breast cancer. Its high expression is associated with poor outcomes and resistance to therapies like tamoxifen and CDK4/6 inhibitors (Milioli2020Cyclin). The gene's amplification is notably prevalent in luminal B ER+ breast cancers, which are often resistant to endocrine therapy (Milioli2020Cyclin).

In the context of estrogen plus progestogen therapy, CCNE2 expression is significantly upregulated, suggesting its role as a risk indicator for breast cancer in women undergoing menopausal hormone therapy (Deng2022Identification). This upregulation is linked to poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer patients (Deng2022Identification).

## Interactions
Cyclin E2 (CCNE2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. CCNE2 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) to form active kinase complexes that are essential for the G1/S-phase transition in the cell cycle (Caldon2009Estrogen). These complexes also interact with CDK inhibitors such as p21 Waf1/Cip1 and p27 Kip1, which modulate their activity (Caldon2009Estrogen).

CCNE2 is regulated by the chromatin remodeling factor CHD8, which binds to the 5' region of the CCNE2 gene and interacts with elongating RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcriptional elongation (RodríguezParedes2009The). CHD8's role in CCNE2 expression is crucial, as its depletion leads to reduced CCNE2 levels (RodríguezParedes2009The).

In breast cancer, CCNE2 interacts with the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic stability (Deng2022Identification). It also acts downstream of HMGA1 in the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing the localization and activity of YAP, a key regulator of cell motility and invasiveness (Pegoraro2015A). These interactions highlight CCNE2's involvement in both cell cycle regulation and cancer metastasis.
