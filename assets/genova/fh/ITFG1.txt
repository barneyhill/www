# ITFG1

## Overview
The ITFG1 gene encodes the protein integrin alpha FG-GAP repeat containing 1, also known as LINKIN, which is a transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cell migration, particularly in the context of cancer progression. LINKIN is known to interact with proteins such as RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, which are part of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, and α-tubulin, highlighting its involvement in cellular processes that connect cell junctions to the cytoskeleton (Tan2023LINKINassociated; Kato2014LINKIN). The ITFG1 gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in the collective invasion of breast cancer cells, making them potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The ITFG1 gene, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling, has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. Alterations in the expression of ITFG1, particularly its interaction with the RUVBL1 protein, play a significant role in the collective invasion of breast cancer cells. This process involves cancer cells invading surrounding tissues as a group, which is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1). High levels of ITFG1, in conjunction with RUVBL1, are linked to increased cancer cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that these proteins may serve as potential therapeutic targets (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1).

The RUVBL1-ITFG1 complex is crucial for maintaining cell-cell junctions during collective invasion, a process that occurs independently of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1). Knockdown experiments have demonstrated that reducing the expression of either RUVBL1 or ITFG1 significantly impairs the collective invasion ability of breast cancer cells, highlighting the importance of this interaction in cancer progression (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1). These findings suggest that targeting the RUVBL1-ITFG1 interaction could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating invasive breast cancer (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1).

## Interactions
The ITFG1 protein, also known as LINKIN, is involved in several significant protein interactions that play a crucial role in cell adhesion and migration processes. ITFG1 interacts with RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, which are part of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, indicating that they occur at the plasma membrane. This suggests a role for ITFG1 in cell adhesion processes, particularly in gonadal cell adhesion (Tan2023LINKINassociated; Kato2014LINKIN).

In breast cancer cells, the interaction between ITFG1 and RUVBL1 is essential for collective invasion, a process critical for metastatic progression. This interaction is not affected by the RUVBL1 (D302N) mutation, highlighting its robustness and potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1).

ITFG1 also interacts with α-tubulin, which further supports its role in cell adhesion by connecting the junction to the microtubule cytoskeleton (Tan2023LINKINassociated). These interactions underline the importance of ITFG1 in maintaining tissue integrity during collective cell migration and its potential involvement in membrane remodeling and chromosome biology (Tan2023LINKINassociated).
