# THRSP

## Overview
The THRSP gene encodes the thyroid hormone responsive protein, commonly referred to as Spot 14, which is a nuclear protein involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. This protein is predominantly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and mammary glands, where it functions as a transcriptional activator, regulating the expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Structurally, THRSP is characterized by its propensity for homodimerization and contains three antiparallel α-helices, with its C-terminal region playing a role in transactivation activity. The protein's expression is modulated by insulin, thyroid hormones, and dietary substrates, highlighting its role in metabolic processes. THRSP is also implicated in various signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as breast cancer and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Custodio2021Low; Ahonen2022Insulininducible; Zhang2011Expression).

## Structure
The thyroid hormone responsive protein (THRSP), also known as Spot 14, is a 17 kDa acidic protein with a strong propensity for homodimerization. It is characterized by its involvement in the regulation of lipogenic enzyme genes, particularly in tissues active in long-chain fatty-acid synthesis such as the liver, adipose tissue, and lactating mammary glands (Zhang2011Expression). The protein's structure includes three antiparallel α-helices, and its C-terminal region is involved in transactivation activity (Zhang2011Expression). 

Crystallization studies of human THRSP and its N-terminally truncated form have been conducted, with the full-length protein crystallizing in space group P4 1 2 1 2 and the truncated form in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1. The molecular-replacement solution indicated the presence of six molecules per asymmetric unit, comprising three THRSP homodimers (Zhang2011Expression). These structural insights aim to elucidate the structure-function relationship of THRSP, particularly in understanding its role in cancer and as a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2011Expression). 

The context does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or other structural features such as prominent folds.

## Function
The THRSP gene encodes the thyroid hormone responsive protein, also known as Spot 14, which plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells. This nuclear protein is highly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and mammary glands, where it is involved in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis. THRSP functions as a transcriptional activator, modulating the expression of genes encoding enzymes critical for fatty acid synthesis, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) (Kuemmerle2011THRSP; Wellberg2014Modulation).

In adipocytes, THRSP is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and regulating sphingolipid metabolism. It influences mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, which are essential for energy homeostasis and metabolic health (Ahonen2022Insulininducible). The protein's expression is regulated by insulin, thyroid hormones, and dietary substrates, and it is particularly responsive to insulin in individuals with high insulin sensitivity (Ahonen2022Insulininducible). THRSP's activity is linked to the regulation of lipid homeostasis and the mediation of insulin's effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism, highlighting its importance in metabolic processes (Ahonen2022Insulininducible).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the THRSP gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. Overexpression of THRSP in mice has been linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms, particularly inattention and memory impairment. This is associated with low striatal T3 levels, despite normal circulating thyroid hormone levels, suggesting a localized brain-specific deficiency. The study indicates that THRSP overexpression may serve as a model for the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD, with potential implications for understanding the disorder's pathology and treatment (Custodio2021Low).

In the context of cancer, THRSP, also known as Spot 14, is involved in lipid metabolism and has been associated with breast cancer progression. High expression levels of THRSP are linked to enhanced tumor lipogenesis and poor prognosis in breast cancer. The gene is located at 11q13.5, a region often amplified in aggressive breast cancers, and its expression is found in the majority of breast cancer-derived cell lines (CUNNINGHAM1998“Spot). In mouse models, THRSP overexpression has been shown to influence tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its role in modulating fatty acid metabolism and signaling pathways in cancer biology (Wellberg2014Modulation).

## Interactions
The thyroid hormone responsive protein (THRSP), also known as Spot 14, is involved in various protein interactions that influence metabolic pathways. THRSP interacts with the thyroid receptor (TR) to regulate the expression of genes such as the malic enzyme, which is involved in lipogenesis. This interaction suggests that THRSP may act as a transcription cofactor, influencing the transcription and translation of genes like p21, a p53 target gene, through its association with TR or other p53 coactivators such as Zac1 (Zhang2011Expression).

In the context of Wnt signaling, THRSP overexpression in mouse models has been linked to the upregulation of proteins such as catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and casein kinase 1 alpha-1 (CSNK1A1). These proteins are part of the Wnt signaling pathway, and their upregulation may disrupt normal signaling, potentially leading to neurological disorders (Custodio2023Hippocampal). The study also highlights the involvement of THRSP in the regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity, which affects β-catenin expression, indicating a role in the modulation of Wnt signaling pathways (Custodio2023Hippocampal). These interactions suggest that THRSP plays a significant role in both metabolic and signaling pathways.
