# SAMD3

## Overview
SAMD3 is a gene that encodes the protein sterile alpha motif domain containing 3, which is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. This domain is known for its role in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The SAMD3 protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and has been implicated in several signaling pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is important for cellular development and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of SAMD3 is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease.
