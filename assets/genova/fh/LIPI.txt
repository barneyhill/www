# LIPI

## Overview
LIPI is a gene that encodes the enzyme lipase I, which is a member of the phospholipase family. This enzyme is involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of phospholipids to generate lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. Lipase I plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including membrane remodeling and signal transduction. The activity of lipase I is significant in the context of metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases, where dysregulation of lipid metabolism is often observed. Understanding the function and regulation of the LIPI gene and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
