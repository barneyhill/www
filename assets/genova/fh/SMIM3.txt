# SMIM3

## Overview
SMIM3, or small integral membrane protein 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein product of SMIM3 is implicated in the regulation of protein-protein interactions, particularly in astrocytes under stress conditions, where it serves as a key hub within the protein-protein interaction network (GonzálezGiraldo2021Common). Additionally, SMIM3 has been associated with osteoarthritis pathophysiology through its correlation with multiple plasma microRNAs, suggesting a role in disease mechanisms (Ramos2021Circulating). In the context of cancer, SMIM3 is part of a gene signature linked to extra-capsular spread in oral squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its potential utility in prognostic assessments (Wang2015An).

## Interactions
SMIM3 (small integral membrane protein 3) has been identified as a key hub protein within significant modules of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in astrocytes responding to stressful stimuli. In a study using the NetworkAnalyst program, SMIM3 was highlighted as a main hub in the second module of the PPI network, which consisted of 136 nodes and 11 queries, indicating its potential importance in the network of protein interactions (GonzálezGiraldo2021Common).

In the context of osteoarthritis (OA), SMIM3 was one of the genes strongly correlating with at least 10 different plasma microRNAs (miRNAs), specifically correlating with 17 miRNAs. This suggests a potential role in OA pathophysiology, although the study did not find significantly more protein-protein interactions than expected by chance for the genes, including SMIM3, that correlated with miRNAs (Ramos2021Circulating).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), SMIM3 is part of an 11-gene signature associated with extra-capsular spread (ECS). This signature is hypothesized to be prognostic for ECS in node-negative tumors, potentially identifying tumors with a propensity for ECS before nodal metastasis is detected. However, specific protein interactions of SMIM3 in this context were not detailed (Wang2015An).
