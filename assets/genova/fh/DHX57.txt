# DHX57

## Overview
DHX57 is a gene that encodes the protein DExH-box helicase 57, which is a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases. These proteins are integral to RNA metabolic processes, primarily due to their ability to unwind RNA structures, facilitating various aspects of RNA processing and regulation. DExH-box helicase 57 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a role in transcription, splicing, and ribosome biogenesis, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function (Abdelhaleem2003The). The gene has also been implicated in the aging process, with genetic variants near DHX57 being associated with the epigenetic age of the cerebellum, and its expression levels showing a positive correlation with chronological age in brain regions (Lu2016Genetic).

## Function
DHX57 (DExH-box helicase 57) is a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, which are involved in various RNA metabolic processes. These helicases are characterized by their ability to unwind RNA structures, a critical function in RNA processing and regulation. DHX57 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to RNA processing, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Abdelhaleem2003The).

The specific molecular activities of DHX57 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature. However, it is known that RNA helicases like DHX57 play crucial roles in transcription, splicing, and ribosome biogenesis. These processes are essential for the proper synthesis and maturation of RNA, which in turn affects protein synthesis and overall cellular function (Abdelhaleem2003The).

In the context of aging, genetic variants near the DHX57 gene have been associated with the epigenetic age of the cerebellum. The expression levels of DHX57 are positively correlated with chronological age in the cerebellum and other brain regions, suggesting a potential role in the aging process, although the exact biological function in this context remains unclear (Lu2016Genetic).
