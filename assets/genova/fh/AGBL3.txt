# AGBL3

## Overview
AGBL3 is a gene that encodes the protein AGBL carboxypeptidase 3, a member of the metallocarboxypeptidases family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through deglutamylation, a process crucial for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics. These functions are vital for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell division, and signaling pathways. AGBL3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with microtubules, and is expressed at low levels in most human tissues, with slightly higher expression in the testis. The gene has also been implicated in cancer biology and certain inflammatory pathways, such as those associated with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, due to its interactions with complement regulatory proteins (Nishino2024Genebased; Lopes2017The; Gül2018SAT0597).

## Structure


## Function
AGBL3 (AGBL carboxypeptidase 3) encodes a cytosolic carboxypeptidase involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a critical component of the cytoskeleton. The protein functions by mediating the deglutamylation of tubulin, which is essential for regulating microtubule stability and dynamics. This activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell division, and signaling pathways (Nishino2024Genebased; Lopes2017The).

AGBL3 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with microtubules, where it influences the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. This regulation is relevant for neuronal function, although there is not enough evidence to confirm a significant role of AGBL3 in cytoskeleton regulation in neurons (Lopes2017The). The gene's expression is generally low in most human tissues, with slightly higher expression observed in the testis (Lopes2017The).

In addition to its role in healthy cells, AGBL3 has been identified as a candidate cancer-related gene, suggesting its involvement in cancer biology through its enzymatic activity on both tubulin and non-tubulin proteins (Nishino2024Genebased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGBL3 gene have been associated with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, urticarial rash, conjunctival injections, and arthralgia. A specific case involved a homozygous frameshift variant, c.769C>T, which leads to early termination of the protein and deletion of the functional carboxypeptidase domain. This mutation results in the disruption of the protein's role in deglutamylation and deaspartylation of target proteins, such as tubulins, which are crucial for microtubule function (Gul2019AB0005).

The patient with this mutation experienced symptoms often triggered by infections or warm conditions, and laboratory findings showed elevated CRP and ESR during attacks, low C3 and C4 values during asymptomatic periods, and positive ANA test results. While treatments like corticosteroids, canakinumab, and anakinra provided partial relief, a favorable response was observed with rituximab, leading to less frequent and milder attacks (Gul2019AB0005).

Alterations in AGBL3 expression or function may also contribute to neurological disorders, as microtubule dynamics are essential for neuronal function and stability. However, specific neurological conditions linked to AGBL3 mutations are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
AGBL3, a member of the metallocarboxypeptidases family, is involved in the deglutamylation and deaspartylation of target proteins, such as tubulins. This enzymatic activity suggests that AGBL3 plays a role in regulating microtubule dynamics and stability. The protein is implicated in interactions with complement regulatory proteins, including CD46, CD55, and CD59, which are inhibitors of the complement membrane attack complex. These interactions may contribute to a novel inflammatory pathway associated with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (Sari2018SAT0599; Gül2018SAT0597).

AGBL3 has also been identified in fusion transcripts, such as the SLC6A3-AGBL3 fusion found in meningiomas. This fusion results in a predicted protein that contains parts of both the SLC6A3 and AGBL3 proteins, potentially affecting their normal functions (Khan2020Identification). Another study identified a fusion transcript between AGBL3 and CALD1, which may interfere with the function of the parent genes, although the specific interactions of AGBL3 in this context are not well defined (Lopes2017The). These findings highlight the potential for AGBL3 to participate in complex protein interactions that influence cellular processes.
