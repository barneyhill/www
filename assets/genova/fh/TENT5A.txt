# TENT5A

## Overview
TENT5A is a gene that encodes the protein terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5A, a cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. This protein plays a pivotal role in the polyadenylation process, particularly influencing mRNAs that encode proteins essential for bone formation and mineralization. Terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5A is highly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it extends the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs, thereby stabilizing them and enhancing their translation. This activity is crucial for the production of collagen and other components of the bone matrix, which are vital for proper bone development and homeostasis (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic). Mutations in the TENT5A gene have been linked to osteogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its clinical significance in skeletal health (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).

## Function
TENT5A, a cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, plays a crucial role in the polyadenylation of mRNAs, particularly those encoding proteins essential for bone formation and mineralization. It is highly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it extends the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs, such as those encoding collagen I subunits (Col1a1 and Col1a2), which are vital for collagen production and bone matrix formation (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic). The polyadenylation activity of TENT5A stabilizes these mRNAs, enhancing their translation and ensuring adequate protein production necessary for proper bone development (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).

In the absence of TENT5A, as observed in knockout models, there is a significant reduction in collagen production, leading to skeletal abnormalities and conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta, characterized by bone fragility (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic). TENT5A's activity is not limited to bone tissue; it is also expressed in other mineralizing tissues, suggesting a broader role in postnatal bone homeostasis and development (Liudkovska2020Functions). The protein's function in polyadenylation is essential for maintaining the stability and expression of mRNAs involved in extracellular matrix formation and secretion, which are critical for healthy bone physiology (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TENT5A gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a group of heritable disorders characterized by skeletal abnormalities, bone fragility, and frequent fractures. Specifically, TENT5A mutations have been linked to type XVIII OI, which presents with severe symptoms such as spontaneous fractures, congenital bowing of limbs, hypomineralization, and blue sclerae. These symptoms are primarily due to defects in collagen production, as TENT5A is crucial for the polyadenylation of mRNAs encoding collagen chains and other proteins involved in collagen secretion and folding (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).

The absence of TENT5A results in a significant decrease in collagen production, affecting both the quantity and quality of collagen fibers. This is associated with downregulation of proteins involved in collagen processing, leading to severe skeletal abnormalities (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic). In TENT5A knockout mice, there are both quantitative and qualitative defects in collagen I production, resulting in disorganized and variable collagen fibers, which contribute to bone fragility (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).

Additionally, TENT5A mutations affect the expression of SerpinF1, a collagen-binding protein implicated in type VI OI, further underscoring the gene's role in skeletal development and its broader impact on bone-related phenotypes (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
TENT5A, a member of the TENT5 family of proteins, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in bone development and other physiological processes. TENT5A is suggested to interact with SMAD proteins, which are important in bone development signaling pathways, although the functional relevance of this interaction in mammals is not fully understood (Liudkovska2020Functions). In Xenopus embryos, TENT5A interacts with Smad1/Smad4, regulating the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway during early differentiation (Liudkovska2020Functions).

TENT5A is also associated with membranes and performs a novel type of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which is essential for the stabilization and expression of mRNAs encoding secreted proteins during osteoblast differentiation (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic). This process is crucial for proper bone development and mineralization (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic). The mechanism of substrate recognition by TENT5A is not fully understood, but it is suggested that TENT5A interacts with FNDC3A/B, membrane-bound proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum, which may explain its preference for ER-associated mRNAs (Brouze2024TENT5mediated). These interactions highlight TENT5A's role in regulating mRNA stability and translation, which is crucial for osteoblast function and bone health (Gewartowska2021Cytoplasmic).
