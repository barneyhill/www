# CLTA

## Overview
The CLTA gene encodes clathrin light chain A, a vital component of the clathrin protein complex involved in intracellular trafficking and endocytosis. Clathrin light chain A is categorized as a structural protein, playing a significant role in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for the transport of molecules between cellular compartments. This protein is also involved in mitosis, where it stabilizes kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Medendorp2010The). The CLTA gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its diverse functions in cellular processes (Das2021Clathrin). Alterations in CLTA expression have been linked to various diseases, including pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and testicular toxicity, highlighting its clinical significance (Beutgen2021Serological; Lu2017Perfluorooctanoic).

## Structure
Clathrin light chain A (CLTA) is a component of the clathrin protein complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle formation and intracellular trafficking. The primary structure of CLTA includes a sequence of amino acids that undergo alternative mRNA splicing, resulting in four isoforms. These isoforms arise from the alternative splicing of exons 5 and 6, encoding 18 and 12 amino acids, respectively (Das2021Clathrin).

The secondary structure of CLTA features a central α-helix that mediates its association with the clathrin heavy chain (Kirchhausen2014Molecular). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation of the protein, which includes specific domains such as a calcium-binding sequence, a heavy chain-binding region, and a calmodulin-binding domain (Das2021Clathrin).

In terms of quaternary structure, CLTA forms part of the clathrin triskelion, which consists of three heavy chains and three light chains, contributing to the stability and assembly of the clathrin coat (Kirchhausen2014Molecular). Post-translational modifications of CLTA include phosphorylation, with specific sites identified for G-Protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) at Ser204 (Das2021Clathrin). The expression of CLTA splice variants is variable and can change with developmental stages and in a tissue-specific manner (Das2021Clathrin).

## Function
Clathrin light chain A (CLTA) is a crucial component of the clathrin protein complex, which plays a significant role in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. In healthy human cells, CLTA is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for the transport of molecules between cellular compartments. This process is vital for cellular communication, nutrient uptake, and receptor recycling (Anderson2018Generation).

During mitosis, CLTA interacts with the mitotic arrest deficient protein MAD2B, and this interaction is important for the proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes. CLTA, as part of the clathrin triskelion structure, stabilizes kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle, ensuring chromosomal stability during cell division (Medendorp2010The). The interaction between MAD2B and CLTA is confirmed to occur during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, highlighting its role in mitotic progression (Medendorp2010The).

CLTA is also described as a 'moonlighting protein' due to its dual roles in membrane trafficking during interphase and stabilizing spindle fibers during mitosis. Disruptions in these functions can lead to chromosomal instability and potentially contribute to tumor development (Medendorp2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLTA gene, which encodes clathrin light chain A, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG), a subtype of glaucoma, serological levels of anti-clathrin antibodies are significantly decreased. This decrease is associated with the pathogenesis of PEXG, potentially affecting clathrin-mediated endocytosis and extracellular matrix turnover, which are crucial for maintaining normal intraocular pressure and optic nerve health (Beutgen2021Serological). The study suggests that these alterations in clathrin autoantibody levels could either be a consequence or a precursor of PEXG, highlighting the need for further investigation into the relationship between clathrin and glaucoma (Beutgen2021Serological).

Additionally, exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been shown to affect the expression of CLTA in mouse testes. PFOA exposure leads to the upregulation of miR-133b-3p, which targets and downregulates CLTA, impacting endocytosis and the blood-testis barrier. This interaction suggests a role for CLTA in testicular toxicity and disrupted spermatogenesis due to environmental toxins (Lu2017Perfluorooctanoic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CLTA in both ocular and reproductive health contexts.

## Interactions
Clathrin light chain A (CLTA) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CLTA interacts with the mitotic arrest deficient protein MAD2B, a relationship that is particularly significant during mitosis. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through various assays, including GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. The interaction is most prominent during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, where CLTA and MAD2B co-localize at the mitotic spindle, suggesting a role in chromosome alignment and mitotic spindle function (Medendorp2010The).

The interaction between CLTA and MAD2B involves specific domains of CLTA, including a C-terminal domain that acts as a calmodulin-binding domain and a central domain that binds to the clathrin heavy chain (CLTC). This binding is essential for the formation of the clathrin triskelion structure, which is important for mitotic spindle stability (Medendorp2010The).

CLTA also forms part of the clathrin trimeric structure, known as the clathrin triskelion, which is crucial for stabilizing kinetochore fibers during mitosis. The depletion of MAD2B results in a diffuse distribution of CLTA and misaligned chromosomes, highlighting the importance of their interaction for chromosomal stability (Medendorp2010The).
