# RDH13

## Overview
RDH13 is a gene that encodes the protein retinol dehydrogenase 13, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein is primarily localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it functions as a detoxifying enzyme. Retinol dehydrogenase 13 plays a critical role in the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde, thereby protecting mitochondria from reactive aldehydes that can cause cellular damage, particularly in the retina. The protein's activity is essential for mitigating light-induced retinal damage and may also be involved in broader cellular detoxification processes. Despite its protective roles, RDH13's function can vary depending on the type of cellular stress, as evidenced by its complex involvement in conditions such as liver fibrosis and its potential implications in diseases like Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (Belyaeva2019Generation; Cheng2022Candidate).

## Function
RDH13 is a member of the retinol dehydrogenase family, specifically localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria. It plays a crucial role in the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde, functioning as a detoxifying enzyme to protect mitochondria from reactive retinaldehyde. This protective role is particularly important in the context of light-induced damage to the retina, as RDH13 deficiency in mice leads to increased susceptibility to such damage, highlighting its role in safeguarding against reactive aldehydes (Belyaeva2019Generation).

RDH13 may also work in conjunction with mitochondrial β-carotene-9,10-dioxygenase type 2 (BCDO2) to reduce apocarotenals to their corresponding alcohols, thereby removing reactive aldehyde groups. This suggests a broader role in cellular protection and detoxification processes within the mitochondria (Belyaeva2019Generation).

Despite its protective functions, RDH13-deficient mice exhibit less susceptibility to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis, indicating a complex role in cellular protection that may vary depending on the type of stress or damage encountered (Belyaeva2019Generation). The precise function of RDH13 in retinoid metabolism or retinoic acid signaling remains unclear, as these aspects have not been fully assessed (Belyaeva2019Generation).

## Clinical Significance
RDH13 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function and retinoid metabolism. Although no direct association with specific retinal diseases in humans has been established, RDH13 may contribute to the pathogenesis of bilateral convergent strabismus with exophthalmus (Sahu2016Retinol). In the context of breast cancer, RDH13, along with other retinol dehydrogenases, shows higher expression levels in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression is associated with worse outcomes in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a survival biomarker (Ajwad2021Identification).

RDH13 has also been studied in relation to Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a mitochondrial disorder. Variants in RDH13 may influence the penetrance of LHON-associated mtDNA mutations, potentially affecting mitochondrial functions crucial for the disease's pathophysiology (Cheng2022Candidate). The gene's involvement in the biosynthesis of cofactors and protection against oxidative stress highlights its significance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, which, when compromised, may contribute to the clinical manifestations of LHON (Cheng2022Candidate).
