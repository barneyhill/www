# AKT1S1

## Overview
AKT1S1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as AKT1 substrate 1, or PRAS40, which is a critical component in cellular signaling pathways. The protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key player in cell growth, metabolism, and survival. PRAS40 functions as an inhibitor of mTORC1, with its activity modulated by phosphorylation events that are influenced by various signaling pathways, including the Akt/PKB kinase pathway. This modulation allows PRAS40 to integrate signals from nutrients and growth factors, linking them to cellular stress responses. The protein's interactions and regulatory roles extend to the nucleolar stress response pathway, where it influences p53 protein stability and activity. AKT1S1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Havel2014Nuclear; Sancak2007PRAS40; Malla2015Prolinerich).

## Structure
The AKT1S1 gene encodes two protein isoforms, A and B, consisting of 276 and 256 amino acids, respectively. Isoform A features a 20 amino acid extension at the amino terminus compared to isoform B (Wiza2017AKT1S1). Both isoforms share conserved regions, including two proline-rich stretches, a TOR signaling (TOS) motif, and a RAIP motif, which are crucial for interaction with mTORC1. The proteins also contain a leucine-enriched nuclear export sequence, facilitating their transport between the cytosol and nucleus (Wiza2017AKT1S1).

AKT1S1 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, with Thr266/Thr246 being phosphorylated by Akt, Pim-1, and AGC-kinase, while other sites are phosphorylated by mTORC1. This post-translational modification regulates its activity and interaction with other proteins, particularly in the mTOR signaling pathway (Wiza2017AKT1S1). The phosphorylation of AKT1S1 promotes mTORC1 activity by causing its dissociation from raptor, an essential component of the mTORC1 complex (Wiza2017AKT1S1).

The gene produces five transcript variants, resulting in the two protein isoforms, which are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (Wiza2017AKT1S1). AKT1S1 homologs in higher species are nearly identical to the human version, with conservation of regulatory domains and phosphorylation sites (Wiza2017AKT1S1).

## Function
The AKT1S1 gene encodes the protein PRAS40, which plays a significant role in regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in healthy human cells. PRAS40 acts as an inhibitor of mTORC1, a protein kinase complex involved in cell growth and metabolism. Its inhibitory effect is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at the T246 site, which is stimulated by insulin through the Akt/PKB kinase pathway. This phosphorylation reduces PRAS40's ability to inhibit mTORC1, thereby facilitating mTORC1 activation and promoting downstream signaling events such as the phosphorylation of S6K1, a key effector in protein synthesis (Sancak2007PRAS40).

PRAS40 is also involved in the regulation of the RPL11-HDM2-p53 nucleolar stress response pathway. It forms a complex with RPL11 in the nucleus, which is distinct from its interaction with mTORC1. This association is regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites, including T246, and is crucial for modulating p53 protein stability and activity. By inhibiting the RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway, PRAS40 helps suppress p53-mediated cellular senescence and apoptosis, thus promoting cell survival and proliferation (Havel2014Nuclear). These functions highlight PRAS40's role as a dual-input signal integrator, linking nutrient and growth factor signals to cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
AKT1S1, also known as PRAS40, plays a significant role in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders. Alterations in AKT1S1 expression or function are linked to several cancers, such as breast, lung, melanoma, colon, prostate, and liver cancers. In these cancers, PRAS40 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance, particularly in colorectal cancer (Malla2015Prolinerich). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AKT1S1 is overexpressed and associated with poor patient outcomes, including metastasis and reduced survival. The long noncoding RNA LINC01134 promotes HCC metastasis by activating AKT1S1, which in turn enhances NF-κB signaling, a pathway involved in cancer progression (Wang2020Long).

In metabolic disorders, AKT1S1 dysregulation is linked to conditions such as diabetes, where its knockout in mice improves glucose homeostasis by enhancing AKT-mTOR signaling (Malla2015Prolinerich). Additionally, AKT1S1 is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and conditions such as stroke and cerebral ischemia, highlighting its broad clinical significance (Malla2015Prolinerich).

## Interactions
AKT1S1, also known as PRAS40, is involved in several significant protein interactions. It is a component of the Akt and mTORC1 signaling pathways. When phosphorylated, AKT1S1 can bind to YWHAZ (14-3-3), which is a crucial interaction for its function (Wiza2017AKT1S1). In the nucleus, AKT1S1 interacts with the ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11), and this interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser221 and Thr246 within AKT1S1. This binding is associated with the inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2, leading to increased p53 protein stability and activation of the nucleolar stress response pathway (Wiza2017AKT1S1).

AKT1S1 also plays a role in regulating mTORC1 activity. Phosphorylation of AKT1S1 results in its dissociation from raptor within the mTORC1 complex, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity (Wiza2017AKT1S1). In the context of cancer, AKT1S1 is involved in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, where it acts as a direct substrate of AKT and a component of mTORC1, negatively regulating its activity until phosphorylated by AKT (Malla2015Prolinerich). These interactions highlight AKT1S1's role in various cellular processes, including cell survival, proteasome activity, and insulin sensitivity.
