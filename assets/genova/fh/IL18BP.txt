# IL18BP

## Overview
The IL18BP gene encodes the interleukin-18 binding protein, a crucial regulatory component in the immune system. This protein functions as a soluble receptor that binds to interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, thereby inhibiting its activity and preventing excessive inflammatory responses. IL-18BP is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domain, which is essential for its high-affinity binding to IL-18, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation that influence its stability and function. The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing it to adapt to various physiological conditions. IL-18BP is constitutively expressed in several tissues and is upregulated in response to certain cytokines, playing a significant role in maintaining immune homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Mühl2019IL18IL18BP; Wang2024Interleukin‑18).

## Structure
IL18BP, or interleukin 18 binding protein, is characterized by a molecular structure that includes a single immunoglobulin-like domain, which is essential for its binding function. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to inhibit the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and activity. Glycosylation is a common modification that can affect the protein's folding and function, potentially impacting its interaction with IL-18.

IL18BP exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. These isoforms may vary in their binding affinity and biological function, suggesting that the structural differences introduced by alternative splicing could play a role in modulating the protein's activity. The presence of different isoforms indicates that IL18BP can adapt its function in response to varying physiological conditions, although the specific structural differences between these isoforms are not detailed in the available information. The immunoglobulin-like domain and the potential for glycosylation are key structural features that define the functional capabilities of IL18BP.

## Function
The IL18BP gene encodes the interleukin-18 binding protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in immune responses. IL-18BP acts as a soluble receptor that binds IL-18 with high affinity, preventing it from interacting with its receptor and thereby inhibiting its pro-inflammatory effects (Mühl2019IL18IL18BP; Wang2024Interleukin‑18). This binding is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation, as IL-18 is known to induce the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and stimulate Th1 immune responses (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18; Wang2024Interleukin‑18).

In healthy human cells, IL-18BP is constitutively secreted and is present in the serum at a 20-fold molar excess compared to IL-18, acting as a buffer to regulate IL-18 activity (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, monocytes, and endothelial cells, and its expression is upregulated by cytokines such as IFN-γ, forming part of a negative feedback loop to resolve inflammation (Mühl2019IL18IL18BP; Wang2024Interleukin‑18). IL-18BP also interacts with other cytokines, such as IL-37, enhancing its ability to modulate immune responses and maintain immune balance (Wang2024Interleukin‑18).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL18BP gene, which encodes the interleukin-18 binding protein, have significant clinical implications. A specific mutation, c.508-19_528del, leads to a complete deficiency of IL-18BP, resulting in uncontrolled IL-18 activity. This deficiency is linked to fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH), particularly in the context of hepatitis A virus infection, where excessive IL-18-mediated cytotoxic activity causes severe liver damage (Belkaya2019Inherited). The mutation disrupts normal mRNA splicing, producing aberrant splice variants that are rapidly degraded, thus failing to neutralize IL-18 (Belkaya2019Inherited).

In cancer, IL-18BP is often upregulated, which increases regulatory T cells and reduces natural killer cell activity, allowing cancer cells to evade immune detection. This makes IL-18BP a target for immunotherapy, as its inhibition could enhance anti-tumor immunity (Park2022Interleukin18). Conversely, the absence of IL-18BP can lead to excessive IL-18 activity, causing conditions like acute renal and liver injuries (Park2022Interleukin18).

IL-18BP also plays a role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Alterations in its expression can exacerbate conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, due to elevated IL-18 activity (Dinarello2013Interleukin-18).

## Interactions
IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) interacts with interleukin-18 (IL-18) by binding with high affinity, thereby inhibiting IL-18's biological activities. This interaction prevents IL-18 from engaging its receptor, IL-18R, and modulates immune responses by inhibiting the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Wang2024Interleukin‑18; Krumm2008Structural). IL-18BP binds to IL-18 through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, which occur at the binding interface, indicating an induced-fit mechanism (Krumm2008Structural).

IL-18BP also interacts with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37, inhibiting its function and contributing to immune balance (Wang2024Interleukin‑18). The protein forms a disulfide-bonded homo-dimer that engages IL-18 in a 2:2 stoichiometry (Wang2024Interleukin‑18). Additionally, IL-18BP is a target of microRNA-134, which negatively correlates with IL-18BP mRNA levels (Wang2024Interleukin‑18).

Viral homologs of IL-18BP, such as those from the Poxvirus family, also bind and neutralize human IL-18, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this interaction (Hurgin2002The). These homologs share similar binding sites and functional epitopes with human IL-18BP (Wang2024Interleukin‑18).
