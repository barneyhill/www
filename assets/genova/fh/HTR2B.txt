# HTR2B

## Overview
The HTR2B gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT2B), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in serotonin signaling. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is involved in various physiological processes, including glucose metabolism and macrophage polarization (de2013Serotonin; Maroteaux2021Gene). The 5-HT2B receptor is known for its biased signaling, where it can preferentially activate either G protein or β-arrestin pathways, influencing cellular responses (Wacker2013Structural). Clinically, mutations in the HTR2B gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as impulsivity-related conditions and schizophrenia, as well as physiological conditions like pulmonary hypertension and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Launay2002Function; Bevilacqua2010A). The receptor's interactions with various proteins, including Gq proteins and β-arrestin-1, underscore its complex role in cellular signaling pathways (Cao2022Signaling).

## Structure
The HTR2B gene encodes the 5-HT2B receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in serotonin signaling. The receptor consists of 481 amino acids in humans and is characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of GPCRs (Maroteaux2021Gene). The N-terminal region of the receptor, approximately 55 amino acids long, acts as a negative modulator of receptor activity, influencing both basal and stimulated conditions (Belmer2013Role). 

The crystal structure of the 5-HT2B receptor bound to ergotamine reveals conformational characteristics of both active and inactive states, with an active-like state in helix VII and partial changes in helix VI, reflecting a strong β-arrestin bias (Maroteaux2021Gene). The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) junction with helix V forms an additional helical turn stabilized by a structured water molecule, creating a conformational constraint on the position of the extracellular tip of helix V (Maroteaux2021Gene).

The receptor is involved in biased signaling, where certain ligands preferentially activate either G protein or β-arrestin pathways (Wacker2013Structural). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common, although specific details are not provided in the context. The receptor may also have splice variant isoforms, affecting its function and localization (Bender20232B).

## Function
The HTR2B gene encodes the 5-HT2B receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In the context of glucose metabolism, the 5-HT2B receptor is involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in human and mouse islets of Langerhans. Activation of this receptor enhances insulin secretion by increasing mitochondrial metabolism and calcium signaling in beta cells, which are crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Bennet2016Serotonin).

The receptor is primarily localized to islet beta cells, where its activation is associated with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity, indicating its role in priming cells to meet metabolic demands (Bennet2016Serotonin). The 5-HT2B receptor also influences intracellular calcium oscillations, which may amplify the production of metabolic coupling factors during GSIS (Bennet2016Serotonin).

In macrophages, the 5-HT2B receptor is preferentially expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages and is involved in modulating macrophage polarization. It influences the expression of M2-specific markers and reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, contributing to an anti-inflammatory state (de2013Serotonin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HTR2B gene, which encodes the 5-HT2B receptor, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and physiological disorders. A notable mutation, the HTR2B Q20* stop codon, is associated with severe impulsivity and is prevalent in the Finnish population. This mutation has been linked to impulsivity-related disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder (Bevilacqua2010A). 

In the context of schizophrenia, mice lacking the HTR2B gene exhibit a range of schizophrenic-like symptoms, including deficits in sensorimotor gating, social interactions, and cognitive functions. These symptoms are sensitive to antipsychotic treatment, suggesting a role for the 5-HT2B receptor in modulating serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission (Pitychoutis2015Mice).

The HTR2B gene is also implicated in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Increased expression of the 5-HT2B receptor is associated with vascular changes in PH, and blocking these receptors can prevent hypoxia-induced PH in mice (Launay2002Function). Additionally, polymorphisms in HTR2B have been linked to differential survival rates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affecting disease progression (El2016Serotonin).

## Interactions
The HTR2B protein, also known as the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in its signaling pathways. It interacts with Gq proteins, where the a5 helix of Gq inserts into the cytoplasmic cavity of HTR2B, formed by transmembrane helices TM2, TM3, TM5, TM6, TM7, and the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2). Key residues of Gq engage in hydrophobic and polar interactions with HTR2B, facilitating the coupling necessary for signal transduction (Cao2022Signaling).

HTR2B also interacts with b-arrestin-1, where the finger loop of b-arrestin-1 engages with the transmembrane helices of HTR2B through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. These interactions are essential for the recruitment of b-arrestin-1, which is influenced by specific mutations in HTR2B (Cao2022Signaling).

The receptor forms heterodimers with 5-HT2C receptors, where signaling is primarily driven by the 5-HT2C protomer. In cardiac fibroblasts, HTR2B interacts with AT1 receptors, sharing Gq-protein-dependent signaling pathways that lead to cytokine release and cardiac hypertrophy (Maroteaux2021Gene).

HTR2B also interacts with proteins involved in nitric oxide synthase pathways and E3 ubiquitin ligases, affecting receptor turnover and signaling (Maroteaux2021Gene).
