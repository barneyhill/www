# ARF6

## Overview
ARF6 is a gene that encodes the ADP ribosylation factor 6, a small GTPase belonging to the ADP-ribosylation factor family. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in regulating membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. As a monomeric GTPase, ADP ribosylation factor 6 is involved in a unique plasma membrane recycling pathway, cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments, which is crucial for the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins (Radhakrishna1997ADPRibosylation). The protein's activity is modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as EFA6, which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating ARF6 to coordinate membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Franco1999EFA6). ARF6's role extends to various physiological and pathological contexts, including its involvement in cancer progression and other diseases, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Hashimoto2019ARF6; Sabe2023KRAS).

## Structure
The ARF6 protein is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family, characterized by its role as a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes. It is a 175 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 21 kDa (TamaddonJahromi2016ADPRibosylation). The primary structure of ARF6 includes an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is co-translationally modified by myristoylation at the second amino acid, glycine. This modification is crucial for the interaction between the helix and the acidic head groups of membrane lipids (TamaddonJahromi2016ADPRibosylation; Li2022ADPRibosylation).

The secondary structure of ARF6 includes conserved regions such as switch I, switch II, and the inter-switch region, which undergo significant conformational changes between the GDP- and GTP-bound states. These changes are essential for the recruitment of effector proteins in a nucleotide-dependent manner (TamaddonJahromi2016ADPRibosylation). The three-dimensional structure of ARF6 differs significantly between its GDP- and GTP-bound forms, affecting its localization and function (TamaddonJahromi2016ADPRibosylation).

ARF6 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The protein's subcellular localization varies, being associated with the plasma membrane in its GTP-bound form and endosomal structures in its GDP-bound form (TamaddonJahromi2016ADPRibosylation).

## Function
ARF6 (ADP ribosylation factor 6) is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in regulating membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics in healthy human cells. It is involved in a novel plasma membrane recycling pathway, where it cycles between the plasma membrane and an internal tubular endosomal compartment. This cycling is essential for the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins, influencing cell surface remodeling and actin cytoskeleton organization (Radhakrishna1997ADPRibosylation).

ARF6 is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as EFA6, which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP, facilitating its role in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton organization. This activation is crucial for processes like endosomal membrane recycling and the redistribution of transferrin receptors to the cell surface (Franco1999EFA6). ARF6 also coordinates the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with lipid modifications required for exocytosis, particularly in calcium-regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells (Vitale2002Calciumregulated).

In adipocytes, ARF6 is involved in insulin-regulated secretory pathways, specifically in the secretion of adipsin, a serine protease, while not affecting glucose transporter translocation (Yang1999ADPribosylation). Additionally, ARF6 regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis, influencing the internalization and recycling of transferrin receptors (D’SouzaSchorey1995A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARF6 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer, ARF6 is associated with increased invasion, metastasis, and proliferation. Overexpression of ARF6 is linked to poor survival outcomes in cancers such as pancreatic, breast, kidney, lung, and head and neck cancers. The ARF6-AMAP1 signaling pathway promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cancer cell invasion and metastasis, and contributes to immune evasion by increasing PD-L1 recycling and surface expression (Sabe2023KRAS). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, ARF6 is activated by PDGFRβ, which is upregulated due to TP53 mutations, and is crucial for malignancy (Hashimoto2019ARF6).

ARF6 also plays a role in uveal melanoma, where it mediates oncogenic GNAQ signaling, influencing pathways such as PLC/PKC and Rho/Rac. Inhibition of ARF6 reduces tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yoo2016ARF6). In breast cancer, ARF6 is crucial for invasive activities, with higher protein expression levels correlating with increased invasiveness (Hashimoto2004Requirement).

In biliary atresia, ARF6 is identified as a susceptibility locus, with specific SNPs associated with decreased expression. Knockdown of ARF6 in zebrafish impairs biliary network formation, indicating its role in liver development (Ningappa2015The).

## Interactions
ARF6 interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. In its GTP-bound form, ARF6 recruits ARNO and Grp1 to the plasma membrane by binding to their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. This interaction is specific to ARF6, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction with ARF1 or its mutants (Cohen2007Active). ARF6 also interacts with EFA6, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for ARF6, which coordinates membrane trafficking with actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The PH domain of EFA6 is responsible for its localization to the plasma membrane, interacting with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and F-actin (Macia2008The).

ARF6 is involved in the interaction with TWIK1, a potassium channel, through EFA6. This interaction is ARF6-dependent and is important for the trafficking of TWIK1 in polarized epithelial cells (Decressac2004ARF6‐dependent). Additionally, ARF6 interacts with POR1, a Rac1-interacting protein, in a GTP-dependent manner, which is significant for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangements (D’SouzaSchorey1997A). These interactions highlight ARF6's role in regulating cellular processes through its interactions with various proteins.
