# MARK3

## Overview
MARK3, or microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell polarity. The protein product of MARK3, also known as C-TAK1, is a member of the microtubule affinity-regulating kinases family, which includes MARK1, MARK2, and MARK4. These kinases are crucial for phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins, thereby influencing microtubule stability and cellular architecture (Sandí2017MARK3mediated). MARK3 is characterized by a complex molecular structure, including a catalytic kinase domain, a ubiquitin-associated domain, and a C-terminal tail domain with a KA1 motif, which are essential for its function and regulation (Marx2010Structure). The kinase plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, stress response pathways, and metabolic regulation, and is implicated in diseases such as high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and Alzheimer's disease (Lund2014MARK4; Machino2022The).

## Structure
MARK3, also known as C-TAK1, is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of MARK3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming distinct domains, including a catalytic kinase domain, a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, and a C-terminal tail domain with a KA1 motif (Marx2010Structure). The secondary structure of the tail domain includes two α-helices and five β-strands arranged in a β-α-β-β-β-β-α pattern (Marx2010Structure).

The tertiary structure of MARK3 features a catalytic domain with an N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe, separated by a cleft that houses the nucleotide binding and active site. The N lobe is composed of a 5-stranded β sheet and a single helix, while the C lobe is predominantly α-helical (Marx2010Structure). The UBA domain interacts with the N lobe, playing a role in autoinhibition and activation (Marx2010Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, MARK3 can form dimers in crystal structures, although a physiological role for this dimerization has not been confirmed (Marx2010Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for MARK3's regulation and activity, affecting its interaction with other proteins and cellular localization (Marx2010Structure).

## Function
MARK3, also known as microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating microtubule dynamics and cell polarity in healthy human cells. It is part of the microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) family, which includes MARK1, MARK2, MARK3, and MARK4. These kinases are related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and are known for phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), thereby influencing microtubule stability and cell polarity (Sandí2017MARK3mediated).

MARK3 specifically phosphorylates ARHGEF2 at the Ser 151 site, which is crucial for modulating ARHGEF2's interaction with microtubules and its subcellular localization. This phosphorylation event leads to the redistribution of ARHGEF2 from microtubule-like structures to a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, affecting cytoskeletal dynamics and cell polarity (Sandí2017MARK3mediated). MARK3 also interacts with proteins such as CLASP1 and CLASP2, further contributing to microtubule dynamics and cell polarity (Sandí2017MARK3mediated).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal organization, MARK3 is involved in metabolic regulation. It is part of the LKB1-MARK3 axis, which acts as a tumor suppressor in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, indicating its involvement in cancer biology and metabolic processes (Machino2022The). MARK3's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, and it is constitutively active in cells, playing a role in cell cycle regulation and stress response pathways (Sandí2017MARK3mediated; Machino2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MARK3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and Alzheimer's disease. In HGSOC, MARK3 is consistently downregulated, which correlates with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. The downregulation of MARK3 is associated with genomic and epigenetic alterations, including copy number deletions and dysregulation by upstream kinases such as LKB1, TAOK1, and PIM1. These alterations may allow cancer cells to bypass metabolic stress checkpoints, contributing to tumor progression and malignancy (Machino2022The).

In Alzheimer's disease, MARK3 is associated with early tau phosphorylation, a key event in the pathogenesis of the disease. MARK3 is found in granulovacuolar degeneration bodies within neurons, and its expression is elevated in Alzheimer's cases compared to non-demented elderly individuals. This suggests a potential role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology (Lund2014MARK4).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of MARK3 in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Interactions
MARK3, also known as microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence its role in cellular processes. MARK3 directly phosphorylates CDC25B at serine 323, a 14-3-3 binding site, which inhibits the nuclear translocation of CDC25B, suggesting its function as a cell cycle checkpoint kinase (Machino2022The). It also interacts with ARHGEF2, phosphorylating it at Ser 151, which affects ARHGEF2's interaction with microtubules and its subcellular localization. This phosphorylation is crucial for establishing cell polarity by altering ARHGEF2's binding to microtubules and its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (Sandí2017MARK3mediated).

MARK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of Slingshot-1 (SSH1) at Ser-937 and Ser-978, which is essential for its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. This phosphorylation inhibits SSH1's F-actin-assisted cofilin-phosphatase activity and is necessary for SSH1's translocation to lamellipodia, facilitating the formation of a single polarized lamellipodium (Mishima2023MARK3mediated). These interactions highlight MARK3's role in regulating cell polarity and cytoskeletal dynamics.
