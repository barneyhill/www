# TNFAIP8

## Overview
TNFAIP8, or tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to immune response and cancer progression. The TNFAIP8 protein is characterized by a conserved TIPE homology (TH) domain, which includes a death effector domain (DED)-like structure, allowing it to interact with lipid messengers and other proteins (LIN2023Structure; Padmavathi2018Novel). As a phosphoinositide-binding protein, TNFAIP8 plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, cell proliferation, and survival by influencing signaling pathways such as NF-κB and the Hippo pathway (Niture2018Oncogenic; Hua2021Current). The protein's expression is regulated by factors like TNFα and NF-κB, and it is implicated in various cancers and inflammatory conditions due to its role in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to chemotherapy (Niture2018Oncogenic; Hua2021Current). TNFAIP8's involvement in these processes makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Structure
The TNFAIP8 protein, encoded by the TNFAIP8 gene, is characterized by a conserved TIPE homology (TH) domain, which includes a death effector domain (DED)-like structure. This domain is composed of seven α-helices forming a large central hydrophobic cavity, crucial for binding lipid messengers such as phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates and phosphatidic acid (LIN2023Structure; Padmavathi2018Novel). The protein's structure is stabilized by a coiled-coil motif located in α-helices 2 and 3, while a destruction box (D-Box) motif is present in α-helix 5, potentially involved in cell cycle regulation (Niture2018Oncogenic; Niture2020TNFAIP8).

TNFAIP8 has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, with conserved C-terminal sequences and variable N-terminal regions (Niture2018Oncogenic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as PKA, PKC, and CKII, which may influence its role in cancer cell signaling (Niture2018Oncogenic). The hydrophobic cavity of TNFAIP8 is lined with hydrophobic residues and hydrophilic residues at the mouth, which may determine ligand specificity (Niture2018Oncogenic). This structural configuration allows TNFAIP8 to interact with phosphoinositides, playing a role in regulating Rho GTPases and influencing cancer cell migration (Lin2021TNFAIP8).

## Function
TNFAIP8 (TNF alpha induced protein 8) is involved in several molecular processes that are crucial for cell biology, particularly in the context of immune responses and inflammation. In healthy human cells, TNFAIP8 is expressed in various tissues, including the bone marrow, immune system, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and adipose tissue, with moderate expression in reproductive tissues (Niture2018Oncogenic). It is regulated by transcription factors such as NF-κB and is influenced by TNFα, which can induce cellular inflammation and activate NF-κB, leading to increased TNFAIP8 expression (Niture2018Oncogenic).

TNFAIP8 plays a role in modulating immune responses by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which suggests its involvement in maintaining immune homeostasis (Unknownauthors2019TNFAIP8:Inflammation). It affects CD4+ T lymphocyte activity and polarization, indicating a role in immune function and potentially in immune dysfunction (Unknownauthors2019TNFAIP8:Inflammation). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences signaling pathways like NF-kB, affecting cell proliferation and survival (Niture2018Oncogenic). While TNFAIP8 is primarily associated with disease states, its expression in healthy tissues suggests it may have roles in normal immune function and homeostasis (Unknownauthors2019TNFAIP8:Inflammation).

## Clinical Significance
TNFAIP8 (TNF alpha induced protein 8) is implicated in various cancers and inflammatory conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, TNFAIP8 is highly expressed in tumor cells, contributing to tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and epithelial ovarian cancer (Liu2013TNFAIP8; Hua2021Current). In gastric adenocarcinoma, high TNFAIP8 expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stages, serving as an independent prognostic marker (CHEN2016Association). In epithelial ovarian cancer, TNFAIP8 overexpression is associated with high histologic grade, large residual tumor size, and platinum resistance, indicating its role in metastasis and chemotherapy response (Liu2013TNFAIP8; Liu2014TNFAIP8).

TNFAIP8 also plays a role in inflammatory diseases. It regulates immune functions and apoptosis, with its deficiency leading to severe colitis and increased apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells (Hua2021Current). In spinal cord injury models, TNFAIP8 expression increases pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting its involvement in inflammation (Hua2021Current). These findings highlight TNFAIP8 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
TNFAIP8 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to cancer progression and immune response. It interacts with Gαi proteins, including Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gao, but not with Gacone or Gas, through its death effector domain-like (DED-like) and C-terminal domains. This interaction is stronger with activated G-proteins, as shown by greater pull-down of Gαi2 and Gαi3 in the presence of GTPγS (Laliberté2010TNFAIP8:).

TNFAIP8 also interacts with the tumor suppressor gene p53, where a mutation at K120 can lead to the transcription of TNFAIP8, promoting cell survival by inhibiting caspase-8 activity (Hua2021Current). It affects the Hippo signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP, promoting cell proliferation in various cancers (Hua2021Current). TNFAIP8 interacts with autophagy-related proteins ATG3 and ATG7, facilitating LC3 lipidation, which is crucial for autophagosome formation (Niture2020TNFAIP8).

Additionally, TNFAIP8 acts as a phosphoinositide-binding protein, interacting with phosphoinositides like PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which influences actin dynamics and cell motility by affecting the activity of cofilin, an actin-severing protein (Lin2021TNFAIP8).
