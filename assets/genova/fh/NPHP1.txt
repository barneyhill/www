# NPHP1

## Overview
The NPHP1 gene encodes nephrocystin 1, a protein that plays a critical role in the function and structure of primary cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes. Nephrocystin 1 is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein due to its involvement in cell-cell junctions and interactions with actin-binding proteins, such as filamins, which are crucial for maintaining the organization of F-actin networks (Jiang2008Targeted). The protein is localized at the transition zone of primary cilia, where it forms part of a multi-protein complex that regulates protein trafficking, thereby maintaining the compartmentalization necessary for ciliary function (Datta2021Differential). Mutations in the NPHP1 gene are linked to nephronophthisis, a ciliopathy that leads to kidney dysfunction, and other disorders such as Senior-Løken syndrome and Joubert syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Leggatt2023A; Srivastava2018Many).

## Structure
The NPHP1 gene encodes nephrocystin 1, a protein consisting of 732 amino acids. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal coiled coil domain, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a nephrocystin homology domain (NHD) (Jiang2008Targeted; mannella2013metabolomic). The N-terminal region, initially predicted to form a coiled coil, is actually a stable monomeric three-helix bundle, consisting of three antiparallel α helices connected by short linkers (mannella2013metabolomic). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, often with cytoskeletal proteins like actin (mannella2013metabolomic).

The SH3 domain, located between residues 157 and 207, is crucial for binding proteins, particularly recognizing proline-rich motifs (mannella2013metabolomic). It interacts with proteins such as Crk-associated substrate p130 Cas and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), which are key in cell signaling (Jiang2008Targeted). The NHD occupies the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein and is involved in self-association and interaction with actin-binding proteins like filamin, playing a role in cell polarity and adhesion-regulated signaling (Jiang2008Targeted; mannella2013metabolomic). Nephrocystin 1 is also known to localize at primary cilia, similar to proteins associated with other cystic kidney diseases (Salomon2008Nephronophthisis).

## Function
The NPHP1 gene encodes nephrocystin-1, a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the function and structure of primary cilia. Nephrocystin-1 is involved in cell-cell junctions in polarized epithelial cells and interacts with proteins such as p130(CAS), Pyk2, and filamins, which are important for the organization of F-actin networks (Jiang2008Targeted). It localizes to the transition zone of primary cilia, where it is part of a multi-protein complex that functions as a gate to control protein trafficking in and out of the ciliary compartment, essential for maintaining the compartmentalization of photoreceptor cells (Datta2021Differential). 

In the context of spermatogenesis, nephrocystin-1 is implicated in the organization of the apical ectoplasmic specialization, a cell-cell adherens junction crucial for Sertoli-germ cell interactions (Devi2015Expression). The protein's interaction with actin-binding proteins suggests a role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for cell signaling and adhesion (Jiang2008Targeted). Nephrocystin-1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining proper cellular signaling and structural organization in healthy human cells, particularly in the kidneys and reproductive system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPHP1 gene are primarily associated with nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive kidney disorder that leads to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in children and can also affect adults (Leggatt2023A; Yuan2015Comparative). Nephronophthisis is characterized by the abnormal structure and function of primary cilia, resulting from whole gene deletions of NPHP1 (Leggatt2023A). Approximately 80% of nephronophthisis cases involve a large recurrent homozygous NPHP1 deletion due to nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) (Yuan2015Comparative).

In addition to nephronophthisis, NPHP1 mutations can lead to other ciliopathies, such as Senior-Løken syndrome, which involves retinal dystrophy, and Joubert syndrome, which includes neurological disorders (Leggatt2023A; Srivastava2018Many). Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is another condition linked to NPHP1 mutations, where recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Lindstrand2014Recurrent).

The clinical significance of NPHP1 mutations extends to their role in retinal development and potential involvement in human spermatogenesis, as indicated by studies on Nphp1 knockout mouse models (Li2021An). These mutations are often under-reported, particularly SNVs, which may account for a significant portion of NPHP1-related diseases (Leggatt2023A).

## Interactions
NPHP1, or nephrocystin-1, is a protein that plays a significant role in ciliary function and is involved in various protein interactions. It is part of a complex that includes NPHP4 and NPHP8, with NPHP4 acting as a bridge between NPHP1 and NPHP8. This complex localizes to the ciliary transition zone, which is crucial for ciliary sensory functions (Ning2020Defective; Sang2011Mapping). NPHP1 also interacts with other proteins such as AHI1, NPHP2 (INVS), NPHP5 (IQCB1), and RPGRIP1L, with the SH3 domain and C-terminal residues of NPHP1 being essential for these interactions (Datta2021Differential).

NPHP1 is involved in multiprotein complexes related to ciliary function, including the NPHP1-NPHP4-RPGRIPL/PDE6D/RPGR complex, which associates with other complexes like IQ/CALM1, KIF3, and the COP9 signalosome (Boldt2016An). It also interacts with proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and signaling, such as p130cas, tensin, filamin, and focal adhesion kinase 2, suggesting a role in maintaining tubular epithelium integrity (Srivastava2018Many). These interactions highlight the importance of NPHP1 in the structural and signaling functions of the cilium, contributing to its role in ciliopathy diseases.
