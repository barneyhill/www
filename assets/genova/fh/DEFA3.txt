# DEFA3

## Overview
DEFA3 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin alpha 3, also known as human neutrophil peptide 3 (HNP-3), which is a member of the alpha-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are primarily produced by neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, and play a critical role in the innate immune response by disrupting the membranes of bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses. The DEFA3 gene is located within a complex multiallelic copy number variation locus, which can influence the levels of HNP-3 in neutrophils and affect individual responses to infections and inflammation (Ballana2007Interpopulation; Ai2016Low). The protein is characterized by its ability to form quaternary structures, such as dimers or multimers, which enhance its antimicrobial effectiveness. Additionally, DEFA3 is involved in immune modulation by attracting immune cells to sites of inflammation, thereby linking innate and adaptive immunity (Chen2010Increased). Variations in DEFA3 expression have been associated with several clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Ciccosanti2022Proteomic).

## Structure
DEFA3 (defensin alpha 3) is a human gene encoding a protein that is part of the defensin family, known for its antimicrobial properties. The primary structure of DEFA3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure typically includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the overall three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is often stabilized by disulfide bonds. These bonds are crucial for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and biological activity. Defensins, including DEFA3, may form quaternary structures as dimers or multimers, which can enhance their antimicrobial effectiveness.

Post-translational modifications of DEFA3 can include glycosylation and proteolytic processing. These modifications are important for the protein's maturation and function. Glycosylation can affect the protein's stability, solubility, and interaction with other molecules, while proteolytic processing is essential for activating the protein's antimicrobial properties. The presence of specific domains and prominent folds within the DEFA3 protein structure contributes to its ability to interact with microbial membranes, leading to the disruption of microbial cell walls and the inhibition of microbial growth.

## Function
The DEFA3 gene encodes human neutrophil peptide 3 (HNP-3), a member of the alpha-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are primarily produced by neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, and are stored in azurophil granules. Upon activation of neutrophils, HNP-3 is released to combat microbial infections through its ability to disrupt the membranes of bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses (Chen2010Increased; Ballana2007Interpopulation).

HNP-3 plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by enhancing phagocytosis, promoting neutrophil recruitment, and regulating complement activation. It also acts as an immune modulator by attracting immature dendritic cells and T cells to sites of inflammation, thereby linking innate and adaptive immunity (Chen2010Increased). The DEFA3 gene is part of a complex multiallelic copy number variation locus, which includes DEFA1, and these variations can influence the levels of HNP-3 in neutrophils, potentially affecting individual responses to infections and inflammation (Khan2013Accurate; Ai2016Low).

In healthy human cells, DEFA3 is expressed at about twice the level of DEFA1, although it is generally less active against bacteria. Its expression is upregulated in certain autoimmune diseases, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses (Ballana2007Interpopulation).

## Clinical Significance
The DEFA3 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to variations in its copy number and expression levels. In the context of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a study found that lower copy numbers of DEFA3 are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease and poorer renal outcomes. This suggests that DEFA3 plays a role in the susceptibility to IgAN and its progression (Ai2016Low).

In hearing loss associated with the mitochondrial DNA mutation A1555G, the absence of the DEFA3 gene has been investigated as a potential modifier of the phenotype. Although no significant differences were observed in the rate of DEFA3 absence between deaf and hearing subjects, a family-based association test suggested a possible link between DEFA3 absence and the manifestation of deafness in individuals with the A1555G mutation (Ballana2007MRPS18CP2).

In severe COVID-19 cases, elevated levels of DEFA3 have been observed in patients requiring ICU admission. This increase is associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, which is a hallmark of severe COVID-19, indicating that DEFA3 may contribute to the immune response and inflammation in this context (Ciccosanti2022Proteomic).
