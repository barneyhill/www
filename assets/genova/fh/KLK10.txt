# KLK10

## Overview
Kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme, which is part of the kallikrein family. This family of enzymes is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, skin desquamation, and hormone processing (Emami2007New; Adamopoulos2017Identification). The KLK10 protein, characterized by its unique molecular structure and trypsin-like specificity, is secreted as a prepropeptide and plays a role in proteolytic cascades essential for coagulation, apoptosis, and immune responses (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Emami2007New). While its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, KLK10 is implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Cao2018Aberrant; Mavridis2010Prognostic).

## Structure
Kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) is a serine protease with a unique molecular structure compared to other serine proteases. Its primary sequence features a charged N-terminal residue, Glu16, and a hydrophobic 75-loop segment with four leucine residues (Debela2016Structural). The active form of KLK10 consists of 232 amino acids, starting with Leu13 and ending with Asn246 (Debela2016Structural). The protein's structure includes several disordered regions, such as the N-terminus and the 75-, 99-, and 148-loops, which contribute to its unique conformation (Debela2016Structural).

The tertiary structure of KLK10 is stabilized by six disulfide bridges, a common feature among kallikreins (Debela2016Structural). The protein's active site includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, with Zn2+ binding at the catalytic center, disrupting the triad and inhibiting enzymatic activity (Debela2016Structural). KLK10's structure resembles the prototypic serine protease trypsin, particularly its zymogen form trypsinogen, with some elements from other kallikreins (Debela2016Structural). The presence of a cis-Pro219 in the 220-loop and the unique Pro190 contribute to its substrate preference (Debela2016Structural). KLK10's structure is marked by significant disorder in its major surface loops, which is atypical for a zymogen (Debela2016Structural).

## Function
KLK10, or kallikrein-related peptidase 10, is a serine protease involved in various physiological processes. It is part of the kallikrein family, which is known for its role in processes such as blood pressure regulation, skin desquamation, and hormone processing (Emami2007New; Adamopoulos2017Identification). KLK10 is expressed in epithelial cells and is associated with the normal epithelial cell-specific 1 (NES1) gene (Adamopoulos2017Identification). It is also expressed in the pituitary gland and islets of Langerhans, suggesting a role in hormone processing (Emami2007New).

The KLK10 protein is secreted as a prepropeptide of 276 amino acids, with the first 33 amino acids forming a signal peptide (Adamopoulos2017Identification). It has a trypsin-like specificity and can accept amino acid residues with large hydrophobic side chains, similar to chymotrypsin (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). KLK10 is involved in proteolytic cascades, which are crucial for physiological processes such as coagulation, apoptosis, and immune responses (Emami2007New). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific function of KLK10 in healthy human cells remains not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
The KLK10 gene, also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 10, plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and methylation status influencing disease progression and patient prognosis. In breast cancer, KLK10 is considered a putative tumor-suppressor gene, with its expression often lost due to methylation of the third exon. This loss is associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients (Mavridis2010Prognostic; Sidiropoulos2005Downregulation). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, high KLK10 levels correlate with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis, indicating its role as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker (Bharaj2002Identification; Mavridis2010Prognostic).

In colorectal cancer, KLK10 expression is significantly elevated in cancerous tissues, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poorer survival rates, suggesting its potential as a marker for unfavorable prognosis (Alexopoulou2013Clinical). Similarly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KLK10 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting metastasis through the enhancement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activation of the FAK-SRC-ERK signaling pathway (Cao2018Aberrant). These findings highlight KLK10's complex role in cancer biology, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
KLK10, a member of the kallikrein family of serine proteases, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In prostate cancer cells, KLK10 interacts with proteins such as Bcl-2 and HK-2. The up-regulation of KLK10 leads to the down-regulation of these proteins, which are associated with cell survival and glucose metabolism. This interaction suggests a feedback mechanism where KLK10 negatively regulates Bcl-2 and HK-2 expression, contributing to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Hu2015NES1KLK10).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KLK10 is implicated in promoting metastasis through its involvement in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the FAK-SRC-ERK signaling pathway. KLK10 knockdown results in the upregulation of epithelial markers and downregulation of mesenchymal markers, indicating its role in EMT. It also reduces the phosphorylation of FAK, SRC, and ERK, suggesting KLK10's participation in the FAK-SRC-ERK axis, which is crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Cao2018Aberrant).

Structurally, KLK10 forms complexes with α1-antitrypsin and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor in ovarian cancer ascites fluid, although its broader physiological roles remain unclear (Debela2016Structural). These interactions highlight KLK10's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
