# CIMIP2A

## Overview
CIMIP2A is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule inner protein 2A, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMIP2A is categorized as a structural protein, specifically associated with the microtubule inner proteins that are integral to the ciliary axoneme, the core structure of cilia. This protein is essential for the proper assembly and maintenance of ciliary microtubules, which are critical for ciliary motility and signaling pathways. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMIP2A can lead to ciliary dysfunction, which is implicated in a variety of ciliopathies, disorders characterized by defects in cilia structure or function.
