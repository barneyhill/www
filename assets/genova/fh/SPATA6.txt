# SPATA6

## Overview
SPATA6 is a gene that encodes the protein spermatogenesis associated 6, which plays a pivotal role in male fertility by facilitating the proper assembly of the sperm connecting piece. This protein is integral to the formation of key structural components, such as the segmented columns and the capitulum, which are essential for the attachment and alignment of the sperm head to the mid-piece during spermiogenesis (Yuan2015Spata6is). SPATA6 is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in late pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids, and is localized to the connecting piece of spermatozoa (Yuan2015Spata6is). The protein interacts with myosin subunits, indicating its involvement in myosin-based microfilament transport necessary for sperm development (Yuan2015Spata6is). Disruptions in SPATA6 function, such as mutations or epigenetic alterations, can lead to male infertility due to defects in sperm head-tail conjunction, underscoring its clinical significance in reproductive health (Yuan2015Spata6is; Sujit2020Increased).

## Function
The SPATA6 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of the sperm connecting piece, which is essential for the proper attachment and alignment of the sperm head to the mid-piece. This protein is involved in the formation of segmented columns and the capitulum, which are major structures of the sperm connecting piece, crucial for linking the developing flagellum to the head during spermiogenesis (Yuan2015Spata6is). SPATA6 is specifically expressed in the testis, particularly in late pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids, and is localized to the connecting piece of spermatozoa (Yuan2015Spata6is).

SPATA6 interacts with myosin subunits, suggesting its involvement in myosin-based microfilament transport, which is necessary for the assembly of the sperm connecting piece (Yuan2015Spata6is). This interaction is crucial for transporting the building blocks required for the formation of the segmented columns during the development of the connecting piece in developing spermatids (Yuan2015Spata6is). The absence of SPATA6 results in acephalic spermatozoa and male sterility, highlighting its essential role in sperm head-tail conjunction and normal sperm assembly (Yuan2015Spata6is).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the SPATA6 gene are associated with several reproductive issues, primarily male infertility. SPATA6 is crucial for the proper assembly of the sperm connecting piece, which is essential for the normal structure and function of spermatozoa. Inactivation or mutations in SPATA6 can lead to acephalic spermatozoa, a condition where sperm lack heads, resulting in male sterility. This defect is characterized by the absence or malformation of structures such as the segmented columns and the capitulum, which are critical for the attachment and alignment of the sperm head to the mid-piece (Yuan2015Spata6is).

Hypermethylation of SPATA6 has been observed in oligozoospermic infertile males, suggesting that epigenetic changes may suppress its expression, thereby compromising sperm production and contributing to infertility (Sujit2020Increased). Additionally, SPATA6 interacts with CFAP52, and mutations in CFAP52 can lead to reduced SPATA6 expression, further affecting sperm head-tail connection and flagella development, which are critical for fertility (Jin2023Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SPATA6 in maintaining normal sperm morphology and function, with its disruption leading to significant reproductive challenges.

## Interactions
SPATA6 is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate sperm development. It interacts with multiple myosin subunits, including myosin light-chain polypeptide 6 (MYL6) and myosin heavy-chain polypeptides 10, 11, and 14. These interactions suggest that SPATA6 plays a role in myosin-based microfilament transport, which is essential for the assembly of the segmented columns during sperm development (Yuan2015Spata6is). Western blot and reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between SPATA6 and MYL6, with both proteins localized to the manchettes of elongating spermatids in wild-type testes (Yuan2015Spata6is).

SPATA6 also interacts with CFAP52, a centrosome/basal body protein. This interaction is crucial for the stability and expression of SPATA6, as CFAP52 regulates SPATA6 stability through its first eight WD40 domains. The interaction between CFAP52 and SPATA6 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that CFAP52 is essential for maintaining SPATA6 expression and stability (Jin2023Identification).

Additionally, SPATA6 is a target of miR-23a/b-3p, which binds to its 3' UTR, resulting in reduced expression levels. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism that could impact SPATA6's role in spermatogenesis (AbuHalima2019Differential).
