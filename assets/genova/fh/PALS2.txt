# PALS2

## Overview
PALS2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as protein associated with LIN7 2, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) p55 family. This protein is characterized by its scaffolding function, facilitated by the presence of PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase (GUK) domains, which are integral to its role in signal transduction and maintaining cell polarity (Kamberov2000Molecular). PALS2 is involved in the formation of supramolecular complexes at cell junctions, particularly in epithelial cells, where it interacts with proteins such as mLin-7 to ensure proper protein targeting and cellular organization (Kamberov2000Molecular). The gene produces two splice variants, Pals2α and Pals2β, which differ slightly in their amino acid composition, suggesting potential functional diversity (Kamberov2000Molecular). The protein's interactions with other components, such as CRB3 and PATJ, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Zhang2012Structure).

## Structure
PALS2 is a member of the MAGUK p55 family and features several key domains, including PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase (GUK) domains, which are typical of scaffolding proteins involved in signal transduction (Kamberov2000Molecular). The protein exists in two splice variant isoforms, Pals2α and Pals2β, which differ by an insertion of 14 amino acids between the PDZ and SH3 domains. Pals2α consists of 539 amino acids, while Pals2β has 553 amino acids (Kamberov2000Molecular). These splice variants suggest alternative splicing events that may influence the protein's structural and functional properties, although the significance of this variation is not fully understood (Kamberov2000Molecular).

The PALS2 protein shows 82% homology to mouse Dlg2/MPP2, indicating a conserved structure among species (Kamberov2000Molecular). The protein is involved in forming membrane-associated guanylate kinase complexes that target mLin-7 to specific cellular locations, highlighting its role in cellular signaling and localization (Kamberov2000Molecular). The presence of these domains facilitates protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes. The specific post-translational modifications of PALS2, such as phosphorylation, are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
PALS2, a member of the MAGUK p55 family, plays a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and signal transduction by interacting with other proteins at cell junctions. It is involved in the assembly of supramolecular complexes that are crucial for cell polarity, particularly in epithelial cells. PALS2 interacts with mLin-7, a protein that is part of a complex network involving PDZ domain proteins, which are essential for the proper targeting of proteins to cellular surfaces (Kamberov2000Molecular). This interaction is facilitated by a conserved region in PALS2, which is crucial for binding to mLin-7 (Kamberov2000Molecular).

PALS2 is localized to the lateral membrane in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, indicating its role in cell-cell contact sites (Kamberov2000Molecular). Although the specific function of PALS2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in cell polarity and protein targeting suggests it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular organization and function. The splice variants of PALS2, Pals2␣ and Pals2␤, indicate potential functional diversity, although the significance of these variations remains unclear (Kamberov2000Molecular).

## Interactions
PALS2, a member of the MAGUK p55 family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cell polarity and signaling. PALS2 interacts with mLin-7, forming complexes that are essential for the proper targeting of proteins to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells (Kamberov2000Molecular). This interaction is mediated by a conserved mLin-7 binding domain present in PALS2, which is also shared by other MAGUK proteins (Kamberov2000Molecular).

PALS2 exists in two splice variants, Pals2␣ and Pals2␤, which differ by a 14 amino acid insertion between the PDZ and SH3 domains. These variants suggest potential differences in interaction capabilities, although the specific significance of this variation is not fully understood (Kamberov2000Molecular).

PALS2 is also part of a larger complex involving proteins such as CRB3 and PATJ, which are important for tight junction assembly and maintenance. These interactions highlight PALS2's role in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Kamberov2000Molecular). The L27 domain of PALS2 is crucial for these interactions, as it mediates the assembly of protein complexes that are vital for cell polarity (Zhang2012Structure).
