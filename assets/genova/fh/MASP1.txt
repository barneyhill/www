# MASP1

## Overview
The MASP1 gene encodes mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease 1 (MASP-1), a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the lectin pathway of the complement system, an integral part of the innate immune response. MASP-1 is involved in the activation of the complement cascade, primarily through the cleavage and activation of MASP-2, which is essential for the formation of the C3 convertase complex. This process facilitates pathogen opsonization and clearance, underscoring MASP-1's critical function in immune defense (Héja2012Revised; Degn2012MannanBinding). The protein is characterized by a modular structure, including CUB domains, an EGF-like domain, and a serine protease domain, which enable its interactions with mannose-binding lectin and ficolins (Gaboriaud2021Structures). Beyond its role in the complement system, MASP-1 is implicated in broader physiological processes, such as coagulation and inflammation, through interactions with protease-activated receptors on endothelial cells (Dobó2014Multiple). Mutations in the MASP1 gene are linked to 3MC syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental disorders (Sirmaci2010MASP1; Rooryck2011Mutations).

## Structure
MASP1, or MBL-associated serine protease 1, is a protein involved in the lectin pathway of the complement system. It has a modular structure comprising several domains, including two CUB domains, an EGF-like domain, two complement control protein (CCP) modules, and a C-terminal serine protease domain (Gaboriaud2021Structures). The CUB domains are involved in calcium-dependent interactions, forming homodimers that are crucial for binding to mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins (Gaboriaud2021Structures). 

The CUB1-EGF region forms a head-to-tail assembly stabilized by calcium ions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds (Gaboriaud2021Structures). The serine protease domain of MASP1 shares a trypsin-like fold, with an open binding site that allows for versatile substrate interactions, making it a potent activator of the lectin pathway (Gaboriaud2021Structures). 

MASP1 is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain proenzyme, which becomes activated upon cleavage, resulting in two chains held together by a disulfide bridge (Gaboriaud2021Structures). Alternative splicing of the MASP1 gene results in different isoforms, including MASP-1 and MASP-3, which have identical A chains but different B chains (Gaboriaud2021Structures).

## Function
The MASP1 gene encodes for proteins that play a crucial role in the lectin pathway of the complement system, an essential component of the innate immune response. The primary protein product, MASP-1, is a serine protease that is involved in the activation of the lectin pathway by cleaving and activating MASP-2, which is necessary for the cleavage of C4 and the formation of the C3 convertase complex. This process is vital for the complement cascade, leading to pathogen opsonization and clearance (Héja2012Revised; Degn2012MannanBinding).

MASP-1 is the most abundant MBL-associated serine protease in human serum and is essential for the efficient functioning of the lectin pathway. It is responsible for generating a significant portion of the C2a component required for C3 convertase formation, highlighting its critical role in complement activation (Héja2012Revised; Dobó2016The). MASP-1 also interacts with other physiological processes, such as the coagulation cascade and cellular activation through protease-activated receptor cleavage on endothelial cells, indicating its involvement in broader immune and inflammatory responses (Dobó2014Multiple). The protein is primarily active in the bloodstream, associated with mannose-binding lectin complexes (Degn2012MannanBinding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MASP1 gene are associated with 3MC syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, developmental delays, and other congenital anomalies. This syndrome includes Carnevale, Malpuech, Michels, and oculo-skeletal-abdominal (OSA) syndromes, collectively referred to as 3MC syndrome (Sirmaci2010MASP1; Rooryck2011Mutations). Specific mutations in MASP1, such as the missense mutation c.2059G>A (p.G687R) and the nonsense mutation c.870G>A (p.W290X), have been identified in individuals with 3MC syndrome. These mutations affect the MASP-3 isoform, which plays a role in the lectin complement pathway (Sirmaci2010MASP1; Gajek2020Association).

The MASP1 gene encodes three protein isoforms: MASP-1, MASP-3, and MAp44. Mutations in MASP1 can lead to deficiencies in these proteins, impacting the lectin pathway of the complement system, which is crucial for immune response (Atik2015Novel; Durmaz2021MASP1‐related). Despite the absence of MASP-1 and MASP-3, some patients retain partial alternative pathway activity, although at reduced levels (Atik2015Novel). The phenotypic presentation of 3MC syndrome can vary significantly, with some patients exhibiting additional features such as structural brain abnormalities and vascular anomalies (Atik2015Novel).

## Interactions
MASP1 (MBL-associated serine protease 1) is a key component of the lectin pathway of the complement system, engaging in several critical interactions with other proteins. It forms complexes with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins, which are pattern recognition molecules that initiate the lectin pathway upon binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Dobó2016The). MASP1 is essential for the activation of MASP2, another serine protease in the lectin pathway. MASP1 cleaves and activates MASP2, facilitating the formation of the C3 convertase complex (C4b2a), which is crucial for complement activation (Héja2012Revised; Degn2012MannanBinding).

MASP1 also interacts with C1-inhibitor (C1-inh), which can inhibit its activity by forming a covalent complex, highlighting the importance of MASP1's proteolytic activity for its function (Megyeri2014Serum). In addition to its role in the complement system, MASP1 can cleave protease-activated receptors (PARs) on endothelial cells, leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and increased endothelial permeability (Megyeri2009Complement; Debreczeni2019MASP1). These interactions underscore MASP1's multifaceted role in immune response and inflammation.
