# ANKRD34C

## Overview
ANKRD34C is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 34C, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ankyrin repeat domain 34C may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific functions of ANKRD34C and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, the presence of ankyrin repeats indicates potential involvement in signal transduction pathways and cellular structural integrity. Further research is needed to clarify the biological roles and clinical significance of ANKRD34C (Qiu2020aarFDC).
