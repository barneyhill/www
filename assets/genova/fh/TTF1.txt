# TTF1

## Overview
Transcription Termination Factor 1 (TTF1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling. The TTF1 protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a critical role in the termination of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences known as Sal boxes. This binding is essential for the proper recycling of the transcription machinery, a process described by the 'ribomotor' model (Tiwari2022Ab). TTF1 also participates in polar replication fork arrest and acts as a chromatin remodeling factor, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Tiwari2022Ab). Structurally, the protein comprises an N-terminal regulatory domain, a central DNA-binding domain with a myb/SANT-like motif, and a C-terminal domain crucial for transcription activation and termination (Tiwari2022Biophysical; Tiwari2022Ab). Additionally, TTF1 is implicated in DNA damage repair, particularly in transcription-coupled repair pathways (Tiwari2023Novel).

## Structure
The human transcription termination factor 1 (TTF1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. The primary structure of TTF1 includes distinct functional domains: an N-terminal regulatory domain responsible for oligomerization, a central DNA-binding domain with a myb/SANT-like domain, and a C-terminal domain essential for transcription activation and termination (Tiwari2022Biophysical; Tiwari2022Ab). The secondary structure of TTF1 is characterized by a helical configuration, as revealed by biophysical analyses (Tiwari2022Biophysical).

The tertiary structure of TTF1 was modeled using ab initio methods due to the lack of suitable homologues in the Protein Data Bank. This model was validated through molecular dynamics simulations, indicating a reliable structure with potential nucleic acid-binding properties (Tiwari2022Ab). The quaternary structure involves oligomerization, which is crucial for its function in transcription termination and chromatin remodeling (Tiwari2022Ab).

TTF1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its transcriptional activity (Boggaram2008Thyroid). The protein's structural stability and interactions are influenced by specific residues identified through centrality analyses of the residue interaction network (Tiwari2022Ab).

## Function
Transcription Termination Factor 1 (TTF1) is a multifunctional protein essential for several critical cellular processes in mammalian cells. It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription by binding to specific DNA elements known as Sal boxes, which are located upstream and downstream of rDNA gene repeats. This binding is crucial for both the initiation and termination of rDNA transcription, ensuring efficient recycling of the transcription machinery through a mechanism known as the 'ribomotor' model (Tiwari2022Ab).

TTF1 is also involved in polar replication fork arrest and acts as a chromatin remodeling factor, contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular physiology (Tiwari2022Ab). The protein contains distinct functional domains, including an N-terminal regulatory domain for oligomerization, a central DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain essential for transcription activation and termination (Tiwari2022Ab). The central domain features a highly conserved DNA-binding myb/SANT-like domain, homologous to the DNA-binding domain of the Reb1 protein in yeast (Tiwari2022Ab).

In addition to its role in transcription regulation, TTF1 is implicated in DNA damage repair, particularly in transcription-coupled repair (TCR), a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that addresses UV-induced DNA damage in transcriptionally active regions (Tiwari2023Novel).

## Interactions
TTF1, also known as transcription termination factor 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence transcription regulation. TTF1 interacts with Nuclear Factor I (NFI) family members, including NFI-B2, NFI-A1, and NFI-C2, to regulate the transcription of surfactant protein C (SP-C). These interactions enhance SP-C promoter activity, with TTF1 binding to the conserved DNA binding and dimerization domain of NFI family members, forming multiprotein complexes that synergistically regulate SP-C gene expression (Bachurski2003Nuclear).

TTF1 also forms oligomers, which are influenced by its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. These oligomers can bind to DNA, forming multimeric complexes that are essential for transcription termination (Sander1997Oligomerization). TTF1's interaction with Pax8, a paired domain-containing factor, results in a synergistic activation of the thyroglobulin promoter. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal domain of TTF1, which is crucial for binding with Pax8 (Di2003The).

In the context of ribosomal DNA transcription, TTF1 binds to specific DNA elements, such as the Sal box, to mediate transcription termination. This binding induces DNA bending, which is crucial for the termination process (Bartsch1988Purification; Smid1992Limited).
