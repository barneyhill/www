# IFRD2

## Overview
IFRD2, or interferon-related developmental regulator 2, is a gene that encodes a ribosome-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation. The protein encoded by IFRD2 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including adipogenesis and myogenic differentiation, by acting as a translational inhibitor. It is involved in key signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK 1/2 pathways, influencing the differentiation of preadipocytes and skeletal muscle satellite cells, respectively (Vietor2023The; Gong2024IFRD2). Clinically, IFRD2 has been associated with hematopoietic and immune functions, as well as metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions like colitis and obesity (Barton2020Wholeexome; Vietor2023The; Cheluvappa2015Modulation).

## Function
IFRD2, also known as interferon-related developmental regulator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including adipogenesis and myogenic differentiation. In the context of adipogenesis, IFRD2 functions as a translational inhibitor, regulating the protein levels of Delta-like homolog 1 (Dlk1), an inhibitor of adipogenesis. This regulation occurs through translational control, distinct from the transcriptional regulation by its orthologue IFRD1. IFRD2 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which maintains preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state by inhibiting key adipogenic transcription factors such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (Cebpa) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparg) (Vietor2023The).

In myogenic differentiation, IFRD2 is expressed during the differentiation of bovine skeletal muscle satellite cells, where it inhibits cell proliferation and promotes differentiation. This process involves the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway, with IFRD2 overexpression suppressing ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, thereby promoting differentiation (Gong2024IFRD2). IFRD2's role as a ribosome-binding protein capable of inhibiting translation highlights its importance in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation (Gong2024IFRD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IFRD2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of hematopoiesis, rare coding variants in IFRD2 are associated with significant changes in reticulocyte indices, specifically high light scatter reticulocyte count, without affecting the overall red blood cell count. These mutations can lead to extreme phenotypes, with homozygotes and compound heterozygotes showing a mean increase of +2.52 standard deviations in reticulocyte count, potentially impacting clinical outcomes related to red blood cell development (Barton2020Wholeexome).

IFRD2 is also involved in immune regulation, as evidenced by its downregulation following appendectomy, which may contribute to protection against colitis. This suggests that IFRD2 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases like colitis (Cheluvappa2015Modulation).

In metabolic disorders, IFRD2 plays a role in adipogenesis and fat metabolism. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of IFRD2 leads to resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity, indicating its potential involvement in obesity and related metabolic conditions. This resistance is linked to impaired adipocyte differentiation and altered expression of key adipogenic factors (Vietor2023The).
