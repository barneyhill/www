# SULF1

## Overview
SULF1 is a gene that encodes the extracellular enzyme sulfatase 1, which is involved in the modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. This enzyme is classified as a sulfatase and plays a crucial role in regulating various cell signaling pathways by removing 6-O sulfate groups from HSPG chains. The activity of sulfatase 1 influences the binding affinity of growth factors, such as Wnts and FGFs, to HSPGs, thereby modulating pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and FGF signaling (Buono2009Sulfatase). SULF1 is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the testes, stomach, and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to normal cellular functions and processes such as angiogenesis and tissue repair (Bret2011SULFs). Alterations in SULF1 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation (Bret2011SULFs). Additionally, SULF1 is implicated in Mesomelia-Synostoses Syndrome, a disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities (Bendas2024Mesomeliasynostoses).

## Structure
The SULF1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of SULF1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The protein features a hydrophilic domain (HD) that is crucial for its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS) and is responsible for localizing the enzyme to the cell surface (Milz2013Cooperation). This domain contains at least two independent HS interaction sites, which contribute to the multivalent interaction necessary for the enzyme's function (Milz2013Cooperation).

The tertiary structure of SULF1 includes a catalytic domain that shows high homology to glucosamine-6-sulfatase, suggesting a role in substrate specificity and proofreading near the active site (Milz2013Cooperation). The HD functions as an exosite, presenting substrate groups to the active site, and is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Milz2013Cooperation).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. SULF1 may also have splice variant isoforms, which could result in different protein forms with distinct functions, but specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure is still under investigation, with ongoing studies to better understand its molecular configuration (Walhorn2018Exploring).

## Function
SULF1 encodes an extracellular sulfatase enzyme that plays a critical role in modifying heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface, influencing various cell signaling pathways. This enzyme specifically removes 6-O sulfate groups from HSPG chains, which affects the binding affinity of growth factors such as Wnts, FGFs, BMPs, and Noggin to HSPGs, thereby modulating signaling pathways like the Wnt/β-catenin and FGF signaling pathways (Buono2009Sulfatase). 

In healthy human cells, SULF1 is expressed in several tissues, including the testes, stomach, skeletal muscle, lung, and kidney, where it regulates the sulfation patterns of HSPGs. This regulation is crucial for normal cellular functions, as it influences the binding and signaling of growth factors such as heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and amphiregulin (Bret2011SULFs). 

SULF1 activity is essential for maintaining normal cellular proliferation and communication, impacting processes like angiogenesis and tissue repair. By modulating growth factor signaling, SULF1 contributes to cellular communication and organismal development, playing a role in processes such as neuroanatomical development, synaptic plasticity, and muscle regeneration (Buono2009Sulfatase).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SULF1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. SULF1 is generally considered a tumor suppressor, with its expression downregulated in several cancers, including breast, ovarian, hepatocellular, gastric, kidney, and head and neck cancers. This downregulation is often due to epigenetic silencing through promoter hypermethylation, which can lead to increased growth factor signaling and cancer cell proliferation (Bret2011SULFs). In breast cancer, the AA genotype of the SNP rs3802278 in the 3′-UTR of SULF1 is associated with a reduced risk, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive subtypes, suggesting a protective effect against breast cancer susceptibility (Lu2016Singlenucleotide).

In mammary tumors, short splice variants of SULF1 are predominant and may facilitate receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. These variants lack catalytic activity, which alters their signaling functions compared to full-length isoforms (Gill2016Short). Full-length SULF1, in contrast, inhibits growth in certain breast cancer cell lines, highlighting its potential role in suppressing tumor progression (Gill2016Short).

SULF1 is also associated with Mesomelia-Synostoses Syndrome (MSS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Deletions in the 8q13 region, involving SULF1, are linked to this syndrome, although SULF1 haploinsufficiency alone may not fully explain the condition's spectrum (Bendas2024Mesomeliasynostoses).

## Interactions
SULF1 interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface, modulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. It specifically affects the cMET receptor by dissociating it from its co-receptor, HSPGs, through the removal of 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate chains. This enzymatic activity of SULF1 leads to reduced phosphorylation of cMET and downstream signaling pathways, such as AKT, ERK1/2, and p38, which results in decreased proliferation and colony-forming ability of chondrosarcoma cells (Lin2022EZH2).

The hydrophilic domain (HD) of SULF1 plays a crucial role in its interaction with heparan sulfate, exhibiting high specificity for 6-O-sulfated heparan sulfate and heparin. This domain facilitates the enzyme's localization to the cell surface and contributes to the dynamic interaction with its substrate, allowing for processive desulfation along heparan sulfate chains (Milz2013Cooperation). The HD's interaction with heparan sulfate is characterized by a two-state binding model, involving a transition from a low force state to a high force state, which is facilitated by external forces (Walhorn2018Exploring). These interactions are essential for SULF1's role in modulating cell signaling and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor.
