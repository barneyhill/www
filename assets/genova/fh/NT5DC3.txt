# NT5DC3

## Overview
NT5DC3 is a gene that encodes the protein 5'-nucleotidase domain containing 3, which is a member of the 5'-nucleotidase domain-containing family. This protein is primarily involved in nucleotide metabolism, where it catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleotides, a critical process for nucleotide recycling and maintaining cellular nucleotide balance (Li2023Lactoferrin). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, suggesting its role in cellular energy dynamics and signaling. NT5DC3 is also implicated in epigenetic regulation, influencing DNA and RNA methylation processes, particularly under hyperglycemic conditions (Li2023Lactoferrin). Furthermore, NT5DC3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer, with its expression modulated by lactoferrin, highlighting its potential significance in disease states related to metabolic and epigenetic dysregulation (Li2023Lactoferrin).

## Structure


## Function
NT5DC3, a member of the 5'-nucleotidase domain-containing family, plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of nucleotides. This enzymatic activity is essential for nucleotide recycling and maintaining cellular nucleotide balance, which is vital for various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and cellular signaling pathways (Li2023Lactoferrin). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in cellular energy dynamics and signaling (Li2023Lactoferrin).

In healthy human cells, NT5DC3 is implicated in the regulation of methylation processes. It is involved in both DNA and RNA methylation, specifically affecting the methylation status of the NT5DC3 gene itself. This regulation is significant under hyperglycemic conditions, where NT5DC3 expression is modulated through DNA 5mC and RNA m6A modifications (Li2023Lactoferrin). The protein's activity in these methylation processes suggests a role in epigenetic regulation, which can influence gene expression and cellular function.

NT5DC3's function as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer has been highlighted, particularly under hyperglycemic conditions, where its expression is influenced by lactoferrin, a protein that modulates its methylation status (Li2023Lactoferrin). This suggests that NT5DC3 may have broader implications in disease states, particularly those related to metabolic and epigenetic dysregulation.

## Clinical Significance
The NT5DC3 gene has been implicated in the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D) to colon cancer. Research suggests that NT5DC3 is involved in the NT5DC3/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in tumor development under diabetic conditions. Alterations in NT5DC3 expression, particularly its phosphorylation at specific sites, are associated with the development of colon tumors in T2D patients. Lactoferrin (LF) has been shown to interact with NT5DC3, potentially inhibiting the progression of T2D to colon cancer by modulating this pathway and affecting NT5DC3 phosphorylation (Li2022Lactoferrin).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, NT5DC3, as part of the cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II family, has been studied for its role in cognitive performance and neuronal function. In Drosophila models, the orthologue of NT5DC3, dNT5C, is highly expressed in the brain and its knockdown leads to deficits in habituation learning and altered activity and sleep patterns. These findings suggest a potential link between NT5DC3 expression and neuropsychiatric conditions, although specific diseases directly associated with NT5DC3 mutations in humans have not been detailed (Singgih2021Investigating).
