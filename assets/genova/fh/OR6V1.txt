# OR6V1

## Overview
The OR6V1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily V member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR6V1, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of odors. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
