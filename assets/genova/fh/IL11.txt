# IL11

## Overview
Interleukin 11 (IL11) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 11 (IL-11), which is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines. IL-11 is characterized by its four-helix bundle structure and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis, immune modulation, and inflammation. It is primarily known for its function in stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly influencing megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production. Beyond its hematopoietic functions, IL-11 is involved in modulating immune responses and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer and fibrotic disorders. The protein interacts with its receptor components, IL-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Rα) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130), to form a signaling complex that activates intracellular pathways, notably the GP130-JAK-STAT3 pathway, which is significant in cancer progression and fibrotic diseases (Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic; Cook2020Hiding; Metcalfe2023Structures).

## Structure
Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a cytokine characterized by a four-helix bundle motif, typical of long helical cytokines, with an up-up-down-down configuration. This structure includes two pairs of antiparallel α-helices (Negahdaripour2016A; Putoczki2014The). The primary structure of IL-11 consists of 199 amino acids, including a 21 amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved off, resulting in a mature protein of 178 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 19 kDa (Negahdaripour2016A). 

The tertiary structure of IL-11 is compact and stable, attributed to hydrophobic interactions at the interface of the α-helices (Negahdaripour2016A). IL-11 lacks cysteine residues, which differentiates it from other IL-6 family members (Negahdaripour2016A). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a hexameric signaling complex with two molecules each of IL-11, IL-11Rα, and gp130 (Putoczki2014The; Metcalfe2023Structures).

IL-11 interacts with its receptor through three sites: Site I involves the AB-loop and C-terminal part of the D-helix, Site II includes the A and C helices, and Site III contains the N-terminal part of the D-helix and AB-loop (Negahdaripour2016A). The AB loop undergoes significant conformational changes upon receptor binding, which is crucial for the formation of the signaling complex (Metcalfe2023Structures).

## Function
Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a cytokine with diverse biological functions, primarily known for its role in hematopoiesis. It stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly influencing megakaryocyte maturation and increasing peripheral platelet counts (Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic; Yang1993Interleukin). IL-11 acts synergistically with other cytokines, such as IL-3 and Steel factor, to enhance colony formation of hematopoietic progenitors (Neben1996The).

IL-11 also plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. It influences T cell cytokine production by reducing Th1 cytokines like IFN-gamma and enhancing Th2 cytokines, thereby exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects (Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic). In macrophages, IL-11 inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and affects the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, contributing to its anti-inflammatory properties (Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic).

In addition to its hematopoietic and immunomodulatory roles, IL-11 is involved in the induction of acute phase proteins in the liver and has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis by affecting lipoprotein lipase activity (Yang1993Interleukin). These functions highlight IL-11's involvement in various cellular processes and its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 11 (IL11) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in the GP130-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial in cancer progression. Elevated IL11 expression is associated with tumorigenesis in epithelial cancers, including gastric and colorectal cancers, where it promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell colonization (Ernst2014Molecular; Nishina2021Interleukin11expressing). In gastric cancer, IL11 expression correlates with disease progression and is linked to the development of gastric tumors in mouse models (Buzzelli2019Overexpression). IL11 is also a significant factor in colorectal cancer, where its signaling enhances tumor growth and metastasis through STAT3 activation (Putoczki2013Interleukin11).

IL11 is involved in fibrotic diseases, such as systemic sclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis, where it is upregulated and contributes to fibroblast activation and tissue fibrosis (Cook2020Hiding). In cardiovascular diseases, IL11 is associated with cardiac fibrosis and chronic heart failure, where its elevated levels correlate with adverse cardiac events (Cook2020Hiding). IL11's role in inflammation is complex, as it is implicated in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, where it may contribute to resistance against certain therapies (Cook2020Hiding). These findings suggest that IL11 is a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a cytokine that interacts with its receptor components, IL-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Rα) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130), to form a hexameric signaling complex. This complex is essential for initiating intracellular signal transduction pathways. IL-11 binds to IL-11Rα with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and this interaction is crucial for the subsequent binding and dimerization of gp130, which is necessary for signal transduction (Metcalfe2023Structures; Barton2000Interleukin11).

The interaction between IL-11 and gp130 involves two main sites: site-II and site-III. Site-II interactions are primarily hydrophobic, involving helices A and C of IL-11, while site-III involves specific contacts such as the side chain of W147 of IL-11 binding against a β-strand of gp130 (Metcalfe2023Structures). The formation of the IL-11 receptor complex is driven by the avidity of these interactions, despite the low affinity of individual gp130 molecules at site-III (Metcalfe2023Structures).

Mutant forms of IL-11 that alter these binding sites demonstrate the necessity of these interactions for stable complex formation. These mutants can bind a single molecule of gp130 in the presence of IL-11Rα, forming trimeric complexes but are unable to dimerize gp130, indicating the importance of both binding sites for gp130 dimerization (Barton2000Interleukin11).
