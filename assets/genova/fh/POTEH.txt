# POTEH

## Overview
POTEH is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member H, which is part of the POTE ankyrin domain family. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including ankyrin repeats and spectrin-like α-helices, which suggest its involvement in protein-protein interactions and potential association with cell membranes (Barger2018Expression). The gene is composed of 12 exons and features a long inverted repeat sequence, which may influence its expression and splicing (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). POTEH is predominantly expressed in the testis and prostate, and its expression is altered in various cancers, such as cardiac angiosarcomas and prostate cancer, where it may play a role in tumorigenesis and serve as a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2014Network; Gozzellino2023Genomic). Additionally, POTEH has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, through genetic variations that may contribute to clinical symptoms (Alhazmi2024Copy).

## Structure
The POTEH gene encodes a protein that is part of the POTE ankyrin domain family, characterized by specific structural features. The POTEH protein includes a N-terminal cysteine-rich region, central ankyrin repeats, and C-terminal spectrin-like α-helices, which suggest roles in protein-protein interactions and association with cell membranes (Barger2018Expression). The POTEH gene contains 12 exons and a full-sized long inverted repeat (LIR) sequence, with the β-actin retrogene insertion located outside the coding sequence (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). 

The presence of ankyrin repeats is a common motif in proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions, indicating that POTEH may be involved in such interactions. The spectrin-like α-helices contribute to the structural stability and potential membrane association of the protein. The LIRs within the POTEH gene may influence gene expression and alternative splicing, potentially leading to different isoforms (Wang2009Discovery). 

POTEH is expressed significantly in the testis and prostate, but not as a cancer-testis antigen, indicating its expression in several normal tissues (Barger2018Expression). The specific post-translational modifications and detailed tertiary or quaternary structures of POTEH are not described in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
POTEH, a member of the POTE gene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In cardiac angiosarcomas, POTEH is notably overexpressed, contributing to increased cell viability and potentially enhancing the aggressive nature of these tumors. This overexpression is associated with poor survival rates, suggesting that POTEH could be a therapeutic target in these cancers (Gozzellino2023Genomic). In prostate cancer, POTEH shows differential binding regions, indicating its involvement in tumorigenesis and potential as a candidate for immunotherapy (Zhang2014Network).

POTEH is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Alterations in its expression, particularly copy number variations, are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related conditions. These genetic changes can lead to clinical manifestations such as seizures, motor and cognitive delays, and speech impairments (Alhazmi2024Copy). Variants of uncertain significance in POTEH have been identified in individuals with ASD and intellectual disabilities, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of these disorders, although further research is needed to clarify its involvement (Bruno2021New).
