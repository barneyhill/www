# MTFR1L

## Overview
MTFR1L (mitochondrial fission regulator 1 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically promoting mitochondrial fission. The protein encoded by MTFR1L functions as a mitochondrial fission regulator, acting as an anti-fusion factor by inhibiting the pro-fusion protein Opa1, thereby facilitating mitochondrial fission and maintaining the compartmentalized morphology of mitochondria in neurons (Virga2023Activitydependent; Virga2024Activitydependent). It is active in the mitochondria and plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, impacting overall cellular health and function. MTFR1L is phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology within dendrites, particularly in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Virga2023Activitydependent; Virga2024Activitydependent). The protein's interaction with Armadillo repeat-containing protein 1 (ArmC1) and its role as a substrate for AMPK highlight its involvement in complex regulatory networks that influence mitochondrial morphology and function (Chen2019Global; Wagner2019Armadillo).

## Structure


## Function
MTFR1L (mitochondrial fission regulator 1 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically promoting mitochondrial fission. This protein functions as an anti-fusion factor by inhibiting the pro-fusion protein Opa1, thereby facilitating mitochondrial fission and maintaining the compartmentalized morphology of mitochondria in neurons (Virga2023Activitydependent; Virga2024Activitydependent). MTFR1L is active in the mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, impacting overall cellular health and function.

In CA1 pyramidal neurons, MTFR1L is phosphorylated by AMPK, a process dependent on the kinase Camkk2. This phosphorylation is essential for maintaining the compartmentalized morphology of mitochondria within dendrites, which is important for neuronal function (Virga2023Activitydependent; Virga2024Activitydependent). The phosphorylation of MTFR1L at specific serine residues (S103 and S238) is necessary for its role in mitochondrial dynamics, and a phosphomimetic form of MTFR1L can rescue mitochondrial morphology defects in Camkk2-null neurons (Virga2023Activitydependent; Virga2024Activitydependent). This indicates that MTFR1L is integral to the structural organization of mitochondria in neurons, particularly in response to neuronal activity.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MTFR1L (mitochondrial fission regulator 1 like) is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the regulation of mitochondrial fission. It is predicted to play a role in mitochondrial fission and interacts with Armadillo repeat-containing protein 1 (ArmC1), which is associated with the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MICOS/MIB) (Wagner2019Armadillo). This interaction suggests that MTFR1L may be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fission processes through its association with ArmC1. 

The protein is also identified as a likely direct substrate of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), with phosphorylation occurring at the S238 site, indicating a regulatory role in mitochondrial dynamics (Chen2019Global). This phosphorylation event was identified in two different AMPK substrate screening studies, highlighting MTFR1L's potential involvement in AMPK-dependent pathways (Chen2019Global). 

While specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, the association with ArmC1 and phosphorylation by AMPK suggest that MTFR1L participates in complex regulatory networks that influence mitochondrial morphology and function.
