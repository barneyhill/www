# RAD21L1

## Overview
The RAD21L1 gene encodes a protein known as RAD21 cohesin complex component like 1, which is a meiosis-specific subunit of the cohesin complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the process of chromosome segregation during meiosis, a type of cell division that results in the formation of gametes. Unlike other cohesin proteins, RAD21L1 is specifically expressed during meiosis, highlighting its specialized function in reproductive biology. The cohesin complex, to which RAD21L1 contributes, is essential for the proper alignment and separation of homologous chromosomes, thereby ensuring genomic stability. Disruptions in the function of RAD21L1 can lead to reproductive disorders, including infertility and primary ovarian insufficiency, due to its critical role in meiosis (Schierding2020Lowa; Schierding2020Low). Additionally, RAD21L1 is involved in regulatory pathways that intersect with cancer-related processes, underscoring its broader significance in cellular homeostasis and disease prevention (Schierding2020Low).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RAD21L1 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders. RAD21L1 is a meiosis-specific subunit of the cohesin complex, and its dysfunction can lead to infertility in men and chromosome segregation errors in women, contributing to primary ovarian insufficiency (Schierding2020Lowa; Schierding2020Low). The gene is not intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, which suggests that its role in meiosis is critical but not essential for survival, unlike other cohesin genes (Schierding2020Lowa).

The RAD21L1 gene is also implicated in broader disease pathways through its regulatory interactions. It is involved in pathways related to the extracellular matrix and proteasome, which are linked to cancer development (Schierding2020Low). Although specific diseases directly caused by RAD21L1 mutations are not detailed, the gene's regulatory potential and its involvement in cohesin-related DNA interactions suggest a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing disease (Schierding2020Lowa). The gene's interactions with other cohesin components and its regulatory network highlight its importance in cellular processes that, when disrupted, can lead to pathological conditions.
