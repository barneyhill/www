# APOB

## Overview
The APOB gene encodes apolipoprotein B, a fundamental protein in lipid metabolism, primarily involved in the formation and function of lipoproteins. Apolipoprotein B exists in two main isoforms: APOB-100 and APOB-48. APOB-100, a large glycoprotein, is synthesized in the liver and plays a crucial role in the assembly and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are precursors to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (Knott1985Human; Young1990Recent). It serves as a ligand for the LDL receptor, facilitating the clearance of LDL from the bloodstream, thus maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Young1990Recent). APOB-48, produced in the intestine, is essential for the formation of chylomicrons, which transport dietary lipids (Powell1987A). The gene's mutations are linked to various lipid disorders, including familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100, impacting cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health (Hooper2005Monogenic; Benn2009Apolipoprotein).

## Structure
Apolipoprotein B (APOB) is a major component of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and exists primarily in two isoforms: APOB-100 and APOB-48. The APOB-100 isoform is a large protein with a complex structure that includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Its primary structure is a long polypeptide chain, and its secondary structure features amphipathic alpha-helices and beta-strands, which contribute to its lipid-associating properties (Segrest2001Structure).

The tertiary structure of APOB-100 is crucial for lipid binding, with amphipathic beta-sheets interacting with the lipid core of lipoproteins, influencing core lipid organization and LDL particle diameter (Segrest2001Structure). The protein is organized into a pentapartite domain structure: NH2-βα1-β1-α2-β2-α3-COOH, with the βα1 domain being globular and similar to lamprey lipovitellin (Segrest2001Structure).

APOB-100 is a glycoprotein with multiple N-glycosylation sites, predominantly located in Domain 4, which may be positioned at the lipid-water interface (Yang1989Structure; Knott1985Human). The protein also contains disulfide bridges, particularly in Domain 1 and Domain 4, contributing to its structural stability (Yang1989Structure). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other lipoproteins, stabilizing the size and structure of lipoprotein particles (Segrest2001Structure).

## Function
Apolipoprotein B (APOB) is a critical component of lipoproteins involved in lipid metabolism. It exists in two main isoforms: APOB-100 and APOB-48. APOB-100 is synthesized in the liver and plays a vital role in the assembly and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are precursors to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (Knott1985Human; Young1990Recent). APOB-100 serves as a ligand for the LDL receptor, facilitating the uptake and clearance of LDL from the bloodstream, which is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Knott1985Human; Young1990Recent). 

APOB-48, on the other hand, is produced in the intestine and is essential for the formation of chylomicrons, which are responsible for the absorption and transport of dietary lipids (Young1990Recent; Powell1987A). The production of APOB-48 involves a tissue-specific RNA editing process that results in a truncated form of the protein (Powell1987A). Both isoforms of APOB are integral to lipid transport and metabolism, influencing plasma cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health (Young1990Recent; Blackhart1986Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the APOB gene are associated with several lipid disorders, including familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB). FHBL is characterized by low plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, often due to nonsense, frameshift, or splicing mutations that result in truncated apoB proteins. This condition can lead to symptoms such as acanthocytosis, vitamin deficiencies, and neuromuscular abnormalities (Hooper2005Monogenic; Cefalù2015Homozygous). FDB is caused by mutations in the LDLR-binding domain of apoB, leading to hypercholesterolemia due to impaired LDL receptor binding and clearance (TYBJARGHANSEN1992Familial; Benn2009Apolipoprotein).

Rare missense mutations in APOB, such as R3500Q and R3500W, are linked to familial defective apolipoprotein B-100, resulting in severe hypercholesterolemia and increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease (Benn2009Apolipoprotein). Conversely, mutations like R3480P are associated with hypobetalipoproteinemia, characterized by significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels (Benn2009Apolipoprotein). The APOB gene's extensive polymorphism, with over 80 SNPs identified, contributes to the variability in lipid levels and associated disease risk (Hooper2005Monogenic).

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein B (APOB) is involved in several critical interactions during lipoprotein assembly and function. It physically interacts with microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which is essential for the assembly of APOB-containing lipoproteins. This interaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is enhanced by the presence of newly synthesized triglycerides, indicating its role in the early stages of lipoprotein assembly (Wu1996Demonstration).

APOB also interacts with Cideb, a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Cideb facilitates the lipidation and maturation of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) by interacting with APOB, particularly through its C-terminal region (Ye2009Cideb).

In the context of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding, APOB interacts with LPS-binding protein (LBP) on low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and VLDL. This interaction enhances the capacity of these lipoproteins to bind LPS, which is significant during infections (Vreugdenhil2001LPSbinding).

APOB's interactions are crucial for its role in lipid transport and metabolism, influencing both the assembly of lipoproteins and their function in the circulatory system.
