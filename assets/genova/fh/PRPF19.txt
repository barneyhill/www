# PRPF19

## Overview
PRPF19 is a gene that encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 19, a multifunctional protein integral to several cellular processes, including mRNA splicing and DNA repair. The protein is a core component of the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which is essential for the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA (Idrissou2022The; Chanarat2013Splicing). PRPF19 is characterized by its U-box domain, which confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating protein ubiquitination, a critical post-translational modification (Chen2021A). This activity is crucial for the DNA damage response, where PRPF19 mediates the ubiquitylation of replication protein A (RPA), thereby activating the ATR kinase and maintaining genome stability (Maréchal2014PRP19). Additionally, PRPF19 is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular senescence, linking it to pathways such as p53-p21 (Kleissl2023PRPF19). The protein's interactions with other spliceosome components and its role in genome maintenance underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer (de2018Prp19Pso4; Zhou2023PRPF19).

## Structure
The PRPF19 protein is a crucial component of the spliceosome complex, involved in pre-mRNA splicing and other cellular processes. Structurally, PRPF19 contains several important domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes a U-box domain, which exhibits E3 ligase activity essential for protein ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that regulates protein stability and function (Chen2021A; van2015CTNNBL1). This domain's activity is dependent on specific conserved residues, and mutations can abolish its function (Chen2021A).

PRPF19 also features a coiled-coil region that facilitates its tetramerization, allowing it to interact with other proteins such as CDC5L and SPF27 (van2015CTNNBL1). The protein's quaternary structure, forming a homo-tetramer, is crucial for its role in ubiquitination, as it brings substrate proteins in close proximity to the U-box domain (Chen2021A). Additionally, PRPF19 contains seven WD40 interaction domains, which mediate protein-protein interactions and link it to other spliceosome components (van2015CTNNBL1). The WD40 domain is essential for interactions with specific proteins, such as ATXN3-Q84, influencing protein aggregation and degradation (Chen2021A).

## Function
The PRPF19 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which plays a significant role in mRNA processing and DNA repair in healthy human cells. PRPF19 is involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA, a critical step in gene expression where introns are removed to produce mature mRNA. It stabilizes the spliceosome, particularly influencing the binding and base pairing of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) during the splicing cycle (Idrissou2022The; Chanarat2013Splicing).

PRPF19 also plays a vital role in the DNA damage response (DDR). It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitylation of replication protein A (RPA) on single-stranded DNA, which is essential for the activation of the ATR kinase. This activation is crucial for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and the maintenance of genome stability (Idrissou2022The; Maréchal2014PRP19).

In addition to its roles in splicing and DNA repair, PRPF19 is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular senescence. Its activity is linked to the p53-p21 pathway, influencing cell viability and potentially extending cellular lifespan (Idrissou2022The; Kleissl2023PRPF19).

## Clinical Significance
PRPF19 has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of PRPF19 is associated with advanced clinical features, poor prognosis, and a negative response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. It is linked to increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment, which suppress antitumor immunity (Yang2022An). In bladder cancer, PRPF19 is overexpressed, particularly in higher-grade tumors, and correlates with poor prognosis. It is involved in regulating immune responses and cellular senescence, influencing cancer progression and resistance to treatment (Wang2023Comprehensive). 

In colorectal cancer, PRPF19 enhances metastasis by stabilizing the MYL9 protein through K63-linked ubiquitination, activating the Src-YAP1 pathway, which is crucial for tumor metastasis (Zhou2023PRPF19). PRPF19's role in DNA repair and mRNA splicing also links it to cellular senescence and stress responses, impacting cancer progression and potentially contributing to conditions like retinitis pigmentosa when disrupted (Kleissl2023PRPF19). These findings suggest PRPF19 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.

## Interactions
PRPF19, also known as Prp19, is a core component of the NineTeen Complex (NTC), which is essential for spliceosome assembly and function. It interacts with several proteins, including CDC5L, PLRG1, and SPF27, forming the active NTC core. These interactions are crucial for the ubiquitin ligase activity of PRPF19, which is initially autoinhibited and requires assembly with these components to become active (de2018Prp19Pso4).

PRPF19 also interacts with the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) protein Prp3, leading to its ubiquitination. This modification facilitates the association of Prp3 with U5 snRNP, forming the U4/U6.U5 snRNP, a critical component of the spliceosome (de2018Prp19Pso4). In the context of DNA damage response, PRPF19 binds to replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and promotes ubiquitin chain formation on RPA, which is essential for the recruitment of ATR and ATRIP to damaged sites (de2018Prp19Pso4; Maréchal2014PRP19).

PRPF19 also interacts with the THO complex, which is involved in genome maintenance and antibody diversification. This interaction stabilizes the recruitment of the THO/TREX complex to transcribed genes, highlighting PRPF19's role in genome maintenance (Chanarat2013Splicing).
